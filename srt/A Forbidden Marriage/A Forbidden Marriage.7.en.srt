[A Forbidden Marriage]

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,990
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,680
Miss Lu,

4
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,479
could you please
take Miss Yang and Uncle Zhang

5
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,410
somewhere safe?

6
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,560
I owe you one.

7
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,900
Yang Qing, I...

8
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:49,759
Go!

9
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,680
Come with me!

10
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:51,920
Yang Qing!

11
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:24,870
Did Tong...

12
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,670
get killed by that lunatic just now?

13
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,130
No, he wouldn't.

14
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,470
The one who tried to kill me just now

15
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,450
was the Fire Hall Master
from Shengyue Sect.

16
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,130
He was...

17
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,120
He was after me.

18
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,680
Besides, the Shengyue Sect forbids
its disciples

19
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,520
from harming women, children,
the elderly, or the weak.

20
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,400
Tong's disappearance

21
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,510
shouldn't have anything to do with him.

22
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,280
Then where is Tong?

23
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,970
No, I must go find her.

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,130
Uncle Zhang.

25
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,300
We've searched everywhere we could.

26
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,510
Searching aimlessly now
would be pointless.

27
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,510
Please stay home.

28
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,000
I've already sent other disciples
of our sect

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,329
to gather information.

30
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,260
If Tong's really gone,

31
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,120
what's the point of me, an old man,

32
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,650
living alone?

33
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,080
No, I have to find her.

34
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,360
Uncle Zhang!

35
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,700
Miss Lu, put down your sword.

36
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,630
Yunmen will see

37
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,920
the disappearance case through to the end.

38
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,590
Uncle Zhang, I'll go with you.

39
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,870
But Mr. Yang,

40
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,840
your injuries...

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,520
I'm fine.

42
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,070
It's getting late.

43
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,310
Let's split up and search.

44
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:29,910
All right.

45
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,430
You two stay here

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,470
and wait for us.

47
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,600
I want to go with you.

48
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
You don't know martial arts or the way.

49
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,280
What if you run into the Fire Hall Master?

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,590
He can't hurt me.

51
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,420
Mr. Yang is right.

52
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,480
You'd only be a burden if you went.

53
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,800
You should stay here
and wait for us to come back.

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,450
I'm skilled in martial arts
and lightness techniques.

55
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,180
I'll go help.

56
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,040
You? Come on.

57
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,230
Grandpa, I'm back!

58
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,230
Grandpa!

59
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,310
Grandpa!

60
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,880
I'm back!

61
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,560
Tong!

62
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,090
Grandpa!

63
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,850
Are you okay?

64
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,540
Are you alright?

65
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,470
I'm fine.

66
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,750
That's good.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,400
Qing, Wangyue, you're here to see me?

68
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,370
Alright, let's go inside.

69
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,840
Tong, you're finally back.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,269
Come, I'll make you something delicious.

71
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,870
Thank goodness Tong is safe.

72
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,680
Otherwise I...

73
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,459
You can't run around like that anymore.

74
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,190
Or else what?

75
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,120
You're just a village girl
who knows nothing,

76
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,450
yet you dare to talk big.

77
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,250
What's wrong with being a village girl?

78
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,040
Yang Qing likes having me,
a village girl, by his side.

79
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,510
Enough.

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,740
It's getting late.

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,880
The Fire Hall Master
probably hasn't gone far.

82
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,159
I also need time to recover
from my internal injury.

83
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,680
We'll stay here tonight.

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,000
Miss Lu, thank you for your help today.

85
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,150
If there's nothing else,

86
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,610
please head back early tomorrow morning,

87
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,470
so Chief Lu won't worry about you.

88
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,600
I promised Mr. Jiang

89
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,110
I'd take good care of you.

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,870
If I go back alone,

91
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,909
it might not be appropriate.

92
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,670
Don't worry and go ahead.

93
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,200
Jiang Yan certainly won't do anything
to you.

94
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,130
I won't leave

95
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,390
unless I personally

96
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,460
escort Mr. Yang back to the inn.

97
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,890
You? Escort Yang Qing?

98
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,950
With your martial skills,

99
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,750
he'll be the one protecting you.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's still better than a village girl
who knows nothing.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,400
You...

102
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,280
Alright.

103
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,520
This place is a bit rough.

104
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,460
Sorry for the inconvenience.

105
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,180
Mr. Yang,

106
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,400
you're severely weakened
and need nourishment.

107
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,310
I made some pork rib soup for you.

108
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,100
Thank you, Miss Lu.

109
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,580
It's too salty. Take it away.

110
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,120
Yang Qing can only eat
light food right now.

111
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,000
Miss Yang, why are you here

112
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,760
to see Mr. Yang so late at night?

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,160
If I hadn't come,

114
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,530
how would I have known

115
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,530
just how shameless some people are?

116
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,270
Yang Qing is injured
and needs to rest early.

117
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,330
You should head back.

118
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:16,920
Go.

119
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,560
Mr. Yang,

120
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,340
-I'll bring you some soup another day!
-Just go!

121
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,400
Yang Qing,

122
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,570
I have a question for you.

123
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,770
In Yunmen Sect, is it forbidden

124
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,630
for people of different generations
to be together?

125
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,840
I suppose so.

126
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,740
You suppose so?

127
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,060
Give me a clear answer.

128
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,360
In our sect,
we value ethics and strict seniority.

129
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,390
Any two people

130
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,830
of different seniority levels

131
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,560
are not allowed to be together.

132
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,620
But it's not absolute.

133
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,080
Some people just enjoy pushing boundaries

134
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,690
and testing how much others can tolerate.

135
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,950
I think

136
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,280
that's quite interesting.

137
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,490
How can you find that interesting?

138
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,430
You mustn't think it's interesting!

139
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,950
You're the pillar of Yunmen,

140
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,220
a model of righteousness—

141
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,620
how could you have such terrible thoughts?

142
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,770
Even though Lu Xuanxuan
isn't from your sect,

143
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,610
in terms of seniority,
she's still your junior.

144
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,130
You absolutely must not fall for her.

145
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,820
If you do,

146
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,480
you would bring shame to Yunmen.

147
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,630
So you think that

148
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,920
she and I...

149
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,510
Why are you laughing?

150
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,540
I'm being completely serious here!

151
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,680
Don't worry.

152
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,580
I just find it interesting.

153
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,080
I never said I wanted to break the rules

154
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,310
and just let loose.

155
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:39,990
That's right.

156
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,640
If you want to like a girl,

157
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,720
there are plenty of options—

158
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,630
like...

159
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,310
Like me.

160
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,430
Don't worry.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,600
I've never had these

162
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,080
unrealistic thoughts.

163
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,070
No need to use yourself as an example.

164
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,560
Just pretend you didn't hear
the first part.

165
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,820
But you can think about

166
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,560
the second part—me.

167
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Miss Yang,

168
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,050
could you consider letting me off?

169
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,800
You think about it,
and I'll think about it.

170
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,530
Let's think about it together,

171
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,190
okay?

172
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,770
Not okay.

173
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,430
Last time you said

174
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,770
I stirred up your feelings.

175
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,820
Of course, I can't give up.

176
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,650
Really?

177
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,070
Did I say that?

178
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,240
You must have dreamed it.

179
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,240
No.

180
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,140
Last time when you were drunk,
you said that deep down, you already…

181
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,340
Words said drunk

182
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,159
can't be taken seriously.

183
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,270
When I was drunk,

184
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,630
I even told our sect leader I liked him.

185
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,080
What?

186
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,970
You actually like that old man Feng?

187
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,390
That's disgusting!

188
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,620
Miss Yang,

189
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,240
what's wrong?

190
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,390
Why the long face?

191
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,550
The disappearance case
hasn't been solved yet.

192
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,950
Yang Qing can't eat or sleep well
every day,

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,640
so of course I'm upset too.

194
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,750
It was my fault.

195
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,800
I insisted Mr. Yang go find Tong.

196
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,910
It wasn't.

197
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,910
It was our bad luck.

198
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,480
Yang Qing is injured right now.

199
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,480
I originally wanted
to lure the Fire Hall Master away

200
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,380
and let Yang Qing leave first,

201
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,960
but he refused to let me go.

202
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,570
Exactly.

203
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,150
You don't know martial arts.

204
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,600
What if you had fallen into the hands
of the Fire Hall Master?

205
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,030
Wouldn't that be perfect?

206
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,150
If I had ended up in his hands,

207
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,790
he would definitely have panicked.

208
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,020
As long as he joins up
with the Yunmen people

209
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,020
and saves me before I get hurt,

210
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,480
he will definitely start caring about me.

211
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,950
Just saying.

212
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,080
Uncle Zhang, don't take it seriously.

213
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,610
The fish has taken the bait.

214
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,120
Young Chief.

215
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,080
What is it?

216
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,480
I have something important to report.

217
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:36,880
Say it.

218
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,300
The caravan carrying the offerings

219
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,360
will reach Biluo Valley within a day.

220
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,390
Okay. Be careful.

221
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,710
The Chief said

222
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,100
you're to personally escort

223
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,380
the offerings back.

224
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,480
If I leave suddenly,

225
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,600
who's going to keep Yang Qing occupied?

226
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
We'll depart tonight.

227
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,810
By the time Yang Qing realizes,

228
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,670
the offerings should already
be back in the valley.

229
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,050
Okay then.

230
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,570
I'll go with you.

231
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,730
Oh right,

232
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,720
have you heard of the Fire Hall Master
of Shengyue Sect?

233
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,750
His name is Mingyang.

234
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,330
He's extremely skilled in martial arts.

235
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,650
He was the only one to escape
when Shengyue Sect was wiped out.

236
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,960
Since then, he's been saying

237
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,600
he wants to avenge Wang Yue, the Witch,

238
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,730
and sees all martial sects as enemies.

239
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,660
You cunning village girl!

240
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
She may look kind,

241
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,840
but she's full of tricks.

242
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,130
She let me hear all that on purpose,

243
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
just to use my feelings for Yang Qing

244
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,040
to send me to my death!

245
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,000
If anything really happens to me,

246
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,870
there's no way she's getting off easy.

247
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,000
Which village girl dared to set you up?

248
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,880
I'll kill her.

249
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,580
No need.

250
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,200
If there's nothing else, you may go now.

251
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,600
Yes.

252
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,700
Tong, go play outside.

253
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,480
I need to talk to Wangyue.

254
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,570
Well, Wangyue, I'll go play outside then.

255
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,320
Go ahead.

256
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,900
Miss Lu has left.

257
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,040
Really? That's wonderful.

258
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,160
Do you dare say you
had nothing to do with it?

259
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,910
Why are you talking to me like this?

260
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,640
Are you blaming me for this too?

261
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,380
This morning when I went out,

262
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,110
I found this letter at the door.

263
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,310
I've heard about your injury recently
and have been very worried.

264
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,240
How serious is it? Are you alright?

265
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,260
After much consideration,

266
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,450
I've decided to lure the Fire Hall Master
away on my own.

267
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,650
Please take care and wait for good news.

268
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,800
She went to distract the Fire Hall Master—

269
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,600
what does that have to do with me?

270
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,210
Sure, it might seem like a coincidence.

271
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,850
But when it involves you,

272
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,910
it's not.

273
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,290
You think I made her do it?

274
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,060
Just answer my questions.

275
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,270
Did you deliberately bring up

276
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,510
the Fire Hall Master to her?

277
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,000
No.

278
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,300
I told Uncle Zhang.

279
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,110
Maybe he told her.

280
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,540
You're not one to gossip.

281
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,630
So why did you mention it to him?

282
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,910
Because I felt like it.

283
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,840
Didn't you tell her yourself?

284
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,830
Yang Wangyue!

285
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,240
I know you two don't get along.

286
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
Then just stay away from her.

287
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,200
You knew exactly
how skilled Mingyang is in martial arts.

288
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,750
You knew Miss Lu is no match for him.

289
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,600
Yet you still pushed her to her death.

290
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,840
You treat life like it's nothing.

291
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,720
The moment someone crosses you,

292
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,920
you strike like this.

293
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,830
I'm so disappointed in you.

294
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,510
You're ruthless and cruel—
unworthy of trust.

295
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,560
Have I not restrained myself enough?

296
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,960
Have I not tolerated her?

297
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,140
You know perfectly well what I'm like.

298
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,340
So why didn't you help me drive her away?

299
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,040
Yes, it's all my fault.

300
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
How could I not have thought of this?

301
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,510
How could I ever have believed that

302
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,040
you wouldn't kill on a whim?

303
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,400
How could I...

304
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,880
how could I...

305
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,410
ever have trusted you?

306
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,170
You want revenge for her, don't you?

307
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:54,840
She's probably

308
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,730
already been killed
by the Fire Hall Master.

309
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,860
Go ahead and kill me!

310
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,080
Just go.

311
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,560
[How I Got My Husband]

312
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,460
Qing,

313
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,060
Shengyue Sect
is not a kind place after all.

314
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,860
Fu was careless
and got captured by Shengyue Sect.

315
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,830
We haven't heard from her since.

316
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
You must not put yourself in danger.

317
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,120
My martial arts are better than hers.

318
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,780
Most people in Shengyue Sect
are no match for me.

319
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,360
Once I get there,

320
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,550
I'll do everything I can to retrieve

321
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,870
the Moon Blade that fell into their hands.

322
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,630
Besides,

323
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,200
rumors about me and that witch

324
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,390
have been swirling
around the martial world.

325
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,320
If Shengyue Sect

326
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,470
is truly using
this to brew some grand conspiracy,

327
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,870
I must get to the bottom of it.

328
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,480
Just...

329
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,050
be careful of that witch.

330
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,740
Don't let her fool you.

331
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,250
If you weren't so determined to go,

332
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,750
I'd never let you wade into this mess.

333
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,890
The Moon Blade was lost years ago.

334
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,370
Someone has to retrieve it

335
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
before it's used by those with ill intent.

336
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,650
As for the witch…

337
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,720
rest assured, Sect Leader.

338
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,670
I won't fail Yunmen.

339
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,420
Alright.

340
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,010
Qing, be careful on your way.

341
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,600
Yang Qing?

342
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,710
I never thought

343
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,290
you'd actually come looking for me.

344
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,230
I'm curious about

345
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,810
just what kind of person

346
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,330
this Saintess Wang Yue, who everyone says

347
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,180
is so hopelessly
in love with me, really is.

348
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,150
I thought you were heartless.

349
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,990
I never imagined someone

350
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,440
as indifferent as you

351
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,960
would be curious about the Saintess.

352
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,270
I can give you a chance

353
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,320
to stay in Shengyue Sect

354
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,140
and observe her up close.

355
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,310
You'll need to wear a mask

356
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,880
and help me handle affairs in the hall.

357
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,480
Don't bother me with trivial matters.

358
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,840
And if you dare do anything
to harm Shengyue Sect,

359
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,350
I'll make sure you pay the price.

360
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,850
Do we have a deal?

361
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,150
Deal.

362
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,490
Then you shall be called...

363
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,940
Shanxiu.

364
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,180
Shanxiu?

365
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,079
Are these...

366
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,400
the women your Saintess snatched back?

367
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,200
Don't speak.

368
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,230
Saintess.

369
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,270
Who are these people?

370
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,270
A few days ago,

371
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,720
the Lu family women went to Yunlong Temple
to pay respects but encountered bandits.

372
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
I saved them.

373
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,350
Unexpectedly, the Lu family

374
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,000
refused to take them back,

375
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,400
accusing them of losing their virtue.

376
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,120
They even forced them to kill themselves
to uphold their honor.

377
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,200
One of them, not thinking clearly,

378
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,940
killed herself on the spot.

379
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,490
Why were you looking at me
like that just now?

380
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,780
Are you new here?

381
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,880
What?

382
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,070
You were surprised I'd save people?

383
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,830
He's mute?

384
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,480
Yue,

385
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,920
what are you going to do about this?

386
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,500
They were probably too ashamed

387
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,940
to admit they were taken by a few bandits,

388
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,910
so they blamed it on Shengyue Sect.

389
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,400
I didn't expect saving them

390
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,280
would bring me so much trouble.

391
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,680
Well, I guess
I'll take the blame for this.

392
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,440
From now on, you're part of Shengyue Sect.

393
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,730
Thank you, Saintess!

394
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,480
What?

395
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,330
You won't let me drink?

396
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,970
If Yuan Yingxing
doesn't come back tomorrow,

397
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,920
I might never

398
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,010
get to drink this wine again.

399
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,270
Don't worry.

400
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,820
Candy?

401
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,340
It's still a long time until dawn.

402
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,550
We're going to
fight Biluo Valley tomorrow.

403
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,610
I don't know whether I'll live or die.

404
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,040
Keep me company for a while.

405
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,780
It's too dark.

406
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,250
Watching your hand signs is exhausting.

407
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,700
Write on my hand.

408
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,530
Shanxiu, let me ask you,

409
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,640
if you were to die here tomorrow,

410
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,680
who would you want to see
the most right now?

411
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,750
No one.

412
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,550
No one?

413
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,320
That's nice.

414
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,020
So free-spirited.

415
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,400
I used to be like that too.

416
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,110
I don't know when it started,

417
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,860
but I'm not like that anymore.

418
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,880
There's someone I really miss right now.

419
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,000
Where is he now?

420
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,400
Does he know I'm thinking of him?

421
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,560
Shanxiu, you know what?

422
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,200
Lately, so many things
have left me feeling lost.

423
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,240
I really don't know how to fix them.

424
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,120
The storm has risen,

425
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,440
evil runs rampant,

426
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,800
and hardships and dangers are everywhere.

427
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,640
Yuan Yingxing, Yao Fu, Yang Qing—

428
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,440
dealing with them is exhausting.

429
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,310
It's so hard

430
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,140
to keep going alone.

431
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,010
I really want to give up.

432
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,000
Even with the storm rising,

433
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,350
never give up on life.

434
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,150
I've been doing all the talking.

435
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,930
You should say something too.

436
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
What should I say?

437
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,990
You're such a closed book.

438
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,000
Let me ask.

439
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,190
What kind of person do you like?

440
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,670
Come on, tell me.

441
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,020
Everyone in the world knows who I like.

442
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,920
Who do you like?

443
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,620
I won't tell anyone else.

444
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,160
Upright,

445
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,480
kind,

446
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,310
passionate,

447
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,640
honest,

448
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,590
pure,

449
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,030
and innocent?

450
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,920
Well,

451
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,720
does Yang Qing like someone like that too?

452
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,350
But aside from

453
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,790
being passionate and sincere,

454
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,920
♪ At that moment, I fell for you again ♪

455
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,830
I don't have any of those qualities.

456
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,000
♪ Love can't be confessed,
afraid heaven might bear witness ♪

457
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,880
But

458
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,500
when you meet someone you truly like,

459
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,170
those things don't seem
so important anymore.

460
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:52,860
♪ Memories return,
afraid it's a fated misstep ♪

461
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:59,140
♪ Why does fate always keep us apart? ♪

462
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:05,410
♪ A restless heart, an iceberg melting ♪

463
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:12,900
♪ Rewrite the stories in this world ♪

464
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:19,880

470
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,800
What's wrong?

471
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,680
Show me your hand.

472
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,920
I'm fine.

473
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,070
No need to bother.

474
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,790
Show me.

475
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,690
Don't move.

476
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,750
Bear with it.

477
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,200
Done.

478
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,640
Thanks.

479
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,020
If you really want to thank me,

480
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,630
watch the fire carefully.

481
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,360
Don't ruin my medicine.

482
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,200
I didn't mean to.

483
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,990
I was just worried
about Mr. Yang and the others.

484
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,630
Since that day I searched for a long time,

485
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,430
there hasn't been a single clue.

486
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,650
I wonder if Miss Lu

487
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,920
has found them yet.

488
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,750
I'm worried about their safety.

489
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,790
Alright.

490
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,120
With their martial arts skills
and intelligence,

491
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,470
you little fool

492
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,630
don't need to worry.

493
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,710
So,

494
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,250
just take care of yourself

495
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,670
and watch over the antidote
for your fellow disciples.

496
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,510
Sir.

497
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,960
Your inner power
hasn't fully recovered yet.

498
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,790
What if you run into the Fire Hall Master?

499
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,940
I've recovered most of it,

500
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,070
enough to fight him.

501
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,560
If you find the ladies,
will you come back?

502
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,710
I have important matters to attend to.

503
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,630
Don't go.
There are monsters in the mountains.

504
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,550
I'm scared.

505
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,030
Mr. Yang is going
to handle something serious.

506
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,180
Don't cause trouble.

507
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,330
I'm not making it up.

508
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,750
I saw it with my own eyes.

509
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,820
Kids say all sorts of things.

510
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,550
Don't take it to heart.

511
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,510
You should get going.

512
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,360
Focus on the important task.

513
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,110
I'm telling the truth.

514
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,310
Wangyue also said there are monsters.

515
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,160
I was scared,

516
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,590
and she even stayed with me while I slept.

517
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,850
Wangyue stayed with you while you slept?

518
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,010
Why didn't I know that?
When did that happen?

519
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,350
Tong, tell me,

520
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,320
where did you see the monster?

521
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,350
I can't tell you.

522
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,510
If I do,

523
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,280
the monster will come take me
and Grandpa away.

524
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,940
Just whisper it to me.

525
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,750
The monsters won't know.

526
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

527
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,410
Uncle Zhang,

528
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,750
I'll go check on Miss Lu's safety first.

529
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,440
You and Tong

530
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,350
should avoid going out
these next few days.

531
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,160
And don't open the door
if a stranger knocks.

532
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,690
Alright.

533
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,830
Mr. Yang,

534
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,240
stay safe out there.

535
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,400
If you need anything from me,

536
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
just say the word.

537
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:14,870
Thank you.

538
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:15,840
Alright.

539
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,950
Let's go.

540
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,030
I've done so much for you,

541
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,400
yet you still think it's not enough.

542
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,660
What am I to you anyway?

543
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,270
You've done nothing for me,

544
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,200
nor have you promised me anything.

545
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,530
Just because I like you,

546
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,480
you think you can treat me like this?

547
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,010
If you really make me angry,

548
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,920
I'll drug you.

549
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,350
Then we'll see how you treat me then.

550
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,720
But...

551
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,280
that would be too boring.

552
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,880
What kind of awful place is this?

553
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,810
Why have I been walking for so long
but I'm still here?

554
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,860
Why can't I get out of this forest?

555
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,070
Yang Qing?

556
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,580
Why are you here?

557
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,910
Don't tell me you came looking for me.

558
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,360
I'm not going back with you.

559
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,720
You actually yelled at me because of
someone like Lu Xuanxuan.

560
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,550
Unless you kneel down
and kowtow to me a few times

561
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
and say "I'm sorry" a hundred times,

562
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,250
I won't go back with you.

563
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,990
I just don't want anything
to happen to you.

564
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,200
Aren't you afraid I might run into
the Fire Hall Master

565
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,070
and get killed?

566
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,730
Would he actually kill you?

567
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,660
So someone would love
to see me die miserably out here.

568
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,890
Shameless couple!

569
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,800
How dare you flirt in front of me?

570
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,430
You're both dying today!

571
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,270
I can handle him.

572
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,830
Stay put.

573
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,890
Come with me.

574
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,040
Yang Qing, do you even know
where we're going?

575
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,710
We just passed through here.

576
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,630
Someone's set up a formation here.

577
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,680
Once we break through this illusion,

578
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,530
we can get out.

579
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,790
Yang Qing, what's wrong with you?

580
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,790
Are you okay?

581
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,750
Let's stop running.

582
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,580
I really can handle Mingyang.

583
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,480
If you go,

584
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,190
you'll just get tangled up
with Shengyue Sect again.

585
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,420
What now? Not running anymore?

586
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,000
That hand sign... the Saintess?

587
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,600
How does she know it?

588
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,830
Si,

589
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,170
don't you still recognize me?

590
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,240
Saintess?

591
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,680
It's really you?

592
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,720
You're alive?

593
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,470
You're really alive!

594
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,530
I... I...

595
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,440
I always thought Yao Fu had killed you.

596
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,720
I've been dreaming
of getting revenge for you.

597
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,380
You think I'd die that easily?

598
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,590
It's just that

599
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,210
my meridians are damaged
and I can't use martial arts anymore.

600
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,790
From now on, I'll always be
by your side to protect you.

601
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,460
Let's go now.

602
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,480
This place isn't safe.

603
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,810
Bring Yang Qing with us.

604
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,750
Yang Qing?

605
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,070
Wouldn't it be great to just leave him
out here in the wilderness?

606
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,950
I would leave you here
before I leave him here.

607
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:48,480
Hurry up.

608
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,360
Yes.

609
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,310
Miss Yang, aren't you going to explain

610
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,770
what happened last night?

611
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,510
You kept stopping me from taking action,

612
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,790
so I had no choice but to knock you out

613
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,850
and face the Fire Hall Master myself.

614
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,440
Are you seriously going to take on
the Fire Hall Master?

615
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,530
He's not someone

616
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,920
an untrained girl like you

617
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,720
can handle.

618
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,680
Yang Qing,
you're still doubting me, aren't you?

619
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,850
Fine, then let me tell you—

620
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,360
yes, I plan to use the Fire Hall Master

621
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,160
to kill Lu Xuanxuan first, and then you.

622
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,090
Hurting people is what I love most.

623
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,850
I'm sorry.

624
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,490
I shouldn't have said
those things to you that day.

625
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,360
It was wrong of me to lash out at you.

626
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,570
I'm not someone who
clings to rigid ideals,

627
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,389
but deliberately hurting others

628
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,250
is something I just can't accept.

629
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,600
I just mentioned it casually

630
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,050
to test her.

631
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,280
I didn't expect her to take it seriously.

632
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,210
Whether Miss Lu believed it or not,

633
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,270
I hope you won't treat
such matters so lightly.

634
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,820
This time it was her.

635
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,239
What if next time

636
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,550
it's me?

637
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,210
Of course it won't be you.

638
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,550
You and that Lu woman

639
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,610
are nothing alike.

640
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,920
I'll try to work with you from now on.

641
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,750
Good. You promised me.

642
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,230
Don't joke about matters
of life and death again.

643
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:51,960
Alright.

644
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,030
I got it, I got it.

645
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:53,920
So...

646
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,630
are we good now?

647
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
What do you think?

648
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,670
I've been running nonstop.

649
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,220
I'm hungry.

650
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,900
Go get me something to eat.

651
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:11,920
Sure.

652
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,420
You stay here.

653
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,540
I'll find something for you to eat.

654
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,390
Why are you here?

655
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,550
Saintess,

656
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,380
you purposely sent me away

657
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,240
just to be alone with Yang Qing?

658
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,400
Don't tell me you're still hung up on him.

659
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,150
Our Shengyue Sect
suffered terribly because of them.

660
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,800
Yuan Yingxing, the Earth Hall Master,
and the Four Guardians

661
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,480
are all trapped in Biluo Valley.

662
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,800
Only the Sun Blade from Yunmen
can open the dungeon.

663
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,300
That's why I disguised myself
as a village girl

664
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,090
and have been following Yang Qing.

665
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,920
And what's wrong
with getting a little closer to him

666
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
along the way?

667
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,760
If it's to save our people,

668
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,730
I will do my best to support you.

669
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,480
But remember, we have

670
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,030
a blood feud with the righteous sects.

671
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,960
I'm sorry.

672
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,110
Saintess,

673
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,760
may I stay by your side?

674
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,180
I can help you find a way.

675
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,670
Yang Qing already knows
you're the Fire Hall Master.

676
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,630
If you stay by my side,

677
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,710
I'll blow my cover.

678
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,230
Yang Qing's martial arts
have been damaged.

679
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,240
Something must have happened to him.

680
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,700
Judging by his condition,

681
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,800
he won't recover anytime soon.

682
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,510
I'm afraid if you stay with him
and something happens,

683
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,240
he won't be able to protect you.

684
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,040
Alright then.

685
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,680
You can stay with me.

686
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,360
However,

687
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,180
you must not reveal my identity.

688
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,150
Just say...

689
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,750
Miss Yang.

690
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,480
Why are you with the Fire Hall Master
from Shengyue Sect?

691
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,250
Don't tell me

692
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,660
he's the uncle you mentioned.

693
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,260
He...

694
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,470
He's actually my lover.

695
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:01,960
My ex.

696
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,530
My ex-lover.

697
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,230
Your ex-lover?

698
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,380
But you never showed any sign of
recognizing each other before.

699
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,440
Here's the thing:

700
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,300
When we were together,

701
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,150
we broke up
because of personality clashes.

702
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,880
He holds a grudge against me.

703
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
Didn't I fall for you?

704
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,590
He's unhappy with both of us.

705
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,100
So,

706
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,380
all that love and hate mixed together

707
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,040
turned him into what he is now.

708
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,320
Miss Yang, do you really like me?

709
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,110
Of course I do.

710
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,530
Isn't my affection for you obvious enough?

711
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,630
You even abandoned your former lover

712
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,880
without hesitation.

713
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,840
Honestly, it scares me.

714
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,760
I'm afraid
I'll be the next one you throw away.

715
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,400
Since your old lover

716
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,070
has come looking for you,

717
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,480
he must still be in love with you.

718
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,710
You've avoided acknowledging
him several times,

719
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,110
yet today you secretly met with him.

720
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,560
Clearly, you still have feelings for him.

721
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,670
In that case,

722
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,310
I'll step aside.

723
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
I wish you two a happy reunion,

724
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,670
a blissful marriage,

725
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,750
a lifetime of happiness,
and lots of children.

726
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,090
Wait, Yang Qing, what do you mean?

727
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,000
Yang Qing...

728
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,080
Saintess...

729
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,920
Yang Qing.

730
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,960
I... I suddenly have
this terrible pain in my chest.

731
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,230
I can't breathe.

732
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,510
Please check on me.

733
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,600
Miss Yang, why bother?

734
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,090
Isn't your old lover right behind you?

735
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,590
I'm guessing he's the one

736
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,720
who comforted you every time
your chest hurt, didn't he?

737
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,470
Miss Yang, why do you have
to toy with me like this?

738
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,360
I...

739
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,320
Yang Qing.

740
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,800
Yang Qing!

741
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,470
[Qingmu Fortress]

742
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,490
[Weihu Hall]

743
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,850
Young Chief, bad news.

744
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,740
Yang Qing and the Fire Hall Master
from Shengyue Sect

745
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,750
were spotted on the main path
to our stronghold.

746
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,550
If we depart tonight as planned,

747
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,030
they might notice.

748
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,230
My father personally
set up this formation outside.

749
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,150
Without a guide,

750
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,350
there's no way they could've gotten in.

751
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,090
Why is Yang Qing with someone
from Shengyue Sect?

752
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,710
Judging by the way they looked,

753
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,280
it seemed like they entered by accident.

754
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,150
They don't seem to know anything
about what's going on here.

755
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,880
Young Chief, what should we do?

756
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,820
Hide the offerings

757
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,360
and send them out another day.

758
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:00,910
And make sure

759
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,370
not a word leaks out.

760
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:02,840
Also,

761
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,400
have someone keep a close eye
on Yang Qing and his group.

762
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,200
Report to me everything they do.

763
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,150
Don't take any other action for now.

764
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:10,960
Yes.

765
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,510
So,

766
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
you want Mingyang to travel with us?

767
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,030
You want your ex-lover trailing behind me?

768
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,710
Do you think

769
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,030
I have too few Shengyue Sect members
around me

770
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,940
and need to add more?

771
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,340
What does that mean?

772
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,250
Is he implying I'm from Shengyue Sect too?

773
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,280
There's really nothing between us anymore.

774
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,480
Yang Qing, he's just helping protect us

775
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,130
and offering clues.

776
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,630
And the one I like is you.

777
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,070
You'll see that he's a good guy.

778
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,400
Besides, he promised me

779
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,030
he won't kill righteous sect members
anymore.

780
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,610
And what about the ones he already killed?

781
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
Mr. Yang, if you dislike what I've done,

782
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,220
I'm willing to pay
any price to make it right.

783
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,480
Hurry up and thank Mr. Yang.

784
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,240
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

785
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,990
Miss Yang, actually,
you don't need my permission

786
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,550
to bring him along.

787
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,080
Let's just head back
to the city as soon as possible.

788
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,220
It's finally settled.

789
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:35,880
Really?

790
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,320
You don't know Yang Qing.

791
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,560
When he doesn't

792
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,920
firmly refuse something,

793
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,590
it means there's room for it.

794
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,550
See? He didn't
firmly drive you away, right?

795
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,440
Just stay.

796
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,870
Yes, Saintess.

797
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,460
However,

798
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,300
he still doesn't want you to stay.

799
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,750
You know that, right?

800
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,400
I noticed from the start.

801
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:03,130
You're the one
who didn't take it seriously.

802
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,370
Si,

803
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,170
whether you stay depends on yourself now.

804
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,110
You have to win Yang Qing over and,

805
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,550
by the way, praise me in front of him

806
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,470
to make a good impression.

807
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,580
It's all for Shengyue Sect.

808
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,630
Makes sense,

809
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,590
but you two shouldn't
get too close, right?

810
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,120
Oh right,

811
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,450
don't call me Saintess in front of him.

812
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,570
Yes, Saintess.

813
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:25,810
What?

814
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,960
You arrested Yang Qing?

815
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,690
Young Chief,
they broke into the formation.

816
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,880
If it weren't for that woman
having no martial skills,

817
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,980
Yang Qing would have completely

818
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,400
destroyed our trap.

819
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:40,500
Yang Qing is the youngest elder of Yunmen.

820
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,300
Our trap can hardly stop him.

821
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:45,940
If you ask me,

822
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,110
since they dared

823
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,910
cause trouble on our territory,

824
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,360
we might as well silence them for good.

825
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,060
About the sacrifice,

826
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,050
if Yang Qing discovers anything,

827
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,540
the whole Biluo Valley will be in danger.

828
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,750
You mustn't do that.

829
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,450
You mustn't harm Yang Qing.

830
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,030
Young Chief, the Chief has given an order.

831
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:04,490
Shut up!

832
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,760
Since when

833
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,050
did you have a say in my matters?

834
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,160
If Yang Qing finds even a trace of clue,

835
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,930
Yunmen will investigate thoroughly.

836
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,820
Weren't they all locked up?

837
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,320
Can't you even keep watch over them?

838
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,050
What's the use of keeping a useless person
like you in Biluo Valley?

839
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,920
Just keep an eye on them.

840
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:33,060
After we send out the offerings,

841
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,100
release them.

842
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,250
Young Chief...

843
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:35,710
Enough.

844
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,660
Just do as I say.

845
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,810
We'll depart immediately after eating.

846
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,590
Yes.

847
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,670
Miss Yang?

848
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:58,920
Miss Yang?
