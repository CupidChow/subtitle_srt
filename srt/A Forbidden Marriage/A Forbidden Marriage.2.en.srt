[Episode 2]

3
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,759
I was right, wasn't I?

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,430
My uncle abandoned me and left.

5
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,789
There's nothing left here.

6
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,460
Miss Yang,

7
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,229
don't you have any other relatives?

8
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,790
I don't think so.

9
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,350
Then just wait here a little longer.

10
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,410
Maybe they'll come back in a few days.

11
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,850
He sold me off.

12
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,669
How could he possibly come back?

13
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,370
That uncle of mine

14
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,150
was once a disciple of Shengyue Sect.

15
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,080
He's definitely not trustworthy.

16
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,430
Yang Wangyue!

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,150
Yang Wangyue,

18
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,590
you little bitch!

19
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,600
I'm settling this with you today!

20
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,400
Mrs. Chen, let's talk this through.

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,100
Talk this through?

22
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,340
Why should I?

23
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,750
She burned down half of Chen's Mansion!

24
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,190
Selling her wouldn't even
cover the damages!

25
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,120
Get out of my way!

26
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,170
Then why don't you
calculate your actual losses?

27
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,170
My losses?

28
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,310
They're huge!

29
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,520
Move!

30
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,560
Mr. Yang,

31
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,970
you saved me again.

32
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,240
Can I offer myself to you
in gratitude now?

33
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,140
This girl is now a disciple
of Yunmen Sect.

34
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm taking her with me.

35
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,750
Yang Wangyue,

36
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,810
you... you...

37
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,450
Bitch!

38
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,620
After dying once, I realized that...

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,200
Yang Qing seems even more charming now.

40
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,600
I've finally managed to stay.

41
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,870
I've got to make a good impression.

42
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,750
Mr. Yang,

43
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,450
you've been practicing for so long.

44
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,430
You must be tired.

45
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,290
I've prepared some water for you.

46
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,970
Mr. Yang, are you really
this cold-hearted?

47
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,390
I've always been detached.

48
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,190
How do you even make

49
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,580
refusal sound so graceful?

50
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,980
What am I supposed to do?

51
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,390
Are you going to say you like me again?

52
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes.

53
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,200
Can you please control

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,580
that overwhelming affection of yours?

55
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,740
You're just too attractive.

56
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,650
I can't help it.

57
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,180
Do you really have to express it
all the time?

58
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,940
Yes.

59
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,430
Miss Yang,

60
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,750
you're really troubling me.

61
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,930
If you're troubled,

62
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,910
just accept me.

63
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,430
Mr. Yang!

64
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,070
Jiang Yan?

65
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,310
Why are you here?

66
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,310
Miss Yang, I'm here for you.

67
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,630
The servants at Master Chen's residence
reported to the authorities,

68
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,090
accusing you of arson
and attempted murder.

69
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,580
The government has already
issued an arrest order,

70
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,090
but we have taken care of it.

71
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,460
That wasn't me.

72
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,490
How could I dare do such a thing?

73
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,280
If I were that bold,

74
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,680
I would've done it when they took me

75
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,540
as a concubine.

76
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,320
Mr. Yang,

77
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,310
do I look like someone
who would kill and set fires?

78
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,680
You kind of do.

79
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,070
Mr. Yang,

80
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,430
how can you say that?

81
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,360
Just kidding.

82
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,120
Miss Yang, there's no need to worry.

83
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,640
Even if the authorities order an arrest,

84
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,100
we'll help take care of it.

85
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,680
However, you can't stay
in Yangliu Town anymore.

86
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,140
Master Chen might seek revenge
against you.

87
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,870
But I'm just a girl with no parents.

88
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,120
Where else can I go?

89
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,740
Don't you have any friends to turn to?

90
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,360
No.

91
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,330
I've lived in this village
since I was little.

92
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,930
I don't know anyone outside.

93
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,390
Never mind.

94
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,920
I'll just...

95
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,000
be more careful around them.

96
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,720
If you stay here,

97
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,740
Master Chen will definitely
take revenge on you.

98
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,940
I'm not afraid of him.

99
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,800
Do you want to try to kill him again?

100
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,090
Who said I tried to kill him?

101
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,470
Mr. Yang,

102
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,940
there you go again.

103
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,040
Exactly.

104
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,720
How could I dare do such a thing?

105
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,120
I'm actually afraid he might
come after me.

106
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,800
Mr. Yang,

107
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,450
I think...

108
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,890
Miss Yang should go with us.

109
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,500
Go with us?

110
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,600
Are you planning to take her to Yunmen?

111
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,800
Take me to Yunmen,

112
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,190
and I can serve tea and water.

113
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,040
Sorry,

114
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,630
I don't need anyone to serve me.

115
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,650
I'm not just anyone.

116
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,850
You'll see if you try.

117
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,480
Mr. Yang!

118
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,990
Miss Yang,

119
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,270
your affection for Mr. Yang

120
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,530
is way too obvious.

121
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,300
Of course it is.

122
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,870
When you like someone,
you should say it out loud.

123
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,830
I do like Mr. Yang.

124
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,600
I've never met such a brave girl before.

125
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,630
Except... the late Saintess
of Shengyue Sect.

126
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,160
Jiang Yan.

127
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,730
Please help me plead with Mr. Yang.

128
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,740
I'm really afraid of being caught
by Master Chen.

129
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,409
Miss Yang, don't worry.

130
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,950
Mr. Yang

131
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,590
may look cold but has a warm heart.

132
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,120
He'll definitely help you.

133
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,570
Then I'd better try harder.

134
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,550
I'm not copying you.

135
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,240
I just noticed

136
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,480
our tastes are exactly the same.

137
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,150
I like whatever

138
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,340
you like to eat.

139
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,870
We're a perfect match.

140
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,390
Really?

141
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,700
You like stinky tofu?

142
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,910
Maybe he likes it?

143
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,200
Yes.

144
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,560
But I don't like it.

145
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,150
It seems our tastes

146
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,120
aren't quite the same after all.

147
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,670
Miss Yang,

148
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,220
you don't seriously think Mr. Yang

149
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,680
likes stinky tofu, do you?

150
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,590
Just eat your food.

151
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,170
What do you think

152
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,010
will happen if I put some poison

153
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
in the food?

154
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,080
Every time I eat something,

155
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,030
you eat it too.

156
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,870
How... how could that be?

157
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm just following you.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,200
If there's poison,

159
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,860
you'd get poisoned first.

160
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,650
Miss Yang, don't listen to Mr. Yang.

161
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,960
How could he possibly poison you?

162
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,530
He's just teasing you.

163
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,000
That's not necessarily true.

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,600
So many people have died
at the hands of their enemies.

165
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,790
But who's to say

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,600
how many died at the hands
of their lovers?

167
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,140
Lovers?

168
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,400
We'll be lovers soon.

169
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,530
Who gave you that confidence?

170
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,910
Mr. Yang, treating Miss Yang this way

171
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,840
will make her think you despise her.

172
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,450
That's fine.

173
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,840
Mr. Jiang,

174
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,200
how can you say that?

175
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,480
Teasing is a sign of affection.

176
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,510
He must like me more than he despises me.

177
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,850
That's certainly not true.

178
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,270
That is true.

179
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,060
[Yixiang Roast Chicken]
[No Dogs
and Shengyue Sect Disciples Allowed]

180
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,240
Are you sure

181
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,450
the Sun Blade is with Yang Qing?

182
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,630
I had someone use a drug to knock out
two Yunmen disciples

183
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,670
and get the info.

184
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,590
It should be correct.

185
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,760
But...

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,790
the Sun Blade is so important.

187
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,240
Would Yunmen really
let Yang Qing guard it?

188
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,120
Yang Qing

189
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,910
is the most promising among

190
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,550
the current generation in Yunmen Sect.

191
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,880
Despite his young age,

192
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,960
he's already one of the Four Elders.

193
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,240
Maybe everyone thinks

194
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,110
such a valuable treasure

195
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
wouldn't be carried around,

196
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,840
so they did the opposite,

197
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
took a risky move,

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,860
and had Yang Qing keep it with him.

199
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,520
I don't mind checking

200
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,150
whether it's with him

201
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,830
or not.

202
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,230
They'll go out tonight.

203
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,310
I'll go and get the thing.

204
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,440
I'll need your help then.

205
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,970
Alright.

206
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,580
And bring a roast chicken.

207
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,670
Your roast chicken skills

208
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,250
have become more and more impressive.

209
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,970
Though the roast chicken shop
is just a cover,

210
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,480
we disciples of Shengyue Sect

211
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,670
are dedicated to everything we do.

212
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,510
If we do it, we do it well.

213
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,810
Right, Saintess?

214
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,780
Alright, I'm leaving now.

215
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,340
Okay.

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,670
Mr. Yang,

217
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,720
Miss Yang...

218
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,750
Don't you find her strange?

219
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,750
Apart from her
overwhelming affection for you,

220
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,950
I don't see anything strange about her.

221
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,980
You actually want to plead for her

222
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,870
and bring her back to Yunmen?

223
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,780
Give me one reason.

224
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,310
I just think she's all alone

225
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,320
and kinda pitiful.

226
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,670
Maybe in the end,

227
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,080
we won't know who's truly pitiful.

228
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,750
What did you find out
from Master Chen's side?

229
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,910
I went to Chen's Mansion to investigate.

230
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,320
Master Chen left early
with the fleet to make a delivery.

231
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,050
He's not home

232
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,000
and won't be back for a few days.

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,360
Okay.

234
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,670
Tomorrow night we'll sneak into
Chen's Mansion to investigate.

235
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,870
Everything is ready.

236
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,230
By the way,

237
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,200
your swordplay is still a bit shaky.

238
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,190
While we're out,
make sure to keep practicing.

239
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,120
Don't slack off.

240
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,470
[Tianlin Garden]

241
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:31,820
Jiang Yan.

242
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,890
-Miss Yang.
-Are you practicing swordplay?

243
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,150
Miss Yang,

244
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,840
I've been practicing for so long,

245
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,700
and I'm still not even one-tenth
as good as Mr. Yang.

246
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,930
Give me your sword.

247
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,410
Watch and learn.

248
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,520
All sword techniques boil down

249
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,920
to thrusts, slashes, sweeps, and flicks.

250
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,870
The target areas

251
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,580
are the wrist, chest, neck, and legs—

252
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,510
either to disable your opponent's ability
to attack and defend

253
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,150
or to kill them.

254
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,910
The moves are simple,

255
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,340
but everyone has their own unique style.

256
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,480
Sword techniques are just like people—

257
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,570
each has their

258
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,910
own character.

259
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,130
If you only imitate Yang Qing,

260
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,100
no matter how well you copy him,

261
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,300
it'll never be yours.

262
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,570
Mr. Yang's swordplay is brilliant.

263
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,010
I'm just too dull

264
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,400
to grasp the essence
of Yunmen Sword Technique.

265
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,360
You are you.

266
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,120
You should learn the moves,

267
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,400
then find a sword style of your own.

268
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,080
Miss Yang,

269
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,290
you seem to know a lot
about sword techniques.

270
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,360
No, not at all.

271
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,600
My uncle used to be in Shengyue Sect.

272
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,070
When he was practicing swordplay,

273
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,630
I got curious and secretly picked up
a few moves.

274
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,270
By the way,

275
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,400
your sword looks quite nice.

276
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,910
Does Yang Qing have one like it too?

277
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,500
Mr. Yang is highly skilled
in martial arts.

278
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,630
Few in the martial world can match him.

279
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,840
He rarely carries weapons.

280
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,480
What about a dagger he keeps on him?

281
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,630
Doesn't he have one?

282
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,600
I'm not sure about that.

283
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,970
He never lets us touch his belongings,

284
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,960
and we're not allowed in his room either.

285
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,600
Miss Yang,

286
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,370
why are you asking about this?

287
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,150
I like him,

288
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,430
so of course I want to know
everything about him.

289
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,270
Miss Yang,

290
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,410
you're not seriously in love

291
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,560
with Mr. Yang, are you?

292
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,720
Of course I am.

293
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,200
Mr. Yang and I are in love.

294
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,350
What, are you trying to break us up?

295
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,750
In love?

296
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,030
It's clearly just a one-sided love.

297
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,090
Let me tell you,

298
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,550
sooner or later
you'll have to give up on him.

299
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,390
Before,
that former Saintess of Shengyue Sect

300
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,680
went around telling everyone
in the martial world

301
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,960
that she'd win him over.

302
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,830
And what happened?

303
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,030
Mr. Yang hasn't even left
the mountain since.

304
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,830
That's right.

305
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,840
That witch

306
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,120
kept pestering Mr. Yang.

307
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,850
She came to the foot
of Yunmen Sect's mountain every few days,

308
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,150
constantly pressuring the Sect Leader
to hand him over.

309
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,240
Well...

310
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,600
are you saying Mr. Yang never had feelings

311
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,670
for her?

312
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,120
How could he?

313
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,900
She was from Shengyue Sect!

314
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,080
The elders were always worried

315
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,440
he'd sneak off the mountain to meet her.

316
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,690
I'll tell you a secret.

317
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,440
I actually saw the romantic fiction
the Saintess of Shengyue Sect

318
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,770
wrote for Mr. Yang.

319
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,870
It was so passionately romantic.

320
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,320
Jiang Yan,

321
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,200
Sect Leader strictly forbids us
from reading them.

322
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,380
I just skimmed through a few pages.

323
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,490
I must say,

324
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,590
Mr. Yang is quite a legendary figure.

325
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,100
Even before anything happened,

326
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,470
that witch had her eye on him.

327
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,320
Then he went down the mountain
to visit home,

328
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,770
and you took a liking to him too.

329
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,700
Mr. Yang sure attracts the ladies.

330
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,730
Jiang Yan, stop talking nonsense.

331
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,630
Miss Yang,

332
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,600
I advise you

333
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,010
not to waste your effort.

334
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,240
In Yunmen,

335
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,420
Mr. Yang already has a perfect match.

336
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,510
A perfect match?

337
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,349
Who?

338
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,040
Believe me.

339
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,210
Once I tell you,

340
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,480
you'll realize you don't really

341
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,750
stand a chance.

342
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,310
Everyone in Yunmen thinks

343
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,910
Mr. Yang should be with...

344
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,790
I don't want to hear it,
nor do I want to know.

345
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,270
Mr. Yang isn't married,

346
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,190
which means I still have a chance.

347
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,630
So don't tell me

348
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,339
who his perfect match is.

349
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,640
I don't care.

350
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,450
If I find out,

351
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,640
I might just go and kill her.

352
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,790
That's right, Shang Huai.

353
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,520
Miss Yang has her own thoughts.

354
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,430
Didn't Mr. Yang teach us?

355
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,640
Don't assume others' feelings

356
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,390
based on your own limited perspective.

357
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,720
That's disrespectful.

358
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:45,850
Really?

359
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,670
He really said that?

360
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,570
I think I like him even more now.

361
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,220
[Tianlin Garden]

362
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,270
Saintess.

363
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,750
Let's go.

364
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,300
Hurry up.

365
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,030
Oh, Yuan Yingxing.

366
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,670
If we hadn't grown up together,

367
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,710
would I bother doing this for you?

368
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,440
See?

369
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,640
In times like this, I have to step in.

370
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,880
Does that Yao Fu you love so much

371
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,810
care about you?

372
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,510
Is your info reliable?

373
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,050
Is the Sun Blade really with Yang Qing?

374
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,350
Rest assured.

375
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,240
My spy network

376
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,070
covers every corner of the martial world.

377
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,000
It's absolutely reliable.

378
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,310
Spy network?

379
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,030
By running a roast chicken shop?

380
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,000
Don't underestimate my roast chicken shop.

381
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,310
When my roast chicken is served,

382
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,640
nothing else compares.

383
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,730
Be careful not to be overheard.

384
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,750
Do you think

385
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,440
Yang Qing would hide the Sun Blade

386
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,270
under his bed?

387
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,380
It's possible.

388
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:52,980
Go and check it out.

389
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,510
Alright.

390
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,070
Me?

391
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,680
Otherwise,

392
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,270
do you think someone of my status

393
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,200
is suited for crawling under beds?

394
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,680
I'll go, I'll go.

395
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:27,920
How is it?

396
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,830
There's a box.

397
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,000
Is it the Sun Blade?

398
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,960
It's a pair of shoes.

399
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,410
Yang Qing sure is particular.

400
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,300
You...

401
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,540
Good evening, Mr. Yang.

402
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,390
I heard noises in my room

403
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,230
and thought it was a thief.

404
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
How could that be?

405
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,450
I'm here to prepare a surprise for you.

406
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,960
Miss Yang,

407
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,580
what are you doing?

408
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,400
I studied this specifically.

409
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
I...

410
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,960
When I stand at this angle,

411
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,510
you'll think I look especially beautiful.

412
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,640
Miss Yang, why did you

413
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,050
come here uninvited?

414
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,880
I...

415
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,790
The moonlight
is particularly beautiful tonight.

416
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,250
I wanted to invite you
to admire it together,

417
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,070
but you weren't in your room.

418
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,590
The wind outside is too strong,

419
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,070
so I had to wait in your room.

420
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,960
Mr. Yang, you don't mind, do you?

421
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,820
I do mind.

422
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,270
Mr. Yang, why are you so distant?

423
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,270
The moonlight outside is really beautiful.

424
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,200
I'll take you to see it.

425
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,830
Let's go.

426
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,460
Tonight's moon...

427
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,070
They finally left.

428
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,830
I just remembered

429
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,640
I have some fine wine
and roast chicken in my room.

430
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,570
I'll go get them.

431
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,190
This beautiful moonlight pairs perfectly

432
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,520
with good food and wine.

433
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,360
You're trying to find something

434
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,490
from me, aren't you?

435
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,750
I'm not.

436
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,180
Is this the "beautiful moonlight"
you mentioned?

437
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,060
Is there even a moon tonight?

438
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,240
When I came here,

439
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,240
there was definitely moonlight everywhere.

440
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,550
What's going on?

441
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,270
Mr. Yang, take another look.

442
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:20,930
There's...

443
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,480
Do you take me for a fool?

444
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,320
Do you have to

445
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,330
sit on my bed to admire the moon?

446
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,830
I...

447
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,850
Or did you

448
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,510
have another purpose from the start?

449
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,040
Speak up,

450
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,110
or don't blame me for being rude.

451
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,240
Fine, I'll tell you.

452
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,950
I've been following you

453
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,010
because I like you.

454
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,530
Going into your room
was was foolish of me.

455
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,600
I believed the legends

456
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,360
and thought putting
a love charm under your pillow

457
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,680
would make you like me.

458
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,730
Mr. Yang.

459
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,320
Mr. Yang.

460
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,720
Tonight at Chen's Mansion,

461
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,960
we found something unusual

462
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,020
in that warehouse.

463
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,000
I suspect

464
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,480
Master Chen is connected
to the missing children case.

465
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,080
He may not be the mastermind,

466
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,210
but…

467
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,560
Didn't half of Chen's Mansion burn down?

468
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,500
Tomorrow, have Shang Huai
take Ling Xiao to Chen's Mansion

469
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,220
and say that

470
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,770
we offended Madam Chen

471
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,300
because of Miss Yang today,

472
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,320
so we want to help with repairs
and cleaning—

473
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
and take the chance to investigate.

474
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,090
I also found that many cargo wagons

475
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,550
have been coming and going

476
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,320
through the back gate
of Chen's Mansion recently.

477
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,920
Send someone to check it out.

478
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,460
Alright.

479
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,720
Tomorrow I have an appointment
with the district leader

480
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,650
to learn more about the situation.

481
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,630
Mr. Yang,

482
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,700
it's...

483
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,940
Mr. Yang, did Miss Yang come by earlier?

484
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,430
What?

485
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,560
You haven't solved the case yet,

486
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,070
but you've certainly mastered the art

487
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,330
of small-town gossip.

488
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,000
Mr. Yang, looks like Miss Yang's
got her sights set on you.

489
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,530
I must say,
Miss Yang is indeed good-looking,

490
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,960
and she's frank, cheerful,

491
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,170
and quite likable.

492
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,680
If it weren't
because of you and Ms. Yao...

493
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,390
Well...

494
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,530
Well, Mr. Yang,

495
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,020
it's been a while
since Shengyue Sect was destroyed.

496
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,220
Ms. Yao made great contributions.

497
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,420
Why hasn't she returned to the sect yet?

498
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,640
Is Ms. Yao someone

499
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,620
you're allowed to comment on?

500
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:41,960
Today

501
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,910
I saw you discussing
swordplay with Miss Yang.

502
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,350
She seems so weak,

503
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,750
yet she spoke about swordsmanship
like an expert.

504
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,670
Don't you find that odd?

505
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,160
I asked her about it.

506
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,410
She said her uncle
was once in Shengyue Sect

507
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,640
and trained in swordsmanship.

508
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,080
So

509
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,310
she picked up a few moves from him.

510
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,510
And you believe that?

511
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,640
Mr. Yang,

512
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,300
Yangliu Town is right next to Mount Yin.

513
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,270
It's normal that some common folk

514
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,610
were swayed by Shengyue Sect.

515
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,960
I've asked the locals.

516
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,840
They said back when
Shengyue Sect was around,

517
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,060
no children went missing,

518
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,070
and public safety was quite good.

519
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,420
All they had to do
was pay a small annual fee.

520
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,160
Mr. Yang,

521
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,510
I just don't understand.

522
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,310
Shengyue Sect wasn't some

523
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,680
bloodthirsty cult.

524
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,400
Why couldn't they just follow

525
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,530
martial world rules

526
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,090
and make peace with us?

527
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,880
Do you know how much trouble

528
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,460
they caused the martial world

529
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,150
just by ignoring the rules?

530
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,670
Forget it.

531
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,190
Forget I said anything.

532
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,820
Mr. Yang,

533
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,970
I really don't think
Miss Yang has anything to do

534
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,920
with the missing children.

535
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
She was forced to marry Master Chen.

536
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,090
She's just outspoken and straightforward.

537
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,260
She doesn't even try to hide

538
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,520
her affection for you.

539
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,300
Since you seem quite fond of Miss Yang,

540
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,960
take her to Chen's Mansion tomorrow

541
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,150
and try to ease things

542
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,840
between her and Mrs. Chen.

543
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,540
Alright, Mr. Yang.

544
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,070
I'll head back now.

545
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:01,560
Okay.

546
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,110
She likes me,

547
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,000
knows swordplay,

548
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
and has relatives in Shengyue Sect?

549
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,880
Could she be...

550
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,640
Is it you?

551
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,310
Mr. Yang, why are you so distant?

552
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,270
The moonlight outside is really beautiful.

553
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,020
I'll take you to see it.

554
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,550
Let's go.

555
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,580
The Sun Blade isn't on Yang Qing.

556
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,930
Come in quickly.

557
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,490
Come on.

558
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,480
I told you your intel was unreliable.

559
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,900
The Sun Blade isn't in Yang Qing's room

560
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,720
or on him.

561
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,960
That can't be right.

562
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,160
Forget it. I won't count on you anymore.

563
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,750
Saintess.

564
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,340
Saintess.

565
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,720
Since when did you
get so close to Yang Qing?

566
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,380
You were even able...

567
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,170
to search his body just now.

568
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,980
I've been pretending to be a weak girl

569
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,310
and staying by his side.

570
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,060
Then I should congratulate you

571
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,620
on getting what you wanted.

572
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,150
Not even close.

573
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,250
Yang Qing hasn't fallen for me yet.

574
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,840
I can use this matter with Master Chen

575
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,110
as an excuse to hang around him more.

576
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,790
If one day I suddenly leave,

577
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,500
he'll feel unsettled, right?

578
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,270
When that happens,

579
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,200
that means Yang Qing has fallen for you.

580
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,370
I want Yang Qing
to know what it feels like

581
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,000
to care about someone deeply

582
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,600
before I leave him.

583
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,590
I get it, I get it.

584
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,790
That's called "playing get to hard."

585
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,750
No, that's not right.

586
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,790
"Playing hard."

587
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,130
Why does that sound so awkward?

588
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:38,830
"Playing..."

589
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,680
"Playing hard to get."

590
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,450
"Playing hard to get."

591
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,880
Yes, "playing hard to get."

592
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,960
Once the pursued party

593
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,680
realizes their feelings,

594
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,440
the relationship

595
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,160
progresses rapidly.

596
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,830
Well said.

597
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,110
But I'm telling you,

598
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,380
I'm not doing this
just for my own selfish reasons.

599
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,250
I'm doing it

600
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,310
to get the Sun Blade
and rescue our people.

601
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,140
Of course.

602
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,070
Saintess,
you're willing to sacrifice yourself

603
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,400
for Shengyue Sect.

604
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,990
The price is too high.

605
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,600
By the way, the Sun Blade

606
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,310
should still be in Yunmen.

607
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,400
Although I hate those old geezers
always preaching

608
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,050
about virtue and righteousness,

609
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,450
I still have to make a trip

610
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,400
to Yunmen.

611
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,110
Saintess, thank you.

612
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,160
Don't forget to escort
Miss Yang to Chen's Mansion.

613
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,960
Yes, Mr. Yang.

614
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,030
Where are you going, Mr. Yang?

615
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,890
I want to go too.

616
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,750
Miss Yang.

617
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,550
Mr. Yang has something to take care of.

618
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,530
Remember to come with me
to Chen's Mansion today

619
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,840
to clear up the misunderstanding
with Mrs. Chen

620
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,040
and put an end to this.

621
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,480
Miss Yang?

622
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,680
Miss Yang?

623
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,010
Are you even listening to me?

624
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,880
What misunderstanding?

625
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,010
Kill them all and there won't be
any misunderstandings.

626
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,350
Is it just the two of us going?

627
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,640
Mrs. Chen is pretty scary.
I'm kind of afraid of her.

628
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,550
I think

629
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,920
Mr. Yang should be there too.

630
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,030
Don't worry.

631
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,610
I'm a disciple of Yunmen, after all.

632
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,310
Mrs. Chen wouldn't dare
do anything to you.

633
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,750
How can I not worry?

634
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,720
You saw it—

635
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,190
she tried to kill me
with a blade that day.

636
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,240
I'm getting a bit hungry.

637
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,880
Why don't we grab a bite
before heading out?

638
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,400
He barely had a few drinks.

639
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,310
How is he already this drunk?

640
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,830
[Yanyu Tower]

641
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,400
Yang Laoqi's house
is on the south side of town.

642
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,350
It's a bit out of the way.

643
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,070
I don't see

644
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,680
his niece very often.

645
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,110
Mrs. Zhang is closer to them.

646
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,550
If you want to know anything,

647
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,440
just ask her.

648
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,920
Actually, I'm not very familiar
with Yang Laoqi either.

649
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,110
I've only seen Yang Wangyue
two or three times.

650
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,920
Her name is Yang Wangyue,

651
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,390
just like the Saintess of Shengyue Sect.

652
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,670
So people in town don't really like her.

653
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,490
Yeah, she usually doesn't come out much.

654
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,830
I heard Yang Laoqi
used to be in Shengyue Sect.

655
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,470
Is that true?

656
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,510
I really don't know about that.

657
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,340
That Yang Laoqi

658
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,190
truly isn't a decent person.

659
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,830
Mr. Yang,

660
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,310
please don't misunderstand.

661
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,040
There's only

662
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,570
one bad egg around here.

663
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,880
The rest of us

664
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,090
have nothing to do with Shengyue Sect.

665
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,700
I don't mean to criticize.

666
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,130
Joining Shengyue Sect was his own choice

667
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,790
and has nothing to do with you.

668
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,590
He's just a lazy good-for-nothing

669
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,050
who never learned a thing.

670
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,440
In the end, he actually sold his niece off

671
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,550
as a concubine for money.

672
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,440
What a sin.

673
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,640
Where is Yang Laoqi now?

674
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,710
After taking Master Chen's money,
he disappeared.

675
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,770
Who knows where he's messing around?

676
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,370
From what I've seen of Yang Wangyue,

677
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,880
she doesn't seem like the type of girl
who stays cooped up at home all the time.

678
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,110
Are you sure she's Yang Wangyue?

679
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,240
Definitely. I've seen her several times.

680
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,160
She's Yang Laoqi's niece.

681
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,560
After she was sold,

682
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,780
she tried to kill herself a few times.

683
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,320
If I hadn't led people down to the bottom
of the cliff to find her,

684
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,320
she probably would have been taken
by wolves long ago.

685
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,200
Yang Wangyue?

686
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,030
Yang Qing?

687
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,680
Why did you come from over there?

688
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,750
This is my home.

689
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,790
Why are you here?

690
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,430
I'm here waiting for you.

691
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,000
-Didn't you and Jiang Yan went to...
-Yes.

692
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,720
I came to tell you about this.

693
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,270
Jiang Yan had promised

694
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,880
to accompany me to Master Chen's mansion

695
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,310
to resolve our conflicts,

696
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,350
but he got drunk

697
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,950
and couldn't be woken up.

698
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,270
Since he can't go,

699
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,240
I had no choice but to come find you.

700
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,590
If you step in,

701
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,990
this matter can surely be resolved
immediately.

702
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,390
No time like the present.

703
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,840
Let's go now.

704
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,720
Why are you looking at me like that?

705
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,480
Miss Yang, you're lying.

706
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,750
Jiang Yan is not one
to overindulge in drinking.

707
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,000
Wait, wait.

708
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,500
Miss Yang, is there anything else?

709
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,040
It's fine if you don't come with me
to Chen's Mansion,

710
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,920
but we're going the same way.

711
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,120
Let's walk together.

712
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,690
Going the same way?

713
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,139
Chen's Mansion is that way,

714
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,340
I'm heading this way.

715
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,110
We're not going the same way.

716
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,110
You're investigating
the missing children case, right?

717
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,710
You're going that way

718
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,969
to talk to the district leader, right?

719
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,370
I'm going to see the district leader too.

720
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,590
I know him very well.

721
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,480
If you want to ask him anything,

722
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,550
I can help you.

723
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,770
I promise he won't hold anything back.

724
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,400
Where did you

725
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,070
hear all this?

726
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,690
A group of prestigious Yunmen disciples
showed up in this town

727
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,360
and have stayed for quite some time.

728
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,290
You must be on some kind of mission.

729
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,550
I think

730
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,440
the only thing that could alert Yunmen

731
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,100
is the missing children case.

732
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,070
Am I right?

733
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,600
Seems like you know quite a bit

734
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,640
about Yunmen.

735
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,920
That's not the kind of insight

736
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,210
a simple village girl would have.

737
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,550
Actually,

738
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
I've admired Yunmen for a long time.

739
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,300
Thanks for your kindness,

740
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,360
but we're really not going the same way.

741
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,820
I'm not going to see the district leader.

742
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,880
Stop following me.

743
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,830
Alright, alright.

744
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,460
I shouldn't have gotten you drunk.

745
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,750
I'm here to apologize.

746
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,050
I promised Yang Qing

747
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,990
I'd help you investigate the case.

748
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,400
But...

749
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,210
You're just a girl

750
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,800
and don't know martial arts.

751
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,840
I grew up here.

752
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
No one knows this area better than me.

753
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,170
With my help on the investigation,

754
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,500
it will definitely be twice as effective.

755
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,010
Jiang Yan.

756
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,290
Mr. Yang.

757
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,920
Mr. Yang.

758
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,200
We're going to Yanyu Tower.

759
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,380
We?

760
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,590
Miss Yang, you want me to go with you?

761
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,760
Yes.

762
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,340
You called me a bad guy

763
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,690
and spoke harshly to me.

764
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,830
But I have a good heart

765
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,280
and can't stand seeing people suffer.

766
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,810
When I heard you wanted
to give Jiang Yan a task,

767
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,940
I wanted to help him.

768
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,840
You want to say I misunderstood you

769
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,110
and that I should comfort you

770
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,840
by granting one of your wishes.

771
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,270
But I never asked you
to go to Yanyu Tower.

772
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,530
You offered yourself.

773
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,130
So I won't be joining you.

774
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,590
Come on.

775
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,630
All that talk about his good temper
and noble character

776
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,360
is all lies.

777
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,840
Miss Yang,

778
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,170
your offer to help me was just a pretense.

779
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,020
What you really want
is to stick to Mr. Yang

780
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,150
all the time, right?

781
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,100
Let's go.

782
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,430
Wang Yue?

783
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,730
Here, keep this.

784
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,550
Come, take a look!

785
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,240
Yang Wangyue.

786
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,340
Yang Wangyue, are you really...

787
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,420
Mr. Yang?

788
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:08,920
You...

789
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,710
You guys...

790
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,260
Mr. Yang...

791
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,340
No need to explain!

792
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,920
Wait, you...

793
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,550
You're stepping on my book.

794
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,900
Are you using the methods
in this book to tease me?

795
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,670
Am I just someone for you to toy with?

796
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,150
It's...

797
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,550
Mr. Yang,

798
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,960
-let me explain.
-Miss.

799
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,610
You've ruined my book.

800
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,530
Now I can't sell it.

801
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,540
What do you say we do about that?

802
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,550
Is your book more important
than my business?

803
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,550
This is the personal reflection

804
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,110
written by the Saintess of Shengyue Sect.

805
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,210
It's very precious.

806
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,240
A new book
by the Saintess of Shengyue Sect?

807
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,480
But didn't she already die?

808
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,080
She wrote it before she died.

809
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,170
It's a posthumous work. Understand?

810
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,440
A new book?

811
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,930
She wrote a lot of books?

812
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,700
Why do I remember
that she only wrote one book?

813
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,520
Of course it's more than just one.

814
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,390
Miss, what do you say

815
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,590
we do about this book?

816
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,600
I'll buy it.

817
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,410
Jiang Yan, pay for it.

818
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,140
Miss Yang!

819
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,680
I bought the book for you.

820
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,510
Um, can we talk about something?

821
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,590
After you finish reading it,

822
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,960
could you lend it to me?

823
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,630
Fine.

824
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,800
Oh, make sure you hide it well.

825
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,280
Don't let Mr. Yang see it.

826
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,530
Didn't he just see it?

827
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
My child!

828
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,280
Give me back my child!

829
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,690
My child!

830
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,310
Mom!

831
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,840
Give me back my child!

832
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,110
My child!

833
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,920
Mom!

834
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,690
Give me back my child!

835
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,250
I'm begging you!

836
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,390
I'm Jiang Yan from Yunmen.

837
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,430
Surrender now!

838
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,360
Miss Yang.

839
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,880
This is...

840
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,880
This is the emblem of Shengyue Sect.

841
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,670
You know it?

842
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,170
My uncle has that emblem
on his clothing too.

843
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,480
Take the child home first.
I have something to take care of.

844
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,440
What's this?

845
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,800
I remember one of our sect's teachings

846
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,780
is that we must never bully

847
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,760
the elderly, the weak, women, or children.

848
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,710
Who has the nerve to steal a child

849
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,000
right under my nose?

850
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,070
It's fake.

851
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,920
Saintess, take a look.

852
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,890
This is the emblem of our sect.

853
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,480
First of all,

854
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,350
the emblem of our sect

855
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,920
is a mark of status.

856
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,360
They're

857
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,170
hand-embroidered by experienced artisans—

858
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,630
only 10 can be made per day.

859
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,840
Now look at this.

860
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,000
It's rough

861
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,020
and lacks detail.

862
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,490
Also,

863
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,710
the new version of our sect's emblem

864
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,150
uses the latest embroidery techniques,

865
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,480
incorporating hidden threads
to create a subtle raised effect.

866
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,610
Now look at this one.

867
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,040
Hidden threads?

868
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,250
Subtle raised effect?

869
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,810
It's obviously fake.

870
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,550
So you're saying

871
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,480
someone is impersonating our sect

872
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,880
to commit evil deeds?

873
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,250
Who dares to be so despicable?

874
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,620
Exactly.

875
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,040
However, Saintess,

876
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,590
you've been

877
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,440
staying in Mount Yin all these years.

878
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,150
You have no idea about these things.

879
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,920
Last year,

880
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,300
the Four Beauties of Qingcheng
were robbed.

881
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,160
Qingcheng Sect

882
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,680
spread rumors that

883
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,110
Chief Yuan was behind it.

884
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,160
Oh my goodness!

885
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:19,960
Chief Yuan

886
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,990
hasn't been down the mountain for years.

887
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,790
And there's the second disciple

888
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,480
of Cangtong Sect—

889
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,990
he's been obsessed with medicine for years

890
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,920
and insisted on retiring
to practice medicine.

891
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,010
His master couldn't keep his own disciple,

892
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,470
yet claimed he was bewitched

893
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,400
by Lingyin, the Water Hall Master.

894
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,760
Good grief!

895
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,410
How could Lingyin possibly have

896
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,300
the compassionate heart of a healer?

897
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,160
And the most ridiculous thing is,

898
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,680
over the past year,

899
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,800
there've been tons of pointless novels

900
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,710
about you chasing your lover

901
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,880
and what happened after you won him over.

902
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,940
Do you understand?

903
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:53,880
Just...

904
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,320
Anyway, they're just

905
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,920
a bunch of pointless novels.

906
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,670
They claim these were written
by the Saintess of Shengyue Sect.

907
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,870
How is that possible?

908
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,260
How are they pointless?

909
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,770
Have you read them?

910
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,360
Are they really written by you?

911
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,370
Of course not.

912
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,890
Don't change the subject.

913
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,480
This is clearly a frame-up.

914
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,630
Yes.

915
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,560
Well...

916
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,190
But Saintess,

917
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,980
that's how things
have been in recent years.

918
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,310
And Chief Yuan never bothered to explain.

919
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,620
Later, I thought it over
and realized she was right.

920
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,860
To explain is to cover up,

921
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,470
and to cover up is to admit the truth.

922
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,440
No point discussing the ocean with a toad.

923
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,480
But how many times

924
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,350
have we taken the blame
for the righteous sects?

925
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,410
You know that as well as I do.

926
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,490
Even if Yuan Yingxing explained,

927
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,080
would those people listen?

928
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,260
All these years,

929
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,300
we've been taking the fall for them.

930
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:47,760
No.

931
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,640
I can't let Yang Qing think we did this.

932
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,700
I must tell him.

933
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,050
She really has a quick temper.

934
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,710
[Tianlin Garden]

935
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,320
Jiang Yan,

936
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,770
today we searched

937
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,670
the warehouse at Chen's Mansion
that you found suspicious

938
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,670
and found many children's clothes.

939
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,940
Looks like the kidnapped kids

940
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,160
were once held there.

941
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,800
We came too late.

942
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,570
That person in black you caught
on the road today

943
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,710
had Shengyue Sect's emblem on him, right?

944
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,570
From what I see,

945
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,030
this matter is most likely
linked to Shengyue Sect.

946
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:20,560
Exactly.

947
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,510
Have you heard?

948
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,630
Shengyue Sect

949
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,950
is truly sinister.

950
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,000
They say that Wang Yue, their Saintess,

951
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,800
transforms on full moon nights.

952
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,130
Their Chief, Yuan Yingxing,
is said to be bloodthirsty.

953
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,990
There's also a Water Hall Master,

954
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,620
a woman

955
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,960
over 70

956
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,970
who still looks like a young girl.

957
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,960
They say the reason she stays youthful

958
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,530
is that she eats children.

959
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,420
So sinister?

960
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,360
What happened today

961
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,020
wasn't done by Shengyue Sect.

962
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,660
Miss Yang?

963
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:49,760
Why are you here?

964
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:52,110
Those men in black
aren't from Shengyue Sect.

965
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,550
The missing people have nothing to do
with them either.

966
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,800
But everyone saw

967
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,960
Shengyue Sect's emblem
on those men's clothes.

968
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,670
It's definitely related to them.

969
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,000
Those emblems are fake.

970
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,150
What?

971
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,210
How do you know?

972
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,360
Do you have any evidence?

973
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
It's none of your business.

974
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,350
I just know.

975
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,760
But without evidence,

976
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,960
how can we believe you?

977
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,290
Yeah, you have no proof.

978
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,110
Exactly. You need to show some evidence.
