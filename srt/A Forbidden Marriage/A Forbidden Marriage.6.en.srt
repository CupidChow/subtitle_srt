00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,950
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,160
Come here.

4
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,789
How could you teach our Shengyue Sect's

5
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,310
mental technique to Yang Qing?

6
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,680
If the Yunmen Sect ever turns against us,

7
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,590
we'll be at their mercy.

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,840
It's fine, it's fine.

9
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,120
If he dares to betray me,

10
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,470
I'll kill him just the same.

11
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:08,740
I...

12
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,900
Can I still be saved?

13
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,050
Though the poison has reached your organs,

14
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,590
your special mental technique
is protecting you

15
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,400
by reversing your qi flow,

16
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,910
temporarily slowing its spread.

17
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,490
Combined with my acupuncture,

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,320
your condition appears stable.

19
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,630
However, the poison remains in your body

20
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,550
and hasn't been fully removed.

21
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,810
How can we remove it completely?

22
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,200
It's not exactly hard,

23
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,150
but it's not simple either.

24
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,010
It will take nine days,

25
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,430
using five extremely potent yang herbs

26
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,090
to counteract the extremely yin
Ghost Scent poison.

27
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,329
Luckily, you ran into me, Mr. Yang.

28
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,910
Otherwise, even with this prescription,

29
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,470
without knowing the proper dosage,

30
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,800
one would still not be able to
cure the Ghost Scent.

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,680
Since there's a cure,

32
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,079
what are you waiting for?

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,630
You think I don't want to save
your lover quickly?

34
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,360
Preparing the cure takes time.

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
Alright, rest assured.

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,040
If others were poisoned by Ghost Scent,

37
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,360
they would certainly die.

38
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,330
But your lover's got me,

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,380
so don't worry.

40
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,120
Saving one or saving a few
makes no difference.

41
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,710
Miss Lingyin, since you've already
lent a hand,

42
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,870
could you also do me another favor

43
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,030
and help cure the rest of
the Yunmen disciples?

44
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,420
Mr. Yang, if you weren't Yue's friend,

45
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,750
I wouldn't care whether you lived or died.

46
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,300
Besides,

47
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,840
diagnosing patients
and preparing medicine takes a lot of energy.

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,040
I cannot help you with

49
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,000
this favor of yours.

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,750
When my sect is in trouble,

51
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,550
how can I stand by and do nothing?

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,450
Miss Lingyin, do you really
refuse to help?

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Lingyin, why are you being so petty?

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,170
It's just saving a few more people.

55
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,400
I'll agree on her behalf.

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,060
We'll help.

57
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,710
That won't do.

58
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,910
Not unless Miss Lingyin agrees on her own.

59
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,470
I won't force her.

60
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,290
Miss Lingyin, if you...

61
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,360
Alright, alright,

62
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,930
you got what you wanted, so quit the act.

63
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,450
I'll help you save them.

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,930
Thank you very much.

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,090
Yes, My Lady.

Jin Buhuan told me

72
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,310
[Lu Jin, Chief of the Biluo Valley]

73
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,870
that he could kill Yuan Yingxing
this time.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,240
He always talks big,

75
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,240
yet time and again,

76
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
he has failed to kill Yuan Yingxing.

77
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,840
Yuan Yingxing

78
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,090
is a chief who fought his way up
from a pile of corpses.

79
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,830
He's not to be underestimated.

80
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,290
The Six Harmonies Palm technique
originated from the Shengyue Sect,

81
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,970
but they issued strict orders

82
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,720
prohibiting their disciples
from practicing it.

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,070
So this technique has been lost
within the Shengyue Sect,

84
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,670
but there's no guarantee

85
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,210
Yuan Yingxing doesn't have the manual.

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,120
If he masters this technique,

87
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,360
he'll become my greatest threat.

88
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,190
This man

89
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,090
must not be left alive.

90
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,100
Then we'll see if Jin Buhuan
has what it takes

91
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,690
to eliminate Yuan Yingxing.

92
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,620
If he can't do it,

93
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,750
what use is keeping him around?

94
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,190
Enough about him.

95
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,320
How are the preparations

96
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,140
for the sacrificial offerings
coming along?

97
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,950
We must not let the Yunmen disciples
continue their investigation.

98
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,310
Jin Buhuan made sure all Yunmen disciples
were poisoned with Ghost Scent.

99
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,970
Now they're busy detoxifying

100
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,720
and can't spare the effort.

101
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,280
This gives us time

102
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,720
to collect the offerings

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
and send them back to Biluo Valley.

104
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,510
How many children do we still need?

105
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,150

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,970
"Rest assured?"

You're the one I worry about the most!

113
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,000
I know you have feelings for Yang Qing,

114
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,510
but you cannot disobey my orders

115
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,020
by secretly instructing people

116
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,530
not to hunt down Yang Qing!

please don't go after him.

119
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,230
I promise I'll keep Biluo Valley's
secret from him.

120
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,460
If he comes to investigate again,

121
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,260
I'll make sure he finds nothing.

122
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,190
Please, don't harm him.

123
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,250
Do you think this is the time

124

125
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,000
Remember,

126
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,330
anyone who stands in my way

127
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,040
cannot be spared.

128
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,740
I understand, Father.

129
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,610
Tomorrow, I'll go to the inn to visit
the Yunmen disciples,

130
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,130
under the pretext of checking on
their condition

131

while keeping a close watch on them.

132
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,750

This doctor seems suspicious.

138
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,260
How could a regular doctor

139
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,520
take a pulse like that?

140
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
Doctor, I'm not feeling well either!

What?

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,240
If you don't undress,

147
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,600
how can I examine you properly?

148
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,000
But...

149
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,720

They're not coughing,

Actually, I'm feeling a bit better now.

It's just that I've never heard of

That doesn't matter. I can cure it.

187
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,120
Who gave you the nerve to mess with
our Yunmen Sect?

188
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
What's your true motive?

189
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,870
Shang Huai.

190
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,320
Look at all of you, half-dead from poison.

191
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,610
What could possibly be worth scheming for?

192
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,910
I don't care what sorcery you used

193
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,040
to bewitch Mr. Yang.

194
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,020
I would rather cut my own throat

195
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,870
than let an evil woman like you,

196
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,870
who kidnaps children to practice
evil arts, treat me.

197
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,360
I'd rather die

198
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,330
than tarnish the righteous name
of our sect!

199
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, Yang Qing,

200
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,170
where did you find this piece of work?

201
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,960
Even making up stories about

202
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,420
kidnapping children to practice evil arts?

203
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,790
Shang Huai, put your sword down.

204
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,750
Who said she's a demoness?

205
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,510
Mr. Yang, she calls herself Lingyin,
the Demonic Healer,

206
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,030
and she behaves erratically,

207
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,960
and she's been rude to our juniors.

208
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,000
So what if I am? So what if I'm not?

209
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,360
Kill me,

210
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,440
and no one else will be able to
cure your poison.

211
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,670
Sister.

212
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,990
Alright, I'm finished teasing you all.

213
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,410
I'm Miss Yang's...

214
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,790
cousin.

215
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,070
My name is Lin Yin,

216
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,720
spelled L-I-N

217
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,870
Y-I-N.

218
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,890
I'm just a good person.

219
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,330
You're Lin Yin.

220
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,120
Then why did you tease us
for so long just now?

221
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,240
I didn't say anything.

222
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,240
You suspected me from the very beginning.

223
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,360
Those who want to condemn others
will always find an excuse.

224
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,240
Besides,

225
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,720
what's wrong with the Shengyue Sect?

226
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,290
Can't they practice medicine
and save lives?

227
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,410
But they all kill people
for their cultivation.

228
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,870
They're hardly healers who help
the world, right?

229
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,330
Regarding killing people for cultivation,

230
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,010
I heard it's been ages

231
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,070
since they did anything like that.

232
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,740
Besides,

233
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,020
where did you hear about this, Mr. Jiang?

234
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,560
But everyone in the martial world says so.

235
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,640
"The martial world?"

236
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,720
I can't believe

237
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,440
you Yunmen disciples

238
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,960
would also believe such baseless rumors.

239
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,840
But you don't have evidence

240
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,470
proving the Shengyue Sect didn't
commit those evil deeds, do you?

241
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,930
Enough.

242
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,120
I invited Miss Lin here
to cure our poison,

243
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,400
not to argue with you.

244
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,080
Shang Huai, apologize to Miss Lin.

245
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,400
I'm sorry, Miss Lin.

246
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,750
My senior and I spoke out of turn.

247
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,370
Alright.

248
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,770
Since you're not bad-looking,

249
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,870
I'll let it slide this time.

250
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,140
Senior. I heard you found a way to cure...

251
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,000
You...

252
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,320
Lingyin?

253
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,120
Why are you here?

254
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,010
She...

255
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,520
Ms. Yao, you know Miss Lin too?

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,750
Junior Yao.

257
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,520
We've only met once.

258
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,870
I'm tired today.

259
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,100
The rest

260
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,150
can wait till tomorrow.

261
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,910
Yue,

262
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,870
why is that woman, Yao Fu, here?

263
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,360
Didn't you try to take her down?

264
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,630
Of course I tried,

265
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,240
but right now I'm no match for her.

266
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,320
Fighting her would only backfire.

267
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,910
Besides,

268
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,670
Yang Qing told me not to harm her,

269
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,800
so my hands are tied.

270
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
You just do whatever Yang Qing says?

271
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,720
Yue,

272
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,550
she killed you once.

273
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,840
I will definitely avenge that,

274
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,910
just not now.

275
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,910
I can't afford to fall out
with the Yunmen Sect.

276
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,030
Fan Hao told me

277
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,440
Yuan Yingxing is imprisoned
in Biluo Valley's dungeon,

278
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,510
and only Yunmen's Sun Blade
can rescue him.

279
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,000
So,

280
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,730
I have to stick with them
to get the Sun Blade.

281
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,510
So that's why

282
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,590
you're following Yang Qing and them.

283
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,400
But I think

284
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,840
there's more to it.

285
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,730
You also want to continue
pursuing Yang Qing, don't you?

286
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,480
Yue.

287
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,400
You wouldn't be like the Chief—

288
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,270
falling for someone from Yunmen

289
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,930
and abandoning us—would you?

290
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,360
Of course not.

291
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,000
I will definitely get my revenge.

292
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,670
I will deal with Yao Fu.

293
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,270
I can't make a move on her, but you can.

294
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,600
Find a chance

295
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
to pay back that sword strike for me.

296
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,700
Okay, leave it to me.

297
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,200
While you're detoxifying
the Yunmen Sect's disciples these days,

298
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,390
Yang Qing won't cause me any trouble.

299
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,540
It's the perfect opportunity

300
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,610
for me to ask him about the Sun Blade.

301
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,290
If you ask me,

302
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,970
you're planning to kill
two birds with one stone—

303
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,540
mixing business with pleasure, aren't you?

304
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,950
Impressive, Senior.

305
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,340
You even managed to find Lingyin
to cure the poison.

306
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Do they know that the person curing them

307
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,030
is the notorious Demonic Healer
of the Shengyue Sect?

308
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,150
The most important thing right now
is to cure the poison,

309
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,750
isn't it?

310
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,400
Have you ever thought about

311
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,790
how the junior disciples would feel

312
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,580
when they learned

313
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,320
that the one who saved them

314
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,600
has countless innocent lives on her hands

315
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
and is the Demonic Healer they've vowed

316
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,240
to eliminate?

317
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,750
If they're not cured,

318
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,390
they won't live long enough
to feel anything.

319
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,850
I'm not saying we shouldn't
cure the poison,

320
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,980
but we should keep our distance

321
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,130
from the Shengyue Sect's members.

322
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,990
Whether it's Lingyin or Wang Yue,

323
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,860
they're ultimately a threat.

324
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,120
Once the poison is cured,

325
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,240
we should let Miss Lingyin
and Miss Wang Yue

326
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,170
go their own way.

327
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,240
I have my own considerations
about this matter.

328
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,040
You don't need to worry, Junior.

329
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,720
Senior,

330
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,390
getting involved with people
from the Shengyue Sect

331
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,050
never leads to anything good.

332
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,010
Are you referring to yourself
and Yuan Yingxing?

333
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,870
I'm giving you friendly advice,

334
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,670
but if you won't listen, so be it.

335
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,370
As for Yuan Yingxing and me,

336
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,970
you needn't concern yourself with it.

337
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,800
Mr. Yang.

338
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,859
Thank you for curing the poison,

339
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,880
and thank your... cousin for her help.

340
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,030
It's nothing.

341
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,960
She enjoys studying these things anyway,

342
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,619
so it's good practice for her.

343
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,160
If you really want to thank me...

344
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,400
why not join me for a drink?

345
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,050
I've prepared some nice food and wine,

346
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,850
and drinking alone is so boring.

347
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,440
Okay.

348
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,510
Please.

349
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,610
Have a seat.

350
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,640
Anyone not

351
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,540
from our Shengyue Sect
will become intoxicated

352
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,890
after just two cups of Chenxiang Wine.

353
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,830
No matter how tight-lipped Yang Qing is,

354
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,830
I guarantee he'll spill everything.

355
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,310
Yue,

356
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,450
we'll depend on you
to extract information

357
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,060
about the Sun Blade's whereabouts
from him.

358
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:13,690
Come on.

359
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,800
Yang Qing,

360
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,150
this first cup is for you.

361
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,850
If it weren't for you,

362
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,710
I would've been beaten to death
by Master Chen.

363
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,160
Didn't he end up dead instead?

364
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,750
I don't know why I'm so hard
to kill either.

365
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,120
Then...

366
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,040
then this cup is to our survival
against all odds.

367
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,400
Okay,

368
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,740
to our survival against all odds.

369
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,620
The second cup...

370
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,400
is to...

371
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,920
to our everlasting love.

372
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,770
Love?

373
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,810
Friendship, then.

374
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,800
Come, have some food.

375
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,270
Okay.

376
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,040
Thank you.

377
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,250
Cheers.

378
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Miss Yang, let me toast to you.

379
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,640
Okay.

380
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,590
What's wrong?

381
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,230
You're a girl.

382
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,500
You shouldn't be too forward toward men.

383
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,520
You should be more reserved.

384
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,160
I...

385
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,240
I...

386
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,580
I'm only not reserved with you.

387
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,680
Miss Yang.

388
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,150
You're so forward toward me.

389
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,480
My heart...

390
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,030
flutters.

391
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,420
What...

392
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,350
what do you mean by that?

393
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,550
You... you're already falling
for me, right?

394
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,200
You like me, right?

395
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,400
Yang Qing, oh, Yang Qing,

396
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,430
you always act so proper.

397
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,410
Turns out you've been hiding
your feelings quite well.

398
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,360
Right,

399
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,600
now isn't the time for this.

400
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,790
Yang Qing.

401
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,780
Where is...

402
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,550
where is your Yunmen Sect's Sun Blade?

403
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,070
The Sun Blade...

404
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,360
Where is it?

405
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,670
The Sun Blade is... is...

406
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,210
Wait... well...

407
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,030
he barely drank much. How is he so drunk?

408
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,060
Even though I didn't learn
the Sun Blade's whereabouts from him,

409
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,610
sharing a bed with him

410
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,290
wasn't such a bad outcome.

411
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,220
What...

412
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,860
Even if it's him,

413
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,530
when he's drunk, he is just
a smelly drunk man.

414
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,750
Forget it, forget it.

415
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,610
I should find another chance
to share a bed with him.

416
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,590
Mr. Yang!

417
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,610
Isn't this Miss Yang's room?

418
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,970
Mr. Yang, why are you...

419
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,690
When I woke up this morning,

420
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,650
I had some questions about detoxification,

421
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,050
so I came to ask Miss Yang.

422
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,060
Detoxification...

423
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,290
Shouldn't you be asking
Miss Lin about that?

424
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,080
Right,

425
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,880
after Miss Lin treated you yesterday,

426
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,480
how are you feeling today?

427
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,110
Mr. Yang,

428
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,310
that Miss Lin really has some skill.

429
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,280
After taking the medicine yesterday,

430
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,410
I tried circulating my internal energy
this morning,

431
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,210
and I felt almost no discomfort.

432
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:12,970
Mr. Yang,

433
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,000
does this mean

434
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,480
our poison is mostly cured?

435
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,960
You have strong cultivation
and were only lightly poisoned,

436
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,420
so you recovered quickly.

437
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,580
But there's still some residual toxin
in your body.

438
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,480
It'll take at least nine more days

439
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,880
to fully clear the poison
from your system.

440
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,110
Nine more days?

441
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,170
Mr. Yang,

442
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,880
we've been away from the sect
for too long.

443
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,680
The Sect Leader will surely blame us
when we return.

444
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,870
This was my fault.

445
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,100
When we return,

446
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,070
I'll explain everything to the Sect Leader

447
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,500
and take full responsibility
for the consequences.

448
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,560
Alright, alright,

449
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,200
you're recovering faster than anyone else.

450
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,240
As for the others,

451
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,510
they'll be lucky just to wake up today.

452
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,390
Oh, right,

453
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,830
Yue has prepared some hangover soup

454
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,290
and wants you to have some.

455
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,580
Hangover soup?

456
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,750
Mr. Yang, don't you usually avoid alcohol?

457
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,890
This room reeks of alcohol...

458
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,490
Oh, right!

459
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,120
How are Ling Xiao and the others?

460
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,920
I'll go check on them.

461
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,510
Okay.

462
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,350
Miss Lin.

463
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,460
When will you have time today

464
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,060
to detoxify my fellow disciples?

465
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,170
What's the rush?

466
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,400
I'll get to it when I'm done here.

467
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,000
Don't worry, they won't die.

468
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,530
Yue can't touch you.

469
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,960
But I can, can't I?

470
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,280
Drink it and die.

471
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,090
Crap your guts out.

472
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,570
Retch your soul out.

473
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,260
Crap your guts out.

474
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,720
It's fine if you don't eat or drink,

475
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,010
but I bet you can't stay awake forever.

476
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,030
You vicious, evil woman.

477
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,970
You bullied Yue,

478
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,750
and you think you can get away with it?

479
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,590
Dream on.

480
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,240
Today,

481
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,040
I'll make you walk in here

482
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,330
and get carried out.

483
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,070
Waiter!

484
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,420
You're finally here.

485
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,240
Um,

486
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,510
my room's out of water.

487
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,110
Could you bring me some more?

488
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:06,840
Well,

489
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,640
I'm getting hungry too,

490
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,590
so just give me this tray of food.

491
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,010
Miss Lin, please wait.

492
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,430
This meal was ordered by Miss Yao.

493
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,890
I'll come serve you
after I deliver it to her.

494
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,270
That Yao woman isn't even here,

495
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,010
so what if you give it to me?

496
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,810
Well...

497
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,400
Waiter.

498
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,300
Last night, while I slept,

499
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,500
the window kept creaking.

500
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,180
I couldn't sleep well.

501
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,130
Can you help me switch to another room?

502
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,270
Sure, sure.

503
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,210
I think, why don't we...

504
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,750
Jiang Yan, come up here for a moment.

505
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,640
Okay!

506
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,710
Ms. Yao.

507
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,600
I didn't sleep very well in my room.

508
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,090
Could you switch rooms with me?

509
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,220
No problem, Ms. Yao.

510
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,250
Go ahead.

511
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,240
Yes.

512
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,410
Listen, Miss Yao,

513
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,030
aren't you embarrassed?

514
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,420
As a senior,

515
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,640
shouldn't you be taking care
of your juniors?

516
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,200
You're uncomfortable in your room,

517
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,230
so you make your junior take it.

518
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,360
How can you be so inconsiderate?

519
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,960
It's nothing, it's nothing.

520
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,740
As juniors,

521
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,240
it's only right that we show respect
to our seniors.

522
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,790
Besides,

523
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,410
I usually sleep like a rock.

524
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,680
This small issue doesn't matter to me.

525
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,060
How do you know it's a small issue?

526
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,660
What if...

527
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,880
Could there possibly be a serious problem?

528
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,960
I mean...

529
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,880
I'm just speaking up for your juniors.

530
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,370
As a heroine of the Yunmen Sect,

531
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,410
you treat your juniors so harshly.

532
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,050
Miss Lin, your kindness is appreciated.

533
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,880
It's just

534
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,420
that I'm really okay with it.

535
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,550
Ms. Yao has always been very good to us.

536
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,610
We appreciate

537
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,120
your concern, Miss Lin.

538
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,640
If you're truly so worried

539
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
about our junior disciples,

540
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,400
why don't you hurry and detoxify them?

541
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:18,820
Yes, indeed.

542
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,230
Junior Ling Xiao still hasn't woken up.

543
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,320
Miss Lin, please attend to them.

544
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,190
I think we should do this:

545
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,030
Miss Lin can't manage everything alone.

546
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,630
Jiang Yan,

547
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,310
you'll assist Miss Lin these days,

548
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,160
and make sure you're always by her side,

549
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,830
ready to follow her instructions
at any time.

550
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,640
Understood?

551
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:40,980
Understood.

552
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,830
Miss Lin, whatever you need,

553
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,830
just say the word.

554
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,880
Besides preparing the antidote
for our fellow disciples,

555
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,680
I'll also have to trouble you...

556
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,870
to prepare another remedy.

557
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,460
Another remedy?

558
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,680
Ms. Yao, you've been poisoned too?

559
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,240
It's not for me

560
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,810
but for the staff who clean the rooms.

561
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,740
This room

562
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,400
has to be thoroughly cleaned

563
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,660
before you can move in.

564
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,000
Am I right, Miss Lin?

565
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,550
Fine, you win.

566
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,890
Although she agreed to help us,

567
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,420
she's unpredictable and hard to deal with,

568
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,680
so we have to be on guard.

569
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,310
You must keep a close eye on her
these next few days,

570
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,040
understood?

571
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,200
Yes, Ms. Yao.

572
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,960
Ms. Yao, but I don't think Miss Lin

573
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,990
seems like someone with ill intentions.

574
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,600
Oh, you.

575
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,890
The sect has really raised you
to be too naive.

576
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,610
Ms. Yao, I'll keep a very close watch
on her.

577
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,640
Go now.

578
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,270
Jin Buhuan has already made
all the arrangements?

579
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,440
He plans to set an inescapable trap
outside Biluo Valley,

580
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,240
ensuring that Yuan Yingxing
meets a gruesome end.

581
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,230
Big words.

582
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,090
Yuan Yingxing isn't so easy to deal with.

583
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,150
He intends to lure Yuan Yingxing there

584
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,590
under the pretense of rescuing
sect members,

585
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,200
hoping to lower his guard.

586
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,140
Good.

587
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'd like to see

588
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,880
if he's actually capable of
pulling this off.

589
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,220
At a time like this,

590
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,890
how can you still be
in the mood for drinking?

591
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,020
The people from Biluo Valley

592
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,150
are actually going to make a move
against Yuan Yingxing.

593
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,310
I'd like to help you, but you won't
let me get involved.

594
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,960
What else could I do but drink?

595
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,930
Look at those people from Biluo Valley,

596
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,550
they're likely planning to
kill Yuan Yingxing this time.

597
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,170
If Yuan Yingxing dies,

598
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,630
whether the Moon Blade falls into
Biluo Valley's hands

599
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,020
or just goes missing altogether,

600
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,620
we'll be in serious trouble.

601
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,540
So, look at you,

602
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,200
what exactly have you done to help me?

603
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,830
Why are there more and more problems?

604
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,400
You think I don't want to help?

605
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,660
But my only decent technique
is lightness skill.

606
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,150
How can I help you?

607
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,670
Aren't I providing you with information?

608
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,000
My father has been gone for so many years,

609
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,300
and all you've done is
investigate this matter?

610
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,700
Your martial arts haven't improved at all!

611
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,110
Junior, please calm down.

612
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,440
I was wrong, okay?

613
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,680
If I had known it would come to this,

614
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,870
I'd have practiced martial arts properly.

615
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,630
Let's focus.

616
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,170
What do you plan to do
about Yuan Yingxing?

617
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,190
Forget it.

618
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,890
Let's focus on gathering both the Sun
and Moon Blades first.

619
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,480
Given the current situation,

620
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,310
the top priority is to find Yuan Yingxing.

621
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,910
The Sun Blade is safe
at the Yunmen Sect anyway.

622
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,250
Senior, stop following me.

623
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,960
You're just a burden.

624
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,480
All you do is drink.

625
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,240
Did you hear what I said?

626
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,300
Stop following me.

627
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,690
What?

628
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,160
Are you watching me?

629
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,400
Are you afraid I'll tamper with
the antidote?

630
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,880
No.

631
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,330
Miss Lin, let me help you fan these.

632
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,660
Young Hero Jiang, didn't you think
I was utterly wicked

633
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,990
and beyond redemption?

634
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,980
Why so kind all of a sudden?

635
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,190
Miss Lin, you're helping cure
my fellow disciples.

636
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,300
I'm very grateful.

637
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,920
I was wrong to misjudge you that day.

638
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,750
I hope you won't take it to heart.

639
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,400
By the way, Miss Lin.

640
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,380
Ms. Yao said

641
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,440
we had all been poisoned
by the Shengyue Sect's deadly toxin,

642
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,970
which is almost incurable.

643
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,440
How do you know so much
about their poisons?

644
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,000
My family lives in Mount Yin.

645
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,610
To earn a living,

646
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,800
I used to gather herbs
for the Shengyue Sect when I was little.

647
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,520
So I know a lot about their poisons.

648
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Is that a problem?

649
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,790
Aren't you afraid of them?

650
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,790
Only people from noble sects
like yours are afraid

651
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,460
and have prejudices against them.

652
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,110
For ordinary people like us,

653
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,510
we don't care about those conflicts
in the martial world.

654
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,250
Whoever feeds us,

655
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,670
that's who we like.

656
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,250
So,

657
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,990
the Shengyue Sect is our provider.

658
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,810
Why should I be afraid?

659
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,060
Could it really be our prejudice?

660
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,220
Anyway, I don't think you're a bad person.

661
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,400
We've only just met.

662
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,440
Don't be too quick to judge,
Young Hero Jiang.

663
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,400
Look,

664
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,070
your senior, Ms. Yao, really dislikes me.

665
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,750
That's not necessarily true.

666
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,000
She is usually quite intense.

667
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,690
Besides, I have my own opinion.

668
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,760
I don't think you're capable of
doing anything bad.

669
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,540
Don't blame me for being blunt.

670
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,960
I never say this kind of stuff to anyone.

671
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,199
To be honest, deep down,

672
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,860
I look down on people like you.

673
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,280
I think those who are too naive
deserve their fate.

674
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,139
But perhaps

675
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,659
I've been around you all too much lately,

676
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,870
and I've gone soft.

677
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
So I thought I'd give you a heads-up.

678
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,310
Your personality

679
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,969
is the result of being too sheltered
by Mr. Yang.

680
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,170
In the martial world,

681
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,409
someone like you is bound to get killed.

682
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,639
Thank you, miss.

683
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,949
I'll keep your words in mind.

684
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,120
Actually, Ms. Yao

685
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,679
just told me the same thing.

686
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,030
Alright, stop standing here
with that silly grin.

687
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,520
Take those three jars over there

688
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
to your fellow disciples to drink.

689
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,580
And take this jar here to the servant boy.

690
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,560
After he drinks it, have him
clean Ms. Yao's room.

691
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,670
Okay.

692
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,440
Yue!

693
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,440
Come on, come on.

694
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,770
Hurry and get the herbs.

695
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,180
Don't miss a single herb

696
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,140
on this list.

697
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,050
Young Hero Yang, I'll have to trouble you
to go with Yue,

698
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,510
as there are too many items

699
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,410
and I'm afraid she can't
carry them all by herself.

700
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,060
Of course,

701
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,760
it's my duty anyway.

702
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,730
I've created an opportunity for you,

703
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,990
so hurry up and ask him.

704
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,320
Then hurry along

705
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,360
and come back soon.

706
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,690
Sure.

707
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,020
Yang Qing, there are so many
interesting things here!

708
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,160
Look at this,

709
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,880
Yang Qing!

710
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,800
The way you keep calling my name,

711
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,600
I'm thinking about changing it.

712
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
Oh, you,

713
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,010
you're usually so indifferent
about everything,

714
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,430
but you never discourage
others' interests.

715
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,080
So why won't you tell me about things

716
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,140
I'm curious about?

717
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
What do you think?

718
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,710
Your questions

719
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,140
are basically about whether I have
feelings for you,

720
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,760
whether I want to marry you,
and things like that.

721
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,840
They're indeed difficult for me to answer.

722
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,800
Well then...

723
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,770
let me ask you something else.

724
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,970
Could you please satisfy my curiosity?

725
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,480
What do you want to know?

726
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,720
I've heard

727
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,130
that your sect has
an unparalleled legendary weapon

728
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,550
called the Sun Blade that's one of a kind.

729
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,320
Is that true?

730
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,710
I'm just a simple village girl

731
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,890
and haven't seen much of the world.

732
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,960
Don't laugh at me.

733
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,010
I knew it.

734
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,440
