Wasn't she supposed to be grounded?

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,079
Why is she here?

18
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,160
Wasn't the Water Hall Master supposed to
be watching her?

19
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,829
Chief,

20
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,440
the Water Hall Master went out
early this morning.

21
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,230
He seems to have found a new lover.

why didn't anyone inform me

27

Do you know

36

38
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,370
these four major sects—

of the mountain,

accusing you of abducting Yao Fu!

41

our Shengyue Sect!

disregards all of us in the martial world,

Yes, that's right!

49
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,740
The Shengyue Sect has been arrogant
for a long time.

That witch Wang Yue is even
more shameless,

-Yeah.
-Right!

81
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,110
Negotiation means to seek peace!

82
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,030
This is the internal affair of our sect.

83

As for how to solve it,

84
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,640

Mr. Yang,

86
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,420
I'm afraid your Junior Yao Fu might not
want a negotiation.

help us from inside

have always been sworn enemies.

As the saintess

who has been officially recognized
and enshrined on the altar,

107
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,260
am I not qualified to interfere?

Yue!

109
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,160
Are you trying to rebel?

110
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,670
Yuan Yingxing, wake up!

111
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,440
How could a woman of Yunmen

112
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,300
be willing to marry into our sect?

113
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,880
They're now ambushing under the mountain

114
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,620
and will attack us soon!

115
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,140
Yao Fu has been lying to you.

116
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,890
She wants to destroy our sect!

117
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,600
-What should we do?
-What should we do?

118
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,660
Have you forgotten

119
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,880
how we got here step by step?

120
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,550

You don't trust me?

123
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,380
So it's just as I thought—

124
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,290
I can never compare to her.

125
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,520
Fine.

126
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,600
Today,

00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,450
let her kill me.

128
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,400
I must marry Yao Fu today.

130
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,289
stop pushing me.

Yuan Yingxing!

132
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,309
We grew up together.

133
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,039
You would actually go

134
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,720
against me for this woman

135
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,780
and forsake the whole Shengyue Sect?

136
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,310
Chief!

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,640

How dare they!

you'll answer for it!

-Yes, Chief!
-Yes, Chief!

146
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,160
The rest,

147
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,360
go down the mountain with me!

148
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,820
-Yes, Chief!
-Yes, Chief!

149
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,760
Wait for me.

-Let's go!
-Let's go!

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,040
I knew

152
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,860
you were up to no good from the beginning.

153
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,590
So what?

154
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,670
It's a shame.

155
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,430
Yuan Yingxing only listens to me.

156
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,310
You're so worried about him.

157
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,550
Don't tell me you really have feelings
for him.

158
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,590
I have feelings for him?

159
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,520
You'd better surrender now.

160
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,450
Your sect will definitely perish today.

161
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,230
I don't know whether our sect will perish,

162
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,880
but you will die for sure!

163
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,830
You can't kill me.

164
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,650
Forget about your hatred.

165
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,040
You can't beat me.

166
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,070
Where am I?

167
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,090
How did I get here?

168
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,500
Why am I dressed like this?

169
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,470
Am I getting married?

170
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,640
You're awake!

171
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,770
That's great!

172
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,900
Come with me now!

173
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,710
Hurry up!

174
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,600
Beautiful cloths!

175
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Stop, stop, stop!

176
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,950
Bride, why did you take off your veil?

177
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,880
This is ominous.

178
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,110
Put it back on, hurry.

179
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,670
"Bride"?

180
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,920
Your ancestors must be blessing you
from above.

181

You're lucky

182
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,890

Today is your wedding day.

184

Don't make any trouble

185
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,250
to upset him.

186
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,330
"My wedding day"?

187

"Master Chen"?

188
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,920
Master Chen is the King of Hell?

189
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't speak such nonsense.

190
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,860
Master Chen is in perfect health.

191
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,410
Didn't you meet him before?

192
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,790
True, he's quite a bit older,

193
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,500
but he's filthy rich.

194
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,500
Once you become his concubine,

195
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,430
you'll never have to suffer again.

196
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,400
So...

197
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,920
I'm still alive?

198
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,160
Don't say such unlucky things

199
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,920
on your wedding day.

200
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Miss Yang, you're perfectly fine.

201
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,130
Master Chen is counting on you

202
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,800
to give him a big, healthy son.

203
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,200
So...

204
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,620
I'm not dead,

205
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,760
and I'm going to marry an old man?

206
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,550
Is this Yuan Yingxing's idea

207
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,760
or Yao Fu's scheme?

208
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,590
Miss Yang,

209
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,040
you're not making sense.

210
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,620
Your uncle

211
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,470
arranged this marriage himself.

212
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,000
If he hadn't owed Master Chen money,

213
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,520
he'd never have offered you as payment.

214
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,880
Miss Yang?

215
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,850
My uncle?

216
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,560
You're Yang Wangyue, Miss Yang.

217
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,290
What?

218
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,720
You don't even remember your own uncle?

219
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,310
Yang Wangyue?

220
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,570
Yeah.

221
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,080
You're an orphan.

222
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,980
Yang Laoqi brought you up.

223
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,440
I don't care if you're pretending
to be sick or have amnesia—

224
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,040
you can't escape this marriage.

225
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,310
Your uncle has already taken the money.

226
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,240
You understand?

227
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,360
Yang Qing?

228
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Yang Qing!

229
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,450
Yang Qing!

230
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,810
What Yang Qing?

231
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,110
-Yang Qing!
-Get in, get in!

232
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,040
-Lift the bride! Lift!
-Yang Qing!

233
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,900
Mr. Yang,

234
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,620
what are you looking at?

235
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,950
I seem to hear

236
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,720
someone calling me.

237
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,070
Really?

238
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,370
Mr. Yang, maybe you misheard?

239
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,350
Maybe.

240
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,230
They actually think of me as someone else.

241
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,340
And this woman has the same name as me.

242
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,110
I was clearly killed by Yao Fu.

243
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,510
How could I now be mistaken
for the concubine, Yang Wangyue?

244
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,740
Never mind. I have to
get out of here first.

245
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,280
M-My martial arts are gone?

246
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,020
Now, the martial world has finally
returned to peace.

247
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,440
[Jiang Yan, Yunmen Sect]

248
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,589
Aside from the dead Saintess
of the Shengyue Sect

249
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,190
and the missing Water
and Fire Hall Masters,

250
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,099
the rest of the Shengyue Sect—

251
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,190
the Chief, Hall Masters, and Guardians—

252
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,510
have all been captured.

253
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,840
The Shengyue Sect is as good as destroyed.

254
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,500
Mr. Yang,

255
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,940
that Saintess of the Shengyue Sect
who admired you so much

256
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,600
died just like that.

257
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,390
Mr. Yang,

258
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,600
did you secretly meet her?

259
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,590
Otherwise,

260
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,340
why would she fall
head over heels for you, of all men,

261
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,000
and pursue you relentlessly?

262
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,340
What did she look like?

263
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:47,750
[Shang Huai, Yunmen Sect]

264
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,600
Rumor has it,

265
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,030
she was hideous—

266
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,400
so frightening

267
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,070
she'd make children cry.

268
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,420
She always wore a veil when out in public.

269
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,280
No one in the martial world
had seen her true face.

270
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,670
It's said she was killed by Ms. Yao.

271
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
That's odd too.

272
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,250
Ms. Yao made a great contribution,

273
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,110
yet disappeared without a trace.

274
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,470
Yao Fu has always been mysterious.

275
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,840
Don't worry about her.

276
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,300
The Sect Leader asked

277
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,760
us to find out Ms. Yao's whereabouts
as well.

278
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,560
Where could she possibly be?

279
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,310
Focus on the investigation.

280
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,390
Mr. Yang, what exactly happened this time?

281
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,510
The Sect Leader even called you
out from your seclusion.

282
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,700
For the past few months,

283
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,800
children have been going missing
in Yangliu Town.

284
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,400
Just this past month, three more
went missing.

285
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,670
It's highly unusual.

286
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,610
The Sect Leader wants us to
help the townsfolk

287
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,070
find the missing children

288
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,280
and uncover the truth

289
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,090
behind their disappearance.

290
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,080
Who could be so cruel?

291
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,250
Mr. Yang, rest assured.

292
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,470
We will give it our all

293
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,040
to complete the mission.

294
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,320
Okay.

295
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,030
This is your first time officially
stepping into the martial world

296
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,120
to carry out a mission.

297
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,950
Be cautious in all things.

298
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,680
Never trust anyone too easily.

299
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,040
Got it, Mr. Yang.

300
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,710
Where should we start?

301
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,080
By the way, Mr. Yang,

302
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
you're from Yangliu Town, right?

303
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,320
You must be very familiar with this place.

304
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,230
Not really.

305
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,330
When I was eight,

306
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,690
my parents passed away. After that,

307
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,620
I wandered outside for a few months

308
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,210
before the Sect Leader took me
into the sect.

309
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,160
I haven't returned here until now.

310
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,270
Mr. Yang,

311
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,800
you're an orphan?

312
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,730
Young Hero Yang.

313
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,320
Ever since the Sect Leader of Yunmen
took you away,

314
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,650
you've never come back.

315
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
But we've never forgotten you.

316
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,660
We've kept

317
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,020
your parents' mansion all these years.

318
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,800
It's just that no one has managed it
for years.

319
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,950
It's...

320
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,560
it's a little messy.

321
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,400
Thank you, District Leader.

322
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,210
That old house has been abandoned
for years.

323
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,230
Selling it is fine.

324
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,760
No need to have it repaired.

325
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,570
We're here this time

326
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,120
to investigate the missing children
in town.

327
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,320
Do you have any leads?

328
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,820
I heard they went missing
by the Flowering Tree.

329
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,710
Have any

330
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,590
suspicious people been coming and going

331
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,720
from town recently?

332
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,710
It's all over the town

333
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,400
that those naughty children were
being rude under the divine tree

334
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,920
and angered the Flower Goddess.

335
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,230
Then, the goddess sent
the mountain spirits to snatch them.

336
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,860
Everyone's terrified.

337
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,270
Many families dare not let their children

338
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,190
go out alone.

339
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,460
I don't know when this will end.

340
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,130
Let's go and take a look.

341
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:30,500
Yes.

342
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,060
[Chen's Mansion]

343
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,270
Yang Wangyue, oh, Yang Wangyue.

344
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,320
I don't know if you're alive or dead.

345
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,920
But consider these

346
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,880
as gifts from me

347
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,350
for using your identity.

348
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,320
That old rascal even thought he could
have a girl by force?

349
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,080
Today I'll act as an agent of justice.

350
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,710
Fire! Fire! There's a fire!

351
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,080
Hurry up! Let's go!

352
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,160
-Get out!
-Run!

353
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,430
Fire!

354
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,080
Help! Put out the fire!

355
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,920
Where is the fire?

356
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,710
Fire! Chen's mansion's backyard
is on fire!

357
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,400
Hurry.

358
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,950
Put out the fire!

359
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,190
Run!

360
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,920
Run!

361
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,510
Hurry!

362
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,600
Fire! There is a fire!

363
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,030
Come out! Come out!

364
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,430

Fire! There is a fire!

366
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,470
Jiang Yan, take Ling Xiao and Xie Feng
to put out the fire.

367
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,640
Shang Huai, evacuate the guests
immediately.

368
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,770
Yang Qing is still as handsome as ever.

369
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,180
This is not the time for that.

370
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,760
I should hurry up and leave.

371
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,050
Look what happened.

372
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,020
It's alright. Calm down.

373
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,540
Be careful.

374
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,370
How's everything?

375
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:16,830
Are you okay?

376
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,840
We've rescued all the guests,

377
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,920
and the fire has been put out.

378
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,360
Fortunately, the fire
was discovered early.

379
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,080
Master Chen suffered minor burns,

380
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,940
and the others were just shocked.

381
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,510
However, the mansion will need repairs.

382
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,710
It may take some time.

383
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,470
We just need to do our part.

384
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,990
We'll leave after we help them
get settled.

385
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,080
Yes, Mr. Yang.

386
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,990
Yang Wangyue!

387
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,270
Yang Wangyue?

388
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,320
Wang Yue...

389
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,300
You are Yang Wangyue?

390
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:50,810
You...

391
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,510
Master Chen tried to take me by force.

392
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,920
I just refused,

393
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,920
so you were going to burn me alive?

394
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,650
You bitch! That's slander!

395
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,560
You set the fire yourself!

396
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,230
I'm just a weak girl.

397
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,920
Why are you doing this to me?

398
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,640
Just because you're rich, you can do
whatever you want?

399
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,430
Look at her,

400
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,580
she seems so delicate.

401
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,670
How could she possibly set a fire?

402
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,750
That's impossible.

403
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,210
She couldn't have done it.

404
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,120
Mrs. Chen,

405
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,940
forcing a woman into being a concubine.

406
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,710
That's not something you can justify
so easily, right?

407
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,850
-Look at her, so fragile...
-Everyone,

408
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,170
my husband is already badly burned.

409
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,290
Please don't listen to her nonsense.

410
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,980
Guards, tie her up!

411
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,660
Wait!

412
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,160
You're twisting it around and blaming me!

413
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,270
All I did was refuse to be
Master Chen's concubine,

414
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,270
and now you're trying to pin
a murder charge on me?

415
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,060
Listen up,

416
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,850
I may be poor, but I have dignity!

417
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,150
Just because you're rich

418
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,800
doesn't mean you can bully people like us!

419
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,160
If your conscience is clear,

420
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,960
then go ahead!

421
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,640
Mrs. Chen,

422
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,360
please let this go.

423
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,560
She's so young,

424
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,270
and you're forcing her to be
your husband's concubine.

425
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,560
It's really not right.

426
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,560
I just lost my parents when I was young,

427
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,710
and there was no one to protect me.

428
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,450
How can you do this to me?

429
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,160
You little wench,

430
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,000
quite the actress, aren't you?

431
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,080
Mrs. Chen,

432
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,950
you hit me! Are you going to kill me?

433
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,510
In plain sight, and there are

434
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,470
so many people watching!

435
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,750
Don't think you can do whatever you want

436
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,960
-because you're rich!
-You're driving me crazy!

437
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,380
Help! Help!

438
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,560
Move!

439
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,300
Get out of my way!

440
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,520
Calm down, Mrs. Chen!

441
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,600
You bitch!

442
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,920
Let me through!

443
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,540
It's Yang Qing!

444
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,900
He actually saw me like this.

445
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,230
Miss?

446
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,410
My head hurts. I'm so dizzy.

447
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,320
Mrs. Chen wants to kill me!

448
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,050
Please help me!

449
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,430
Miss.

450
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,100
Miss?

451
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,510
Miss?

452
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,830
[Tianlin Garden]

453
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,540
I only meant to fake fainting.

454
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,190
How did I actually fall asleep?

455
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,840
Where am I?

456
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,780
Miss Yang, you're finally awake.

457
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,160
How are you feeling?

458
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,850
Do you have any discomfort?

459
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
No, no. I'm much better now.

460
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,920
That's good.

461
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,360
I'm Jiang Yan, a disciple
of the Yunmen Sect.

462
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,290
Thank you for saving me, Mr. Jiang.

463
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,900
No need to thank me.

464
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,130
If you must thank someone, thank Mr. Yang.

465
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,440
Without his permission,

466
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,370
we wouldn't have brought you back.

467
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,740
Why are you disciples

468
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,090
of the Yunmen Sect here?

469
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,600
You may not know, Miss Yang,

470
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,920
but Mr. Yang is from this very town.

471
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:04,990
You...

472
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,800
you mean Yang Qing?

473
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,000
Miss Yang, you know him?

474
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,330
I've heard of him.

475
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,080
So why are you here?

476
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,800
Who is it?

477
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,820
It's me.

478
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,370
Yang Qing probably doesn't recognize me.

479
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,650
I wore a veil every time we met.

480
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,670
Miss Yang, it's Mr. Yang.

481
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,670
Don't be nervous.

482
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,840
He's a kind man.

483
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,240
Mr. Yang.

484
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,500
Mr. Yang, thank you for saving me.

485
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,850
Please accept my bow.

486
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,330
No need to be so formal, Miss Yang.

487
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,800
I heard you're from this town?

488
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,230
Yes.

489
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,510
I lost my parents when I was young

490
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,710
and only had an uncle.

491
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,710
Might I ask your age?

492
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,360
I used to live here when I was young,

493
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,780
but I don't recall hearing of you.

494
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,800
I...

495
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,160
I don't remember many things.

496
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,100
I was seriously ill not long ago.

497
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,190
I'm also troubled.

498
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,430
Mr. Yang,

499
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,300
well, she just woke up. Maybe don't ask
too many questions yet.

500
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,400
Miss, please rest.

501
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,800
Later, I'll have Jiang Yan
escort you home.

502
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,270
I have something important to do,

503
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,120
so I'll bid you farewell here.

504
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,620
Farewell?

505
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,400
No, no!

506
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,230
I...

507
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,330
I'm not going home.

508
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,890
My uncle must have taken the money
from selling me and run away.

509
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,460
I'm the only one in my family now.

510
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,500
Tell me,

511
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,160
what should I do

512
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,800
if I get caught by Master Chen?

513
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,840
Mr. Yang,

514
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,120
Miss Yang has a point.

515
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,660
What do you think we should do?

516
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,550
I'm on an important mission.

517
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,640
I have to return to the Yunmen Sect
to report.

518
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,470
Miss Yang,

519
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,840
you're a young lady,

520
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,990
and it's inappropriate for you
to follow us.

521
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,920
What's so inappropriate about it?

522
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,520
Miss, please get ready.

523
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,440
Jiang Yan will escort you back.

524
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,320
Mr. Yang,

525
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,750
please let me stay for a few more days.

526
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,470
I really have nowhere else to go.

527
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,910
I promise I won't cause you any trouble.

528
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,840
But I have to carry out my mission.

529
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
If danger arises,

530
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,400
I don't want to

531
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,990
get you involved.

532
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,110
Then let Mr. Jiang

533
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,400
carry out the mission.

534
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,030
After all I just did to take care of you,

535
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,190
now that he shows up,

536
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,030
you're going to kick me away.

537
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,880
I don't care.

538
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,360
I heard your Yunmen Sect is the leader
of the martial world.

539
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,090
How could you

540
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
not care about a weak woman?

541
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,850
If you don't care,

542
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,450
it's no different from sending me

543
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,070
back to Master and Mrs. Chen.

544
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,710
Tell me, just because I was born

545
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,560
poor and unfortunate,

546
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,710
I deserve to stay unfortunate?

547
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,260
Jiang Yan will protect you.

548
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,030
Come with me.

549
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,800
I have something to instruct you on.

550
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,670
Yes, Mr. Yang.

551
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,900
He's still as handsome as ever.

552
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,270
How's the investigation

553
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,270
on the missing children coming along?

554
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:36,920
Mr. Yang,

555
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,300
the juniors were out investigating
in the streets this morning.

556
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,720
They seemed to have found
some suspicious people

557
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,320
in taverns near Yanyu Tower.

558
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,980
I've asked Junior Ning to lead
some people to investigate.

559
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,140
We'll go there later

560
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,610
and see what's going on.

561
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:53,970
Mr. Yang,

562
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,750
what about Miss Yang?

563
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:56,850
I don't think

564
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,850
it's right to send her back alone either.

565
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,180
What if Master Chen comes after her again?

566
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,510
Find time

567
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,950
to visit the Chen residence personally

568
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,110
and tell Master Chen not to
make things difficult for Miss Yang.

569
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,360
He will always show respect

570
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,400
to our sect.

571
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,410
After things settle down,

572
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,610
send her back.

573
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,570
Okay, Mr. Yang.

574
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,760
Yang Qing, oh, Yang Qing,

575
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,800
since Heaven has let you stay by my side,

576
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,400
I won't let you go anymore.

577
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,690
Didn't you say I'm ruthless

578
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,230
and I don't deserve to be your friend?

579
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,120
Then,

580
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,120
I'll be Yang Wangyue

581
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,320
and be all gentle to you.

582
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,770
Let's see how you can refuse me this time.

583
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,350
[Tianlin Garden]

584
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,320
Miss Yang.

585
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
Mr. Yang.

586
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,950
Just call me Wangyue.

587
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,110
Miss Yang, you're not resting
in your room.

588
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,490
Is something wrong?

589
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,270
Mr. Yang,

590
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,950
not only are you handsome,

591
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,160
but also so nice.

592
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,360
Do you have a lover?

593
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,920
A fiancée?

594
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,470
A wife?

595
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,280
If you have none of those...

596
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,270
So?

597
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,160
So...

598
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,030
You saved me

599
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,400
and took care of me.

600
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,920
I've been thinking and thinking

601
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,190
about how to repay you.

602
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,320
After thinking about it for a long time.

603
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,990
I think that I have to marry you
to repay you.

604
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,430
I don't want to be
Master Chen's concubine.

605
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,840
But if it's you,

606
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,490
even if it means being your lowliest maid,

607
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,450
I am willing.

608
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,300
It's Jiang Yan and Shang Huai

609
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,450
who are helping and taking care of you.

610
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,800
If you want to thank someone,

611
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,730
just thank them.

612
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,540
Without your orders,

613
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,360
what would those boys know to do?

614
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,080
Miss Yang,

615
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,780
I'm not a boy.

616
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,030
You're the one directing everything
behind the scenes.

617
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,690
You're the one I should thank.

618
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,030
When did he direct anything?

619
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,960
He didn't care about us at all...

620
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,140
Mr. Yang,

621
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,400
you have so much on your plate,

622
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,030
yet you're still worried about me.

623
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,510
I feel terrible.

624
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,920
I haven't been worrying about you.

625
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,430
It's the juniors who pitied you

626
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
and helped you.

627
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,120
I'm not someone with much sympathy.

628
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,560
Jiang Yan, let's go.

629
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,100
Okay.

630
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,160
Mr. Yang,

631
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,750
are you that heartless?

632
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,120
Yeah.

633
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:53,950
You...

634
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,770
Even the way you reject people

635
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,120
is so gentle.

636
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,270
What am I supposed to do?

637
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,450
Miss Yang.

638
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,100
Mr. Yang,

639
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,040
why is Miss Yang following us?

640
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,880
Come on, Miss, please pray for a talisman.

641
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,800
The way she acts

642
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,340
reminds me of someone.

643
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,360
Here.

644
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,950
Who?

645
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
Miss Yang, we have
something important to do,

646
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,950
and you don't know any martial arts.

647
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,280
Please go back to Tianlin Garden and rest.

648
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,880
Is your mission dangerous?

649
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:41,950
I'm sorry.

650
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,600
This is our sect's business.

651
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,360
It's not something I can share with you.

652
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,160
How can you be so cold?

653
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,210
Yeah.

654
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,350
I was born that way.

655
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,440
Even if you're cold, I still like you.

656
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,640
What's wrong with your eyes?

657
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,100
Do you need to see a doctor?

658
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,800
I'm fine, Mr. Yang.

659
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,500
Go back to Tianlin Garden now.

660
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,840
Miss Yang,

661
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,219
are you going to

662
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,550
follow us around all day?

663
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,239
Yes.

664
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,320
Who knows when Master Chen might

665
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,429
come after me again?

666
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,239
Staying close to you

667
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,300
makes it easier for you to protect me.

668
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,840
Yang Qing walks way too fast.

669
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,340
He disappeared in the blink of an eye.

670
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:33,100
To think that I, the carefree Saintess
of the Shengyue Sect,

671
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,250
would one day have nowhere to go.

672
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,560
This must be the darkest day
in the history of the Shengyue Sect.

673
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:47,929
Why is Yang Qing completely immune
to any charm or persuasion?

674
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,800
Why is there a secret mark
of the Shengyue Sect here?

675
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,270
[No entry for members of the Shengyue Sect
or dogs]

why do you...

682
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,510
want to see me?

683
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,630
Didn't the signboard at the entrance
of this shop

684
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,950
originally say,

685
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,040
"No entry for

686

Our roast chicken restaurant

690
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,840
only serves the righteous customers.

691

We have nothing to do
with the Shengyue Sect.

"Shengyue Sect"?

693
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Then, Guardian Fan, do you remember

694
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,920
what will happen to traitors

695
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,740
of the Shengyue Sect?

696
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,620
You know who I am?

697
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,750
But I'm no traitor.

698
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,970
Besides,

699
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,330
there is no Shengyue Sect now.

700
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,860
After the siege by the four major sects,

701
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
the Shengyue Sect

702
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,120
has long since fallen apart.

703
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,800
What did you say?

704
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,470
You deaf or something?

705
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,070
I said that the Shengyue Sect is gone.

706
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,030
It's fallen apart.

707
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,430
It has been annihilated!

708
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,400

710
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,090
Naturally, he couldn't escape

711
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,260
and was captured.

712
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,360
What a pity.

713
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,570
He used to be so powerful.

714
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,760
Now the Saintess is dead.

715
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,890
The Chief's wife is missing.

716
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,130
I'm afraid the Shengyue Sect

717
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,820
is doomed.

718
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,200
Chief's wife?

719
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,140
Does that woman, Yao Fu, deserve
to be called by this title?

720
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,020
Where are Lingyin and Mingyang?

721
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,140
Those two rascals?

722
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,530
They were really lucky.

723
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,540
They were not in the sect that day.

724
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,980
Wait, Miss,

725
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,420
who are you?

726
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,060
Why do you know the Shengyue Sect so well?

727
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,200
Guardian Fan,

728
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,380
you have indeed never seen

729
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,320
me like this.

730
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,430
But you should be able to recognize

731
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,510
my eyes, right?

732
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,720
Saintess?

733
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,040
I wouldn't dare… wouldn't dare…

734
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,850
Are you trying to have me captured?

735
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Don't forget.

736
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,600
You are also part of the Shengyue Sect.

737
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,090
If they catch me,

738
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,900
you're not getting away.

739
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,150
Saintess.

740
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,450
How dare I summon people to arrest you?

741
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,720
I didn't know you were still alive.

742
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
That's great, really.

743
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,430
God is blessing us, God is blessing us.

744
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,680
Come on, Saintess.

745
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,340
Come on, please have a seat.

746
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,920
I really didn't expect this. Look.

747
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,470
I've prepared all these dishes for you,

748
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,760
but you didn't have any.

749
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,280
Come on, please have some.

750
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,650
Alright, alright.

751
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,480
Let's get down to business.

752
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,640
What exactly happened?

753
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,330
Speaking of this,

754
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,030
it's a long story.

755
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,680
On the day of the Chief's wedding,

756
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,540
the four major sects attacked us.

757
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,630
We couldn't hold the defenses,

758
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,090
and they found a weak spot
and broke through.

759
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,440
There was a chance to turn things around.

760
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,840
But after the Chief heard
what happened to you,

761
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,050
he was crushed and lost all will to fight.

762
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,380
With low morale,

763
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,320
we couldn't resist any longer.

764
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,270
Later,

765
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,950
everyone who was present

766
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,650
was captured and imprisoned
by the four major sects

767
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,680
in Biluo Valley.

768
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,430
Yuan Yingxing was imprisoned.

769
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,920
Why didn't any of you try to save him?

770
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,950
S-Save him?

771
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,610
Saintess, you have no idea.

772
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,310
The four major sects have joined forces

773
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,000
and built a special dungeon

774
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,980
just for locking up our people.

775
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,280
It's guarded heavily,

776
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,940
making it hard for ordinary people
to enter.

777
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,540
And even if we could break in,

778
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,030
I heard

779
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,750
that we need to use one of their
Alliance Leader's Tokens, the Sun Blade,

780
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,560
to open it.

781
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,320
But the Sun Blade is in
the Yunmen Sect's hands.

782
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,510
It's not something that an old man like me

783
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,800
can easily get.

784
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:35,990
Mr. Yang.

785
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,430
There you are.

786
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,090
We've found something.

787
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,520
Mr. Yang,

788
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,950
at the marketplace near the kapok tree,

789
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,330
someone heard children

790
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,640
crying in the chests.

791
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,050
It was

792
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,740
on the 1st and 15th of the lunar calendar
this month.

793
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,600
Wooden chests?

794
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,240
Has anyone purchased
wooden chests recently?

795
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,720
Big chests keep moving in and out
of Master Chen's house.

796
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,850
It is said that they are for
the decoration of the new room

797
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,320
for his 13th concubine.

798
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,240
His 13th concubine?

799
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,360
Mr. Yang, it seems to be
Miss Yang Wangyue.

800
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,760
Mr. Yang,

801
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,110
should we bring Miss Yang back?

802
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,650
Maybe she has some clues.

803
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:15,920
Mr. Yang,

804
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,390
she has no sense of boundaries
when she speaks,

805
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,850
but she's not a bad person.

806
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,410
Let's go.

807
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
Mr. Yang!

808
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,800
Where are you going?

809
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,800
Are you going to find me?

810
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,680
Miss Yang, why are you back?

811
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,610
I

812
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,070
couldn't hold back my admiration for you.

813
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,070
Every time I open or close my eyes,

814
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,070
I see your handsome face.

815
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,110
So

816
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,510
I bought the most famous
roast chicken in town

817
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,570
to make it up to you.

818
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,190
If this is your way of apologizing,

819
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,150
can you answer a few questions?

820
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,030
If I answer your questions,

821
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,430
can I stay?

822
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,110
Mr. Yang,

823
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,010
you wouldn't

824
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,310
really abandon me to my fate, would you?

825
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,510
How could your fate

826
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,600
be my responsibility to manage?

827
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,400
Since you said you can't manage me,

828
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,660
then I decide to stay,

829
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,080
and you can't kick me out.

830
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,640
If you don't kick me out,

831
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,980
I'll answer

832
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,260
any questions you ask.

833
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,290
If you're that determined to stay,

834
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,950
do as you wish.

835
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,380
I knew you couldn't bear to send me away.

836
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,180
Go ahead. What do you want to ask?

837
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,280
Well... Miss Yang,

838
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,790
on your wedding day with Master Chen...

839
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,430
What wedding?

840
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,160
He forced me to be his concubine
and kidnapped me.

841
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,690
Well, on that day,

842
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,010
did you notice

843
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,090
anything unusual about Master Chen?

844
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,400
Come closer.

845
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,150
I didn't notice.

846
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,840
I already told you everything.

847
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,090
It was so chaotic that day.

848
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,630
Who would pay attention to
some wrinkled old man?

849
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,140
I answered your questions.

850
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,540
You can't kick me out now.

851
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,230
Miss Yang...

852
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,000
Forget it.

853
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,920
We're not likely to get anything serious
from her.

854
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,590
Send her back tomorrow.
