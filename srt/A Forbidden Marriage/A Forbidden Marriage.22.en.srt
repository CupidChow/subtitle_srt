[Episode 22]

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,190
[Tianyu Palace]

4
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
Is there some hardship
you cannot speak of?

5
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,260
If there is,

6
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,250
I can trust you once,

7
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,490
or even twice.

8
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,380
Whatever it is, I won't blame you.

9
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,240
Speak!

10
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,290
Talk to me, Yao Fu!

11
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,470
Just a few days ago,
you were all tender with me,

12
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,800
and the next moment you married Yang Qing!

13
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,140
Did you ever speak a single truthful word?

14
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,960
What do you want me to say?

15
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,770
That Yunmen forced me?
That someone pressured me?

16
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,750
I can say that,

17
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,960
but would you believe it?

18
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,610
You've betrayed me again and again!

19
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,540
Yao Fu.

20
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,420
Just you wait.

21
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,760
You'll stay here until you die,

22
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,130
never to see the sunlight outside again.

23
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Senior Shen!

24
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,150
Junior Yang.

25
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,870
The dungeon in Biluo Valley

26
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,650
has been opened,

27
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,680
and the prisoners
have been rescued by them.

28
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,270
By now,

29
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,820
they should be on their way
back to Mount Yin.

30
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,260
Yang Wangyue.

31
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,780
How exactly has Yunmen ever wronged you?

32
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,070
Everything you've done
has been a slap in Yunmen's face!

33
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,000
And she even dares to claim
she has feelings for you.

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,060
If she had even a shred of conscience,

35
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,370
she wouldn't have dragged you into
such a predicament.

36
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,290
I'm the one to blame.

37
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,830
Our top priority now
is to retrieve the Sun Blade.

38
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,270
When it comes to knowledge of Mount Yin,

39
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,200
besides Junior Yao, I know it best.

40
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,140
How about we split up?

41
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,720
Alright.

42
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,480
Greetings, Chief!

43
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,630
Please spare me, Chief!

44
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,280
Please spare my life, Chief!

45
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,880
The Six Harmonies Palm
is truly miraculous.

46
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,990
Its power is absolutely astonishing.

47
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,500
Once I master this divine skill,

48
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,500
the martial world

49
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,690
will be mine to command!

50
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,440
Father, your might is unmatched.

51
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,380
Earlier, you exposed that witch.

52
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,409
You shall be credited for that.

53
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,260
Well done.

54
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,630
It's a shame that Yunmen was useless,

55
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,159
letting that witch escape.

56
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,159
I'll definitely track her down

57
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,420
and tear her to pieces!

58
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,770
That witch doesn't matter.

59
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,360
What matters is that

60
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,800
you must help me reclaim
the Alliance Leader's Token.

61
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,800
Understand?

62
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,510
Yes.

63
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,850
I'll definitely retrieve
the Alliance Leader's Token.

64
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,520
Mingyang has been quite reliable
this time.

65
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,210
Fortunately, everything was prepared
in advance,

66
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,610
so it's fairly thorough.

67
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,550
We still cannot afford to delay.

68
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,080
Let's depart immediately.

69
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,070
I have an idea.

70
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,830
Let's split up.

71
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,670
Qinglai City is the only route
to Mount Yin,

72
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,390
and now Yunmen and Biluo Valley

73
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,090
have already stationed heavy guards
at all four gates

74
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,000
with strict inspections.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,680
I'll draw them away at the north gate.

76
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,770
Once the guards there are distracted,

77
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,640
you must quickly disguise yourselves
as a merchant caravan with the Guardian

78
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,760
and leave the city,

79
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,450
From Yangliu Town, take the secret passage
back to Mount Yin.

80
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,680
This plan could work,

81
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,610
but it's too dangerous.

82
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,020
Fortune favors the bold.

83
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,560
We went through so much to rescue them.

84
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
We can't let them be captured again.

85
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,000
If we must do this,

86
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,870
you can't be the one to go.

87
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,430
Mingyang and I will go.

88
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,030
I'll disguise myself as you.

89
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,770
No, you can't go either.

90
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,780
You should go with Saintess

91
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,310
and take everyone back
to the Shengyue Sect.

92
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,159
I'll go distract them.

93
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,470
You'll distract them?

94
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,120
I'm afraid once you go,

95
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,890
it'll turn into an all-out fight.

96
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,450
Enough.

97
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,870
Yue.

98
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,630
I'll take Mingyang
and disguise myself as you.

99
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,190
This is the safest approach.

100
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,510
I can use poison,
and Mingyang can fight.

101
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,610
Don't worry.
We won't be the ones at a disadvantage.

102
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,870
Look at them.

103
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,720
They've suffered so much in prison.

104
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,120
Their bodies won't hold out much longer.

105
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,590
Hurry and take them away.

106
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,930
But...

107
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,890
No buts.

108
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,720
In the time we're wasting,
you could have already covered miles.

109
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,480
Yue,

110
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,520
could you bear to see them
escape one danger

111
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,000
only to face death again?

112
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,270
Lend me your silver hairpin.

113
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,600
With a veil upon my face,

114
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,409
I should be able to pass through
without arousing suspicion.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,930
You must be careful.

116
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,570
If you can't win, just run.

117
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,730
This was a birthday gift from Yang Qing.

118
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,530
Why do I get the feeling

119
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,310
you're still a little reluctant to
part with

120
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,720
the gift that scoundrel gave you?

121
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,950
Who said I'm reluctant?

122
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,810
I've long wanted to throw it away.

123
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,180
[Yixiang Roast Chicken]

124
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,750
[No entry for members of the Shengyue Sect
or dogs]

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,710
Manager.

126
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,320
Where's your boss?

127
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,870
So many people want to see me every day.

128
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,190
Just send away those who aren't important!

129
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,600
You...

130
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,200
It's really like surging waters
flooded the Dragon King temple.

131
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,470
I didn't even recognize our own people.

132
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,460
What brings

133
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,170
you two

134
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,880
to my humble roast chicken shop today?

135
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,420
It's an honor to have you here.

136
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,620
Such an honor indeed.

137
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,940
I noticed the sign at your door earlier,
which says...

138
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,000
The servants are ignorant.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,730
I've told them countless times

140
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,670
not to hang such signs at the door,

141
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,540
yet all they do is brush me off.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,970
It wasn't me.

143
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,790
Why are you still standing here?

144
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,330
Go change that sign at the door
right now!

145
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,960
Yes, Boss.

146
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,800
I'll change it right away.

147
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,690
Useless thing.

148
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,480
I believe you're not just here

149
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,820
for that sign at my door, right?

150
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,680
You should already know that

151
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,290
Saintess has rescued

152
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,320
the four Guardians and the eight Vanguards

153
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,920
imprisoned in Biluo Valley.

154
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,650
And now,

155
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,150
we need to distract the guards
at the north gate for Saintess.

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,530
Do you have any good ideas?

157
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,640
This...

158
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,110
I'm merely

159
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,440
the owner of a small roast chicken shop.

160
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,360
How could I possibly...

161
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,390
Well, Fan Hao.

162
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,000
Saintess allowed you to
open this roast chicken shop

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,200
as a cover for gathering intelligence.

164
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,690
If I'm not mistaken,

165
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,360
the Shengyue Sect provided
your startup capital, right?

166
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,730
And now look at you,

167
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,630
treating this chicken shop as
your main business,

168
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,830
completely addicted to running it, huh?

169
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,220
To be honest,

170
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,750
who would have thought
this chicken shop would be so profitable?

171
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,440
It's enough for me

172
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,740
to live a comfortable life.

173
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,790
This is much better

174
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,760
than being a hall master
in the Shengyue Sect.

175
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,180
I don't care if you're genuinely
running this business or just for show.

176
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,710
You must first make sure the sect matters
are handled properly.

177
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,200
Of course.

178
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,250
That's for sure.

179
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,440
Please.

180
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,600
Here you go.

181
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,840
Thank you.

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,510
Mr. Jiang, you've been following me
for quite a while.

183
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,710
What's your purpose?

184
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,350
How did you know my surname is Jiang?

185
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,520

Let's split up.

262
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,530
Shang Huai,

263
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,440
take some disciples
and pursue in this direction.

264
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,020
The rest of you, come with me.

265
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,740
-Yes!
-Yes!

266
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,690
Mr. Shen, I have some thoughts.

267
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,910
Go ahead.

268
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,790
My family raises horses,

269
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,460
so I can read their tracks.

270
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,700
Look,

271
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,870
these hoofprints

272
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,550
are quite different
from those we saw miles back.

273
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,680
These are shallower and more chaotic.

274
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,420
So,

275
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,570
there was likely no rider on the horse.

276
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,240
And since this horse just gained
its freedom,

277
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,600
the chaotic tracks make perfect sense.

278
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,780
Therefore, they must have separated
from their horses

279
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,390
to deliberately lead us
in the wrong direction.

280
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,590
So you're suggesting

281
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,600
we should pursue in this direction?

282
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,320
Exactly.

283
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,470
Alright.

284
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,900
They can't get far within these few miles.

285
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,520

294
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,220
What's this?

295
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,150
You've been poisoned with Ghost Scent.

296
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,240
You should know how powerful

297
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,210
this Ghost Scent is.

298
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,820
No one but me can cure it.

299
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,560
You're not Yang Wangyue.

300
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,330
You're the Demonic Healer, Lingyin?

301
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,710
Demoness.

302
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,190
You actually dared to
impersonate Yang Wangyue!

303
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,090
Your poor eyesight

304
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,580
is hardly my fault, is it?

305
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,790
Shang Huai, how could you

306
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,830
mistake her for Yang Wangyue?

307
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,480
You're truly useless,
causing nothing but trouble.

308
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,270
When we go back,
reflect on your mistakes in seclusion.

309
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,720
Unless there's a good reason,
you're not allowed to leave the mountain!

310
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,400
Mr. Shen.

311
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,930
She's wearing
Yang Wangyue's silver hairpin,

312
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,260
so I was briefly misled.

313
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,010
I was wrong.

314
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,030

315
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,540
You still have time for idle chat?

316
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,190
Better think about

317
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,710
whether you'll even live to make it back.

318
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,910
Demoness, hand over the antidote
immediately!

319
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,100
You want the antidote?

320
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,350
That can be arranged.

321
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,140
Just obediently follow me back
to Mount Yin.

322
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,370
I know that besides you,

323
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,710
there are others who want us dead

324
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,120
and are hunting us down.

325
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,540
The best way to ensure our safe return
to Mount Yin

326
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,640
is for Mingyang and me to disguise
ourselves as Yunmen disciples

327
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,240
and blend in with your group.

328
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,030
So I'll have to trouble you, Elder Shen,

329
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,750
and you young heroes of Yunmen
to accompany us on this journey.

330
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,240
After all, during your last raid
on our sect,

331
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,020
you didn't get a proper tour.

332
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,290
Why not enjoy a proper visit this time?

333
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,480
How does that sound?

334
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,250
Don't even think about it.

335
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Going to your territory at Mount Yin

336
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,850
would be walking straight into a trap!

337
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,300
I'd rather die here

338
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,970
than let Yunmen suffer such humiliation!

339
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,730
Mr. Shen.

340
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,750
We mustn't.

341
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,720
This Ghost Scent poison
is extremely potent.

342
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,210
We've been poisoned by it before.

343
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:17,920
At that time,

344
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,400
all our fellow disciples
couldn't channel our energy,

345
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,200
and we gradually lost
our sense of smell and taste.

346
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,630
Mr. Shang certainly speaks
from experience.

347
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,490
If I hadn't given you the antidote
last time,

348
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,740
you would indeed have gradually lost
all five senses.

349
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,720

350
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,970
to cure you?

351
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,930
If I hadn't,

352
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,260
Mr. Shang,
you would probably be blind by now.

354

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,760
that only members of the Shengyue Sect
know about.

371
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,790
They've been inside for 15 minutes.

372
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,520
Their guard must be down by now.

373
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,760
Why don't we go in now

374
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,380
and catch them by surprise?

375
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:34,930
I...

376
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,970
I'll go in and talk to Yang Wangyue.

377
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,710
You and the disciples wait for me outside.

378
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,320
This...

379
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,430
She joined Yunmen because of me after all.

380
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,620
If negotiations fail,

381
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,020
I'll capture her myself.

382
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,440
Junior Yang.

383
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,970
I'm not supposed to agree to this,

384
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,110
but I understand.

385
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,560
She hurt you deeply,

386
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,160
and you need closure.

387
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:02,540
Go ahead,

388
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,720
but I can only give you the time it takes
to finish a cup of tea.

389
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,450
Thanks a lot.

390
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,450
Guardian Zhou.

391
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,770
Yang Qing?

392
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,090
Come with me.

393
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,480
Why is he here?

394
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,590
W-What's going on?

395
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,440
Wait for me here.

396
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,670
Did you figure anything out?

397
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,280
I've told you before that

398
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,200
the Sun Blade is
Yunmen's ultimate treasure

399
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,800
and cannot be stolen at will.

400
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,850
I've also told you

401
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,880
that I could trust you,

402
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,510
but if you couldn't convince
those righteous sects

403
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,770
to release our people,

404
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,640
I would take matters into my own hands.

405
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,400
I'm sorry,
something unforeseen has happened.

406
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,020
I thought I could handle it properly.

407
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,950
Handle it?

408
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,910
Is marrying Yao Fu
what you call handling it?

409
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,150
Gaining my trust

410
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,150
only to crush it completely,

411
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,450
is that your idea of handling things?

412
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,240
I don't know why this happened,

413
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,250
but Wangyue, trust me—

414
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,300
I've never betrayed you.

415
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,110
Just because the lover's knife
pierces your heart and no blood is seen,

416
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,770
does that mean it hasn't hurt?

417
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,000
Yang Qing.

418
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,070
Do you have to see me

419
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,060
bleeding to death in front of you

420
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,530
to call it hurt, to call it betrayal?

421
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,820
I'm sorry, Wangyue.

422
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,630
You said

423
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,170
you'd reconcile the two factions,

424
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,500
and I believed you.

425
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:08,970
You said

426
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,110
you'd openly get our people released,

427
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,440
and I believed that too.

428
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,790
Even when I was locked
in Seclusion Valley,

429
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,590
I never thought about escaping.

430
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,330
But what happened?

431
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,800
As soon as I got imprisoned,

432
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,970
you started cozying up to Yao Fu,

433
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,250
planning to marry her.

434
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
In all my life,

435
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,940
this is the first time
I've trusted someone,

436
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,150
a trust

437
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,940
I never gave even to Yuan Yingxing,
who grew up with me.

438
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,230
I truly don't know

439
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,230
why I agreed to marry Yao Fu,

440
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,570
as if I wasn't in control of myself.

441
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,280
She must have bewitched me,

442
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,350
just like when she bewitched you before

443
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,160
and you couldn't help being nice to her.

444
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,360
It's the same with me.

445
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,530
I had no inner strength back then,

446
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,850
which is why I was easily affected.

447
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,060
But what about you?

448
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,510
The great Elder Yang
with such profound inner strength,

449
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,570
would you also fall victim so easily?

450
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,100
Don't think I'll believe you

451
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,370
just because you make up some excuse.

452
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,220
Wangyue.

453
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,530
I have never lied to you.

454
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,080
It doesn't matter if you don't believe me.

455
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,910
After all, I betrayed your trust.

456
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,850
Do as you wish—
kill me, execute me, it's all up to you.

457
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,310
What good would your death do me?

458
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,210
I want you ruined and disgraced.

459
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,370
Wangyue.

460
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,200
You've rescued your people.

461
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,060
Please return the Sun Blade to me.

462
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,640
The four major sects have set up
an inescapable net outside,

463
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,840
all for the Sun Blade.

464
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,500
The Sun Blade is on me.

465
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,590
If you want it,

466
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,610
come and take it yourself.

467
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:52,610
Keeping the Sun Blade
will only bring you trouble.

468
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,890
Give it to me.

469
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,740
Kill me,

470
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,410
then you can take the Sun Blade
as you please.

471
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,740
After all, for Yao Fu's sake,

472
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,590
you almost killed me once before.

473
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,000
What's one more life?

474
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,470
I'm no match for your skills,

475
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,090
so take it if you can.

476
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,770
What?

477
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,500
Don't want it anymore?

478
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,680
Yang Qing.

479
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,810
I will never surrender
this Sun Blade to anyone,

480
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,880
especially not to you.

481
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,420
I want you to remember,

482
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,340
this Sun Blade

483
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,050
will be like a knife in your back,

484
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,360
reminding you day and night

485
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
that you lost Yunmen's ultimate treasure

486
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,410
because you betrayed me, Wangyue.

487
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,730
In this world,

488
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,510
I'm always the one who deceives others,

489
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,030
never the one being deceived.

490
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,960
Saintess, are you alright?

491
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,720
Don't worry.

492
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,550
Yang Qing didn't do anything to you,
did he?

493
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,270
Rest assured.

494
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,880
Lingyin's sedative worked well.

495
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,790
However, Guardian Zhou,

496
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,750
we shouldn't stay here long.

497
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,790
Quickly, open the secret passage.

498
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,070
Yes.

499
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,880
Hurry!

500
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,310
Get inside!

501
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,030
Quick!

502
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,490
Let's go.

503
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,780
Faster, move faster!

504
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,790
Let's go!

505
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,890
Have you heard?

506
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,310
The Shengyue Sect is about to be restored.

507
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,020
I have.

508
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,720
That Chief Yuan

509
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,270
is quite something indeed.

510
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,840
He was once utterly defeated
by other sects,

511
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,540
but now,

512
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,120
he's making a comeback.

513
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,560
That's a good thing.

514
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,790
When the Shengyue Sect wasn't around,

515
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,990
many problems arose.

516
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,670
Children went missing in Yangliu Town,

517
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,070
causing quite an uproar.

518
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,240
They say bandits took them,

519
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,900
but I don't buy it.

520
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,210
How could mere bandits be that skilled?

521
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,090
Even when Yunmen came,
they couldn't solve it.

522
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,550
In the end,
the case was just hastily closed.

523
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,430
If the Shengyue Sect were around,

524
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,270
Chief Yuan would never have allowed

525
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,540
such an unclear resolution.

526
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:21,960
Wrong.

527
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,370
If the Shengyue Sect
were around,

528
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,230
these incidents probably
wouldn't have happened at all.

529
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,580
Right. That's right.

530
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,000
You've all perked up your ears, right?

531
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,070
Did you hear that?

532
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,080
I mean, Elder Shen,

533
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,650
could you stop going on about
righteousness

534
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,320
and the common people all day long?

535
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,360
It's useless.

536
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,770
Nobody buys it anyway.

537
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,430
They think

538
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,260
your Yunmen is inferior to
our Shengyue Sect.

539
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,270
They think you're unreliable,

540
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,910
Yuan Yingxing is more capable,

541
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,820
and that you just don't measure up.

542
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,410
You...

543
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,770
What about us?

544
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,400
Can't take it anymore, Elder Shen?

545
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,370
What are you standing there for?

546
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,030
Come over and get warm by the fire.

547
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,740
They're not familiar with
the roads around here,

548
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,000
so they won't catch up
with us for a while.

549
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,720
You were lying to me earlier, weren't you?

550
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,720
That small dose of sedative
had no effect on you at all.

551
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,900
Wangyue.

552
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,210
I know you hate me and resent me,

553
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,590
but if you take the Sun Blade,

554
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,300
you'll become a target hunted
by everyone in the martial world.

555
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,330
Hunted?

556
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:39,790
What,

557
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,380
if I hand the Sun Blade over to you,

558
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,110
will that guarantee my safety?

559
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,930
Yang Qing.

560
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,280
Listen to yourself.

561
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,790
Every word you say
is supposedly for my good,

562
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,790
but you're actually looking out for
their interests.

563
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,570
Someone's coming.

564
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,320
Wangyue,

565
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,000
give me the Sun Blade,

566
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,350
and get out of here quickly.

567
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,610
Who would be chasing me

568
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,510
except your people from Yunmen?

569
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,040
I'll never trust you again.

570
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,890
Witch, you can't escape now.

571
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,250
What, even you dare to
lay hands on me now?

572
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,160
Mr. Yang.

573
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,790
This witch is so ungrateful for your help,

574
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,640
yet you're still going to help her
like that?

575
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Yunmen's affairs

576
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,960
are none of Biluo Valley's business.

577
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,290
If you leave now,

578
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,720
I'll let this slide.

579
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,160
Yang Qing.

580
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,460
Do you really want to make an enemy of

581
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,440
the entire righteous martial world
just for this witch?

582
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,410
I'll definitely save her.

583
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,930
I'll bear the consequences alone.

584
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,590
If you want to capture her,

585
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,190
you'll have to kill me first.

586
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,940
Fine, Yang Qing.

587
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,720
You've brought this upon yourself,

588
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,920
so don't blame me for showing no mercy.

589
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,780
Whoever brings me the witch's head

590
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,840
will be rewarded 100 taels of silver!

591
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,430
Yang Qing!

592
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,430
Yang Qing.

593
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,750
Wangyue.

594
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,680
I didn't expect your martial skills
to improve so much.

595
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,500
Who told you to take that blade for me?

596
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,330
Wangyue, I'm alright.

597
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,610
Don't harm my junior!

598
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,320
Drawing weapons against Biluo Valley?

599
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,540
It's bad enough that Yang Qing

600
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,740
openly takes the Shengyue Sect's side,

601
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,640
yet you're defending them too, Elder Shen?

602
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,170
Miss Lu.

603
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,140
You harmed Elder Yang.

604
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,200
If the major sects of the Central Plains
find out about this,

605
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,600
it won't end well for you.

606
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,150
Seems you intend to defend them
to the very end, Elder Shen.

607
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,350
Mr. Shen!

608
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:26,880
Mr. Shen!

609
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,970
Mr. Shen!

610
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,120
Mr. Shen.

611
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,280
Young Chief, they've escaped.

612
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,080
This matter won't end here.

613
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,170
Biluo Valley will definitely expose

614
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,570
Yunmen's true nature to the martial world.

615
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,960
Let's go.
Follow me to hunt down that witch!

616
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,740
Yes!

617
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,510
Are you okay?

618
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,830
♪ Time flows like sand in an hourglass,

619
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,440

Let's rest for a bit.

621
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,010

♪ Though carefree, I can't resist the gaze

627
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,340
Then you could be with Yao Fu

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,190
and live happily ever after.

629
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:33,920

Let me hold you one last time.

649
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,260
Wangyue.

650
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,830
If I die,

651
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,730
don't be sad.

652
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,870
Just forget about me.

653
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,860
In the future,

654
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,400
find someone who treats you well

655
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,290
and live a good life with him.

656
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,450
What are you talking about?

657
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,710
In this lifetime,

658
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,330
I'll only marry you and no one else.

659
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,670
Whether in life or death,

660
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,470
you belong to me.

661
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,050
Let's have our wedding ceremony.

662
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,480
Let's do it right here, right now.

663
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,170
Wangyue.

664
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:43,870
Wangyue...

665
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,740
Heaven and Earth bear witness.

666
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,150
From this moment on,

667
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,000
you are my husband.

668
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,340
I will never betray you.

669
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,570
Wangyue.

670
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,220
That strike might have injured
my vital vein.

671
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,730
What you've done is not worth it.

672
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,930
Don't talk nonsense.

673
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,160
We've bowed to Heaven and Earth.

674
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,830
You're my husband forever.

675
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,510
Saintess!

676
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,960
Saintess!

677
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,800
Saintess!

678
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,940
What did you just call him?

679
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,890
Husband?

680
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,760
He was about to marry Yao Fu.

681
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,690
How could you...

682
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,560
Are you telling me what to do?

683
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,690
I wouldn't dare.

684
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,600
I'm here to pick you up, Saintess.

685
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,070
The disciples from Biluo Valley have left.

686
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,400
Now while the main road is empty,

687
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,130
it's the best time to
return to the Shengyue Sect.

688
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,490
The Six Harmonies Palm
is truly formidable.

689
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,730
Formidable!

690
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,170
Father,

691
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,590
you've mastered the divine skill!

692
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,560
From now on,

693
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,230
neither Yunmen nor the Shengyue Sect

694
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,850
will be a match for me!

695
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,470
Congratulations, Father.

696
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,840
Did you get the Sun Blade back?

697
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,550
Please forgive me for failing to
retrieve the Sun Blade.

698
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,880
However, Yang Qing openly colluded with
that witch from the Shengyue Sect,

699
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,730
and even turned against us for her sake,

700
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,260
following her to Mount Yin.

701
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,190
I've already announced to all major sects
in the martial world

702
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,210
that Yunmen has produced a traitor
who defected to the Shengyue Sect.

703
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,630
Haven't they always been
proud of Yang Qing?

704
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,580
Now that Yang Qing has openly defected to
the Shengyue Sect,

705
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,980
Yunmen's reputation will surely plummet.

706
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,400
Good.

707
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,180
Good.

708
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,290
That's an excellent strategy.

709
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,770
As long as Yunmen declines,

710
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,560
our Biluo Valley will surely rise!

711
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:17,840
You may rise.

712
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,160
Thank you, Father.

713
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,670
My child.

714
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,670
I'll carefully plan

715
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,330
and settle the score with Yunmen.

716
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,420
If Biluo Valley can replace Yunmen,

717
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,720
you'll deserve the greatest credit.

718
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,780
Thank you, Father.

719
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,060
Still won't talk?

720
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,730
You're truly as stubborn as a mule.

721
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,050
Is it so difficult

722
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,520
for you, Yao Fu,
to say you've wronged me, Yuan Yingxing,

723
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,370
just once?

724
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,030
Don't think pretending to be asleep

725
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,350
will make me spare you.

726
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,040
You've humiliated and hurt me,

727
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,330
and you can never repay that debt
in this lifetime.

728
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,040
Get up.

729
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:05,780
Get up right now!

730
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,510
Chief, report!

731
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,720
Chief, Saintess has returned.

732
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,370
Got it.

733
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,180
Yuan Yingxing.

734
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,080
Chief.

735
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:24,920
Yue.

736
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,170
You may return,

737
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,180
but Yang Qing beside you

738
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,960
cannot enter our Shengyue Sect.

739
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,200
Yuan Yingxing, why are you being so petty?

740
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,550
Yang Qing is my husband now.

741
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,680
Why can't he come in?

742
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,920
Husband?

743
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,810
Who gave you permission
to marry Yang Qing?

744
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,010
Without my permission,

745
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,740
how could our sect's Saintess
marry an outsider,

746
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,590
especially when Yang Qing has married
another woman?

747
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,050
How can you tolerate that?

748
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,180
Yuan Yingxing.

749
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,940
Yang Qing has explained everything to me.

750
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,520
It was all Yao Fu's scheme.

751
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,160
And he has sworn to me

752
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,850
that he has never betrayed me.

753
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,530
Yue, you're too naive.

754
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,890
How can you trust a man's word?

755
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,800
It takes two to tango.

756
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,680
He says Yao Fu schemed against him,

757
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,280
and you just believe it?

758
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,670
If you don't let him stay,

759
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,800
I'll leave with him.

760
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:22,900
Chief.

761
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,430
Why are you wearing Yunmen clothes?

762
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,770
Chief, here's what happened.

763
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,740
On our way back, Mingyang and I

764
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,330
happened to run into people from Yunmen,

765
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,010
so I simply forced them

766
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,970
to let us disguise as Yunmen disciples

767
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,540
and escort us back to Mount Yin,

768
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,140
which helped us avoid
Biluo Valley's pursuit.

769
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,880
Well done. Go claim your reward.

770
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,410
Also, Chief,

771
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,920
Elder Shen from Yunmen

772
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,590
was slightly injured while saving Yue.

773
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,390
I need to check on him right away.

774
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,760
Help me check on Yang Qing too
while you're at it.

775
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,310
Alright.

776
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,880
[Yunmen]

777
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,410
Sect Leader, this...

778
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,730
Chief Lu.

779
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,420
What's this supposed to mean?

780
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,430
Feng Xingyun.

781
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,090
Yang Qing and Shen Tianyou
have been gone for ages,

782
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,650
yet they still haven't retrieved

783
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,880
the Alliance Leader's Token
from that witch.

784
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,940
Everyone, tell me,

785
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,880
how can an alliance leader like this

786
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,940
lead us to wipe out the Shengyue Sect?

787
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,590
Exactly!

788
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,900
Feng Xingyun.

789
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,700
The Alliance Leader's Token is lost.

790
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,960
In this martial world, naturally those
with virtue and great skill prevail.

791
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,630
Don't blame our Biluo Valley
for outnumbering

792
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,400
and overwhelming your Yunmen!

793
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,590
If you can defeat me,

794
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,130
I'll submit completely and never bring up
replacing the alliance leader again.

795
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,700
Do you really think
our Yunmen is afraid of confrontation?

796
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,020
Fine. If I lose,

797
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,000
Yunmen will, without question,

798
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,970
surrender the position of alliance leader

799
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,700
and willingly take a back seat.

800
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,880
Well said!

801
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,540
-Sect Leader!
-Sect Leader!

802
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,500
Sect Leader!

803
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,560
Sect Leader!

804
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,240
Sect Leader!

805
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:19,840
Sect Leader!

806
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,500
Are you alright, Sect Leader?

807
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,170
Sect Leader!

808
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,530
Everyone saw that, right?

809
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,470
Feng Xingyun has lost.

810
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,820
I won!

811
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,450
Sect Leader...

812
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,290
Today, I, Lu Jin,
have become the new alliance leader.

813
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:44,250
I promise once again
to all the heroes of the martial world

814
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,870
to eliminate the Shengyue Sect
within a month!

815
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,050
The righteousness
that Yunmen failed to uphold,

816
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,150
Biluo Valley will fulfill!

817
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,100
Congratulations, Alliance Leader!
