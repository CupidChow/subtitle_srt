1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,870
New teachers!

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,610
Hey, hey.

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,990
You guys are being too dramatic.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,200
Be quiet.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,280
I know you're all excited and looking forward to it.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,950
Because I, your Mr. He,

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,820
am going to attend a teaching seminar,

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,870
I won't be able to attend all the classes.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,900
So, I've invited Mr. Zhao Xi to teach you

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,780
physics and chemistry with me.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,950
And by the way,

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,850
the person next to him is your new history and geography teacher,

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,160
Lin Beiting, Mr Lin.

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,610
I'm telling you,

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,200
both of them are outstanding talents who have studied abroad

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,680
at universities which would blow your mind.

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,280
You must learn well from them.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,410
Now, let's have the two teachers introduce themselves.

19
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,980
Hello everyone,

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,050
I'm Zhao Xi.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,350
I'm your senior,

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,160
and I'm also from Tamsui.

23
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,670
I'm not your senior,

24
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,510
but I do like people from Tamsui.

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,590
I'm Lin Beiting.

26
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,289
Feel free to ask me any geography or history questions.

27
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:12,390
Okay.

28
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,340
Let's welcome these two teachers.

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,250
So for the next physics class,

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,270
I'll have Mr. Zhao Xi give you the lesson.

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,730
Don't give him a hard time.

32
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,660
Alright, I'll leave now.

33
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,660
Bye, see you.

34
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,210
Okay.

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,270
Today we'll learn a new law.

36
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,840
What is this law?

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,820
The Law of Conservation of Energy.

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,750
In English, it's called the Conservation of Energy,

39
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,970
and it's also known as Bernoulli's Principle.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,100
Please sit down.

41
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,050
Thank you.

42
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,190
Bernoulli's Principle has many examples

43
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,250
in our daily lives.

44
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,750
Do you know

45
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,360
what the most common one is?

46
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,750
Airplanes.

47
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,990
Due to changes in airflow, different air pressures are created,

48
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,850
which causes the airflow to move.

49
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,180
Just like these two balls:

50
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,840
when we try to blow them apart,

51
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,110
they actually come together.

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,860
When the wind stops,

53
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,140
they separate

54
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,490
and return to their original positions.

55
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,910
This is called...

56
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,290
Bernoulli's Principle.

57
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,980
Okay.

58
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,900
Now you can try it.

59
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,050
I just don't like it.

60
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,950
Make it clear. What don't you like?

61
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,470
I don't like Bernoulli's Principle,

62
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,200
or Qi Jiahao.

63
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,770
He works too hard.

64
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,350
Just like now.

65
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,520
Who...

66
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,290
can help me?

67
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,390
It sucks.

68
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,200
It sucks.

69
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,060
Using this method to prevent me from taking the exam

70
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,990
sucks.

71
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,700
I'll never let you get your way, no matter what.

72
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,010
You're good at fighting, huh?

73
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,770
You're good at it.

74
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,990
Put it down!

75
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,500
Stop running!

76

[Episode 5, Closed: Everything Happened Because of the Wind]

78
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,210
May I come in?

79
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,900
You're late for the exam?

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,030
Where have you been?

81
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,210
Miss, I went to see a doctor.

82
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,870
What have you got?

83
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,440
I have a problem with my brain,

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,880
so I was fooled.

85
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,300
Miss, can I take the exam now?

86
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,700
Oh, hurry up and get in.

87
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,520
You're 12 minutes late.

88
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,310
The listening test is already finished.

89
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,370
Hurry up and write.

90
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,940
Although I missed the listening part,

91
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,900
I can refer to the questions.

92
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,290
The questions in the first section are standalone,

93
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,220
so there's nothing I can do for now.

94
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,970
For the second section,

95
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,230
the dialogues correspond to each other.

96
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,190
By finding the frequently occurring words,

97
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,120
I can grasp the main point of the dialogue

98
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,720
and understand the meaning.

99
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,500
This way, my chances

100
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,970
of guessing correctly will be much higher.

101
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,860
Then,

102
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,920
by using this to backtrack, I might

103
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,450
get some of the first section's questions right.

104
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,240
Time's up. Stop writing.

105
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,210
Pass the exam paper forward.

106
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,409
You might as well just choose C instead of choosing randomly.

107
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:44,210
Otherwise, what if you end up with no points at all?

108
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,440
Miss, do you teach English?

109
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,130
No, I teach geography.

110
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,150
Have you seen the answers for this exam?

111
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,690
No.

112
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,530
Alright, hurry up and pass the papers forward.

113
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,560
Hey, Sheng, Tian, there are seats over here.

114
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,020
Hurry up. There are seats.

115
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,120
I called Sheng and Tian over. Why did you come along?

116
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,100
Sheng,

117
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,320
what happened to you during the English exam this morning?

118
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,400
Yeah, I heard about it too.

119
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,740
You didn't hear the English listening section?

120
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,280
Yes.

121
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,440
Keep your voice down.

122
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,900
I don't want to hold a press conference here.

123
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,159
Someone messed with you!

124
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,360
Keep your voice down!

125
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,640
Anyway,

126
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,200
someone tricked me, saying that Ms. Jin was waiting for me at Joy.

127
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,870
When I got there, I found that Joy was closed

128
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,780
and the owner was nowhere to be found.

129
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,830
Then, as I turned around,

130
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,490
two hooligans blocked my way,

131
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,060
and we ended up fighting.

132
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,840
Did you beat them up?

133
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,040
Did you win the fight?

134
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,270
How is that possible?

135
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,440
Then how did you come back to take the exam?

136
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,560
I took the chance and ran away.

137
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,740
I ran really, really fast,

138
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,420
but still missed the English listening section.

139
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,550
Who holds a grudge against you anyway?

140
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,750
Should I ask my dad

141
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,650
if he can let you retake the listening test?

142
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,230
Will your dad agree?

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,990
I don't know.

144
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,120
Anyways, I think

145
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,390
we should let Big Mouth Xu know about this and have him handle it.

146
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,860
The person who did this has really gone too far,

147
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,800
don't you think?

148
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,130
Yes, yes, let's go find Dean Xu.

149
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,010
Sure, let's go together.

150
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,120
There's strength in numbers.

151
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,850
Let's go.

152
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,180
Sit down.

153
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,040
Thank you very much.

154
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,830
Thank you for not killing me.

155
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,840
What does that mean?

156
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,490
During the last exam,

157
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,289
I got scolded by him for fighting.

158
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,409
This time, when he asks why I was late

159
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,380
and we explain, he'll definitely find out about the fight.

160
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,060
I would definitely get scolded by him.

161
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,390
That's true. We don't have any evidence.

162
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,200
And we can't prove that those two hooligans

163
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,530
got into the school and started the fight.

164
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,580
Alright, then we won't go to my dad for now.

165
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,950
This is really strange. I thought about it.

166
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,540
Why would two hooligans from off-campus

167
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,290
be able to get into our school?

168
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,190
Who holds a grudge against you?

169
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,420
There's only one truth. I got it.

170
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,980
It must be Zhai Tao.

171
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,650
Oh, Zhai Tao.

172
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,190
Zhai Tao? Who?

173
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,240
Zhai Tao.

174
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,370
The trash who kicked Uncle Mute last time.

175
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,120
Oh.

176
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,280
What did those two hooligans look like?

177
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,390
I don't remember clearly.

178
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,790
Anyway,

179
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,950
they were both not very tall, about 1.7 meters.

180
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,860
Black hair.

181
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,950
I also forgot what clothes they were wearing.

182
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,370
I don't really remember

183
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,700
much else.

184
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,140
I'm not criticizing you.

185
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,510
You have face blindness

186
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,120
and can't remember their names.

187
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,460
How do you expect me, a little detective, to figure things out?

188
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,490
They were there to beat me up.

189
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,430
Should they introduce themselves?

190
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,780
I don't know their names.

191
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,780
That makes sense. You're so stupid.

192
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,280
Who usually protects you?

193
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,590
Are you feeling strong and confident now?

194
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,430
Who protects me usually?

195
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,870
Who?

196
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,410
My dad protects me.

197
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,590
Stop picking and eat.

198
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,590
I'm going to Joy.

199
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,460
What for?

200
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
To buy some water.

201
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,450
To buy some water?

202
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,220
Doesn't Tian use a kettle?

203
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,250
I don't know.

204
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,910
He didn't even take a bite.

205
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,700
Are you done picking?

206
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,160
Are you going to eat or not?

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,820
The knife for cutting the ribs must have been used to cut garlic today.

208
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,560
It smells like green onions and garlic.

209
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,680
I can't eat them.

210
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,690
It's really a miracle that you've made it this far.

211
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,070
How did you grow up?

212
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,370
Uncle Zhao.

213
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,930
Don't you have exams today?

214
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,190
What are you doing here in the afternoon?

215
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,120
Buying water.

216
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,990
Oh.

217
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,910
[Waterproof and Breathable Bandage]

218
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,040
Are there still people stealing things?

219
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,100
Of course.

220
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,820
It's dark and empty here at night,

221
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,000
so it's hard to guard against.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,190
Uncle Mute and I have caught several.

223
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,480
Why are you buying band-aids?

224
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,860
How much?

225
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,520
Here.

226
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,410
Just take it.

227
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,910
I'll head out then.

228
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,370
Okay, get back to the exam.

229
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,990
I bought it while I was buying the water.

230
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,200
Are we going to pickle or stir-fry

231
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,800
the cucumbers later?

232
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,110
You're back, Wang.

233
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,880
Yes.

234
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,580
Take a rest. We're going to eat later.

235
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,530
Okay.

236
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,540
This one.

237
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,560
It's done.

238
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,630
Let me help you.

239
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,590
Don't help me. You can't even carry a bowl properly.

240
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,870
What are you doing here? Are you supervising me?

241
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,200
Are you afraid I'll make something awful?

242
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,790
Hello?

243
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,860
Hello.

244
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,530
Are you kidding me?

245
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,780
You only got two points on your Chinese composition?

246
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,990
How come you're as bad as the guy next door to me?

247
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,450
Wow, you're laughing at me.

248
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,080
I even went around asking for answers for you last time.

249
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,570
Wang.

250
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,960
Wait!

251
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,400
Don't come over.

252
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,790
The one in the kitchen is the one who will accompany you for the rest of your life.

253
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,720
As for me, I'll leave the nest after turning 18.

254
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,410
Otherwise, people will say I'm living off my parents.

255
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,940
Don't mess things up for me.

256
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,380
You little brat.

257
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,020
You know what?

258
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,700
The grading teacher actually wrote

259
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,880
that my essay was incoherent and misused idioms.

260
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,710
Please, that teacher has no taste.

261
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,920
So, do you want me to go next door

262
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,870
and borrow some guidance on writing lyrical essays for you?

263
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,890
No need.

264
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,520
Come on. I'm Shakespeare.

265
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,670
I don't need that.

266
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,060
Sheng, do you know that the two hooligans who beat you were caught?

267
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,160
Hey, Crab, I'll call you later.

268
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,020
What are you...

269
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,610
Hello, Sheng.

270
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,310
How did they get caught?

271
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,350
It was Xi.

272
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,910
They were causing a scene at the café,

273
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,490
so Xi and his team gave them a beating and sent them to the police station.

274
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,360
Also,

275
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,310
Joy has installed a new security camera,

276
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,190
so the incident with them beating you got exposed too.

277
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,610
What a coincidence!

278
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,880
They were out of luck.

279
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,570
Xi doesn't even know them.

280
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,900
I told him that they beat you this morning,

281
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,320
and he was shocked.

282
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,920
Hey, I'll send you another picture.

283
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,830
See?

284
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,000
This is called divine justice, the heavens are watching,

285
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,710
and justice prevails.

286
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,410
Take care of Wang.

287
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,040
No need.

288
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,570
Is Tian back?

289
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,600
I'll talk to you later.

290
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,520
Tian's here.

291
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,570
What?

292
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,740
The two hooligans who beat me today were caught.

293
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,560
Do you know?

294
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,890
Yes.

295
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,900
Gao Tianyang showed me the live stream.

296
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,610
Was it you?

297
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,080
What do you mean?

298
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,550
It was captured on the security camera.

299
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,820
Your shoes.

300
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,710
Impossible.

301
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,640
Impossible?

302
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,190
I was so far away.

303
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,579
Yes.

304
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,470
It was me.

305
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,060
Tian, you're back?

306
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,829
Yes!

307
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,280
Wash your hands and clean up.

308
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,670
We'll eat soon.

309
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,710
Okay.

310
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,540
This afternoon, I went to Joy to buy some water

311
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,460
and happened to see two security cameras.

312
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,950
The owner of Joy must have installed them

313
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,620
because he was concerned about thieves at night.

314
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,420
So, I downloaded the footage and sent it to Zhao Xi.

315
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,480
I figured that with so many people coming and going in the store,

316
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,540
there might be a chance to catch them.

317
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,840
But I didn't mention that you got beaten.

318
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,760
It was a coincidence

319
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,790
that those two hooligans were causing a scene.

320
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,420
Would you have told me

321
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,750
if I hadn't found out?

322
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,510
Do you just enjoy doing good deeds?

323
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,680
Would you have kept quiet if I hadn't asked?

324
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,090
I was just thinking

325
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,240
that you must have been very scared at that time,

326
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,960
really hoping someone could help you,

327
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,090
but there was no one.

328
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,950
There was no one there

329
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,940
but yourself,

330
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,060
two hooligans out of nowhere,

331
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,390
and the fear of not knowing whether you could win.

332
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,610
If I were you,

333
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,250
I would probably have been panicking too.

334
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,730
I didn't know about it at the time, so I couldn't help you...

335
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,620
but I didn't want to do nothing at all.

336
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,640
Better late than never.

337
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,810
It's not a big deal. Don't worry.

338
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,330
What?

339
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,600
Well,

340
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,330
I twisted my leg

341
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,010
while fighting this morning.

342
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,580
Carry me upstairs.

343
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,230
Go upstairs.

344
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,080
Don't let my dad or your mom see.

345
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,570
Why are you going upstairs? It's time to eat!

346
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,450
We're here.

347
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,400
Thank you.

348
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,090
Aren't you getting down?

349
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,110
Well,

350
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,200
help me all the way

351
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,080
and take me to the door.

352
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,100
Open the door for me.

353
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,530
Thanks again.

354
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,130
You should skip dinner.

355
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,140
Why?

356
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,190
You need to lose weight.

357
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,100
I take back my thanks.

358
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,840
Hey, wait a minute.

359
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Give me your hand.

360
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,850
Don't get too emotional.

361
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,260
You gave this to me this morning.

362
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,610
There's one piece left.

363
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,870
Does it hurt?

364
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,160
I can be pretty careless.

365
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,690
If it does hurt, let me know.

366
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,590
Okay.

367
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,490
Thank you.

368
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,540
Oh, right.

369
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,190
Did you beat them up for me today?

370
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,920
No.

371
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,280
When they tried to run away, they happened to pass right in front of me,

372
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,010
so I just blocked them a little.

373
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,910
Well, he hit me 6 times today.

374
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,450
Did you block him 6 times?

375
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,060
Definitely more than 6 times.

376
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,400
You two can come down for dinner now!

377
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,380
I'm not eating today.

378
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,250
I'm on a diet.

379
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,240
This guy

380
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,200
must have gone back to bed for a nap.

381
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,450
I'll send the samples to you as soon as I get them tomorrow.

382
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,040
Yes.

383
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,410
Okay.

384
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,580
Everything was made as we discussed before.

385
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,310
Don't worry.

386
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,370
Okay, bye.

387
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,050
Time to eat.

388
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:20,670
Okay.

389
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,280
Let me help you.

390
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,210
Thank you.

391
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,760
Morning, Wang.

392
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,660
Morning.

393
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,730
Come on.

394
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,190
Sit here.

395
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,630
You're finally willing to come down to eat.

396
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,480
Wang,

397
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,020
didn't you say you want to eat Shaomai?

398
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,910
I specifically learned how to make Shaomai online.

399
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,780
Have a try.

400
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,800
If you like it, I'll make it for you again in the future.

401
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,040
Oh.

402
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,590
Where is Jiang Tian?

403
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,650
Oh, he went to the Little White House.

404
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,750
Oh.

405
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,030
Aren't you two going to the English competition today?

406
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,760
Yes.

407
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,250
It's this afternoon.

408
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,080
I'll go later.

409
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,920
Good luck.

410
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,360
Eat more.

411
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,970
Yeah, I don't know what's wrong.

412
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,700
It just isn't cooling anymore.

413
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,330
There's no problem.

414
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,430
There's no problem?

415
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,960
But why isn't it cooling?

416
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,070
Did you accidentally adjust the temperature?

417
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,150
I didn't adjust the temperature.

418
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,820
But sometimes the engine makes this noise,

419
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,100
then it stops for a bit,

420
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,950
and then it makes the same noise again. It sounds weird.

421
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,750
Alright, I've adjusted it back.

422
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,790
It's fine now?

423
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,760
It will gradually get cold.

424
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,410
Let me know if there are any more problems.

425
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,050
Okay.

426
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,580
I'm leaving then.

427
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,000
Hey, wait.

428
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,200
Where are you going in such a hurry? You haven't eaten yet.

429
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,430
I have an English competition this afternoon.

430
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,280
I have an appointment with someone to take the subway together.

431
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,370
You have an appointment with someone?

432
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,040
Yes.

433
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,850
Who?

434
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,430
The person who freeloaded last time.

435
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,230
Wang?

436
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,980
Yes.

437
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,850
How could you say he was a freeloader?

438
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,430
He's so well-behaved,

439
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,940
polite, and not cold like you.

440
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,890
He hasn't come here to eat for a while.

441
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,430
Does he not like my cooking?

442
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,130
No, he actually thinks the school's food is worse than yours.

443
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,390
So, does that mean

444
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,240
he likes my cooking?

445
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,200
Then why didn't he come today?

446
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,390
Did you invite him?

447
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:29,970
I...

448
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,000
I didn't invite him. But you didn't invite him either?

449
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,870
How did you make friends with him?

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,040
Give me your phone.

451
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,040
What are you doing?

452
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,300
Give it to me. Hurry up. No more nonsense.

453
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,380
Wang. Wang.

454
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,860
Wang.

455
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,400
Wang,

456
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,850
Jiang Tian asked you to come over for lunch.

457
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,930
Okay. Hurry up.

458
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,670
Alright.

459
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,360
I'll go cook now.

460
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,690
By the way, there's a bit of a leak in the toilet.

461
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,410
Could you take a look?

462
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,140
What happened to your hand?

463
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,780
It's just a scratch.

464
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,320
I'll take care of it.

465
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,800
Hey, Wang, come.

466
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,810
Let's eat.

467
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,120
Hurry up and eat.

468
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,050
Where is Jiang Tian?

469
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,890
My house is old.

470
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,810
The toilet and the pipes are leaking.

471
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,610
I asked him to check it out for me.

472
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
Oh.

473
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,180
Eat up.

474
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,380
So, he invited me over today

475
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,620
just for lunch,

476
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,100
or can I come here to eat in the future as well?

477
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,340
Actually, it was my invitation.

478
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,240
Oh.

479
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,740
Well...

480
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,440
Today's...

481
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,080
You first.

482
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,180
Well...

483
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,190
Did Tian get into a fight?

484
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,820
I noticed he had a band-aid

485
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,430
on his hand today.

486
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,570
He said it was just a minor scratch by accident.

487
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,170
Even if I ask him,

488
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,310
he won't tell me the truth.

489
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,570
So, did you invite me over today

490
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,980
just to ask about this?

491
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,780
Honestly,

492
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,560
I've never seen Tian be this close

493
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,160
to anyone before,

494
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,340
including me.

495
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,460
He's always been reluctant to interact with others,

496
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,110
so,

497
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,940
he's very cautious

498
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,450
and doesn't want to hurt anyone.

499
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,740
Maybe because he's been hurt himself,

500
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,270
he particularly understands other people's wounds

501
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,790
and needs.

502
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,560
You know,

503
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,280
he's like a martial arts master in those martial arts films—

504
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,030
if someone gets within three feet of him,

505
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,740
they'd be knocked away by his protective aura.

506
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,440
He's been on his own since he was young.

507
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,310
His grandmother and parents have ignored him,

508
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,450
so he isolated himself from them.

509
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,610
No one can see

510
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,230
what's going on in his mind.

511
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,660
He doesn't let anyone get close,

512
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,990
so,

513
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,870
no one can enter his inner world.

514
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,990
You're

515
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,810
the first friend I've seen him

516
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,710
bring over here.

517
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,440
So, I want to ask you

518
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,070
for a favor:

519
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,810
don't let him push you away.

520
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,100
I hope you can get closer to him, okay?

521
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,850
[Qi Jiahao]

522
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,570
How to buy this?

523
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,000
There are so many stations; where do I need to go from and to?

524
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,690
Use this.

525
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,480
I guess you don't have an EasyCard, right?

526
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,700
Here.

527
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,630
Oh.

528
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,480
How much do I own you?

529
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,310
It's okay.

530
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,500
As long as you do well in the English competition.

531
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,070
Even if you don't come in first,

532
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,670
at least aim for the top five.

533
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,860
Okay, I'll keep it with me during the exam

534
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,540
and carry it with me usually,

535
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,270
like an amulet. Okay?

536
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,110
Can you be more dramatic?

537
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,150
[Wang]

538
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,240
Let's go.

539
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:08,890
Okay.

540
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,490
Everyone, remember what I said:

541
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,840
aim for victory from stability and score from risks.

542
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,420
Write down what you know first

543
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,130
to secure your base score.

544
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,120
For what you don't know…

545
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,240
Why are you two so late?

546
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,450
I'll say it again.

547
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,910
You two listen carefully.

548
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,640
Write down what you know first to secure your base score,

549
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,280
and leave what you don't know until the end.

550
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,130
If you have time, make sure to attempt them as well.

551
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,420
Check your answers several times

552
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,850
and don't hand the paper in early.

553
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,150
I've emphasized this many times already.

554
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,790
Don't hand the paper in early.

555
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,790
The exam is about to start.

556
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,830
Get ready to go in.

557
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,480
I'll help you both check in.

558
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,460
Thank you.

559
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,330
Thank you.

560
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,410
Hey, I just called you.

561
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,670
Why didn't you answer?

562
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,280
Oh, sorry about that.

563
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,810
What's wrong?

564
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,710
No. It's just that Ms. Jin asked me to tell you

565
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,550
that it's okay if you didn't do well on this week's test.

566
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:07,080
Focus on doing your best in this competition.

567
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,699
After the exam, she'll talk to you tomorrow.

568
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:13,150
But didn't Ms. Jin say to tell him this after the exam?

569
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,989
You're affecting him right now.

570
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,090
It's okay.

571
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,739
I heard you.

572
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:23,040
It's about time to go in. Let's go.

573
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,730
Hey, wait a minute.

574
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,960
This time I won't sit behind you.

575
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,710
If you run out of pen refills during the exam,

576
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,170
I won't be able to help you.

577
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,200
I brought pencil leads with me.

578
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,340
Take it.

579
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,860
Oh.

580
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,290
What Qi Jiahao did earlier

581
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,910
was to discourage you because you're highly capable.

582
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,230
So, do your best in the exam.

583
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,560
Have faith in yourself.

584
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,470
Do you believe in yourself?

585
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,100
What about you?

586
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,500
Do you believe in me?

587
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,210
Don't let him push you away.

588
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,540
I hope you can get closer to him, okay?

589
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,120
Just like these two balls:

590
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,060
when we try to blow them apart,

591
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,380
changes in airflow

592
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,130
create different air pressures, which causes the airflow to move,

593
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,290
and they actually come together.

594
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,830
Run.

595
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,940
Aren't you good at running?

596
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,230
Keep running.

597
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,060
Playing cool, huh?

598
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,720
Didn't I tell you not to hand in the paper early

599
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,660
and to check your answers several times?

600
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,320
How many times have I told you?

601
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,580
We tried our best.

602
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,580
Miss, we were wrong.

603
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,830
You should admit that you were wrong.

604
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,110
Do you know your score on this week's test?

605
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,580
91,

606
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,890
which is 9 points lower than last time.

607
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,400
In listening, which is your strong suit, you lost 7 points.

608
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,420
And your handwriting—

609
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,040
the grading teacher couldn't even read it.

610
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,970
That's another 2 points off.

611
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,210
I see.

612
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,220
You'd better.

613
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,750
You'd better remember what you said before,

614
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,580
that you would improve by 50 places.

615
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,130
Otherwise, Big Mouth Xu...

616
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,950
Dean Xu will kill you,

617
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,630
and you'll lose your spot as an Excellent Model Student.

618
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,700
Got it?

619
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,820
May I ask how the other students did?

620
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,790
Besides you two,

621
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,560
no one else scored above 90.

622
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,960
What should I do?

623
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,620
What?

624
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,130
Are you two feeling so proud of yourselves now?

625
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,570
After

626
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,590
the competition results come out,

627
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,040
I'll give you a good talking-to.

628
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,370
-May I come in?
-Get out.

629
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,500
Come in.

630
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,220
Oh.

631
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,970
Qi Jiahao.

632
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,570
Luckily, I didn't listen to the proctor and chose C for every question.

633
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,560
Otherwise, I would definitely have lost more than 7 points.

634
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,470
So, you want me to praise you for being good at guessing?

635
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,930
-Why are you so annoying when you talk?
-Hey!

636
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,630
Qi Jiahao, the little English teacher, messed up this time.

637
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,830
He only scored in the 80s.

638
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,250
Ms. Jing asked him to go to her office.

639
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,120
So,

640
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,530
even though your English score might be a bit dismal this time,

641
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,860
you've definitely made

642
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,530
the most progress.

643
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,350
Actually, my English score...

644
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,170
Gao Tianyang,

645
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,020
lend me your math textbook.

646
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:25,910
You didn't bring it?

647
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,660
Yes.

648
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,090
Sure, I can lend it to you.

649
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,070
But I'm going to charge you.

650
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,160
Since we're so familiar, I'll give you a discount.

651
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,700
Go on a date with me after school.

652
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,880
Forget it. Sheng.

653
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,790
Hey, alright.

654
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,880
I was just kidding. I'll lend it to you.

655
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,420
Let's go.

656
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,810
Gao Tianyang, you got the accommodation form?

657
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,470
Yes.

658
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,040
Sheng,

659
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,050
you asked me about accommodation before.

660
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,860
Give this form to me after you finish it.

661
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,980
Okay.

662
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,140
Did you get it?

663
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,900
You want to stay at school?

664
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,140
No.

665
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,160
I just casually asked the monitor for one earlier.

666
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,280
Tian,

667
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,880
this is yours.

668
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,050
After you finish the accommodation form,

669
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,010
make sure to give it to me by this Friday.

670
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:27,820
Remember.

671
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,730
Why are you laughing?

672
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,380
Stop it.

673
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,020
Why do you want to stay at school?

674
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,540
Well...

675
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,920
I just asked the monitor for it casually.

676
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,340
And at that time,

677
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,240
I wasn't familiar with you.

678
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,130
How about now?

679
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,470
Do you still want to stay at school?

680
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,630
No.

681
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,040
Now I'm already quite familiar with you,

682
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,830
right?

683
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,590
And you?

684
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,750
Do you still want to stay at school?

685
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,720
I think I will in the future.

686
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,410
Class begins. Go back to your seats.

687
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,280
Those who are sleeping, wake up.

688
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,450
Before we start, I'd like to announce

689
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,410
the results of the last Excellent Model Student vote.

690
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,240
The winner is Qi Jiahao.

691
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,840
Congratulations to Qi Jiahao.

692
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,330
This time, we're implementing a seating arrangement based on rankings.

693
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,980
So, you'll know your rankings when you see your seats.

694
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,130
I'll distribute the score reports now.

695
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,640
Here.

696
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,550
Sheng,

697
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,620
you've improved by over 50 points in total,

698
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,850
with top three rankings in physics and chemistry school-wide.

699
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,410
Your overall ranking has risen by 47 places.

700
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,880
47?

701
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,640
Unfortunately,

702
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,580
if you had listened to the English listening section,

703
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,580
your ranking could have risen by another 7 or 8 places.

704
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,690
What a pity.

705
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,450
Indeed.

706
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,270
All that effort seems to have been in vain.

707
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,300
Just like these two balls:

708
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,200
when we try to blow them apart,

709
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,500
changes in airflow

710
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,260
create different air pressures, which causes the airflow to move,

711
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,410
and they actually come together.

712
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,450
This is called...

713
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,470
It's not poisonous.

714
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,410
Haws help with digestion and prevent diarrhea.

715
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,110
I remember I told you

716
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,370
that when I was young, I was very afraid of the dark

717
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:22,970
and always slept with my mom.

718
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:26,880
Later, my mom got sick,

719
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,110
so I slept with my dad.

720
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,840
At that time, our house was very small,

721
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,120
but there was always someone by my side.

722
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,100
As the house got bigger,

723
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:45,200
it seemed like more people came into the house,

724
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,830
but I found myself alone.

725
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:56,540
Do you know why I hate Bernoulli's Principle?

726
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:05,410
Because it sounds like "effort in vain," and I hate that.

727
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,150
Effort

728
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,360
without results.

729
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,360
The same goes for trying be an Excellent Model Student.

730
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,580
And the same goes for wanting you to stay.

731
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,310
Do you know why I hate Qi Jiahao?

732
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,880
Because the harder one works,

733
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,950
the more pitiful one seems.

734
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,650
Everything

735
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,480
happened because of the wind.

736
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,220
Once the wind stops,

737
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,450
everything will return to normal.

738
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:09,770
[Jiang Tian's Very Moment]

739
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:10,600
[Your friend Wang Wang Xianbei has changed their profile picture and name]

740
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,330
A teenager's mind is like the weather in June.

741
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,580
When it's pouring rain and overcast,

742
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,480
it feels like the clouds will never clear.

743
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,640
But as soon as the rain stops,

744
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,330
everything brightens up immediately

745
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,600
with the sun shining brightly.
