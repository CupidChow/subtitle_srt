00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,240
I'm in...

2
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,870
Jiang Tian's room.

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,970
Where is he?

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,280
Did we sleep in the same bed last night?

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,000
Good morning.

6
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,640
Morning.

7
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,030
So,

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,930
did you sleep well in someone else's bed?

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,330
Don't be so petty. It's just one night.

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,670
So petty.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,890
I'm going back to my room.

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,660
Am I running away after sleeping with him?

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,240
"Sleeping with him?"

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,500
What are you thinking?

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,900
Hey, Jiang Tian...

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:51,790
Huh?

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,300
Where is he?

18
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,840
Was he scared off by my morning wood?

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,410
I don't believe

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,610
that, as a healthy young adult,

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,190
he wouldn't have morning wood when waking up.

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,710
I must be dreaming just now.

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,350
Now that he's not here,

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,070
I should better be going.

25
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,470
Why did I sleep here last night?

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,480
Can you black out even without drinking?

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,360
I wonder who was clinging to my bed

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,090
like a post-it note last night.

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,280
Sometimes, when people are extremely tired,

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,539
they may feel a bit tipsy.

31
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:33,830
You call that tipsy?

32
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,789
That's more like being falling-down drunk.

33
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,210
Can't you just forget about it? So petty.

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,310
Again?

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,560
Where did you sleep last night?

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
What do you think?

37
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,950
There's only one bed here.

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,140
Where else can I sleep?

39
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,800
Right.

40
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,230
Change your clothes and let's have breakfast.

41
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,030
Well...

42
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,320
Wait a moment. I'm not ready yet.

43
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,850
I forgot my phone in the bathroom.

Sheng.

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,070
You've been changing your screen name quite often recently.

50
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,800
Why are you so interested in me?

51
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,850
I'm not the one who noticed it.

52
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,030
It's Pepper...

53
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,740
Gao Tianyang, what?

54
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,570
Yeah, yeah. It is me who is up to no good.

55
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,870
I've been staring at Sheng's screen name for no reason.

56
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,860
Is that okay?

57
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,780
-Our Sheng is handsome and good at studying.
-Shut up!

58

Where can we find such a talented and handsome boy?

The more I think about it, the more it makes sense.

Sheng, be gay,

61
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,460
so I can have a taste of puppy love.

Sorry to take up your morning self-study time

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,830
to handle something.

66
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,080
We still need to reselect the Excellent Model Students.

67
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,480
Let's do a secret ballot.

68
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,150
Please distribute the paper for me.

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,450
Please write the name on it.

70
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,830
Then, we don't have to write the names

71
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,610
of the students who were chosen last time.

72
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,130
One more thing.

73
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,500
I mentioned the criteria for Excellent Model Students last time.

74
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,670
One spot will be selected from the class cadres,

75
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,450
another will be based on grades, and a third will go to the student
with the greatest improvement.

76
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,540
As you all know,

77
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,120
Jiang Tian has held the No. 1 position in the grade for a long time,

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,570
and you can all see the great rise in Sheng Wang's ranking.

79
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,820
Originally, these two spots were supposed to be theirs.

80
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,250
However,

81
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,700
these two students,

82
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,400
firstly, are very confident,

83
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,780
and secondly, they want to give others a chance.

84
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,180
So, they willingly give up these two spots.

85
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,620
So, the spot will go to the students in second place.

86
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,280
Li Jia.

87
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,900
Your total score ranks second in the grade in two exams.

88
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,440
And I remember you had a high vote last time.

89
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,370
Then, we'll give one spot to Li Jia.

90
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,100
Is that alright with everyone?

91
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,840
Thank you. Thank you, teacher.

92
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,070
Pepper, good for you!

93
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,490
Sit down.

94
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,680
Sit down.

95
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,710
Then, Gao Tianyang,

96
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,409
you've improved by 64 points compared to last time,

97
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:54,110
and your rank has gone up by 78 places.

98
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,659
You are the student with the second-most improved performance in the class.

99
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:59,520
So, let's give the other spot to Gao Tianyang, okay?

100
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,550
Darn it, me?

101
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,830
Stop cursing. It's you.

109
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,180
Isn't there a saying

110
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,310
that when two people no longer stand on ceremony with each other

111
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,370
and can comfortably share both troubles and honors...

112
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,490
they are then friends?

113
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,420
Why are you smiling?

114
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,980
Then, I'll announce the voting results.

115
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,910
The spot selected from the class cadres is Li Yu.

116
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
The one who has received the most votes is Xu Tianshu.

117
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,659

124
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,380

125
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,920

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,490
Don't let me see you!

127
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,210

128
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,490

136
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,280
He can't come because of something at school.

137
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,230
Luckily.

138
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,470
It's good that he didn't come.

139
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,220
Oh, right.

140

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,570
who just left just now?

142

You saw the man?

143
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,120
Yeah.

144
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,560
He passed me by.

145
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,850
That's Ji Huanyu.

146
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,080
Ji Huanyu?

147
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,330
Tian's dad.

148
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,970
Oh, right. My dad told me about it.

149
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,350
He used to live here too.

150
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,280
Can I have a look?

151
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,100
Here.

152
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,040
These photos

153
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,020
are a bit old.

154
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,600
You young people don't get photos developed anymore, right?

155
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,730
Who is this person?

156
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,970
That's two different people.

157
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,110
Oh, right.

158
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,630
No wonder one's a color photo and the other's black-and-white.

159
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,160
They feel like they are from a different time.

160

This cat

161
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,140
seems to be the one Jiang Tian used as his profile photo.

162
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,230
I think so.

163
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,380
So, this is Jiang Tian?

164
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,660
Uh-huh.

165
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,240
Then this man...

166
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,570
Ji Huanyu.

167
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,840
Ji Huanyu is really not a good man.

168
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,760
Tian had a difficult childhood with him when he was little.

169
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,620
Tian wasn't happy

170
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,950
when he was little?

171
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,530
Unhappy and had a tough life.

172
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,370
Just like a stray cat.

173
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,110
When Tian was little,

174
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,430
Ji Huanyu

175
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,910
and Tian's mother

176
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,910
were always away and busy.

177
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,280
So, they sent him to his grandmother.

178
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,030
His grandmother had Alzheimer's.

179
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,000
She often locked Tian out and didn't let him in.

180
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,110
Grandma!

181
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,010
Grandma!

182
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,280
Grandma!

183
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,490
Tian would sit outside the door all day,

184
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,840
having nothing to eat.

185
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,880
He was shy

186
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,650
and didn't want others to know that he was locked out

187
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,580
and didn't want to disturb others.

188
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,360
At that time, I had a cat named "Captain."

189
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,150
Sometimes, when Tian couldn't get into the house,

190
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,530
he would play with Captain

191
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,900
at the door.

192
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,270
And I'd take this chance

193
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,090
to bring Tian back to my home

194
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,200
so that he could

195
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,510
have something to eat.

196
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,470
I was looking for my cat.

197
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,360
So, you have it.

198
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,410
Grandpa, what's the name of this cat?

199
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,500
Its name is Captain. Is it a good name?

200
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,820
Yes.

201
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,640
Why don't you go inside?

202
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,040
Your grandma is not home?

203
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,720
Then, how about coming to my place and waiting for her again?

204
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,100
Okay.

205
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,140
Okay, let's go.

206
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,800
Hold it tightly. I'll take your bag for you.

207
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,650
You're hungry, right?

208
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,840
Captain was a stray cat.

209
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,630
I think Tian was so close to the cat

210
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,590
because he probably felt they were similar.

211
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,370
What about Captain?

212
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,530
It's dead.

213
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,410
Captain lived outdoors.

214
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,990
Tian

215
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,800
would often wait for it outside,

216
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,600
waiting for it to come back.

217
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,330
He told me

218
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,690
that as long as he waited there, Captain would come back.

219
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,110
But the cat never came back.

220
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,060
Seeing Jiang Tian so lonely

221
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,070
must have made Auntie Jiang very sad, right?

222
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,460
You know Jiang?

223
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,580
Oh, yes, that...

224
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,290
Actually, Auntie Jiang is sort of with my dad now.

225
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,870
They may get married soon.

226
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,750
Right, right.

227
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,050
I heard about it, but I forgot.

228
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,360
So, you and Tian are kind of brothers now.

229
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,780
Sort of.

230
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,440
It's good for Jiang to have a new boyfriend.

231
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,280
I watched her grow up.

232
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,310
She was diligent and filial when she was young.

233
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,960
She had a lot of jobs

234
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,470
to pay for her mother's medical expenses and support Tian.

235
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,450
She had a lot of side jobs in Taipei too.

236
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,650
But she just didn't have the time to accompany Tian,

237
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,220
so she felt very guilty.

238
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,350
Sometimes, when she came back to see Tian,

239
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,100
her eyes were so swollen from crying that they looked like walnuts.

240
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,930
Jiang Tian had such a miserable childhood.

241
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,090
What about his father?

242
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,200
He...

243
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,190
He is an orphan.

244
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,870
He was often bullied when he was young.

245
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,730
When he grew up,

246
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,420
he wanted to do big things and achieve something.

247
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,320
In the end, he couldn't do anything well

248
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,380
and was unwilling to take care of his child at home.

249
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,290
One time, he suddenly changed

250
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,450
and came back to accompany Tian.

251
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,470
He accompanied him for a whole year.

252
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,160
Isn't that good?

253
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,100
Not at all.

254
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,380
He didn't know how to take care of a child.

255
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,110
One day,

256
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,670
Tian came to my house,

257
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,810
and I found a burn on the back of his neck.

258
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,210
A few days later,

259
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,630
he had a fever and vomited at my house.

260
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,470
Then Jiang took him back.

261
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,560
Soon after,

262
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,920
she divorced Ji Huanyu.

263
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,180
About that scar on his neck, was it Ji...

264
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,670
That's what I asked him.

265
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,180
He said no.

266
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,970
I think

267
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,120
he didn't want to tell me the truth.

268
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,770
That's how he is.

269
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,990
He won't say anything

270
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,190
and will take everything upon himself.

271
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,350
Later,

272
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,990
I don't know why

273
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,820
but Tian wandered around.

274
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,540
He'd live with people who had a spare room.

275
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,230
I often saw him carrying luggage,

276
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,860
crashing at someone's house here or there.

277
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,940
He couldn't be close to anyone,

278
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,030
and no one could keep him around.

279
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,300
Jiang Tian!

280
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,010
Why...

281
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,970
are you packing?

282
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,910
I haven't.

283
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,250
It's always been left like this.

284
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,569
No wonder

285
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,450
his suitcase is always packed neatly

286
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,470
as if he is ready to leave at any moment.

287
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,700
Turns out that staying in one place

288
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,680
is very difficult for him.

289
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,730
Now that

290
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,490
you have lunch with me

291
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,940
and I stay at your house,

292
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,820
don't regret it.

293
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,880
I will not regret it!

294
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,730
Sheng, where have you been?

295
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,930
It's time for the lunch break roll call.

296
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,620
Grandpa Ding, I'm leaving. I'm late for class.

297
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,570
Oh.

298
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,880
I'm going to start taking attendance now.

299
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,790
Chief of Discipline,

300
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,600
check if anyone has sneaked their phone in with them.

301
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,190
Okay.

302
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,910
Everyone, put away your phones,

303
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,540
or I'll have to write down your names.

304
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,320
Gao Tianyang.

305
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,980
Here.

306
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,370
Feng Xinhua.

307
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,230
Yes.

308
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,540
-Zhou Yueqiao.
-Cover for me.

309
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,140
Yes.

310
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,070
I'll be right back.

311
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,030
Chen Dongxiang.

312
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,590
Yes.

313
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,430
I'll say that you don't feel well and have gone to the health room.

314
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,360
-Gu Youjia.
-Hurry back.

315
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,110
Yes.

316
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,470
Qi Jiahao.

317
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,050
He's not here.

318
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,360
Does anyone know where he went?

319
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,990
Qi Jiahao's been away a lot lately. Did something happen to him?

320
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,410
I seem to have seen him walking toward Road 3 with Zhai Tao.

321
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,140
Okay, I'll write his name down.

322
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,900
Song Sirui.

323
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,460
Yes.

324
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Xu Tianshu.

325
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,630
Really? Why are they going there?

326
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,750
How would I know? Put away your phone.

327
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,170
And remember it.

328
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,310
Jiang Tian.

329
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,120
Jiang Tian?

330
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,250
He was here just now.

331
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,280
Does anyone know where he went?

332
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,810
Just now, I seem

333
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,670
to have seen him walking toward Road 3 with Zhai Tao.

334
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,240
Uncle Zhao!

335
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,890
Have you seen Sheng Wang?

336
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,800
Wang? No.

337
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,500
But I saw the students who gave him trouble.

338
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,030
Hey.

339
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,190
You should be careful too.

340
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,930
I'm afraid they'll come to you too.

341
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,390
After all, you're the one who reported them.

342
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,370
What's wrong?

343
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,200
Are you sure you didn't see Wang?

344
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,360
Where did he go?

345
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,250
I have to go.

346
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,990
Hey, wait.

347
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,380
What's going on?

348
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,250
How could it be you?

349
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,980
Sheng Wang.

350
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,470
Lin, Xi, it's you.

351
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,980
Have you seen Jiang Tian?

352
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,050
Jiang Tian?

353
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,810
He should be in the classroom for lunch break.

354
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,790
What's wrong?

355
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,390
Do you know Jiang Tian's father?

356
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,500
Yes, I do. Ji Huanyu.

357
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,630
I saw him near Old Ding's place today.

358
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,790
We can't let him find Jiang Tian.

359
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,110
I'm afraid he'll take Jiang Tian away.

360
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,240
T-T-Take him away?

361
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,330
Where?

362
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,590
We saw him near the Little White House yesterday.

363
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,590
We guess he was there for Jiang Tian.

364
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,050
No one knows what he wants.

365
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,370
Anyway, we should be on our guard

366
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,810
and protect Jiang Tian.

367
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,340
Okay, I got it.

368
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,830
I'll keep an eye on him too.

369
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,810
Okay, you go back for the lunch break.

370
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,020
Bye.

371
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,030
Bye.

372
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,850
Tian heard that Zhai Tao and Qi Jiahao showed up at Road 3,

373
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,790
so he went to look for you.

374
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,950
Have you seen him?

375
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,210
When I thought I was abandoned by the whole world

376
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,410
and believed that no matter how hard I tried, my efforts were futile,

377
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,670
actually, I forgot...

378
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,670
that someone doesn't even have a home...

379
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,730
but still works hard for me

380
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,140
and uses all his powers

381
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,110
to protect me.

382
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,130
How could it be you?

383
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,460
Where have you been?

384
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,550
Ms. Jing has been taking attendance, you know?

385
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,640
From now on,

386
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,130
I'll always be by your side.

387
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:42,980
That's all.

388
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,280
Let's go. Let's...

389
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,380
go to a place.

390
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,670
Hey.

391
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,520
Let's go.

392
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,460
Hey, where are you going?

393
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,590
We can't get out now.

394
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,710
Hey!

395
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,630
What do you want?

396
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,110
Climb over.

397
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,520
Why?

398
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,950
Because

399
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,080
I've never skipped a class before.

400
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,490
Don't tell me you haven't skipped a class either.

401
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,540
I have seen someone who does it.

402
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,860
Will it count if you've seen it?

403
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,720
Then, does witnessing a murder make you a murderer?

404
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,280
Oh, I found that you're really talented at it.

405
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,120
You can bring together things that are completely unrelated.

406
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,580
And you can't refute me,

407
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,700
right?

408
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,910
What are you doing?

409
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,460
Run.

410
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,560
What are you doing?

411
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,570
Stop!

412
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,630
Which class are you in?

413
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,660
Come back!

414
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,940
Gao Tianyang.

415
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,290
Yes, Ms. Jing.

416
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,650
Where are Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian?

417
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,050
Sheng Wang went to the health room.

418
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,270
What about Jiang Tian?

419
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Jiang Tian?

420
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,940
Jiang Tian...

421
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,660
Are you going to say that he went to the health room too?

422
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,340
Maybe.

423
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,630
Ms. Jing, having lived to this age, I've realized

424
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,910
that anything

425
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,280
is possible.

426
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,900
Impossible!

427
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,750
I just called and checked in with the health room.

428
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,280
Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian aren't there at all.

429
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,160
Sheng.

430
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,360
Tian.

431
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,030
Then, that's a good thing.

432
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,990
It means that they are in good health. They're fine.

433
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,190
Am I right? Applause.

434
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
It's a good thing.

435
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,030
Gao Tianyang!

436
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,400
You...

437
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,430
go to the back of the classroom now,

438
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,630
do a half-squat, and hold the position.

439
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,050
As long as they've not returned,

440
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,480
keep squatting until Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian have.

441
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,510
Did you hear me?

442
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,650
Yes.

443
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,110
Then, squat now.

444
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,660
Ms. Jing, I can't squat deeper.

445
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,730
I may offend public morals and decency if I go deeper.

446
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,930
You won't lead me to commit any crimes, will you, Ms. Jing?

447
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,600
So what?

448
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,360
No one can see you from the back.

449
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,310
Squat.

450
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,970
Hurry up.

451
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,470
Alright, everyone.

452
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,010
Stop laughing.

453
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,490
Stop looking at him.

454
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,020
Now open your English textbooks.

455
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,030
Gao Tianyang!

456
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,380
Squat still.

457
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,920
Turn to page 180.

458
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,230
Are you okay?

459
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,230
As the saying goes,

460
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,650
"Lie down wherever you fall."

461
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,120
Let's take a break here.

462
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,200
What do you want?

463
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,680
I was just chased so hard by the security guard.

464
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,420
Now we can't go back to school now.

465
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,080
Why don't we lie down here and take a rest?

466
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,340
Lie with me for a while.

467
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,330
Jiang Tian,

468
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,700
I suddenly feel

469
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,510
that you're about my age.

470
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,050
Don't you want to rest?

471
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,110
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

472
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,970
Where do you want to go later?

473
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,520
I need to think about it.

474
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,190
Okay.

475
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,770
My turn.

476
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,750
Okay, you do it.

477
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,550
My turn. My turn.

478
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,340
One more.

479
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,040
One, two!

480
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,620
Yeah! Double hits!

481
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,720
Yeah!

482
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:37,820
Hey, Jiang Tian.

483
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,370
Look over there.

484
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,070
I asked you to stay at home for the kids' sake before.

485
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,280
I think I was too harsh with what I said to you.

486
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,490
So, I asked you out.

487
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,430
What are they doing here?

488
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,090
I hope you don't take it to heart.

489
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:48,820
I don't know.

490
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,320
It's okay. I'm fine.

491
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,940
Right, weren't you worried

492
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,570
if Tian would get used to it or not?

493
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,230
Look at how happy they are now.

494
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,370
Then we...

495
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,130
Don't you want to know about my mom...

496
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,370
-No, your dad...
-Then we can relax a little, right?

497
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:06,780
No.

498
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,420
Don't you want to know

499
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,770
how they're dating?

500
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,140
I don't.

501
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,980
Oh.

502
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,380
-But I want to.
-Yeah.

503
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,580
No. Hey.

504
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
But I still think

505
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,980
that he hasn't told me his true feelings.

506
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,140
Hey, Ou.

507
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,830
We need to take it slow.

508
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,010
Some things can't be rushed.

509
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,310
But some things need to be dealt with first.

510
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,650
For example...

511
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,830
What is it?

512
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,320
Well,

513
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,120
our family and our future.

514
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,920
Let's get...

515
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,220
I know. You mean,

516
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,060
we have more people in our family now,

517
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,920
so we need to get our expenses under control, right?

518
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,570
My dad is so stupid.

519
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,580
Let me create a romantic atmosphere for him.

520
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,160
Hey!

521
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,010
I'm warning you, don't do anything stupid.

522
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,130
Ou.

523
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,950
Will you marry me?

524
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,090
He proposed.

525
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,260
Dad.

526
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,180
What are you doing?

527
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,040
Gao Tianyang!

528
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,370
Are you done?

529
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,430
Wait!

530
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,470
Hurry.

531
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,780
Go inside.

532
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,010
Thank you.

533
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,430
I was momentarily swayed by sympathy. You looked so pitiful.

534
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,360
You're welcome.

535
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,530
So, does this mean I can get your help anytime

536
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,600
if I appeal to your sympathy?

537
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,240
You can do that.

538
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,110
Then you have to be more pitiful than you are today.

539
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,480
Oh no.

540
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,090
I might not be able to get you to help me anymore.

541
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,880
Do you even know yourself?

542
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,570
You have opportunities every day,

543
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,070
at any time, okay?

544
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,590
What do you mean by "every day, at any time...

545
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,240
Alright.

546
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,130
I'll tell Sheng that you're a good girl

547
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,450
and virtuous.

548
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,330
Why... why would you tell him that?

549
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,110
I shouldn't tell him, but tell Tian instead.

550
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,040
But in this way, Sheng will never know

551
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,740
how virtuous

552
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,340
and adorable our Pepper is.

553
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:32,840
You...

554
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,500
What?

555
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,190
Go in.

556
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,350
If you want to go tell him that, go by yourself.

557
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,500
Magic bracelets, come and take a look!

558
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,320
Come and take a look!

559
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,670
Come and take a look, my friends!

560
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,030
Hey, boss.

561
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,520
Yes?

562
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,199
Do your bracelets have any special meaning?

563
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,699
Let me tell you, once you wear my bracelets,

564
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,860
whether you are family, friends, or lovers,

565
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,239
your bond with them will definitely last forever.

566
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,130
Feel it.

567
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:22,270
Let me take a look.

568
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,350
Okay, thank you.

569
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,420
Boss,

570
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,370
I'd like these two.

571
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,659
Good choice.

572
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,250
May your bond last forever!

573
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,989
What are you looking at?

574
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,480
Watching them clean.

575
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,409
What's so interesting about cleaning?

576
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,370
Youth.

577
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,100
Once you grow up,

578
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,969
you can never go back to it.

579
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,030
Zhao Xiaoxi.

580
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,890
Jenny Yang.

581
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,080
How is it?

582
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,680
How does it feel to come back and be a teacher?

583
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
What do you think?

584
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,090
Not bad, right?

585
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,810
Thank you for your help.

586
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,950
You're welcome.

587
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,850
Is this the friend you mentioned that you met abroad?

588
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,860
Why don't you introduce him?

589
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,390
Mr. Lin... from the History Department.

590
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,720
Hello, I'm Yang Jing.

591
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,830
I teach English.

592
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,060
You may call me Jenny.

593
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,930
Jenny.

594
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,340
Hello, I'm Benny.

595
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,180
How's school? Are you settling in well?

596
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,100
Not bad.

597
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,080
That's good.

598
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,600
I'll get back to work.

599
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,020
If you need anything,

600
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,260
you can contact me later.

601
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:38,890
I'm going.

602
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,780
Okay, thank you.

603
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,390
Bye.

604
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,110
You're quite close with Jenny, aren't you?

605
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,120
We went to the same high school.

606
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,980
Since returning from abroad, she's the only person I've kept in touch with.

607
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,370
I came back to become a substitute teacher because of her as well.

608
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,100
Does this count as being close?

609
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,420
Yes.

610
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,520
Candied green mangoes.

611
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,580
Sweet and sour. It was my favorite snack when I was a kid.

612
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,180
Since I went to Shanghai, I've rarely had them.

613
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,020
Delicious food should be shared with good friends.

614
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,750
Have a piece.

615
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,300
Come on.

616
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,420
I don't eat snacks.

617
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,890
You're such a picky eater,

618
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,510
yet you like this kind of snack?

619
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,520
Because it's delicious.

620
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,680
Oh, right.

621
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,930
Why did you suddenly yank me away?

622
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,800
I missed my dad's grand proposal all because of you.

623
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,320
I was afraid that you might ruin it.

624
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,230
No way!

625
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,990
I was going to help them.

626
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,570
Blowing some bubbles on the side for them

627
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,900
and singing some songs.

628
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,530
My dad was so clumsy when he proposed.

629
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,590
I was so worried.

630
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,940
But

631
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,310
if your mom agrees to marry my dad,

632
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,080
we'll become real brothers.

633
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,890
Will you be upset about this?

634
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,320
Help me tie the bracelet.

635
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,800
I want this one.

636
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,330
I'll tie this on you later.

637
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,490
You know?

638
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,370
Actually, I always think

639
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,850
that the Guanyin Mountain by the Tamsui River is quite spiritual.

640
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,480
As long as you pray to it with all your heart,

641
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,510
it will fulfill your wishes.

642
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,060
Come on.

643
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:44,830
So,

644
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,510
let's live on campus together.

645
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:49,970
You and I,

646
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,550
together.

647
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,570
Why?

648
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,580
Because that will be a place that truly belongs to you.

649
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,330
Am I right?

650
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,920
A real home.

651
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,480
Compared to staying with your dad for a while,

652
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,760
with your mom,

653
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,140
and with Old Ding,

654
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,550
never knowing when you can unpack your luggage

655
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,310
or whether you should pack,

656
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,400
school

657
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,060
is actually the most reassuring place for you.

658
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,450
Although you can't stay in the dorm forever,

659
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,690
at least you'll have a clear timeline.

660
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,870
A place that gives you a sense of belonging and security,

661
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,530
one that truly belongs to you,

662
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,630
is something you'd want, right?

663
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,560
So, you and I,

664
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,860
together.

665
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,830
Okay.

666
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,320
You know what?

667
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,420
I found it when I was peeking at your lyrical writing guide

668
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,880
that wrapping one arm around one's shoulder

669
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,300
signifies friendship.

670
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
But I think we are more than friends;

671
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,990
we're family.

672
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,670
Was Big Mouth Xu called that when he was very young?

673
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,550
He already had a big mouth when he was a kid,

674
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,790
but we all called him Little Mouth Xu.

675
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,090
You call him Big Mouth Xu?

676
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,630
No.

677
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,920
At least we never call him that in public.

678
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,210
But we call his son Little Mouth Xu.

679
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,400
Eat up. Hurry up.

680
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,580
Have more vegetables. Hurry up.

681
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,070
It's good.

682
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,280
Don't be picky.

683
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,230
Wang, here.

684
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,550
Give me some.

685
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,050
Of course.

686
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,980
Thank you.

687
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,360
Eat more.

688
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:11,930
You too.

689
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,150
Exams also require physical strength.

690
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,350
Dad.

691
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,280
Why are you suddenly calling me "Dad"?

692
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Didn't you always call me Old Sheng?

693
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,130
What's wrong?

694
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,750
We have something to tell you.

695
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,690
-Mom.
-Dad.

696
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:36,660
-We've decided to live on campus together.
-We've decided to live on campus together.

697
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,380
-Live on campus?
-Live on campus?

698
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,780
Are you kidding me?

699
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,950
Why live on campus when you have a home?

700
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,170
No!

701
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,700
God has taken away people's timidity.

702
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:54,130
Young boys' love is both passionate and intense.

703
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,450
At that moment, the setting sun cast its light

704
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,050
on the winding Tamsui River.

705
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,280
The patterned window is rimmed with gold.

706
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,680
The feathers on the keychain are outlined in a dazzling glow.

707
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,410
Time passes as gently and enduringly

708
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,700
as this blessing does.

709
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,890
Change your clothes and let's have breakfast.

710
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,060
[Jiang Tian's Very Moment]

711
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:17,950
Well...

712
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,070
Wait a minute. I'm not ready yet.

713
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,700
I forgot my phone in the bathroom.

714
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:03,700
No wonder someone would block himself with a book

715
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,210
and bend down.
