00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,210
The fourth answer.

175
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,260
Should we change our answers?

176
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,590
Of course.

177
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,740
Tian’s answer is definitely correct.

178
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,860
And...

179
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,980
Question 7?

180
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,970
Question 9. Question 9.

181
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,970
I chose E too.

182
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,450
Sheng Wang!

183
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,160
Sorry.

184
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,640
By the way,

185
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,150
the next class is with Zhaocai.

186
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,550
You haven't had her class before, have you?

187
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,790
Zhaocai?

188
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,160
Yes, Chinese teacher.

189
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,070
She’s round, and when she talks, she’s like this,

190
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,280
like a lucky cat.

191
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,890
So we call her Zhaocai.

192
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,980
What's her real name?

193
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,500
I forgot.

194
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,250
What should I call her?

195
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,240
Just call her Zhaocai.

196
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,880
That’s what everyone calls her. She won’t mind.

197
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,430
Okay.

198
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,000
Also, if you have any questions in the future,

199
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,820
just come to me.

200
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,880
I've got your back.

201
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,740
Okay.

202
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,120
Have you all got your papers?

203
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,940
Yes.

204
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,870
I know this exam was a bit difficult.

205
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,750
In the essay section, it was easy to go off-topic.

206
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,200
As for the second reading comprehension passage,

207
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,990
the average score for the entire grade was quite low.

208
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,090
As for the poetry analysis part…

209
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,620
Forget it.

210
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,620
Let's just say I didn’t have

211
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,030
high expectations for you in poetry analysis,

212
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,100
but you really can’t be this off the mark.

213
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Out of the whole class, not even ten of you got it right.

214
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,370
Speaking of which,

215
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,950
I have to take a moment

216
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,110
to commend your new transfer student.

217
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,680
Where’s the transfer student?

218
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,100
Look at Sheng Wang.

219
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,910
He just transferred here

220
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,110
and hasn’t even covered the material for this test,

221
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,840
but his grasp of the fundamentals is impressive.

222
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,800
He didn’t lose a single point in the poetry analysis

223
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,420
and reading comprehension,

224
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,330
and his essay was excellent too.

225
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,810
Come on, let's give him a round of applause.

226
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,250
However,

227
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,240
I do have a suggestion for you.

228
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,950
You need to work on your handwriting.

229
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,060
It doesn’t have to be beautiful,

230
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,400
but at least make sure each character stands upright,

231
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,560
not slouched over.

232
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,240
It doesn’t look good.

233
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,960
Mr. Sheng,

234
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:35,970
you can do it!

235
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,860
Messy handwriting.

236
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,790
You can do it!

237
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,120
Hey.

238
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,340
Why are you laughing?

239
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,990
At least he can write something.

240
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,250
Unlike some students,

241
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
when asked to write a lyrical essay,

242
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,080
their writing comes out as rigid as a formula.

243
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,080
Can you be a bit more sensitive?

244
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,770
I won’t say who it is,

245
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,760
Jiang Tian.

246
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,650
Let’s look at the first question of the reading comprehension test.

247
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,170
Don't say I didn't tell you.

248
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,970
Zhaocai’s style is to call on whoever got it wrong.

249
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,700
Whoever got it wrong? What do you mean?

250
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,720
Jiang Tian.

251
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,400
Stand up.

252
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,359
What should the answer to this question be?

253
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,070
A.

254
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,410
Are you sure it’s A?

255
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,240
Do you want to double-check before answering?

256
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,740
D.

257
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,170
Alright, everyone.

258
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,210
What’s the answer to this question?

259
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,410
C.

260
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,780
The answer is C.

261
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,320
We should be able to understand the meaning of the text.

262
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,930
Be a bit more sensitive, okay?

263
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,730
Sit down.

264
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,230
Alright.

265
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,180
Let's look at the last reading comprehension question.

266
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,510
It’s on the second page.

267
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,490
"Wang Youjun Pretending to Sleep"

268
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,310
As the title suggests, Wang Youjun refers to Wang Xizhi.

269
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,160
And why was he called "Youjun?"

270
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,950
This "Youjun" was neither Wang Xizhi's name nor his pseudonym.

271
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,240
Just a friendly reminder.

272
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,040
Zhaocai ends class on time.

273
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,760
What does that mean?

274
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,250
That means we can go to the cafeteria on time.

275
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:56,910
Listen,

276
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,750
as soon as the bell rings,

277
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,010
rush out immediately.

278
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,220
Life is really tough.

279
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,220
-Those freshmen...
-Gao Tianyang.

280
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,620
What are you talking about?

281
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,910
Nothing.

282
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,810
Then how about sharing it with the whole class?

283
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,880
I just said...

284
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,810
that those freshmen...

285
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,030
Louder. Repeat it three times.

286
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,830
I'll only end class when you finish.

287
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,620
Come on. Say it.

288
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,410
I just said...

289
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,410
Those freshmen animals run faster than dogs!

290
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,160
Those freshmen animals run faster than dogs!

291
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,610
They run so fast!

292
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,520
Alright, sit down.

293
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,060
Copy the classical Chinese text we learned today 3 times

294
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,060
and hand it to me before school ends.

295
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,390
Class dismissed.

296
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,380
Thank you, Miss!

297
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,010
Hurry up.

298
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,200
Why aren’t you two running?

299
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:05,770
What?

300
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,430
Us... two?

301
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,820
Mr. Jiang is so diligent,

302
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,810
still correcting his Chinese exam paper after class.

303
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,810
If you have any questions, feel free to ask for my help.

304
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,440
I don't.

305
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,860
It's okay.

306
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,190
I can help you.

307
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,520
Miss, I'll eat first.

308
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,160
Oh, Miss, I'm leaving too.

309
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,410
Correcting an English exam paper in a Chinese class?

310
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,140
Come to my office after school.

311
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,750
[Student Cafeteria]

312
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,740
It was all Sheng Wang’s fault.

313
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,830
He blocked my way,

314
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,190
so I didn’t get a seat.

315
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,480
You were slow, and now you’re blaming others.

316
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,870
Why didn’t you get a seat today?

317
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,960
I forgot.

318
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,160
Because your legs are short.

319
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,840
Short legs.

320
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,610
So what?

321
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,560
Can’t I tell the truth?

322
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,090
-Be careful.
-How strange.

323
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,370
Gao Tianyang, you’re really not very friendly to your classmates.

324
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,440
Exactly.

325
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,150
What? You made fun of me for having short legs,

326
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,160
and you blamed Sheng Wang for not knowing

327
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,620
the seat-grabbing rules.

328
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,820
You care so much about the new classmate, huh?

329
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,030
Are you up to something?

330
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,360
You’re the one up to something.

331
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,950
Isn’t it normal to care about a transfer student?

332
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,790
Oh, really?

333
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,950
Then why don’t you care about Qi Jiahao?

334
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,580
He’s also a transfer student.

335
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,530
Qi Jiahao?

336
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,990
You mean the one who transferred from another class

337
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,650
because he did well in his exams

338
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,320
when we were moving up to Grade 11?

339
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,890
Uh-huh.

340
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,940
He doesn't count.

341
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,910
Why? They are both transfer students.

342
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,240
Okay. He counts.

343
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,720
But they are still different.

344
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,650
For the second-to-last question on yesterday’s practice test,

345
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,050
only three people in our class got it right:

346
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,530
Qi Jiahao,

347
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,870
Sheng Wang, and Jiang Tian.

348
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,580
Three of you, please stand up.

349
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,630
I should have copied the answers from Tian, just like you did.

350
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,350
I’m curious

351
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,550
how your answers ended up being exactly the same.

352
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,630
Did you really know how to solve it,

353
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,890
or did you just copy?

354
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,620
Come up here one by one, solve it in front of everyone,

355
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,150
and explain your approach.

356
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,510
Qi Jiahao, you go first.

357
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,760
Come up here.

358
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,580
I don’t know.

359
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,350
I forgot.

360
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,920
You forgot the approach you wrote yourself?

361
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,040
Sheng Wang.

362
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,340
Jiang Tian.

363
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,410
Hey, don’t you think Sheng Wang is quite something?

364
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,320
He also copied,

365
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,190
but he understood it immediately after copying,

366
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,310
unlike Qi Jiahao.

367
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,050
It’s clear they’re not on the same level.

368
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,740
Reality is harsh.

369
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,640
Yeah, reality is harsh.

370
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
Eat a bit more and see if you can grow taller.

371
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,460
What are you doing? I can finish it. You've had enough already.

372
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,940
Are you grabbing food from my girlfriend?

373
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,270
Who is your girlfriend?

374
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,570
You are so disgusting.

375
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,210
You have your own food.

376
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,240
Eat your own food.

377
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,860
Your tofu looks really good.

378
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Wait.

379
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,990
It was him who was caught writing the English paper during class, not me.

380
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,650
Why did I follow him and leave?

381
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,460
Come on, that transfer student isn’t any worse than Jiang Tian, okay?

382
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,970
He’s your type.

383
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,590
Hey.

384
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,820
I'm in love.

385
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
That’s not right.

386
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,820
Isn’t the cafeteria over there? Where are you going?

387
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,100
If you go there now, you’ll only get plates.

388
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,490
Go ahead.

389
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:10,880
Hey!

390
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,390
So where are you going?

391
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,620
I’m talking to you. Can you hear me?

392
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,300
Jiang Tian, Jiang Tian!

393
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,300
Stop making a mess over there.

394
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,430
Your mute uncle and I are enough here.

395
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,880
I told you to close the shop, but you didn't.

396
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,720
You just had heart surgery.

397
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,300
If you’re not going to close it, at least let me help.

398
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,150
This small place of mine doesn’t deserve someone like you.

399
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,010
You were abroad for so long

400
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,830
and didn’t even get a girlfriend.

401
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,550
You don’t want Miss Yang or foreign girls.

402
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,580
What do you want?

403
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,860
Mango pomelo sago.

404
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,980
How are you going to get married like this?

405
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,940
Marriage is just a piece of paper.

406
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,260
It’s just a choice.

407
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,430
Look at you, aren't you also single?

408
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,120
I have your mute uncle with me.

409
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,980
What about you?

410
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,170
What will you do when you’re old?

411
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,370
Who will be with you and take care of you?

412
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,040
Don’t argue.

413
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,440
I found a place nearby

414
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,700
and am opening a café.

415
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,070
It will open in a couple of days.

416
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,560
Drop by if you have time.

417
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,170
I'm just an old man.

418
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,400
I'll only embarrass you.

419
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,600
It's too fancy. I can't afford it.

420
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,000
I didn’t expect there

421
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,310
to be a minimart on campus.

422
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,070
But isn’t it a bit far from the classrooms?

423
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,200
Do people usually come here?

424
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,120
What are you talking about?

425
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,280
Of course they come here.

426
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,440
The students who live on campus always come.

427
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,110
Oh.

428
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,230
Did you bring your friend here for a meal?

429
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,930
Yes, him.

430
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,120
Not me.

431
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,320
First time here?

432
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,290
Yes.

433
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,290
What do you want to eat?

434
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,220
What do you have?

435
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,960
Abura-age and fish ball soup.

436
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,050
Oh, okay.

437
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,000
Your new classmate

438
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,000
is tall.

439
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,660
Yeah.

440
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,840
Kids these days

441
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,440
eat so well they grow into giants.

442
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,190
Look at this new one—he’s handsome too.

443
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,080
Hey, kid, do you have a girlfriend?

444
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,020
Or are you like Jiang Tian,

445
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,880
always acting so cool that you scare the girls away?

446
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,630
You seem pretty familiar with the owner. You come here often?

447
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,760
Eat here.

448
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,560
Where are you going?

449
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,910
He doesn't eat here.

450
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,080
He eats off-campus.

451
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,040
Off-campus?

452
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,160
At the Little White House.

453
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,700
Do you know it?

454
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,900
It used to be the school’s staff dormitory.

455
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,480
Now, a lot of the old staff still live there,

456
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,810
and some students from afar rent rooms there too.

457
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,630
Oh, I know.

458
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,200
I used to live in Tamsui.

459
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,270
Wow.

460
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,620
I'm starving.

461
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,710
What's wrong?

462
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,410
You can’t eat alone without company?

463
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,870
Or does the food taste bad?

464
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,730
No, it's just...

465
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,880
I can't eat it.

466
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,280
You can't eat it?

467
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,300
You've got a spoon and chopsticks, so why can't you eat?

468
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,210
I don’t eat cilantro.

469
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,030
Just pick it out, then.

470
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,150
It's not just that...

471
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,920
I can't stand this sauce either.

472
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,170
But without this sauce, how can you even eat it?

473
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,170
Give it a try.

474
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:51,740
But...

475
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,280
Is there any hot sauce?

476
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,860
You're so picky.

477
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,610
If you want hot sauce, go to a Sichuan restaurant.

478
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,660
Why are you eating this?

479
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,800
This is a specialty.

480
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,070
It’s sweet and sour. Just give it a try.

481
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,890
I think it's weird.

482
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,990
You’re such a delicate young master,

483
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,650
needing me to pick out the cilantro for you before you eat it.

484
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,370
How is it?

485
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,650
The abura-age and fish ball soup here is just as good as anywhere else, right?

486
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,500
Let me tell you,

487
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,670
this minimart of mine

488
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,040
is a real old shop.

489
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,530
It’s been around for decades.

490
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,010
Yes. And I don’t have to squeeze in with other people.

491
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:25,810
Right?

492
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,950
As long as you enjoy the food.

493
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,810
Pay up, please.

494
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,450
Oh, right.

495
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,500
Sir,

496
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,850
I think I forgot to bring money.

497
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,950
Are you trying to dine and dash?

498
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,930
No, no.

499
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,620
How about you tell me how much it is? I'll pay you tomorrow.

500
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,590
No.

501
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,860
How about I go back to the classroom to get it?

502
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,750
You want to run away?

503
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,320
No way.

504
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,960
Well, what should I do?

505
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,300
What should you do?

506
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,320
You need my help with that?

507
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,040
Uncle Zhao, what's up?

508
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,610
Well,

509
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,190
Come over with money.

510
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,090
Pay for the student you brought here who tried to dine and dash.

511
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,890
I won't let him go until you come.

512
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,020
I'm sorr...

513
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,780
He...

514
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,370
Sir, why don't you just kill me?

515
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:35,970
No.

516
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,400
My small business

517
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,990
can’t afford to kill you.

518
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,320
Lately, every time I encounter someone with the last name Jiang, things go wrong for me.

519
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,520
Do I have a grudge against that surname?

520
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,110
What are you mumbling about?

521
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,120
Instead of complaining, it's better to do something meaningful.

522
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,000
Here.

523
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,310
Save his phone number.

524
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,500
So that if you try to dine and dash again,

525
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,050
you won’t need me to call

526
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,420
and ask him to take you back.

527
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,210
But...

528
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,870
What?

529
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,910
Even with family, we need to settle accounts clearly.

530
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,040
You also need to cover this phone call.

531
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,790
You're right.

532
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:27,970
Alright.

533
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,580
Alright.

534
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,530
Your rescuer is here.

535
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,790
You’re really something.

536
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,200
I came out in a hurry.

537
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,710
I didn’t realize I forgot to bring money.

538
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,840
I didn’t expect that I'd have to not only pay for someone else's food

539
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,970
but also be responsible for picking up and dropping off.

540
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,250
Uncle Zhao, how much?

541
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,830
Anything else?

542
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,990
Me?

543
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,330
Who else would it be?

544
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
These. Thank you.

545
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,130
[You have a new friend from your contacts]

546
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,130
[Notification]

547
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,230
Who is it? A period?

548
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,140
What does that mean? Speechless?

549
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,000
Or do you know that others have nothing to say to you?

550
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,070
Next time, I might really kill you.

551
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,590
Oh.

552
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,860
I'm sorry.

553
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,490
I'm really sorry.

554
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,510
I won't make you angry again.

555
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,240
I will keep my distance from...

556
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,500
you.

557
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,090
You...

558
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,520
What's wrong?

559
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,940
I don't believe you.

560
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,030
Why are you all standing here?

561
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,870
Wait!

562
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,850
Close the door!

563
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,100
I'm sorry.

564
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,780
Drink some water to calm down.

565
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,690
Well...

566
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,250
I'll keep my distance from you.

567
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,520
Give it to him for me.

568
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,710
We need to change into sportswear for gym class in the afternoon.

569
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,910
It’s a hassle for the girls to change clothes,

570
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,010
so our class has scheduled time for them

571
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,940
to change in the classroom at noon.

572
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,690
What other rules does your school have?

573
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,390
Nothing else.

574
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,280
If there are any, I'll let you know after it happens.

575
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,670
Run! Run!

576
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,800
Make sure your movements are accurate!

577
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,000
Stop playing around.

578
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,360
Warm up properly.

579
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,370
Otherwise you'll get injured later.

580
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,360
During the school sports meet,

581
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,760
each class needs to send representatives.

582
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,710
Everyone has a chance to participate.

583
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,170
Are you alone?

584
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,620
Come on, I'll team up with you.

585
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,230
Excuse me, Mr. Wang.

586
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,790
The Training and Sports Coordinator said

587
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,030
there’s a meeting about the sports meet,

588
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,880
so please come over.

589
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,810
Okay, thank you.

590
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,320
I have something to deal with.

591
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,600
You can do some free activities for now.

592
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,880
Yeah! Free activities!

593
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,050
Free activities!

594
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,179
Don't go too far.

595
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,830
Don't go too far.

596
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:34,219
I'm exhausted. Luckily, I didn't run the mixed relay.

597
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,139
Free activities.

598
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,870
What do you want to play?

599
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,980
Aren't we supposed to practice the mixed relay?

600
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,830
Forget about practicing.

601
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,940
Come on.

602
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,040
Where are the others?

603
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,000
Basketball?

604
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,820
Or volleyball?

605
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,670
No. Let's just disband here.

606
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,840
That's a great idea.

607
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,929
This won't do.

608
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,239
What if the teacher comes back?

609
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,840
We need to stay here at least.

610
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,409
So, what should we play?

611
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,610
Truth or dare.

612
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,430
Truth or dare?

613
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,920
Who said that?

614
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,570
It sounds pretty good.

615
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,120
We haven’t played that in a while.

616
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,700
Plus, we have a new classmate now.

617
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,450
Sheng Wang!

618
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,440
Come and play with us!

619
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,650
Hurry.

620
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:13,980
Come here.

621
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,200
Let's play together.

622
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,090
What to play?

623
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,730
Truth or dare.

624
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,380
Do you want to play?

625
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,820
Or do you have any secrets that you don’t want to share?

626
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,030
I...

627
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,790
I... I don’t.

628
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
I take it as a yes.

629
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,530
Game on.

630
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,620
Little Pepper, can I borrow your hair tie?

631
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,490
Oh.

632
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,750
Whoever this end of the baton points to

633
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,160
will have to choose between truth or dare.

634
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,140
Like this.

635
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,320
What color is your underwear?

636
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,740
Red.

637
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,330
Hey, aren’t I supposed to say that only after I get pointed at?

638
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,520
Red! He’s wearing red underwear.

639
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,990
Alright, just kidding.

640
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,050
You get to spin the baton first, okay?

641
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,000
Okay.

642
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,690
The game starts now.

643
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,800
Truth or dare!

644
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,740
Okay!

645
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,450
Truth.

646
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,130
Well,

647
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,550
you're new here. I'll ask a tough one on your behalf.

648
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,260
Oh.

649
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,370
Does Big Mouth Xu kiss your mom at home?

650
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,600
Have you ever seen it?

651
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,100
Why would Big Mouth Xu kiss his mom?

652
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,490
Big Mouth Xu is his dad.

653
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,820
That’s why he’s called Little Mouth Xu.

654
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,410
Please answer.

655
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,370
How could I have seen that?

656
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,170
Have you seen your parents kiss?

657
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,920
Not having seen it means you haven't seen it.

658
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,450
So that means they do kiss, right?

659
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,450
They don't!

660
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,090
Big Mouth Xu is so open-minded.

661
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,210
Hey, why don’t you be like your dad

662
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,240
and kiss someone in front of us?

663
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,820
What?

664
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,480
Kiss who?

665
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,210
I've already answered one question.

666
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,080
My turn.

667
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,640
-Dare.
-Truth.

668
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,270
I'll kiss her then.

669
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,020
I'm not the one being punished.

670
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
You have a lot of weird thoughts.

671
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,450
OK, I'll let you have it.

672
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,030
Dare.

673
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:48,880
No.

674
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,190
Tell the teacher "I love you."

675
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,850
If you can’t do it, you’ll be punished.

676
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,420
No need. it's just three words.

677
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,150
Watch me.

678
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,540
There are some things we need to confirm.

679
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,340
Mr. Wang.

680
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,980
I love you!

681
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,450
Is that okay?

682
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,540
Yes.

683
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,590
Wow, good.

684
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,740
My turn.

685
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,100
It's not spinning.

686
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,530
Truth or dare!

687
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,810
Truth.

688
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,800
Truth?

689
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,200
Little Pepper.

690
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,950
What's the longest

691
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,290
you've ever had constipation?

692
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,020
Gao Tianyang!

693
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,650
Tell us! Tell us!

694
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,340
Gao Tianyang.

695
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,490
She can skip it, okay?

696
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,490
Because she’s my girlfriend, she can skip it.

697
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,820
Nonsense. Who's your girlfriend?

698
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,840
Just spin it.

699
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:48,780
Song Sirui.

700
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,370
Truth.

701
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,820
Step on his head.

702
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:51,680
Step on him!

703
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,690
That's too easy.

704
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,980
What's going on?

705
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,450
Go away!

706
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,330
Fine. Let's consider that your punishment. You can spin it.

707
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,360
Truth or dare!

708
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,230
Dare.

709
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,500
Dare. Okay.

710
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,490
Kiss the next person who walks over to us

711
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,090
for ten seconds.

712
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,290
Kiss again?

713
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,580
If you don't,

714
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,540
you'll have to bark like a dog, walk like a dog

715
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,800
for three laps, and pretend to pee like a dog.

716
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,520
Do you dare?

717
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,110
Wow, that's pretty intense.

718
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,170
Do you dare to kiss?

719
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,540
Do you dare?

720
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,030
Okay.

721
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,650
No problem. I can do it.

722
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:35,730
Great!

723
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,300
You’re a real man.

724
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,190
Nice.

725
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,010
Cool.

726
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,140
Who is it?

727
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,310
It's Tian!

728
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,100
He doesn’t count, right?

729
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,870
We didn’t specify whether it should be a man or a woman.

730
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,930
Yes.

731
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:57,110
Kiss him! Kiss him!

732
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,170
You'll have to walk like a dog if you don't kiss him.

733
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,410
I'm not scared.

734
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,060
I can do it.

735
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,770
No way.

736
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,230
Ten seconds?

737
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,400
Ten seconds.

738
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,430
Do it.

739
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:53,600
10, 9, 8, 7,

740
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,240
6, 5, 4, 3,

741
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,780
2,1!

742
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,910
Is that okay?

743
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,980
You really got the nerve.

744
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,030
Yes.

745
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,710
Tian is going to kill him.

746
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,120
You really got the nerve.

747
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,450
Jiang Tian.

748
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,200
Come on.

749
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,760
Jiang Tian, let me explain.

750
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,870
Jiang Tian,

751
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,910
actually, I just wanted to...

752
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,690
You,

753
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,120
don't follow me.

754
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,650
Wait.

755
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,510
I just want to say that's just...

756
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,940
a game.

757
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,060
I admit

758
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,960
that the kiss today

759
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,370
was indeed a bit out of line.

760
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,040
But in that situation,

761
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,750
I had no other choice.

762
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:36,710
No.

763
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,030
I need to explain it to him.

764
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,360
Jiang Tian.

765
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,470
Jiang Tian.

766
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,660
I'll come in if you don't say anything.

767
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,100
Jiang Tian.

768
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,720
Well...

769
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,470
About what happened today...

770
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,020
I'm sorry.

771
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,390
But...

772
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,780
But that was not a big deal.

773
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,220
Not a big deal?

774
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,790
Yes.

775
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,100
It was just four lips touching each other.

776
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,010
Don't be so petty.

777
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,360
You get angry so easily.

778
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,410
I'm petty?

779
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,820
I get angry easily?

780
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,600
He’s like a tree,

781
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,260
without any gestures of joy or sorrow.

782
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,920
That was not a big deal, right?

783
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,860
One half peacefully settled in the dust,

784
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,720
while the other soars in the wind;

785
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,620
one half casting shade,

786
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,890
while the other basks in the sun.

787
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,430
Extremely silent.

788
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,460
Extremely proud.

789
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,150
Never reliant.

790
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,800
Never seek.

791
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,400
[Jiang Tian's Very Moment]

792
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,240
Are you alone?

793
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:22,510
Come on, I'll team up with you.

794
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,990
I'm not popular anyway.

795
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,290
Because of my dad’s job,

796
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,390
I move a lot.

797
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,590
People always treat me like an outsider.

798
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,390
It’s fine.

799
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,980
Come here. Come here.

800
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,090
Free activities.

801
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,460
What do you want to play?

802
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,270
Aren't you supposed to practice the mixed relay?

803
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,430
Hell no. Are you really going to practice?

804
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:53,440
Where are the others?

805
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,170
Basketball?

806
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,430
Or volleyball?

807
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,930
Let's just disband here.

808
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,080
That's a great idea.

809
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,090
Great idea.

810
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,390
This won't do. What if the teacher comes back?

811
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,990
We need to stay here at least.

812
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,270
So, what should we play?

813
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,600
Truth or dare.

814
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,550
Truth or dare?

815
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:10,890
Who said that?

816
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,650
It sounds pretty good.

817
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,160
Not bad. We haven’t played that in a while.

818
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,870
Plus, we have a new classmate now.

819
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:18,290
I guarantee we can dig out a big secret.

820
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,040
Sheng Wang!

821
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,190
Come and play with us!

822
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:22,960
Hurry.

823
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,500
Come here. Let's play together.

824
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,330
What to play?

825
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,940
Truth or dare.

826
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,390
What's the longest you've ever had constipation?

827
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,240
Tell us!

828
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,200
Gao Tianyang!

829
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,360
She can skip it, okay?

830
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,490
Because she’s my girlfriend, she can skip it.

831
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:41,450
Nonsense.

832
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,570
Lyrical essays emphasize atmosphere

833
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,060
and avoid being straightforward.

834
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,150
For example, putting an arm on someone’s shoulder

835
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:53,940
can be used as a metaphor

836
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,530
for considering them as a person in one's circle.

837
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,460
These. Thank you.

838
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,860
Truth or dare!

839
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:07,520
Dare.

840
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:10,940
Give him a tough one.
