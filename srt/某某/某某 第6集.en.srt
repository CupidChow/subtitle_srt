But to whom should you be polite?

You should be polite to strangers.

he doesn't need to be so polite.

169
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,100
To put it bluntly, it's just not wanting to

171
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,130

Are you really the victim here?

Oh, sorry, sir. I'm face-blind.

370
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,990
Let me put it simply.

371
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,700
That day, two hooligans

372
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,720
came to the shop to make trouble and got caught by Lin and me.

373
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,170
Then he confessed

374
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,190
that his sworn brother had been humiliated at school

375
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,610
and couldn't get over it.

376
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,870
So he sneaked into the school

377

to find someone to take revenge on.

378
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,120
This person here is the one who was humiliated at school,

379
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,650

No,

I just wanted to scare him. I didn't mean to hit him.

382
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,920
But he told me

383
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,270
this exam was very important for Sheng Wang,

384
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,420
and if he failed, it would be devastating.

385
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,930
It was all his idea.

386

If you don't believe me, ask my sworn brother.

It's really you, Qi?

I barely spoke to them.

390
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,770
They did something wrong

391
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,640
and tried to put the blame on me.

392
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,120
Seriously, barely spoke to us?

393

Am I crazy?

395

Why would I frame you out of so many people in the school?

396
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,860
How would I know why you're framing me?

397
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,160
How does being in Class A relate to this?

398
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,820
You're a bad guy to me and I don't want to associate with you. Okay?

399
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,220
You'd better tell the truth now.

400
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,390
You told me

this exam was very important to him

402
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,280
and let me beat him so that he can't take it!

Regardless of your intentions,

you've caused Sheng Wang to miss his listening exam.

You may think an exam is nothing,

419
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,470
and there will be another chance.

420

his chance to become a model student?

Although college exams are not the be-all and end-all,

427

it can indeed affect a person's life.

You worked hard to become a model student,

429

but you've ruined someone else's efforts.

Do you think you deserve to be a model student?

I'll ask your class teacher to select a new model student.

432
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,810
Your qualification will be cancelled.

each of you three

Since I didn't advance by 50 places,

444

then I don't want the title.

so we should be punished together.

00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,940

Your characters won't be sloppy. They'll stand out.

688
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,400
You...

689
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,740
You said it.

690
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,560
I don't want it to be pretty.

691
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,890
I'm not a calligrapher.

692
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,580
Let's go.

693
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,780
Go to my room?

694
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,960
Yeah.

695
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,060
Hey, you...

696
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:40,500
[Sheng]

697
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,340
[Ban]

698
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,470
[Guo]

699
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,380
Practice these characters.

700
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,190
Dui.

701
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,910
Feng.

702
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,310
Guo.

703
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,380
Sheng.

704
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,910
Why these characters?

705
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,470
What's special about them?

706
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,750
They include all basic structures:

707
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,680
full enclosures, half enclosures, top and bottom,

708
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,560
left and right.

709
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,410
Oh.

710
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,540
Start now.

711
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,540
Okay.

712
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,420
How is it? Take a look.

713
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,250
I think I've improved this time.

714
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,010
[Feng]

715
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,320
[Feng][He]

716
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:11,890
Rewrite it.

717
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:14,990
Oh.

718
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,020
The strokes need to be longer.

719
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,920
The slants need to be clearer.

720
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,100
The breaks should be distinct.

721
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,650
Don't connect the strokes.

722
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:29,870
This one is good.

723
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,050
But this one's messy.

724
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,250
The strokes shouldn't blend together.

725
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,490
This one's okay.

726
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,740
This one's good.

727
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,980
This one's not right.

728
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,830
I just told you, the breaks need to be clear.

729
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,100
Rewrite.

730
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,880
Rewrite.

731
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:55,980
Rewrite.

732
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,420
Rewrite.

733
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:09,640
Rewrite.

734
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,000
I can't write anymore.

735
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,660
Go back to your room and sleep.

736
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,250
Who practices calligraphy like this?

737
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,130
I'm so sleepy.

738
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,960
Your room is right next door.

739
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,350
Sheng Wang, get up.

740
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,710
I'm so sleepy.

741
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:29,600
Sheng Wang.

742
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,400
If there's only one person

743
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,700
who can hear you,

744
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,650
that person is more important than anyone else.

745
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,700
I only know what I should do at my age.

746
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,150
When it's time to be crazy, be crazy.

747
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,790
You'll have decades

748
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,280
to be cautious later.

749
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,530
What's the rush?

750
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,320
[Class A Grade 2]

751
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,730
Okay, there are a few points today.

752
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:00,310
[Jiang Tian's Very Moment]

753
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,110
Remember to memorize the formulas.

754
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,110
Class dismissed.

755
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,410
Thank you.

756
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,860
[Class A Grade 2]

757
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:27,700
Sir,

758
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,290
I have a question.

759
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,940
Me too.

760
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,040
Hello?

761
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,200
Uncle Chen, I'm Wang.

762
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,520
Can you be my dad again?

763
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,820
Because I have another parent meeting.

764
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,650
I think you called the wrong number.

765
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:55,440
Jiang Tian?

766
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:59,120
Yes.

767
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,690
I'll call again.

768
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,110
Okay.

769
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,410
Hello, Sheng Wang?

770
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,830
Tian?

771
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,900
Mom.

772
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,540
I just saw your message.

773
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,370
You're having a parent meeting?

774
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:48,620
I can go.

775
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,550
Mom, you don't have to come.

776
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,310
Special situation.

777
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,890
Special situation?

778
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,270
What special situation?

779
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,660
What special situation?

780
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,070
Special situation.

781
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,410
What? Did I get it on my skirt?

782
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,570
Did I get it on my skirt?

783
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,070
What?

784
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,120
Come on, keep it down.
