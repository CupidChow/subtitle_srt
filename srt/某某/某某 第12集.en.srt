1
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,110
When I was young,

2
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,270
my mom liked to grow mint on the balcony,

3
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,070
saying it could make tea

4
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,970
and keep mosquitoes away.

5
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,180
In summer,

6
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,280
there's always a typhoon.

[Episode 12 Starting Over is a Necessary Pain for New Birth]

9
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,440
Did you hear me?

10
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,350
This is very important.

11
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,680
I'll say it again.

12
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,010
This time, our mock exam

13
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,850
is co-hosted with other schools

14
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,840
to let you experience real exam conditions.

15
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,440
So, based on the draw,

16
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,560
you won't take the exam at your own school.

17
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,800
Wherever you draw,

18
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,900
that's where you'll take the exam.

19
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,440
What?

20
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,510
Don't worry.

21
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,770
The school will arrange buses to take you there.

22
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,640
So remember to gather on time.

23
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,470
Do you hear me?

24
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,230
Yes.

25
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,970
Also,

26
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,560
don't be late.

27
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,020
It isn't just our school,

28
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,820
all the high schools are insane.

29
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,310
See?

30
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,390
That's a parabola.

31
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,440
Gao Tianyang,

32
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,500
explain the formula for the parabola's trajectory.

33
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,900
The formula for the trajectory.

34
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,640
Y squared equals...

35
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,260
4

36
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,220
4c and what?

37
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,090
Cx.

38
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,600
Y squared equals 4cx.

39
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,720
Yes, Y squared equals 4cx.

40
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,420
Thank you, Sheng Wang.

41
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,750
Gao Tianyang, sit down.

42
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,360
Alright, take out your exam papers.

43
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,460
Let's review.

44
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,650
Starting with the first question.

45
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,100
A 5 kg block on a horizontal surface

46
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,560
moves with an initial speed of 4 m/s.

47
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,310
The frictional force is 10 Newtons...

48
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,290
I'm going to shower.

49
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,850
This is awesome.

50
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,150
This is the hipster version.

51
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,980
This is the best.

52
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,660
Wow.

53
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,890
I can't hold on.

54
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,360
I'm out of shampoo.

55
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,570
Can I borrow yours?

56
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,320
I have it.

57
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,440
Use mine.

58
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,070
We have something good.

59
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,470
Do you want to take a look?

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,740
No.

61
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,870
Not interested?

62
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,860
Sheng,

63
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,620
do you want to see

64
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,210
some adult stuff?

65
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,050
Porno?

66
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,830
I'll just read Math.

67
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,850
Alright.

68
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,970
You have no taste.

69
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,730
Shi, let's continue.

70
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,060
Gao Tianyang.

71
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,340
Here you go.

72
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,980
It's nothing.

73
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,630
Thank you.

74
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,200
How did you get it out?

75
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,650
You idiot, you spilled so much.

76
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,430
Clean it up.

77
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,970
How did you spill so much?

78
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,350
You idiot.

79
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,520
-You idiot.
-Why did you put it here?

80
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,310
I didn't put it here. It was already here.

81
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,890
It's all over the place.

82
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,390
Wipe it.

83
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,550
Clean it up.

84
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,920
It's hard to clean.

85
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,610
What's wrong with you?

86
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,410
Hey, you got it on my pants too.

87
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,940
Alright, take it away.

88
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,660
Morning, Sheng.

89
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,660
Gosh.

90
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,850
Look at your dark eye circles.

91
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,610
Is it that obvious?

92
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,880
Anyone with eyes can see.

93
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,070
What's wrong?

94
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,830
Insomnia.

95
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,770
Listen to me,

96
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,200
since you didn't sleep well,

97
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,620
you need to eat well.

98
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,940
Two eggs for breakfast aren't enough.

99
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,160
Are you done?

100
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,040
G un.

101
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,790
G un.

102
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,820
Read faster.

103
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,900
G un, gun (means get lost).

104
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,330
No.

105
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,900
Why couldn't you sleep?

106
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,550
Did something happen in our dorm?

107
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,810
No.

108
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,810
Wang.

109
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,970
Is that what you wanted to ask me?

110
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,060
No, this is what I wanted to ask you.

111
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,830
This is the question.

112
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,300
If there are fish in the pool to be sold,

113
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,410
when is the best time to catch them?

114
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,910
When you want to eat.

115
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,460
How many to catch?

116
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,890
How many to catch?

117
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,900
When you want to eat.

118
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,430
Absolutely not.

119
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,890
Let's make a bet. I'll ask Sheng.

120
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,430
Come on, ask him.

121
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,270
Sheng, let me ask you.

122
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,610
In the last chemistry class,

123
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,890
we talked about fluoride,

124
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,010
the fluoride in toothpaste.

125
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,220
What's the key point of that chapter?

126
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,810
What's the key point?

127
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,500
Preventing tooth decay.

128
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,650
What are you laughing about?

129
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,100
Preventing tooth decay.

130
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,340
What?

131
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,410
Sheng,

132
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,290
what's up with your dark circles?

133
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,950
I didn't sleep well.

134
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,350
There are eggs here.

135
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,230
It's said that rolling boiling eggs here

136
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,850
can remove dark circles.

137
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,360
Wow.

138
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,460
You can try it.

139
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,180
I was wondering who put the eggs here.

140
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,810
Like this?

141
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,390
No.

142
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,440
Take it out.

143
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,740
Like this?

144
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,940
Roll it.

145
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,680
It's hot.

146
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,240
Hey, time for class.

147
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,890
Have you finished your homework?

148
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,570
Go back to your seat.

149
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,370
If you don't eat it, give it to me.

150
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,870
Why couldn't you sleep?

151
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,030
Because

152
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,660
I had a nightmare last night.

153
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,870
Lin.

154
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,510
Dean Xu just said he wants to see me.

155
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,380
Wait for me.

156
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,490
You scared me.

157
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,530
What are you doing, watching a horror movie?

158
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,820
Yeah, where's Tian?

159
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,450
He went running.

160
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,690
No,

161
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,420
I just want to build my courage.

162
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,610
I used to think I wasn't scared.

163
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,320
I even laughed at Gao.

164
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,620
You know what?

165
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,740
When I went back to the dorm with someone,

166
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,660
the corridor was so dark.

167
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,470
Someone suddenly touched my shoulder,

168
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,900
and I was terrified.

169
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,860
So, have you built your courage?

170
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,290
If I had, would you still scare me?

171
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,070
To make up for it,

172
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,670
how about I watch it with you?

173
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,170
Sure.

174
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,090
Come on.

175
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,950
By the way,

176
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,440
aren't you afraid?

177
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,050
Weren't you in the same bed with Tian back then?

178
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,450
It doesn't matter.

179
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,020
Come on, let's be positive.

180
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,440
Yeah.

181
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,370
Here, take this.

182
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,090
Okay.

183
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,370
You scared me.

184
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,300
It's really scary.

185
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,820
I have a text message.

186
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,270
Oh.

187
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,090
Who sent it?

188
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,440
Your laugh is so dirty.

189
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,690
Who else could it be?

190
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,990
He Shi.

191
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,370
She told me to build my courage.

192
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,330
Love-struck fool.

193
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,230
Are you in a relationship?

194
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,220
I can always spot you love-struck

195
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,340
students.

196
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,030
You must be in a relationship.

197
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,930
Sir, I'm really not in a relationship.

198
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,430
I'm just texting Jiang Tian.

199
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,560
I don't believe you.

200
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,250
Show me,

201
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,980
unlock your phone.

202
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,050
It really is Jiang Tian.

203
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
I've noticed,

204
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,850
no matter how fierce a girl is,

205
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,290
she becomes so cute

206
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,770
when she's in love.

207
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,420
Why?

208
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,960
I never knew girls with dimples could be

209
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,300
so charming.

210
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,950
You know

211
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,160
how cute she is when she smiles?

212
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,760
She has a little dimple here.

213
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,090
Her hair shines

214
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,460
and lightens

215
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,080
under the sun.

216
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,230
Her skin is fair,

217
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,580
her legs are long,

218
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,220
and she's adorable.

219
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,150
Her smile is so warm.

220
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,010
How do you know

221
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,450
she's the one you like?

222
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,970
There are many girls with dimples, long legs, and fair skin.

223
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,900
How do you know she's the one you like?

224
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,200
There's no need to ask about this question.

225
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,290
You know best

226

whether you like her or not.

227
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,290
When you like someone,

228
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,650
she's the only one in your eyes.

229
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,670
For example, at the school anniversary sports day,

230
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,900
I won first place in the sprints.

231
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,920
A group of students came to celebrate with me,

232
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,910
but I only saw Shi.

233
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,130
She handed me a bottle of water.

234
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,880
And

235
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,570
I accidentally touched

236
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,580
her...

237
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,819
I was so nervous.

238
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,920
I even...

239
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,690
I even wanted to kiss her.

240
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,650
I'm going to get some water.

241
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,300
Hey, Shi Yu.

242
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,260
Tian, you're back.

243
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,390
What's wrong with him?

244
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,880
What do you mean?

245
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,010
What were you doing?

246
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,470
We were watching a horror movie.

247
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,810
I wanted to build my courage,

248
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,070
and Sheng Wang came back,

249
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,870
so I asked him to watch it with me.

250
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,320
Him?

251
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,380
Yes.

252
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,310
So you two were trembling together?

253
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,350
No,

254
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,770
Sheng is so bold.

255
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,400
I was terrified,

256
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,570
but he looked calm.

257
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,130
You mean he's bold?

258
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,350
Yes.

259
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,770
Are you scared?

260
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,670
How about we share the bed?

261

What's wrong?

265
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:35,980
Nothing.

266
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,480
There's no need to ask about this question.

267

OK.

You can't even button properly.

No, it's autumn, windy and cold.

You boys are really clumsy.

Your brains must be unbalanced.

293

00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,750
I really didn't do well this time.

351
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,470
Hey,

352
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,000
I heard Sheng didn't do well this time.

353
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,630
How did you know?

354
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,350
He said it himself on the bus.

355
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,130
Really?

356
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,210
Yes.

357
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,480
Besides, when I asked him before,

358
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,930
he would say, "Not bad."

359
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,350
But when I asked him this time,

360
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,820
he said he didn't do well.

361
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,710
That means he didn't do well.

362
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,660
Even if it's bad,

363
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,330
it's still better than ours.

364
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,430
The overall results of our class in this exam...

365
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,440
is quite normal.

366
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,280
Don't scare us, sir.

367
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,760
We're all nervous.

368
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,440
Well, the average in physics is the first among the four schools,

369
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,340
as well as math,

370
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,770
but English is the fourth.

371
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,770
Ms. Yang Jing is not very happy.

372
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,610
Be prepared to be scolded.

373
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,260
But there are some good news.

374
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,840
Our top student is still Jiang Tian,

375
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,090
who is also first among the four schools,

376
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,660
and he beat the second place by 21 points.

377
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,250
Tian, you're amazing.

378
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,320
You're not even human.

379
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,560
Yeah, a freak.

380
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,600
Oh, I meant

381
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,560
impressive.

382
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,350
Another good news is,

383
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,610
more students in the top ranks this time.

384
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,310
Previously,

385
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,520
our class had at least 10 students outside the top 30.

386
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,930
This time,

387
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,990
there are only 6,

388
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,770
but they all

389
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,320
need to leave Class A.

390
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,190
I’ll hand out the report cards now.

391
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,270
If you don't get it,

392
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,530
come to me after class.

393
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,400
I’m the lucky 30th.

394
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,580
I don't have to leave Class A.

395
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,490
Gao Tianyang, don't be so excited.

396
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,160
Sit down.

397
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,840
What’s wrong, Tian?

398
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,140
Aren't you happy with being first among the four schools?

399
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,350
I don't have the report card.

400
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,900
God isn't fair.

401
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,310
It favors the most handsome one.

402
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,400
And that's me.

403
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,690
Definitely not you.

404
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,130
Sheng is much more handsome than you.

405
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,640
That doesn't make sense.

406
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,730
You can't talk nicely.

407
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,050
Did you cheat?

408
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,060
You're the one who's hopeless.

409
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,970
I cheated?

410
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,520
Alright.

411
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,770
Sheng,

412
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,150
I still can't accept it.

413
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,520
I don't believe it.

414
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,570
Neither do I.

415
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,680
Even Gao Tianyang got in.

416
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,810
How could you not?

417
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,140
Yeah, even I got in.

418
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,940
I told you.

419
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,730
I didn't do well this time.

420
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,760
I thought you were just being modest.

421
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,810
Yeah.

422
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,970
If you ask ten people after an exam,

423
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,510
ten of them will say they did not well.

424
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,850
I thought you were just being modest.

425
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,100
I've never been like that.

426
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,600
Yeah,

427
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,090
Sheng is always blunt.

428
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,520
Thank you.

429
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,450
But if you…

430
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,500
Alright.

431
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,600
I'm just moving from downstairs to upstairs.

432
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,850
It's not a farewell.

433
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,910
No need to be so sentimental.

434
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,120
It's okay.

435
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,400
Next time we'll change classes for the final exam.

436
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,460
Sheng, come back with a better score.

437
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,390
Sheng,

438
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,490
good luck.

439
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,670
Again?

440
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,990
We'll wait for you.

441
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:00,730
Oh, right,

442
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,510
you need to study hard during this time.

443
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,090
Me?

444
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,530
You should study hard.

445
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,130
You should study hard.

446
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,090
If I make it next time,

447
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,430
and you're still at 30,

448
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,190
then you'll be the one leaving.

449
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,810
That's good.

450
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,350
Not bad.

451
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,350
Wow, it seems like it.

452
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,910
That's great.

453
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,940
Hey, trade you for Sheng.

454
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,810
Great.

455
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,310
Good.

456
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,870
Well, I just remembered

457
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,980
He needs to see me.

458
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,600
I have to go.

459
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:27,930
He?

460
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:28,520
Take this to the class for me.

461
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,170
Oh.

462
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,940
No, I have to be serious,

463
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,180
or Pepper will miss me.

464
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,370
Didn't you say you rely on your looks?

465
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,730
Ms. Wu, Ms. Yang.

466
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,780
Morning.

467
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,460
How come they got such basic questions wrong?

468
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,040
I don't know what they're thinking.

469
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,640
Those were covered in class.

470
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,800
Report.

471
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,520
You came so fast.

472
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,220
Good timing.

473
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,060
Come in.

474
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,930
How did you answer these two questions?

475
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,540
I've said it many times.

476
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:08,100
Reading test and poetry appreciation answers should

477
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,770
follow the point distribution.

478
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,860
Eight-point questions need four parts.

479
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,060
Six-point questions need three parts.

480
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,100
Aren't you familiar with that?

481
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,520
How did you mess it up?

482
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,600
Sheng Wang,

483
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,930
what's wrong with you this time?

484
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,370
Why did you make such stupid mistakes?

485
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,110
Ms. Yang, let's skip English for now.

486
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,340
At least he's the top in English in the school.

487
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,980
So what?

488
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,110
I've seen many top students.

489
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,210
He's only one of them.

490
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,190
Stop pretending.

491
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,400
Think about

492
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,370
why you got those questions wrong.

493
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,050
I also checked his exam paper.

494
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,010
You think he wrote it randomly?

495
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:50,750
Not really.

496
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,510
Some answers were

497
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,060
actually quite good.

498
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,540
Just some minor errors.

499
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,650
One subject isn't a big deal,

500
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,860
but combined,

501
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,530
it makes a difference.

502
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,860
Pay more attention,

503
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,790
understand?

504
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,890
But

505
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,239
how did you get

506
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,139
the English grammar questions wrong too?

507
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,600
It's five points in total.

508
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,270
What does that mean?

509
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,050
With these five points,

510
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,179
you don’t have to leave Class A.

511
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,270
Do you know?

512
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:18,889
All right.

513
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:19,790
He knows now.

514
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,290
Sheng Wang,

515
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,710
I don't want you to leave our class.

516
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,480
But

517
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,530
you still have a chance.

518
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,989
Work hard next time, okay?

519
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,710
Go back to class.

520
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,580
Thank you, everyone. I'm leaving.

521
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,020
I can't believe this.

522
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,880
How did he end up like this?

523
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,650
Class begins.

524
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,070
Help me pass on the exam papers.

525
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,890
Check out your mistakes first.

526
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,130
We'll review later.

527
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,990
Where is he?

528
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,120
I don't know.

529
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,560
He wasn't here just now?

530
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,360
Tian,

531
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,210
are you mad at me?

532
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,730
No.

533
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,760
Oh.

534
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,650
You came at the right time.

535
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,690
You're not late today.

536
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,770
Here, just in time.

537
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,020
Today's main dish, Steamed Fish Head with Chili.

538
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,350
Wow, good.

539
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,440
I'm starving.

540
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,220
Eat now.

541
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,350
It's good.

542
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,100
Good, huh?

543
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,420
Mm, good.

544
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,050
Tian, is it good?

545
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,260
Mm.

546
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,980
With the way you're eating,

547
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,390
I thought I poisoned the food.

548
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,110
Look at your face.

549
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,790
If I eat with a smile,

550
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,060
you'd find it even more strange.

551
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,500
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,140
Alright, you caught me there.

553
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,270
By the way,

554
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,750
Mute, help me out.

555
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,520
The shrimp is thawed.

556
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,140
Peel it for me, quickly.

557
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,080
Come on. Stop eating.

558
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,950
Stomachache?

559
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,320
No, I just ate too much.

560
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,370
Where's your bracelet?

561
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:16,850
It broke.

562
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,150
Do you care?

563
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,120
If you care so much,

564
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,850
let me ask you,

565
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,020
did you lie to He and Yang Jing like this in the office?

566
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:44,970
Yes.

567
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,170
That's it.

568
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,410
It's like fake myopia.

569
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,980
Just correct it.

570
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,310
Hey,

571
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:09,140
did you lie to them like that in the office?

572
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,290
What should I lie to them about?

573
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,330
Messing up the exam.

574
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,100
It's a big exam.

575
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,230
Why would I mess it up on purpose?

576
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,280
It wouldn't do me any good.

577
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,900
Where are you going?

578
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,690
When are you moving?

579
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,130
When will you change classrooms?

580
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,840
Noon.

581
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,230
I'll move before lunch break ends.

582
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,630
After we go back.

583
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,630
I really failed the exam.

584
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,210
I made mistakes in every subject.

585
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,720
Really?

586
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,100
Here.

587
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,360
It's not growing well.

588
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,310
You need to cut it from where it's grown wrong,

589
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,520
so new branches will grow,

590
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,260
and it will have beautiful leaves again.

591
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,460
They're going to another class soon.

592
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,150
Yeah, the school is really strict this time.

593
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,050
Can't we ask the teacher for help?

594
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,230
It's fine.

595
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,180
In a few weeks, it's the final exam.

596
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,240
They'll come back.

597
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,350
Will they really come back?

598
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,760
They will.

599
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,380
They have to come back, okay?

600
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:54,820
But

601
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,180
every time someone leaves,

602
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,900
we always say this,

603
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,530
but how many actually

604
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,390
come back?

605
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,410
Little Mouth Xu, stop saying that.

606
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,090
Sheng.

607
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,710
Everyone, start your self-study.

608
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,370
Go back to your seat. Let's go.

609
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,480
Keep your voice down.

610
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,060
I'm telling the truth.

611
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,630
Sheng, you too,

612
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,560
good luck.

613
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:14,880
No,

614
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,170
don't be too good luck,

615
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,430
or next time you'll have to comfort me.

616
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,990
[Class B Grade 2]

617
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:07,800
Tian.

618
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,190
It's Tian.

619
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,150
How could he move to Class B?

620
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,060
He's helping move stuff.

621
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,610
Why helping him?

622
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,040
Where to sit?

623
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,510
Sit here.

624
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,300
I've prepared it for you.

625
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,680
Welcome to Class B.

626
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:48,590
I'm going back.

627
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,470
Okay.

628
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,050
Thank you.

629
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:55,620
Tian.

630
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:41,640
Why are you avoiding me?

631
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,170
Is it because you like Yang Jing,

632
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,680
or is it just for fun?

633
00:47:58,730 --> 00:47:59,660
Impulsiveness?

634
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:02,970
Or regret?

635
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,570
None of that.

636
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,070
Then why?

637
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,580
Because I like you.

638
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,210
New student,

639
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,790
you can sit there for now.

640
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,780
Wait.

641
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:30,730
It's okay.

642
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,920
You can sit here.

643
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,540
Tian, what are you doing?

644
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,810
Changing seats.

645
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:41,640
I know,

646
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,570
but why are you suddenly changing?

647
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,390
This was my seat originally.

648
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,210
Right.

649
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,860
It's better you sit here.

650
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,480
Otherwise, if I get bored in class and want to chat,

651
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,020
someone sitting behind doesn't talk to me.

652
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,680
That would be awkward, right?

653
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,690
I won't talk to you too.

654
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:05,170
Right.

655
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,260
Compared to you, Sheng is better.

656
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,210
After mom left,

657
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,840
I've been alone ever since.

658
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,460
Even if I'm lonely and scared,

659
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,650
I never let anyone know.

660
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,660
Never told anyone.

661
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,440
Until...

662
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:20,180
Jiang Tian!

663
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,750
Actually, we can give it a try.

664
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,230
Try what?

665
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:33,660
Try to get close.

666
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,820
We fought together,

667
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:41,650
so we should be punished together.

668
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:43,850
What did those two hooligans look like?

669
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,950
Does it hurt?

670
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:50,090
Are you afraid?

671
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:06,160
On the mountain top, the sun shines on me,

672
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,250
looking back at the bleak place,

673
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,700
returning home,

674
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,710
there's neither wind nor rain.

675
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,730
Everyone has read this poem, right?

676
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:22,040
This poem is the masterpiece of Su Dongpo.

677
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,260
During his exile,

678
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,980
he wrote down his inner feelings,

679
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,390
expressing that he wouldn't be afraid,

680
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,840
he would move forward bravely

681
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,580
without fear,

682
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,660
and look forward

683
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,410
to returning home.

684
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,870
Sheng Wang,

685
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,470
I'll wait for you to come back.

686
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,030
Hidden love is a one-sided chaos.

687
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,470
Because I like you so much,

688
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,090
I feel like standing upon the edge of an abyss

689
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,420
and walking on thin ice,

690
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,890
almost forgetting

691
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,930
I'm 17,

692
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,760
when the whole world is mine.

693
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,630
No hesitation,

694
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,550
no weighing of options.

695
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,840
I'm invincible

696
