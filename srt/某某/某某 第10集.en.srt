1
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,610
Next, let's move on

2
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,940
to a cultural museum that I myself love,

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,920
the Alhambra Palace.

4
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,640
It's located in Granada, in southern Spain.

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,680
In 1984, it was designated as a World Heritage Site.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,080
Generally speaking,

7
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,740
Catholic architecture is more prevalent in Spain,

8
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,530
while the Alhambra Palace exemplifies Eastern Islamic architectural style.

9
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,540
That's because in 711 AD,

10
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,820
the Moors led the Arabs

11
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,250
and invaded the Iberian Peninsula,

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,420
which is now Spain and Portugal.

13
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,940
And then Muhammad I

14
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,580
established the Alhambra Palace

15
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,830
primarily as a defensive fortress.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,190
It remained so until 1492,

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,320
when Spain successfully reclaimed its territory

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,890
and expelled the Moors.

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,830
After that,

20
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,510
the Alhambra Palace fell into ruin

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,580
and remained abandoned for several centuries.

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,240
Do you have any questions about what I just said?

23
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,650
No.

24
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,289
What's wrong?

25
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,120
You don't like Spain,

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,220
or you don't like the idea of reclaiming territory?

27
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,400
I don't like history.

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,670
History is just a bloody record of aggression.

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,360
It's all about who defeated whom,

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,970
drawing boundaries,

31
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,250
and then establishing countries with this

32
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,840
and that as borders.

33
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,550
What's wrong?

34
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,960
Am I wrong?

35
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,470
No.

36
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,550
But

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,540
it is precisely through these movements and advancements

38
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,060
that some high walls have been brought down,

39
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,170
allowing love

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,920
to fill the world.

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,140
And

42
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,430
it's precisely because of these boundary-like things

43
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,540
that there is the possibility of entering someone else's world

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,940
and understanding them.

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,840
So, do you think I'm invading your world right now,

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,079
or are you invading mine?

47
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:50,120
I just don't like history.

48
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,750
Then they just let the palace remain abandoned for hundreds of years

49
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,730
until 1828,

50
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,870
when King Ferdinand VII of Spain

51
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,150
began to restore it...

Let's get started.

56
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,900
Today, we need to catch up on progress.

57
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,520
We need to finish Chapter 9

58
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,620
and Chapter 10.

59
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,460
Sheng Wang,

60
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,870
what are you doing here?

61
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,410
Didn't the school doctor tell you to rest at home for 15 days?

62
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,310
Look at your foot.

63
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,020
I can just stay in the dorm.

64
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,070
There's no need for me to go home.

65
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,950
Let me ask you,

66
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,700
which floor is your dormitory on?

67
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,630
The fifth floor.

68
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,820
And our classroom?

69
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,660
The second floor.

70
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,740
If you don't go home,

71
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,660
how will you manage going up and down so many floors?

72
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,520
Ask your classmates to carry you?

73
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,029
Also, who's going to help you when you need to

74
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,600
go to the bathroom, take a shower, dress, and undress?

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,450
Even though our dormitory has anti-slip protection,

76
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,030
what if you fall again,

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,090
hit the door or floor,

78
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,440
or end up hitting somewhere and injuring yourself again?

send Sheng Wang downstairs.

86

I'm leaving then.

Alright, stop looking. Let's continue.

You wanna get out of class?

89
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,910
I've sent you the recordings of the classes these days.

90
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,680
Make sure you listen to them and review.

91
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,310
Okay.

92

You don't have to take this week's weekly exam,

93

but there will be an exam when you return.

94
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,620
So, you still need to prepare.

You should thank Jiang Tian.

you should thank your brother.

Understand?

122
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,150
just call out

123
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,680
and I'll bring it up for you.

124
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,860
Really, don't hesitate to ask me for help.

125

Isn't it time to change your bandage?

126
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,540
I'll go down and get your medicine to change it.

Oh, no need!

I can buy it for you right away.

It's okay, Auntie.

131
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,450
I only hurt my foot.

The rest of me is fine.

133
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,500
Okay.

134
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,450
Make sure to rest well

135
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,730
and eat more fruit.

136
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,390
Okay.

137
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,720
Call out to me

138

if there is something.

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,450
Don't hesitate to ask me for help.

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,440
actually, you don't have to be so nice to me.

146
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,290
I know you're doing this...

147
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,250
probably because you miss Jiang Tian.

148
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,540
But I want to say

149
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,820
that he is doing very well in the dorm.

150
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,010
Although I don't know what happened to you before,

151
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,930
he's quite happy now

152
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,490
and doesn't blame you.

153
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,670
He believes that as long as you're doing well,

154
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,530
he'll be happy.

155
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,400
I also think that as long as you and my dad are doing well,

156
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,300
I'll be happy.

157
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,890
Thank you.

158
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,830
I talked to my dad about this before,

159
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,490
but I don't know if he told you.

160
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,580
We're family.

161
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,850
Thank you, Wang.

Take good care of yourself, okay?

I never realized our house was this quiet during the day.

165
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,250
Is he in PE class,

166
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,010
or did he leave his phone in the classroom?

167
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,900
See, I knew I shouldn't have come home.

168
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,350
I'm so bored...

169
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,110
I'm going to rot here!

170

I'm so bored!

171
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,480
Or is it because

172
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,260
the people in this house aren't here?

173
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,330
Gosh, hey!

174
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,030
The power has really gone out!

175
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,920
Seriously?

176
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,250
-The power is out!
-Tonight,

177
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,250
no night tutoring session!

178
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,350
Yes!

179
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,170
You seem really happy.

180
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,710
What are you going to do later?

181
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,130
It's a secret.

182
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,080
Secret?

183
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,030
What about you?

184
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,820
Wanna go to 208 for a charcoal-grilled hotpot?

185
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,990
I don't have time.

186
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,960
Don't have time?

187
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:28,940
Hotpot?

188
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,330
Isn't there a power outage?

189
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,260
Oh, you're going to use a small stove.

190
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,900
Hey, isn't that prohibited in the dorm now?

191
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,960
Shh.

192
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,740
Shi.

193
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,330
It's a secret.

194
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,990
Secret.

195
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,760
Tian, do you want to go to 208?

196
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,590
No.

197
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,890
Since you're going to 208 tonight,

198
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,950
can I borrow your rechargeable lamp?

199
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,030
You can,

200
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,100
but why do you need it?

201
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,430
To organize something.

202
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,310
Organize what?

203
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,920
Some interesting test questions.

204
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,410
Darn it.

205
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,350
We're all thinking about how to have fun,

206
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,230
and you're thinking about studying?

207
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,180
Tian,

208
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,420
come on.

209
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,390
You're already the top student in the grade.

210
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,060
Wait.

211
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,160
You're going to organize some questions

212
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,440
for Sheng, right?

213
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,320
He has just transferred here,

214
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,700
and now he has to miss 15 days of classes.

215
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,990
This is pretty bad for him.

216
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,860
But our school is crazy enough.

217
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,170
Weekly tests are one thing,

218
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,470
but now

219
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,060
with this scramble-style class rotation...

220
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,090
But don't worry.

221
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,840
Sheng is a tough guy.

222
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,180
He won't get left behind.

223
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,710
He's ranked 79th right now,

224
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,040
which is still risky.

225
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,410
Besides,

226
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,830
he kept texting me all day

227
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,730
and said that he was really bored.

228
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,050
I think I should give him something to do.

229
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,900
Hey, I need to take a call.

230
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,660
Hello?

231
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,200
Yes.

232
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,630
Okay, I'll go to you now.

233
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,370
Okay.

234
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,460
Hey, I'm heading out.

235
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,270
Where?

236
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,240
Secret.

237
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,660
Secret again?

238
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,880
-Bye.
-Secret again?

239
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,000
Cool!

240
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,280
Two times. The second time.

241
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,330
Yes, you need to tap it twice.

242
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:10,870
Bye.

243
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,280
Okay.

244
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,650
Jiang Tian.

245
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,770
I'm here.

246
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,170
You said there was a power outage in the dorm.

247
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,390
Is the electricity restored?

248
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,740
Not yet.

249
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,400
By the way,

250
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,920
you said you had something to do tonight.

251
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,560
Yes.

252
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
What is it?

253
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,020
Do you have to do it outside of school?

254
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,730
Yes, to the Little White House.

255
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,510
Then go.

256
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,460
I'm going to have dinner.

257
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
What are you up to?

258
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,440
You came at the right time.

259
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,450
Let's talk about the account for this month.

260
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,770
Do you know that we're NT$6,000 short this month?

261
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,500
NT$6,000 is not a small amount.

262
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,830
What's wrong?

263
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,180
What's so urgent?

264
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,260
I'm wondering

265
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,030
if this is because we didn't receive the goods last time.

266
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
What do you think?

267
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,040
Got you!

268
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,840
You can't escape now, can you?

269
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,250
Isn't this the footage of Jenny being kidnapped?

270
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:12,990
Yeah.

271
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,680
I finally found this surveillance footage,

272
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,410
but the school had a power outage,

273
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,010
so I had to use your computer.

274
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,500
Was it really so urgent

275
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,050
just to watch the surveillance footage?

276
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,700
I don’t like to delay things until tomorrow that I can accomplish today.

277
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,070
You're just like Jenny.

278
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,550
Both of you are the type to act impulsively when you get heated.

279
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,230
Well, easy for you to say.

280
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,250
But if I hadn't acted impulsively back then,

281
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,930
would you even be alive today?

282
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,480
This is called "Please Touch It."

283
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Please touch it?

284
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,569
Did you see? Look.

285
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,530
Please touch it.

286
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,319
D-O-G.

287
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,089
Dog.

288
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,470
Hey, what are you doing?

289
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,859
It's none of your business.

290
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,260
This is an ancient relic.

291
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,000
An ancient relic. So?

292
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,440
There's already a sign that says "Do Not Touch It,"

293
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,200
yet you keep touching it.

294
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,760
How important can it be?

295
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,050
Don't touch it!

296
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,010
They've witnessed the rise and fall of Tamsui over the past few hundred years.

297
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,760
Tamsui?

298
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,550
So what if I call here Tiramisu?

299
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,000
You just littered with that cigarette butt!

300
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,740
What are you going to do about it?

301
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,830
Please leave.

302
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,680
Say that again.

303
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,710
Please leave!

304
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,600
Say that again!

305
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,960
So, there are more of you.

306
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,400
Not that it matters.

307
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,630
There are only two of you.

308
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,290
What do you want to do about it?

309
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,120
What do you want to do about it?

310
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,600
Come back!

311
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:14,910
Stop!

312
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,700
Stop!

313
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,020
Stop!

314
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,250
Stop!

315
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,770
Go!

316
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,040
Hurry up. Come here.

317
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,510
I'm lucky I ran into you.

318
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,570
I'm really bad at fighting.

319
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,590
I would have gotten beaten up badly.

320
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,530
Thank you.

321
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,670
You're welcome.

322
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,650
Are you also from NTU?

323
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,480
Yes.

324
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,760
You too?

325
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,040
Physics major, fourth year.

326
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,410
History major, sophomore year.

327
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,770
You really like history?

328
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,300
Yes.

329
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm currently writing a thesis on the history of this area,

330
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,060
so I came here for field research.

331
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,370
What about you, senior?

332
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,790
Do you like physics?

333
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,250
I study physics because it enables me

334
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,950
to see another world.

335
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,640
Also,

336
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,440
my dad doesn't know a thing about physics,

337
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,570
so I think it's cool.

338
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Actually, I've always had a dream,

339
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,540
and that's to open a café here

340
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,850
to create my own history.

341
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,650
That sounds awesome.

342
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,430
Senior,

343
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,620
if you're going to open a café in the future,

344
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,950
make sure to include me.

345
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,680
Deal.

346
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,150
Have you remembered now?

347
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,750
Don't you still owe me a life?

348
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,660
So, I specifically followed you back,

349
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,620
opened this shop together,

350
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,150
and became your waiter.

351
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,930
Did I force you to do any of these?

352
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,610
Then do you know

353
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,540
why I was willing to come back with you?

354
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,130
I need to take this.

355
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,090
Hello, Jenny Yang.

356
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,650
You need to see me?

357
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,370
Okay.

358
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,760
You're in a good mood to invite me to go shopping with you.

359
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,180
If I had any other option, I wouldn't want to invite you.

360
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,890
Fine, I'll just go back.

361
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,120
I used to send you both obvious and subtle signals, but you ignored them all.

362
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,250
Of course, I eventually gave up on you.

363
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,250
Thank you for giving up on me.

364
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,210
And now, I've found someone new whom I like.

365
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,720
As for you, the one who's been eliminated,

366
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,660
just be my tool

367
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,890
and help me pick out a gift,

368
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,630
got it?

369
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,760
Yes.

370
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,220
Hey, look.

371
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,640
How about this one?

372
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,660
It has flowers.

373
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,670
Wanna hear the truth?

374
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,150
Yes.

375
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,330
It sucks.

376
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,440
Have you ever seen a guy with something like this on his desk?

377
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,930
If you're going to give him something, give something practical,

378
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,930
something that he can use every day.

379
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,420
That kind of makes sense.

380
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,120
How about this one? It's a cup.

381
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
What do you think?

382
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,880
Are you unsure about it, or do you just not know?

383
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,050
I don't know.

384
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,210
Are you even a man?

385
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,650
You can't even make a decision about it.

386
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,580
I'm a man,

387
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,390
but I don't know what the man you like needs.

388
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,430
Think about it, okay?

389
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,900
Hey.

390
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,530
This is it.

391
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,450
He'll definitely like this.

392
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,500
[What are you up to]

393
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,440
I'm done.

394
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,960
How long will it take for you to finish your business?

395
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,810
I'm done.

396
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:50,720
That soon?

397
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,270
What's wrong?

398
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,310
Oh, nothing.

399
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,210
Have you come back to school?

400
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,950
Not yet.

401
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,800
On my way back.

402
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,570
What does it mean?

403
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,780
Where are you?

404
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,960
I'll reach the west gate after crossing the street.

405
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,730
Did you really reach the west gate?

406
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,130
Then why didn't I see you?

407
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,470
The power's back on! The power's back on!

408
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,250
Hey!

409
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:09,890
Where are you going?

410
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,680
Picking someone up.

411
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,010
You're running so fast!

412
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,150
I need to take a shower today.

413
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,770
Cool.

414
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,520
Excuse me.

415
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,000
Did you suddenly appear from the gate

416
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,000
or...

417
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,480
You came from the dorm, right?

418
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,280
You lied to me.

419
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:16,820
Fine.

420
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,160
Luckily, you arrived just in time,

421
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,290
so I forgive you.

422
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,510
So, you can walk now.

423
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,490
Yeah.

424
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,940
It's okay. I can carry...

425
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,870
my bag.

426
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,360
Who brought you here?

427
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,120
Mrs. Sun.

428
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,350
I had to beg her several times before she finally agreed.

429
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,150
Oh, by the way,

430
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
do you know she's been

431
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,050
cooking pork trotters for me for the past few days?

432
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,410
Others get bone broth when they injure their feet,

433
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,170
but she keeps making me pork trotters. What's that supposed to mean?

434
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,230
To help your trotter get better soon.

435
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,630
What do you mean?

436
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,280
Are you calling me a pig?

437
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,640
I... What's wrong?

438
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,840
Is there something different about me?

439
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,090
Yes.

440
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,080
What's different?

441
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,030
You've gained weight.

442
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,560
You...

443
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,670
Why are you so afraid of getting fat?

444
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,060
Because you always say I'm fat.

445
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,000
People fear fame,

446
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,720
while only pigs...

447
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,720
fear getting fat.

448
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,840
Well, you keep saying that.

449
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,290
I know your foot hasn't fully recovered yet.

450
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Give me your hand.

451
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,130
Let me help you.

452
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,940
What?

453
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,200
So it's true what they say

454
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,330
that a lot of students come here

455
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,380
to date.

456
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,900
Let's go.

457
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,970
Eyes on the road.

458
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,990
If you fall later, it'll be your own fault.

459
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,150
Now you're holding me.

460
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,550
If I fall, you should take responsibility.

461
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,220
Now the one who's clinging to others has to take responsibility.

462
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,220
I'm clinging to you. I'll take responsibility, okay?

463
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,300
Sheng, why are you back?

464
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,870
What? Not happy to see me?

465
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,400
I've interrupted your little arrangement?

466
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,140
No, of course not! How could that be?

467
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,150
So, Tian rushed down because he knew you were coming back, huh?

468
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,480
-Hey, listen...
-Weren't you going to take a shower?

469
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,100
Hurry up.

470
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:20,880
Right.

471
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,850
I need to take a shower today.

472
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,890
I reek today.

473
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,550
Shower time.

474
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,180
Wow, you really do smell bad.

475
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,580
I just had a charcoal-grilled hotpot.

476
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,700
So, it was you!

477
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,590
What?

478
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,640
I thought I'd seen that T-shirt somewhere before.

479
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
I figured I must have been mistaken.

480
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:58,680
Is it good?

481
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,250
I just saw it on the second floor near the west gate.

482
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,580
Oh.

483
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,610
Oh.

484
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,350
I know.

485
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,710
I was there to talk to Shi about something.

486
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,850
No, He Shi.

487
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,740
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

488
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,620
I didn't mean to grill you.

489
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,420
I'm not nervous. Who's nervous?

490
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,310
What about you?

491
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,870
And you, what were you doing there?

492
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,310
Why were you at the "dating spot"?

493
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,920
Who tricked you into going there?

494
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,820
He was going back to school,

495
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,530
and Tian came to pick him up.

496
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:36,820
Oh.

497
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,280
I thought he was just like me.

498
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,050
Oh, the power's back on.

499
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,850
I'm going to take a shower first.

500
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,370
Wait!

501
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,280
What did you just say?

502
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,470
Sheng, the same goes for you.

503
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,510
What were you doing at the "dating spot"?

504
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,490
You secretly...

505
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,970
I'm going to take a shower first.

506
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,430
Hey, hey. I was going to...

507
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,330
Hey.

508
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,800
Do you think we should remind him?

509
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,130
About what?

510
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,770
That dating could lower his grades.

511
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,880
The teacher did say that,

512
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,370
but if you tell him that,

513
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,220
you might get punched.

514
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,120
Yeah, that's true.

515
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,350
But as Shi's good buddy,

516
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,890
I always feel like I should say it.

517
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,700
To be, or not to be.

518
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,000
What should I do?

519
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,530
Go, loser! You stink!

520
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,240
Go.

521
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,700
Hey, what have you done?

522
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,150
It's done.

523
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,880
Let's switch beds.

524
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,100
You take my bed.

525
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,230
I've climbed all the way up to the fifth floor.

526
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,530
These four steps are nothing.

527
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,060
Do you think I'm having a discussion with you?

528
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,320
Also,

529
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,020
your bandage can come off now.

530
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,390
What should I replace it with?

531
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,630
With this.

532
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,250
It's breathable.

533
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,500
Come on, give me your foot.

534
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,410
Does it hurt?

535
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,290
Or did you come from the dorm?

536
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,860
Well, you keep saying that.

537
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,380
People fear fame,

538
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,990
while only pigs...

539
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,990
fear getting fat.

540
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,620
I've climbed all the way up to the fifth floor.

541
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,870
These four steps are nothing.

542
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,400
Do you think I'm having a discussion with you?

543
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,030
Does it hurt?

544
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:28,480
You're up.

545
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,590
I've bought breakfast for you.

546
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,420
And...

547
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,570
Pepper asked me to give this to you.

548
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,940
Her homemade cookies

549
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,870
and "I hope you get well soon" card.

550
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,590
Oh.

551
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,719
Save me some cookies.

552
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,070
I'll just take the card.

553
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,280
You can have the cookies.

554
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,020
Really?

555
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,800
I love you so much!

556
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,930
Okay, let's go.

557
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,530
We're going to be late for class.

558
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,130
Bye.

559
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,700
Don't miss me too much.

560
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,370
Just stay in the dorm

561
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,940
and don't run around, okay?

562
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,430
Your foot hasn't recovered yet.

563
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,120
I know.

564
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,030
I might as well take a leave.

565
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,660
Then I'll hop back now.

566
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,940
Okay.

567
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,930
I'll go to class

568
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,230
and record it for you.

569
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,710
None of these brats are well-behaved.

570
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,820
Who caused trouble this time?

571
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,870
Who else could it be?

572
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,800
The one who sprained his ankle.

573
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,470
He insisted on coming to school.

574
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,570
Sheng Wang?

575
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,990
He came to class?

576
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,950
The problem is his foot hasn't fully healed yet.

577
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,870
He can barely get around, so how is he supposed to attend classes?

578
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,610
He'd be better off resting at home!

579
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,570
Yeah.

580
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,970
Then why did he come back?

581
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,190
Especially since we have a long weekend coming up

582
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,970
after school today, right?

583
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,680
Yeah.

584
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,290
Forget it. I'm too tired to talk about it.

585
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,130
I'll get back to class.

586
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,670
Okay.

587
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,680
Bye.

588
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,590
These students,

589
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,890
not a single one of them lets us rest easy.

590
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,870
So, you bought this cup

591
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,880
for Lin?

592
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,930
Well...

593
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,910
Didn’t he save me at the school sports meeting before?

594
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,210
I saved you too.

595
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,550
Why didn't you give me anything? Double standards, huh?

596
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,340
Or do you have feelings

597
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,620
for Lin?

598
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,320
So what if I do?

599
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,630
Hey.

600
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,390
Aren't you close to him?

601
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,080
Can you help me check how he feels about me?

602
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,710
This doesn't look like food from the school cafeteria.

603
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,300
Yes.

604
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,830
Old Ding made it?

605
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,910
He went on a trip.

606
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,120
Then, this food...

607
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,460
Xi and Lin made it.

608
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,430
What about lunch?

609
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,090
Right.

610
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,960
Why don't you...

611
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,480
Even if I can beat those starving students in the cafeteria,

612
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
you are so picky.

613
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,630
Would you actually eat what they make?

614
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,570
Can I not ask Xi and Lin to help?

615
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,830
Guys!

616
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,050
I'll be going now.

617
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,410
You're going home?

618
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:07,950
Yes.

619
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,680
Go to hell.

620
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,410
Bye.

621
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,410
Happy holidays.

622
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,120
Happy long weekend. Bye.

623
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,860
Bye.

624
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,060
I'm so stupid.

625
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,740
Why did I rush over yesterday?

626
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,500
You would have been going home

627
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,650
in just one more day.

628
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,390
What was the point of coming here?

629
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,580
I'm so stupid.

630
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,700
It's good that you're here.

631
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,850
You can review the lessons you missed

632
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,650
and the scope of the weekly test.

633
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,780
Eat up.

634
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,050
After you eat, do the exercises.

635
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,470
You're not allowed to sleep until you've finished the questions.

636
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,530
How can you do this?

637
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,090
Eat up.

638
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,080
No.

639
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,790
After you eat, do the exercises.

640
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,690
I'll do the exercises now.

641
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,440
I just read an article.

642
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,600
Why do we need sleep?

643
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,950
Everyone knows that sleep is important.

644
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,670
But have you ever wondered why?

645
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,830
What exactly happened while we sleep?

646
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,250
Okay.

647
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,050
Aren't you close to him?

648
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,800
Can you help me check how he feels about me?

649
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,850
What?

650
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,620
What would you both like to order?

651
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,320
Why are you up?

652
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,480
Jiang Tian?

653
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,840
What's wrong?

654
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,770
You didn't get out of bed?

655
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,420
No. What's wrong?

656
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,290
What did you see?

657
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,240
Oh, nothing.

658
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,910
Maybe I was mistaken.

659
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,170
Go back to sleep.

660
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,070
Okay.

661
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:52,870
What's wrong?

662
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,430
No way.

663
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,640
Students, let's gather.

664
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,990
Let's gather in the hallway.

665
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,760
I have something to announce.

666
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,980
Something happened in the dormitory.

667
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,780
I've already called the police.

668
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,700
It should be a thief who broke in,

669
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,530
assuming the dorms would be empty during the long weekend,

670
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,150
and stole some laptops and other electronics to sell.

671
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,620
The police said there have been many such cases recently.

672
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,860
Until the thief is caught, we need to be extra careful, okay?

673
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,030
If you're scared,

674
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,920
you can either switch rooms or sleep together.

675
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,920
You could even go home for a couple of days if you'd like. Safety first, right?

676
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,240
If you want to go home, remember to check in with me for registration.

677
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,420
Alright then, let's go back to sleep.

678
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,280
Thank you, sir.

679
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,070
Make sure to lock up and close

680
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:45,130
your windows and doors properly these next few days,

681
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,240
-okay?
-Okay.

682
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,450
Let's go. Let's go back to sleep.

683
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,160
It's okay.

684
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,700
My PSP was stolen.

685
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,840
Yes, I've called the police.

686
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,560
The door is locked.

687
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,680
Sleep.

688
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,420
Oh.

689
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,200
Are you scared?

690
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,110
No. Just...

691
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,650
the teacher said we could sleep together,

692
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,250
but we have bunk beds,

693
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,090
so...how about

694
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,200
I give you half of my bed?

695
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,410
I can't write anymore.

696
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,400
Hey, go sleep in your own room.

697
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,890
Who can practice calligraphy like this?

698
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,860
I'm so sleepy.

699
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:49,970
Sheng Wang, get up.

700
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,460
I'm really too tired.

701
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:53,150
Sheng Wang.

702
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:56,570
Hey.

703
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:06,440
Wang,

704
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,410
get up.

705
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,640
Why are you spacing out?

706
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,420
I toss and turn a lot in my sleep,

707
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,020
which might disturb others.

708
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:36,930
Really?

709
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,250
I've slept with you before.

710
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,060
You didn't turn over

711
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,860
in your sleep that time, did you?

712
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,180
I slept quite well.

713
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,490
Hey.

714
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,270
It's a small bed.

715
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,910
There's not enough room for two comforters.

716
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,070
I'll share one with you.

717
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,270
It's precisely through these movements and advancements

718
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,980
that some high walls have been brought down.

719
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,710
What are you doing?

720
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,620
Rearrange seats.

721
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,780
You sit in the front.

722
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:11,330
I'm really sorry.

723
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,270
I won't make you angry again,

724
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,200
and I will keep my distance from...

725
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,910
You don't mind if I sit on your bed?

726
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:16,640
Yes, I do.

727
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:19,340
Besides,

728
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:23,630
it's precisely because of these boundary-like things

729
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,810
that there is the possibility of entering someone else's world

730
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,210
and understanding them.

731
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,300
Wrapping one arm around one's shoulder

732
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,850
signifies friendship.

733
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,440
But I think we are more than just friends;

734
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,530
we're family.

735
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,170
So, do you think I'm invading your world right now,

736
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,820
or are you invading mine?

737
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,340
You're home.

738
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,300
Welcome home.

739
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,360
Thank you.

740
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,370
I don't know when

741
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:21,520
I realized

742
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,110
that some boundaries

743
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,570
between us had disappeared.

744
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,650
I don't know if what lies ahead will be a comedy

745
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:31,530
or a tragedy.

746
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,740
But that night,

747
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,940
I slept soundly,

748
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:37,770
like a baby.
