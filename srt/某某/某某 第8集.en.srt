She assigned so many classical texts—

50 of them.

Is it my fault or Auntie Jiang's?

134
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,060
I've told you before.

135

It's not anyone's fault, and I'm not angry.

136

Can you please listen to me carefully?

137
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,040
I'm listening.

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,260
You have to tell me so I can understand.

139
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,040
I'm just...

140
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,820
afraid you'll be unhappy.

141
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,900
Dad,

142
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,190
since I was little, you've always said

143
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,380
I'm petty,

144
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,720
grumpy, and quick to get angry.

145
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,000
But the truth is, every time you asked me to talk to you,

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,350
I always did.

147
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,830
But every time after I talked to you,

148
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,760
did you ever really listen?

149
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,410
When I was little,

150
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,660
I said I could handle things on my own

151
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,780
and didn't need your concern.

152
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,830
You had work to do and business trips to take.

153
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,830
I was okay with it.

154
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,040
All I needed was for you to tell me when you'd be back,

155
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,370
and I could accept that.

156
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,720
And what happened?

157
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,760
You married Auntie Jiang.

158
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,040
I...

159
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,120
Later, I came to terms with it.

160
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,270
I realized that my mom was gone,

161
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,910
and eventually,

162
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,960
I would fall in love, get married,

163
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,100
and leave this home.

164
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,180
You couldn't stay alone forever,

165
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,330
and you'd find someone new—I could accept that.

166
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,910
But I remember telling you

167
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,310
that I didn't want anyone to replace my mom.

168
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,370
And what happened?

169
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,500
You and Auntie Jiang

170
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,100
moved into the house we lived in when I was a kid,

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,740
sleeping in the room my mom used to sleep in,

172
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,870
cooking in the kitchen my mom used to use,

173
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,410
and even making the dishes my mom used to cook.

174
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,160
Wang.

175
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,580
Dad.

176
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,650
You did it on purpose.

177
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,200
You deliberately found someone who looks a lot like my mom.

178
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,130
You knew I wouldn't get angry with her.

179
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,060
You anticipated that I would eventually accept her.

180
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,490
Fine.

181
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,420
I want to say that I actually did accept her long ago.

182
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
When I accidentally drank alcohol,

183
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,360
she made me honey water.

184
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,860
She knew I had trouble getting out of bed and was often late,

185
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,990
so she had her son wait for me every day.

186
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,860
When I casually mentioned what I liked to eat,

187
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,990
she worked hard to learn how to make it.

188
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,090
Even if it didn't taste great, she still tried her best.

189
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,540
But I still can't accept

190
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,270
anyone replacing my mom.

191
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,270
-I didn't mean to let her…
-Dad.

192
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,970
But I can accept

193
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,550
having two more people in the house.

194
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,460
I don't dislike Auntie Jiang

195
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,900
and I accept you two being together.

196
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,830
I can consider them family.

197
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,320
And my relationship with Jiang Tian is quite good—

198
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,270
better than you might think and better than I imagined.

199
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,230
So I'm not angry with anyone.

200
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,770
I just simply want to live at school.

201
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,660
So this time,

202
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,020
can you listen to me carefully?

203
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,120
The money has already been transferred to me.

204
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,240
Mom.

205
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,980
Don't overthink it.

206
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,270
I've never felt that you let me down

207
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,420
or were trying to leave me behind.

208
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,950
I used to feel really sad,

209
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,060
and I did resent you a little for...

210
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,210
treating me that way.

211
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,060
But now I understand you.

212
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,550
It's all in the past.

213
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,300
It doesn't matter anymore.

214
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,280
Do you feel that

215
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,720
living...

216
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,570
living here makes you very unhappy

217
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,900
and very uncomfortable?

218
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,440
Living in the dorm has nothing to do with it.

219
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,870
It's just more convenient to study while living in the dorm.

220
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,480
Don't worry too much.

221
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,910
Actually, this morning, when Wang

222
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,470
was talking to your Uncle Sheng

223
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
saying that

224
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,480
since your Uncle Sheng is often not at home,

225
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,060
he barely sees him a few times a year,

226
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,800
so whether he lives at home or not doesn't really make a difference,

227
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,360
I actually felt quite sad hearing Wang

228
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,450
say these things.

229
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,040
Because I felt like

230
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,620
he was a bit like you when you were a kid.

231
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,700
Over the years,

232
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,030
I've always been thinking

233
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,810
about your dad and me.

234
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,690
If I hadn't been so stubborn

235
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,270
and we both could have taken a step back,

236
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,660
if I

237
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,010
hadn't been so focused on work

238
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,870
and could have spent more time with you,

239
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,530
or if...

240
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,020
Mom.

241
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,710
If I hadn't sent you to your grandmother,

242
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,630
would we

243
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,540
be different now?

244
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,310
But I know

245
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,910
that I missed a lot,

246
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,530
and I also know

247
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,240
there are many things I can no longer make up for.

248
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,050
That's why I really don't want to see you

249
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,950
moving around by yourself,

250
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,610
carrying your luggage

251
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,460
from place to place.

252
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,610
It would make me really sad.

253
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,360
Mom.

254
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,570
Mom.

255
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,320
I'm not alone this time.

256
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,569
This time, someone is with me,

257
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,180
and someone is with you too, right?

258
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,910
Thank you, Tian.

259
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,890
Once Wang and I move into the dorm,

260
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,760
you and Uncle Sheng can go out and work together,

261
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,090
taking care of each other.

262
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,960
This is a good thing,

263
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,610
isn't it?

264
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,670
Thank you.

265
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,640
Thank you.

266
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,870
Have some tea.

267
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,690
Thank you.

268
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,560
Here.

269
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,680
You talked for a long time just now.

270
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,810
Is everything okay?

271
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,530
Everything's fine.

272
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,080
Did you cry?

273
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,900
It's fine.

274
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,120
After they start living at school,

275
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,080
they'll only come back for a few days at a time.

276
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,390
Don't feel too sad about it.

277
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,070
We can just make sure

278
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,230
we don't schedule work

279
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,940
or go on business trips

280
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,940
during those days,

281
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,540
and we'll spend time with them. How about that?

282
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,390
Maybe we'll even end up seeing them more often that way.

283
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,330
Yeah.

284
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,580
My son is so bold.

285
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,800
He's so picky about food

286
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,150
and doesn't eat a lot of things, yet he's daring enough to live at school.

287
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,030
Let's see how he handles his meals.

288
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,240
Well, maybe it will help him change

289
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,510
his bad habit of being picky about food.

290
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,500
Impossible.

291
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,250
He'll probably come back looking like a skinny monkey.

292
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,980
Forget it.

293
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,510
As long as they are happy.

294
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,820
Tian isn't picky about food,

295
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,580
but I doubt the dorm food

296
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,320
is anything good.

297
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,470
Yeah.

298
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,650
So in the end, it'll still be us who have to deal with it.

299
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,770
He also told me,

300
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,400
"Mom, don't worry."

301
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,000
But as parents, how can we not worry?

302
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,490
Oh, youth.

303
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,980
That's just how it is, right?

304
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,400
Yeah, we were young once too.

305
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,140
You know,

306
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,580
when I was little, I used to steal sausages from your house.

307
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,600
So it was you who stole the sausages from my house?

308
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,170
Now that you mention it, I really miss

309
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,330
my mom's sausages.

310
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,560
Dad.

311
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,070
So...

312
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,400
can we live at school?

313
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,720
We talked about it last night.

314
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,350
Since you both want to go so much,

315
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,220
then go ahead.

316
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,260
Dad.

317
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,480
Thank you.

318
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,070
Son.

319
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,710
Okay.

320
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,760
Wang, come here.

321
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,270
What's wrong?

322
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,980
Come on.

323
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,470
Tian, you too.

324
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,220
Get up.

325
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,490
Come here.

326
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,260
Tian, you're the older brother.

327
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,200
When you're in the dorm, I'm counting on you to take care of Wang.

328
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Wang, let me tell you, when you get to the dorm…

329
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,110
Alright, Old Sheng.

330
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,610
Can you stop nagging?

331
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,910
From now on, we're family,

332
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,510
so we should take care of each other, understood?

333
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,280
Ms. Jiang,

334
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,600
how about a hug?

335
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,060
Let's hug. Come on.

336
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,550
We're family.

337
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,360
We're family!

338
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,520
Morning, Ms. Yang.

339
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,510
Morning.

340
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,890
Why are you here so early today?

341
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,500
I've got a goldfish memory.

342
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,810
I just remembered

343
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,090
that Ms. Lai, the senior year teacher, is going on antenatal leave

344
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,700
and will be on maternity leave later.

345
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,460
So you'll be taking over her history and geography classes for the sophomores and seniors.

346
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,320
Why didn't you remind me earlier?

347
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,550
Well, you just remembered, didn't you?

348
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,130
Alright.

349
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,020
Mr. Lin,

350
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,070
Is this...

351
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,690
the rainbow?

352
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,960
So you support it too?

353
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,390
Yes.

354
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,870
I support it too!

355
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,330
But it's a private school and quite conservative.

356
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,580
Mr. Lin,

357
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,570
you dared to bring such a beautiful rainbow mug?

358
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,500
You're so brave.

359
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,120
Do you like this mug?

360
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,450
Yes, I do. It's very pretty.

361
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,340
If you don't mind,

362
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,630
you can have it.

363
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,870
Really?

364
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:06,870
Yes.

365
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,160
To celebrate that we both support the rainbow.

366
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,060
Thank you.

367
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,890
Cheers.

368
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,300
Cheers.

369
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,410
Morning.

370
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,520
Morning.

371
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,840
Morning, Zhao Xiaoxi.

372
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,230
Want some breakfast?

373
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,840
What are these?

374
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,450
Sandwiches?

375
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,510
Zhao Xiaoxi, you're so nice today!

376
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,640
I want one.

377
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,990
They're all yours.

378
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,140
Love you.

379
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,430
Zhao Xiaoxi,

380
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,010
so what am I eating today?

381
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,910
A steamed bun?

382
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,400
You lined up early to get it?

383
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,940
Of course.

384
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,570
But why is the bun cold?

385
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,890
Then don't eat it.

386
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,400
I didn't say I wouldn't eat it.

387
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,950
I want to eat it.

388
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,960
Jenny Yang, my dad said he hasn't seen you in a long time

389
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,660
and asked you to come over for dinner when you're free.

390
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,860
If I go just because he asks,

391
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,490
won't that make me look like no one is interested in me?

392
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,040
Don't worry.

393
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,000
My dad will definitely make a big spread of all your favorite dishes.

394
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,630
Okay?

395
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,460
You said it.

396
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,480
You'd better keep your word.

397
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,910
I'll definitely go.

398
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,070
It's my dad who said it, not me.

399
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,550
This is tasty. Even cold, it's still tasty.

400
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,810
Wow, that move!

401
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,650
So white.

402
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,370
That pose!

403
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,290
So big!

404
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,650
Hey, but how did you hurt your leg, sweetie?

405
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,400
Oh no, that broke my heart.

406
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,000
Hey.

407
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,440
What do you mean by "so white and so big?" That's not how you describe it!

408
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,650
Or are you saying their legs are thick, white, and big?

409
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,290
Why are you playing teacher at this moment?

410
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:11,860
What a bummer.

411
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,390
The dorm assignment is out.

412
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,300
Yes. Yes.

413
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,340
Really?

414
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,670
How did you know?

415
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,370
Why are you laughing? Did you hit the lottery or something?

416
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,560
Just keep watching the legs.

417
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,530
It's one of your business.

418
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,650
You have no sense of aesthetics.

419
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,030
It's fine. Sheng Wang doesn't want to look,

420
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,750
so Tianyang will just look more.

421
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,180
I just ran into He, and he gave me the key.

422
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,120
You two boys, I swear, I'll swap you out.

423
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,700
Which room?

424
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,170
Did you get hurt?

425
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,170
Did you get hurt?

426
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,520
Looks like you're fine.

427
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,580
[Boys' Dormitory 501]

428
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,550
Keep going, keep going!

429
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,520
It wasn't until this moment

430
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,130
that I really felt like I was gonna live on campus.

431
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,500
Tell me it's true.

432
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,880
Be careful.

433
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,850
It's true.

434
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,840
Have you seen the dorm?

435
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,500
Nice.

436
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,150
You can skip the next class to check it out.

437
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,780
Do you think I wanna die?

438
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,270
Big Mouth... no.

439
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,260
Sir.

440
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,040
One's secretly taking pictures, and another's sneaking a peek.

441
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,640
You've got all the gear, huh?

442
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,040
Go back to the classroom.

443
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,180
Wait.

444
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,310
Are you dating someone?

445
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,500
You're all going through adolescence.

446
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,800
At this age, you want to try everything

447
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,370
and break every rule.

448
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,940
You're not bad-looking,

449
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,250
so naturally, you get a lot of attention.

450
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,470
Some girls who are bolder and more rebellious

451
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,010
might start showing you some affection.

452
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,760
I'm not dating anyone.

453
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,770
I was your age once too,

454
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,730
so I understand.

455
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,740
Wait, sir.

456
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,860
Who told you that?

457
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,280
Then who were you just texting?

458
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,340
Jiang Tian.

459
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,810
How is that possible?

460
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,950
I'm great at catching students

461
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,200
who are dating.

462
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,330
You're definitely in a relationship.

463
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,610
Sir, I'm really not in a relationship.

464
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,410
I was really texting Jiang Tian.

465
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,240
I don't believe it. Here.

466
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,480
Unlock it and let me see, quickly.

467
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,980
It really is Jiang Tian?

468
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,750
Yes.

469
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,570
I wrongly accused you.

470
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,020
You know,

471
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,610
you still need to remember what I just said.

472
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,110
Students should focus on their studies.

473
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,020
You're so outstanding.

474
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,510
I hope you can focus on your studies,

475
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,120
successfully get through high school, and complete your education.

476
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,870
Everything else should be put aside.

477
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,200
Don't get distracted.

478
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,910
This is against school rules.

479
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,460
I'll confiscate it.

480
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,330
Come on, go back to the classroom.

481
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,330
Sheng Wang.

482
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,650
Wait for me.

483
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,450
There's no phone,

484
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,010
just this.

485
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
What do you think?

486
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,110
You don't want it?

487
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,240
Wait.

488
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,870
I want it.

489
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,060
That's my promise to you.

490
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,460
The start of a new life.

491
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,000
So let's live together.

492
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,140
Okay.

493
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,240
Later, when we go back,

494
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,720
grab your luggage and head to the dorm first.

495
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,340
Okay.

496
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,600
If there's anything we forgot, we'll go buy it.

497
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,110
Okay.

498
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,510
What about your phone?

499
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,730
I don't know.

500
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,690
I asked Gao Tianyang.

501
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,620
Gao Tianyang asked Little Mouth Xu,

502
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,450
but Little Mouth Xu didn't dare to ask Big Mouth Xu.

503
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,900
But he's pretty loyal.

504
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,160
He asked He.

505
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,080
He said there are two options.

506
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,240
First, write a letter of apology

507
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,070
until Big Mouth Xu is satisfied.

508
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,760
Second,

509
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,510
have my dad come over.

510
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,630
So...

511
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,630
So... For the first option, with my handwriting,

512
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,160
Big Mouth Xu would probably be so mad that he'd have a stroke.

513
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,620
I can't write that letter.

514
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,660
And for the second, having my dad come to school—

515
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,850
he doesn't have the time.

516
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,180
Plus, if I tell him, he'll definitely say,

517
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,530
"I'll give you money, just go buy a new one."

518
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,270
My dad...

519
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,750
He's not great in most ways,

520
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,690
but he's always generous when it comes to spending money on me.

521
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,550
I believe that.

522
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,700
You bought a fridge for Old Ding last time.

523
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,760
Did you forget that?

524
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,070
Oh, right.

525
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,700
Don't worry.

526
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,600
My dad will treat you just as well.

527
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,370
Oh, by the way, after we leave the dorm,

528
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,850
could you go to the phone store with me?

529
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:29,330
Okay.

530
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,380
Hello, Mom.

531
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,120
What?

532
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,790
Excuse me.

533
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,010
Are Jiang Tian and Sheng Wang's dorms in this building?

534
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,410
Hold on, let me check.

535
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,340
Okay, thank you.

536
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,210
Got it.

537
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,790
So, may I ask who you two are?

538
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,810
Oh, I'm Jiang Tian's mom.

539
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,350
I'm Sheng Wang's dad.

540
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,170
Well...

541
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,440
What's their relationship?

542
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,080
They are brothers.

543
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,400
Mom.

544
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,280
Hey.

545
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,290
Old Sheng?

546
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:16,970
Hey, Son.

547
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,690
Why are you here?

548
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,690
Weren't you supposed to fly to Shenzhen at noon today?

549
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,460
Wang, your dad is worried about you.

550
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,240
He has postponed everything to tomorrow afternoon

551
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,620
and changed his flight to tomorrow morning.

552
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,870
I just wanted to get you both settled in before leaving.

553
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,240
That way I'll be at ease.

554
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,540
What's wrong? You don't want us to come?

555
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,450
Give it to me.

556
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,210
Let me do it.

557
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,410
Let me show you the way.

558
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,780
Let's go.

559
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,850
Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian are brothers?

560
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,710
Do you know that?

561
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,980
I can't believe it.

562
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,280
Let's post it online.

563
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,350
This way.

564
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,570
We live in Room 501.

565
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,130
Wow, your dormitory is huge.

566
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,650
501? Let me have a look.

567
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,700
Someone has already moved in.

568
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,540
Hello.

569
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,160
Let me help you.

570
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,250
Hello, Ma'am.

571
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:07,860
Come in.

572
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,440
Hello.

573
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,510
Hello, Sir.

574
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,880
Their room is big.

575
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,670
Not bad.

576
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,570
Gao Tianyang?

577
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,320
Why are you here?

578
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,220
Sheng?

579
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,400
Tian?

580
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,100
I should be the one asking this question.

581
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,200
Didn't you say you weren't going to live at school?

582
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,110
Have you changed your mind?

583
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,460
It's none of your business.

584
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,420
What about you? Why did you move in?

585
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,040
Have you heard the saying "A cunning rabbit has three burrows?"

586
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,640
By the way,

587
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,230
this is Shi Yu from Class B.

588
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,400
Hello, I'm Shi Yu.

589
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,590
I know you.

590
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,290
You know me?

591
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,440
I'm quite low-key in Class B.

592
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,920
I don't know if you're low-key in Class B,

593
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,690
but you're quite "high-key" on the court.

594
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,490
You stepped on my foot six times.

595
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,990
Sorry.

596
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,500
It's okay.

597
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,070
Shi Yu and I chose this bunk,

598
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,110
so you'll be sleeping on the inside.

599
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,560
Oh.

600
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,520
Wang, Son, come here.

601
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,270
Okay. Listen to me.

602
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,810
Tian is the older brother after all,

603
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,870
so we'll let him have the bottom bunk.

604
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,280
I'm just a few months younger.

605
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,300
Why do I have to sleep on the top bunk?

606
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,600
Well,

607
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,380
you can wait for the next lifetime.

608
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,110
That way you might have a better chance.

609
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,880
You two are good brothers, right?

610
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,080
You should take care of each other.

611
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,290
Hey.

612
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,020
You must be thirsty, right?

613
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,740
Your dad and I are going to get some water. Let's go.

614
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,700
Okay, let's go.

615
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,390
Stop nagging.

616
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,590
Alright, let's go.

617
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,720
When did you two become brothers?

618
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,170
I was just wondering

619
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,080
why there's only one set of parents here.

620
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,680
Are you really brothers?

621
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,160
Yes.

622
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,290
Come on, Tian,

623
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,380
I grew up with you.

624
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,510
How come I didn't know you had a long-lost brother?

625
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,500
We just found each other.

626
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,430
What's going on?

627
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,480
To put it simply,

628
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,890
we both come from single-parent families.

629
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,800
This is my dad, this is his mom,

630
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,810
and these are the two of us.

631
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,180
They got together,

632
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,310
and...

633
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,870
here we are.

634
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,409
So you really are brothers.

635
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,530
But this pairing

636
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,250
is quite dramatic, isn't it?

637
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,040
Yes.

638
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,210
Two handsome top students

639
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,560
are actually family.

640
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,400
Handsome?

641
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:25,949
Only the older brother is handsome.

642
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,020
What do you mean?

643
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,659
Are you saying you're the only handsome one,

644
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:32,780
Big Brother?

645
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,190
Good boy.

646
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:34,940
You...

647
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,870
Hey.

648
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,800
Tian is indeed older than you.

649
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,570
So it's right for you to call him Big Brother.

650
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,739
Gao Tianyang.

651
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,429
Fine. I'm just kidding.

652
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,699
However,

653
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,989
younger brother, you need to listen to your older brother.

654
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,790
Come on, let's get organized.

655
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,920
They argued even about sleeping arrangements.

656
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,190
How will they manage living together outside?

657
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,030
You're just too worried.

658
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,980
They've decided to move into the dorm,

659
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,660
don't you think they'll take care of each other?

660
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,140
That's true.

661
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,530
They've grown up now,

662
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,920
and I, as a father, should let go.

663
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,490
Yes, Mr. Sheng.

664
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,210
Let's go.

665
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,120
Breaking news! Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian from Class A Grade 2 are brothers!

666
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,310
Really? Don't they have different surnames?

667
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,310
I heard they're living together.

668
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,710
Wow, it's so hard to choose between the two brothers.

669
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,160
Do you know Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian

670
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,200
are actually brothers?

671
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,690
It's all over the school forum,

672
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,380
with a 5000% increase in buzz.

673
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,650
Isn't that great?

674
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,060
It makes it easier for you to follow idols.

675
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,040
Are you admiring that their whole family is handsome?

676
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,300
Do I look like someone who follows idols?

677
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,330
Yes.

678
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,910
Women's preference for young pretty boys is a rule that never changes.

679
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,200
If you like them, I can pretend to be one.

680
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,990
Forget it.

681
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,400
You're old

682
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,350
and overcooked.

683
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,640
When did your taste become so heavy,

684
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,650
Jenny Yang?

685
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,210
So why are you always such a gossiping old woman, Zhao Xiaoxi?

686
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,860
What are you talking about? I'm just over thirty.

687
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,540
If you like young pretty boys,

688
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,880
I can reluctantly pretend to be one.

689
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,310
Are you sure you're not going to consider it?

690
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,370
Zhao Xiaoxi, you're so annoying.

691
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,350
Go away.

692
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,960
Fine, I'll go away.

693
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,900
Then you can forget about the bubble tea.

694
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,320
What? You brought bubble tea?

695
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,870
Looks like you know who's the boss here. Give it to me.

696
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,700
I want it.

697
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,870
Give it to me.

698
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,390
Gosh.

699
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,440
It's so sweet.

700
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,160
Today's bubble tea is not sweet at all.

701
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,130
I think it's sweet.

702
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,680
Isn't it?

703
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,600
It's fine.

704
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,730
I can drink healthy drinks sometimes.

705
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,440
You don't have to see us off.

706
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,830
You don't have to see us off.

707
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,160
Why did you say that?

708
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,880
Come on. Is there something wrong that he keeps trying to see us off?

709
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,610
He means well.

710
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,090
Dad,

711
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,430
my phone was confiscated by the teacher,

712
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,450
and he said that a parent needs to come and retrieve it.

713
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,980
See? Right?

714
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,200
Actually, I was planning to buy a new one myself,

715
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,810
but...

716
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,170
since you're here...

717
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,810
When you need something, you call me Dad.

718
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,870
When you don't, you call me Old Sheng.

719
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,080
Alright, alright, I'll go get it for you.

720
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,760
Really?

721
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,410
Let me take you to him.

722
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,070
Let's go.

723
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:54,790
Let's go.

724
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,820
Jiang Tian!

725
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,500
Jiang Tian,

726
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,970
let's live at school together.

727
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,290
Me and you?

728
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,660
Together?

729
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,980
Thank you.

730
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,730
Actually, we can give it a try.

731
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,510
What?

732
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,970
Try to get closer to each other.

733
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,260
I didn't have what we have now, so the past was so important.

734
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,490
But I have it now,

735
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
so the past doesn't matter anymore.

736
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,080
From now on,

737
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,980
I'll always be by your side.

738
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,230
A place where you can feel a sense of belonging and security,

739
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,090
a place that truly belongs to you.

740
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,240
Is that what you want?

741
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,440
That's my promise to you.

742
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,590
The start of a new life.

743
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,610
So let's live together.

744
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,900
It's really like what "Guidance on Writing Lyric Essays" said:

745
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,960
"Boys at 16 or 17

746
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,450
are all shining brightly."

747
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,520
So,

748
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,650
this time,

749
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,000
can your suitcase

750
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,060
be put away?

751
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,670
Yes.

752
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,050
I don't know why it ended up like this.

753
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,600
I don't know.

754
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't know.

755
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,590
I do.

756
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,080
You're home.

757
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,420
Welcome home.

758
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,430
Do you have a heart?

759
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,050
You're not crying even at this moment.

760
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,840
I even shed a few tears for you.

761
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,460
Thank you.

762
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:51,940
You can't sleep?

763
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,140
Are you not used to it?

764
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:09,950
Thank you.
