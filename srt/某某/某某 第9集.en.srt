1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,570
Everyone,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,810
the punctuation in an essay is very important.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,690
Whether you use it correctly or not

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,790
affects your essay scores

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,620
and whether you'll lose points.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,080
So you must remember this.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,410
For ellipses,

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,700
how many dots are there in an ellipsis?

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,650
Please.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,540
Six.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,140
That's right, six dots.

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,980
And don't add a period after every sentence.

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,120
What does a period mean?

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,250
It means the end of conversation.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,900
It means the sentence is complete,

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,630
a final point.

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,790
As for the ellipsis,

18
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,790
it means the opposite of the period.

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,930
An ellipsis means there's more to say.

20
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,210
It indicates something is ongoing.

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,530
Finally,

22
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,610
for the dash,

23
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,130
it's straight...

24
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,950
Head up.

25
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,990
Feet up.

26
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,710
Faster, faster.

27
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,530
Li Yu, Song Sirui.

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,560
Are you running turtles?

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,890
I can't do it, sir.

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,990
I can't.

31
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,740
I'm dying.

32
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,030
Be careful.

33
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,120
I don't want to run anymore.

34
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,440
You just gave up?

35
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,830
This is just the basketball court, not the playground.

36
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,190
The school anniversary is coming up.

37
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,910
Relay races are basic.

38
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,370
At least

39
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,890
get a place.

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
No, give it to other classes.

41
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,789
Oh my.

42
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,580
How can you be so unambitious?

43
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,980
I have faith in you.

44
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,990
I believe Class A

45
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:31,880
can do it.

46
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,210
We can't.

47
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,390
Yes, we can.

48
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,880
Come, Tianyang.

49
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,860
Help me keep track of

50
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,030
the participants for the school event.

51
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,610
Yes.

52
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,950
Finalize the list and give it to me.

53
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,009
Okay.

54
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,750
Alright, class dismissed.

55
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,620
Thank you.

56
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,700
Bye.

57
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,470
Okay, I'll count myself in.

58
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,700
There are four people in the relay race.

59
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,280
Pepper,

60
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,750
you're in.

61
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,180
No.

62
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:01,030
I've checked, and I'll have my period that day.

63
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,650
Your period?

64
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,130
Yes.

65
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,290
Running with your period is even more efficient.

66
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,620
Do you think I'll let you off? Flying kick.

67
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,289
You deserve it.

68
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,410
Then...

69
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,370
Sheng,

70
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,730
I signed you up for the long jump.

71
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,690
Why?

72
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,000
Since you're good at bluffing,

73
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,340
you should jump far.

74
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,030
If that's the case, Jiang Tian should do the high jump.

75
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,500
Because his score is high.

76
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,780
Tian and Qi Jiahao

77
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,360
never join these activities.

78
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,780
Please, please.

79
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,829
What's up?

80
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,220
Okay, okay.

81
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,450
Tian will compete. You guys should cheer.

82
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,110
Okay.

83
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,370
Okay.

84
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,770
It's settled then.

85
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,400
Tian for high jump. Sheng Wang for long jump.

86
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,950
Okay.

87
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,850
3,000-meter race.

88
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,490
Any volunteers?

89
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,130
Yes, Gao Tianyang.

90
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,020
Pepper, you want to tire me out?

91
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,610
Yes, let me tell you,

92
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,329
according to my little notebook,

93
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:59,120
you've dozed off six times in class in the past week,

94
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,490
littered ten times,

95
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,720
and

96
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,220
read comics 20 times.

97
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,540
If I report this,

98
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,320
you might get a demerit.

99
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,950
So, are you running or not?

100
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,570
Yes.

101
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,220
I really want to run the race.

102
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,520
Run.

103
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,040
I'll run the 3,000 meters.

104
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,560
Sheng.

105
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,590
You probably don't know the rules.

106
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,740
Our school's competition

107
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,990
uses a scoring system for each class's events.

108
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,010
The top three in each event

109
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,540
get 15, 12, and 9 points.

110
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,740
The fourth, fifth, and sixth places

111
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,370
get 6, 4, and 2 points.

112
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,400
Last year, we relied on Gao Tianyang alone,

113
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,750
and since he was the only one,

114
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,820
we couldn't improve our points.

115
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,250
But this year, with Sheng and Tian,

116
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,920
we should be safe.

117
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,680
Yeah, we have Sheng and Tian this year.

118
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,610
I think we still have a chance.

119
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,950
So, let's thank Sheng and Tian.

120
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,490
Class A has hope now.

121
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,180
Sheng and Tian.

122
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,290
You're right,

123
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,190
but you can go now.

Scones.

130
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,340
It should be made by Lin.

131
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,730
He learned to make them when he was

132
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,010
studying in the UK.

133
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,410
Want some?

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,820
Yes, of course.

It's good.

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,620
No.

137
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,940
I've checked, and I'll have my period that day.

Running with your period is even more efficient.

142
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,500
I signed you up for the long jump.

143
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,480
Why?

144
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,380
Since you're good at bluffing,

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,690
you should jump far.

146

If that's the case, Jiang Tian should do the high jump.

147
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,670
Because his scores are high.

148
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,990

149
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,890

Didn't get along?

159
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,730
It's okay. Doesn't matter.

160
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,360
It's better this way. No one will disturb me.

161

I used to be your tutor. I know you're not a bad person.

It was your fault getting Sheng Wang beat up.

163

But it's all in the past.

164

Don't mention Sheng Wang to me.

165

It's all in the past? How?

The English Master in our class, Sheng Wang.

167

Are you crazy?

Treating me like a tourist attraction.

169
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,430
No, seriously, getting all 150 questions right is insane.

170
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,220
He's just an outsider who came in halfway.

171
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,570
He has nothing but good grades.

172
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,850
Yet everyone just accepted him so easily.

173
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,480
Why does he get to be so well-liked

174
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,200
without even trying?

175
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,620
Thank you, Sheng.

176
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,940
Thank you, Sheng.

177
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,220
Do you know how hard I tried to fit in with everyone?

178
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,410
When I first transferred to Class A,

179
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,300
I imitated their interests,

180
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,300
studied their topics, and bought them food.

181
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,980
And then?

182
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,860
It took a long time to build our friendship.

183
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,300
And now, because of Sheng Wang, everything is ruined.

184
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,409
Don't you think Sheng Wang is amazing?

185
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,370
Even when copying,

186
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,190
he understands immediately,

187
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,320
unlike Qi Jiahao.

188
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,010
It’s clear they’re not on the same level.

189
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,750
Do you know, Xi?

190
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,480
My English

191
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,280
has always been the best in the class.

192
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,320
Even Jiang Tian ranked second.

193
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,620
My test paper can be considered as a standard answer key.

194
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,790
Do you know how happy I was?

195
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,770
But then came Sheng Wang.

196
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,810
He became the new standard answer key.

197
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,250
Except for you two,

198
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,890
no one else scored over 90.

199
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,000
Jiahao,

200
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,140
do you remember I once told you

201
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,330
that everyone has their own strengths?

202
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,530
Try not to compare yourself to others.

203
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,730
And?

204
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,110
And?

205
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,320
And we're comparing now. What's this?

206
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,039
Isn't this teaching us how to compare?

207
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,409
Isn't comparing who has more friends the same thing?

208
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,780
You're concerned about me now

209
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,920
because fewer people are around me.

210
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,040
I made one mistake,

211
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,570
and now all the cheers,

212
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,000
excitement, and glory have nothing to do with me.

213
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,010
Class A's friendship is so superficial.

214
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,620
Even Jing, who was once the best to me, said

215
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,130
she's disappointed in me.

216
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
So it's not just me feeling bad

217
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,360
but everyone else.

218
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,620
I'm so frustrated. Why me?

219
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,900
It's really good.

220
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,200
Zhao Xiaoxi, do you want one?

221
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,390
You eat.

222
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,500
Zhao Xiaoxi, what's wrong?

223
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,560
You look weird today.

224
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,810
Do you think

225
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,670
we have to suffer when we're young to grow up?

226
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,200
If you can't get through things when you're young,

227
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,690
will you be able to move on when you grow up?

228
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,730
Zhao Xiaoxi,

229
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,670
I didn't know you could be so sentimental.

230
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,890
I thought you were

231
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,500
always thinking about

232
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,330
how to have fun, fight, and cause trouble.

233
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,580
Jenny Yang.

234
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,400
What's up?

235
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,620
Yes.

236
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,160
I think

237
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,770
youth is like a color,

238
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,700
and time is like the light.

239
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,490
As time shines,

240
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,840
the things that don't fade as you grow up

241
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,290
are the things you don't want to let go of.

242
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,490
As for whether it's painful,

243
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,940
it depends on the colors you leave behind.

244
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,630
So,

245
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,340
don't leave too many blank spaces in your youth.

246
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,430
When you have something to enjoy, grab it quickly,

247
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,640
or you'll end up with a blank youth when you grow up.

248
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,600
Got it?

249
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,240
Jenny Yang.

250
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,390
You're lame.

251
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,390
You are.

252
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,030
Isn't it lame?

253
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:18,990
I think...

254
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,740
Talking about youth and such

255
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,090
sounds really lame coming from you.

256
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,200
I think it's quite mature.

257
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,330
"Mature" doesn't

258
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,620
apply to you.

259
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,120
Zhao Xiaoxi,

260
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,330
you're the immature one.

261
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,820
Yes, you're the most mature.

262
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,080
You don't understand.

263
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,590
I really don't.

264
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,410
You can't appreciate it.

265
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,860
Are you going to eat or not?

266
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,250
If you don't, I'll eat it all.

267
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:51,970
Go ahead.

268
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,160
I'm afraid it's not enough for you.

269
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,890
Then I'll eat them all.

270
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,760
None for you.

271
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,010
[30th Anniversary School Sports Meeting]

272
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,660
Announcement.

273
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,990
[Danying High School]

274
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,110
Dear guests, welcome to the 30th

275
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,150
anniversary sports meeting of Danying High School.

276
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,270
Danying High School is a school with good traditions.

277
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,540
Class C, are you ready?

278
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,780
Shout your slogan!

279
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,490
Wisdom and courage first, set sail for victory.

280
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,990
Bravo!

281
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,700
Good luck, everyone. Don't get hurt.

282
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,280
Thank you.

283
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Ms. Chen.

284
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,450
The most handsome teacher in our school.

285
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,660
Now, Class B, show me what you've got.

286
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,400
One, two, three, go!

287
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,960
Go forward with courage, we're sports talents.

288
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,040
Go, Ms. Chen!

289
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,850
Now, my excellent Class A,

290
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,560
shout your slogan.

291
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,950
Three, two, one.

292
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,610
Winning or losing, it's all the same.

293
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,950
Hey, it's a competition.

294
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,020
What's with the slogan, "Winning or losing, it's all the same"?

295
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,220
Who came up with this?

296
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,800
Gao Tianyang.

297
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,250
Gao Tianyang, seriously?

298
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:13,710
Sir,

299
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,700
this is the true sports spirit.

300
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,920
It's about participating,

301
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,890
not winning.

302
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,500
You have so many reasons.

303
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,990
But we are definitely

304
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:22,670
very serious.

305
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,530
Look, we specially designed these class shirts.

306
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,110
A.

307
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,900
Super A.

308
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,380
Super A.

309
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,250
A is fine, but Super A?

310
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,410
Who dares to wear this?

311
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,950
Sir, none of us wants to wear it.

312
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,520
It's a total waste of our money.

313
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,440
No, it's pretty.

314
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,340
No.

315
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,530
Super A really suits your Class A.

316
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,540
Super Class A.

317
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,510
Wow.

318
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,390
Is this our Goddess Jing?

319
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,550
Ms. Yang.

320
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,350
What's up?

321
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,020
I feel

322
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm in love.

323
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,850
Gross.

324
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,930
Everyone, does Ms. Yang look beautiful today?

325
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,030
Yes.

326
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,420
Alright, stop.

327
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,520
Stop your flattering.

328
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,780
Alright, who still hasn't changed into the class shirt?

329
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,030
Hurry up and get changed.

330
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,910
Then, we'll meet at the command stand for a group photo.

331
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,110
-Okay.
-I'm leaving.

332
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,410
Did you hear

333
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,700
Jing say to get changed? Little Mouth Xu.

334
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,150
No, I can take photos without changing.

335
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,450
We'll go check out the other classes.

336
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,790
You really have no taste.

337
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,300
You don't understand art. Sheng gets me.

338
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,730
Hey, give me another one.

339
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,870
You want to wear two? Fine.

340
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,810
No,

341
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,550
he's wearing it.

342
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,740
No way, Tian.

343
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,820
I'm not wearing it.

344
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,660
Gao worked hard to design and make it.

Just wear it.

No, I won't.

Just for one day.

Nope.

Please.

350

Please.

351

Please.

352

Please, Jiang Tian.

353
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,910
Come on, just wear it.

354

Just for one day, please.

355
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,320
Did you see it?

356
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,940
Tian is wearing it. Are you going to wear it?

357
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,740
Fine.

358
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,510
Take it.

359
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,600
Hand them out.

Change and come back for the photo.

OK.

383
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,240
Mr. He,

384
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,540
what was Class A's score last year?

385
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,120
Oh, our score last year was…

386
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,250
Last year, our class was at the bottom.

387
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,820
Bottom.

388
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,500
Oh, you all look so motivated this year.

389
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,280
You won't be at the bottom again, right?

390
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,410
How about this?

391
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,770
I'll make a bet with you.

392
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,010
If you win first place in the relay race,

393
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,670
I'll buy everyone drinks.

394
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,690
If you lose, you'll have to clean the toilet for a week.

395
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,860
Dean, the bet is so lame.

396
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,569
Losing means cleaning the toilet for a week,

397
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:05,900
but winning only gets drinks?

398
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,900
Yeah.

399
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:09,859
That's not fair.

400
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,020
What do you suggest?

401
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,520
Running naked.

402
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,079
Let's make a big bet.

403
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,819
It's more sincere that way

404
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,230
and won't look like us bullying them.

405
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,109
Right?

406
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,770
Yes.

407
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:23,760
Bet.

408
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,750
That's true.

409
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,569
Really?

410
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes.

411
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,500
Are you up for it, Dean?

412
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,190
Bet, bet, bet!

413
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,920
Alright, bet it is. I'm not afraid.

414
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,790
Okay.

415

If you win first place in the relay race,

416
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,230
I'll run naked.

417
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,710
Is that okay?

418
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,210
Okay.

Is it us or Class B?

Wait.

you heard it wrong.

I said the overall first place,

and you have to win the teacher's event.

462

What?

463
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,980
-That's cheating.
-Not keeping promises.

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,000
but now you ate it secretly.

690
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,300
The scones I made?

691
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,540
Yes.

692
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,260
Oh, stop arguing.

693
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,830
I'll make more next time.

694
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,920
I heard you have many specialties.

695
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,690
I want to try them all next time.

696
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,700
No problem.

697
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,960
It's a deal then.

698
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,790
Deal.

699
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,290
Zhao Xiaoxi, your hand.

700
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,750
-Come on.
-Your hand. Hurry.

701
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:13,870
Here.

702
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,610
Anyway, no matter what happens,

703
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,360
we must face it bravely.

704
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,040
That's right.

705
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,080
Face what?

706
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,210
Look, your hand is injured.

707
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,360
You need to apply some medicine too.

708
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,790
In the martial world,

709
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,570
you always have a few scars.

710
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,650
Yes.

711
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,630
Thanks for saving me, hero.

712
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,700
Unfortunately, I can't marry you.

713
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,050
I finally see what you were like back then.

714
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,000
Alright, let's go.

715
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,640
Let's go.

716
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,870
Don't move.

717
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,010
Little Mouth Xu.

718
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:46,870
Kneel.

719
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,530
Good luck, Dean.

720
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,530
Are you crazy? Are you on drugs?

721
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,160
You got hurt.

722
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,210
I'm fine. Let's continue.

723
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,240
Let me see.

724
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,920
Don't move.

725
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,080
Referee,

726
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,200
we want to cancel.

727
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,790
I'm fine.

728
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,910
Sheng Wang's foot is injured. I'll take him to the health room.

729
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,090
-Okay.
-Jiang Tian.

730
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,640
-What should we do?
-Come up.

731
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,130
We have to run naked.

732
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:30,980
Come up.

733
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:34,800
Come up.

734
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,080
Song Sirui,

735
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,490
you'll replace me.

736
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,060
Me?

737
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:49,550
Song Sirui.

738
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,400
No, they...

739
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,680
Forget it.

740
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,390
Ready?

741
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,910
Hurry!

742
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,850
We're doomed.

743
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,910
We're going to run naked.

744
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,660
Hey,

745
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,370
it's you, not us.

746
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,230
Not me.

747
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,030
You have to join us.

748
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,200
No way.

749
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,980
Luckily,

750
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,330
I really don't want to see my dad run naked.

751
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,770
Why didn't you let me carry you in the first place?

752
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,520
Because it's embarrassing.

753
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,020
There's no need to be embarrassed.

754
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,140
Besides,

755
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,870
it's not the first time.

756
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:09,900
Hey,

757
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,610
your neck is in my hands now.

758
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,570
Watch your mouth.

759
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,130
You're in my hands now.

760
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,610
What's wrong? Go on.

761
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,540
Nothing.

762
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,870
Are you tired?

763
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,150
I won't be tired if you don't move.

764
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,020
Are you tired?

765
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,480
Me?

766
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,750
Why would I be tired?

767
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:54,490
Your neck is stiff. Aren't you tired?

768
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,020
Mind your foot injury.

769
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,650
Don't move around for the next few days.

770
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,390
Okay.

771
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,940
You keep an eye on him.

772
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,430
Let's go.

773
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,040
Don't move.

774
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,750
What's wrong?

775
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,570
It's not a cast.

776
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,710
A souvenir.

777
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,060
Hey,

778
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,990
you're the king of few words again?

779
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,060
Drawing a period.

780
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,550
A period means the end, you know?

781
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,310
Do you like it?

782
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,000
An ellipsis means there's more to say.

783
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,180
It indicates something is ongoing.

784
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,180
How are you?

785
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,510
Sheng.

786
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,940
How was the competition?

787
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,460
Sorry, it's my fault.

788
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,270
No, it's my fault.

789
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,970
I wish I'd taken care not to hurt my foot.

790
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,450
Sheng, how's your foot?

791
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,870
The doctor said I need to rest for a while.

792
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,560
It's no big deal. Don't worry.

793
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,150
Have a good rest.

794
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,360
Hey, Tian.

795
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,210
Can I borrow your pen?

796
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,080
This is what movies do.

797
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,560
When you get injured,

798
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,210
we sign on the bandage.

799
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,570
I'm going to change it tonight.

800
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,660
Be gentle.

801
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,410
I know. I won't hurt your Sheng.

802
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,220
Your handwriting is so ugly.

803
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,320
Love you.

804
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,750
What kind of scribbles are these?

805
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,470
Pepper.

806
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,400
Hey, it's itchy over there.

807
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,740
Hey, be gentle there.

808
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,210
Sheng, I wish you to get well soon.

809
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,060
Get well soon.

810
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,130
But, did we forget something?

811
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,490
An important thing.

812
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,320
Oh, right.

813
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,720
I think so.

814
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,820
A bet is a bet.

815
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,440
Let's go.

816
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,940
Let me help you.

817
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,950
Let me see.

818
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,720
Put in the uninjured foot.

819
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,820
I'll get the other for you.

820
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,900
Okay, thank you.

821
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,880
Let's go.

822
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,890
Let's go.

823
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,570
Hurry up.

824
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:33,670
Yes. Put all the things away first.

825
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,310
Alright. Okay.

826
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,010
Yes, those.

827
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,640
Is your foot okay?

828
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,430
That's it.

829
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,200
Go take a rest.

830
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:49,620
How is it?

831
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,520
Dean,

832
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,570
a bet is a bet.

833
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:54,760
It's...

834
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,000
It's no big deal.

835
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,700
Stop it. Go back now.

836
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,360
No,

837
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,380
we have to keep our promise.

838
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,510
We have to run naked.

839
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:02,770
Well...

840
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,680
Don't joke about this.

841
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,950
Don't you hear me?

842
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:06,530
Go back now.

843
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:07,860
A bet is a bet.

844
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,050
A bet is a bet.

845
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,960
Fine.

846
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,250
Stop messing around.

847
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,240
Go back.

848
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,320
Keep your promise.

849
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,350
Cool.

850
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,280
Are you serious?

851
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,580
No, stop it, okay?

852
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,910
It's just a joke.

853
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:23,410
Go back now.

854
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:24,020
Get ready.

855
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,110
Take off the clothes.

856
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,580
Hey.

857
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,390
Don't take it off.

858
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,810
Don't. Stop it.

859
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,990
Don't take it off. Stop it.

860
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,250
Turn around.

861
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,580
What?

862
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,680
Don't take it off.

863
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,460
Hey, stop looking.

864
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:54,700
Run!

865
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,110
One, two, three, four.

866
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,550
Two tigers. Two tigers.

867
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,920
It's fine to take a peek.

868
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:12,450
The book says

869
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,890
16 or 17-year-old boys are always shining.

870
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,300
The end of summer is coming.

871
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,930
Some cicadas

872
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,630
didn't emerge in time,

873
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,340
suffering all summer.

874
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,120
And someone

875
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,880
is trapped at the end of sommer,

876
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,560
waiting for

877
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:32,190
his only one.
