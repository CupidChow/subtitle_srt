00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,490
all the Jiangs are impressive.

173
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,900
Impressive.

174
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,940
Look at Jiang Tian.

175
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,320
His pictures are all lined up in a row at the top of the Honor Roll.

176
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,630
He came first in all subjects.

177
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,030
He's really impressive.

178
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,150
OK. And then...

179
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,420
There are eight classes

180
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,909
in each grade here.

181
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,409
Three, two, one! Yeah!

182
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,670
There's a seat over there. It's yours.

183
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,710
Dean!

184
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,370
Dad.

185
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,050
Morning, Dean.

186
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,740
Here, this seat is for you.

187
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,440
I know.

188
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,750
It must be hard for you to catch up now.

189
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,610
The only way

190
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,920
is to ask other students sitting next to you

191
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,750
if you have any questions.

192
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,320
Do you know why we reserved

193
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,780
this special desk for you?

194
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,590
Out of the whole grade,

195
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,350
only he is the most suitable and the best.

196
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,820
Many students ask him about his homework after class.

197
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,460
He is...

198
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,500
Hey, this boy...

199
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,310
Dean!

200
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,240
We have a meeting later.

201
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,370
Okay. Got it.

202
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,909
I'll be right there.

203
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,510
Thank you.

204
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,870
You're sleeping so...

205
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,549
Oh, right.

206
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,710
I'll let it slide since it's your first day here.

207
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,990
Starting tomorrow,

208
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,420
earphones and phones

209
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,280
will not be allowed in the classroom.

210
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,700
Oh.

211
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,980
Don't let me catch you.

212
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,350
Gao Tianyang,

213
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,620
so what if you blocked it? It's the second time.

214
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,990
See? Case in point.

215
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,830
I'll confiscate it.

216
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,120
Here, Chief of Discipline.

217
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,730
Yes.

218
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,700
Deduct three points for Gao Tianyang for playing with his cell phone.

219
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,600
He swore.

220
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,990
Deduct one more point!

221
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,680
Got it!

222
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,550
Huh, you study hard.

223
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,870
You got caught again, huh?

224
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,090
I'm sorry.

225
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,150
Seems like your phone was confiscated because of me.

226
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,980
But...

227
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,390
I'm sorry for your loss.

228
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,750
Forget it. It's not your fault.

229
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,530
It's not the first time, anyway.

230
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,830
Anyway, every once in a while, they'll check to see who's carrying a phone.

231
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,620
You can ask any classmate

232
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,050
and see whose phone hasn't been confiscated before.

233
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:41,970
I haven't.

234
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,550
Bro,

235
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,470
you are so young.

236
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,110
What's gotten into you?

237
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,440
You transferred to a new school in the second grade

238
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,580
and to our class?

239
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,290
It's because of my dad.

240
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,370
Class is starting. Please sit down, newcomer.

241
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,020
Okay.

242
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Back to your seat.

243
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,040
Class begins.

244
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,420
Your breathing sounds disturbed me.

245
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,160
My... My breathing sounds disturbed you?

246
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,410
Tian, he is the newcomer today.

247
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Big Mouth Xu wants you to help him with his study.

248
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,060
What are you doing?

249
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,090
Changing seats. You sit in the front.

250
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,110
Why should I have to sit in the front?

251
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,610
What do you think?

252
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,160
Come on, new classmate.

253
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,370
Jiang Tian

254
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,900
is not a morning person.

255
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,970
Don't mind him.

256
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,550
Okay.

257
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,430
So, he’s Jiang Tian?

258
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,570
Yes.

259
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,120
I've really been having issues with all the Jiangs recently.

260
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,870
Yeah.

261
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,090
Wow.

262
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,490
I really don't know why.

263
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,740
But it seems like

264
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,030
I've had issues with everyone named Jiang.

265
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,730
Why?

266
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,110
I don't know. Just...

267
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,400
Wang!

268
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,500
Come on. Come on.

269
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,250
Hurry up.

270
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,270
Come on. Let me introduce you.

271
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,530
Come on. Here.

272
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,350
Here.

273
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,810
Wang, this is Auntie Jiang.

274
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,330
I've been meaning to introduce you.

275
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,620
Didn't we invite you to dinner, but you didn't come?

276
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,820
We finally met today.

277
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,950
Wang.

278
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,820
Auntie Jiang and I went to the same elementary school together.

279
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,580
We lost contact for a long time.

280
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,060
Until a few years ago, we got in touch on the Internet.

281
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,820
Have a seat.

282
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,110
Thank you.

283
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,100
Let me eat first.

284
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,310
Don't sneak food.

285
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,650
Well... I'm hungry.

286
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,470
Yeah.

287
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,270
Is it good?

288
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,580
It's delicious.

289
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,580
I wonder if Sheng Wang likes

290
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,870
what I've cooked for him.

291
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,860
Of course, he'll like it.

292
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,930
I've already tasted it.

293
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,660
It's so good.

294
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,710
He is not you.

295
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,530
I don't know.

296
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,780
I just feel anxious.

297
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,310
I don't know how he'll react when he sees me.

298
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,410
Honey.

299
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,720
Everything will be just fine.

300
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,870
Don't be nervous.

301
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,270
I'll call and ask him where he is now.

302
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,280
It’s okay.

303
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,340
This is Jiang Tian, Auntie Jiang's son.

304
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,830
Him?

305
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,220
Jiang Tian is a few months older than you.

306
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,380
So you have to call him "Big Brother."

307
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,110
Big brother?

308
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,340
Good boy.

309
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,100
You...

310
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,700
Well,

311
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,200
you must have met each other at school today.

312
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,210
I slept all day. I didn't notice him.

313
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,260
Well...

314
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:25,820
What are you doing?

315
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,520
Well,

316
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,620
it's your first day as classmates. It's normal that he doesn't remember your face.

317
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,570
You'll get to know each other better as you spend time together.

318
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,700
I'll go ahead if there's nothing else.

319
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,830
There is something.

320
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,750
My stomach hurts.

321
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,770
I have to go first.

322
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,240
Hey, Wang! Wang!

323
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,090
Tian, what are you doing? Where are you going?

324
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,290
I'm going to Old Ding.

325
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,730
You kid.

326
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,640
Wang, are you alright?

327
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,140
It's best to drink this when you're not feeling well.

328
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,580
Here.

329
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,050
Why do you keep hanging up on me?

330
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,860
Oh, I see.

331
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,950
You've come to a new school.

332
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,700
Now you've made new friends, so you completely left me behind.

333
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,030
I'm telling you. Me, Peng Xie, I'm just...

334
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,530
Hello?

335
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,830
Excuse me, why do you keep hanging up...

336
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,400
Fine. Fine.

337
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,880
I won't ask anymore, okay?

338
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,320
I apologize to you, okay?

339
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,410
Sure.

340
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,300
Get me the second year's final exam papers

341
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,100
for Math, Physics, and Chemistry.

342
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,510
Final exam papers for Math, Physics, and Chemistry?

343
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,710
Why do you want those?

344
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,660
[Fundamental Physics 1]

345
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,990
No way. That serious?

346
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,050
[Chemistry 1]

347
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,620
[Chinese 1]

348
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,740
The semester has just begun, and you're already previewing?

349
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,810
But that's not right.

350
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,410
Preview? Why do you need the final exam papers?

351
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,599
Hey, give me a reply.

352
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,310
Sheng Wang!

353
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,390
Mr. Sheng!

354
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,089
Again?

355
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,359
Fine, so you'll keep ignoring me

356
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,619
if I don't get you the exam papers, right?

357
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,060
Alright.

358
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:17,920
You're good.

359
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,900
You're so handsome, so you make the call here.

360
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,599
Math, Physics, and Chemistry, right?

361
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,910
Okay, I'll get those for you.

362
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,030
Wait. That's not right.

363
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,470
Why don't you need Chinese and English exam papers?

364
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,890
That's discrimination.

365
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,200
You're being discriminatory.

366
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,110
How can I study all of this in one night?

367
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,570
We have to make a choice, you know?

368
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,340
No.

369
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,860
It's all because of the sick school

370
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,390
I was transferred to today.

371
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,910
Turns out they're about to have an exam tomorrow.

372
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,840
And it's about all the contents of the last semester.

373
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,170
Why hasn't a teacher come

374
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,060
since the class started long ago?

375
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,600
Today is Saturday,

376
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,260
and it's summer school.

377
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,260
So, it's a day of self-study.

378
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,640
You didn't bring your exam papers or homework?

379
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,950
It's my first day.

380
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,660
Oh, right.

381
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,470
What do you use to review?

382
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,440
Textbooks.

383
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,660
Review?

384
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,810
Why do I need to review?

385
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,890
Because there is a weekly exam next week.

386
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,780
What?

387
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,410
E...x...a...m.

388
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,190
About what?

389
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,050
What we learned in the first year?

390
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,830
That was the exam before the last exam.

391
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,690
It's not about the first year.

392
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,600
It's about this, this.

393
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,040
Didn't the Dean say this is what we need to learn this semester?

394
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,570
Theoretically, yes.

395
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,880
But we've finished it.

396
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,210
We finished these a couple of days ago. Today is a self-study day,

397
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,150
and exams are tomorrow.

398
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,410
After that, we'll start the classes for the next semester.

399
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,440
How many subjects have you finished?

400
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,530
Both.

401
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,100
Do you mean all of these?

402
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,860
No. So, you mean

403
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,680
I'll have exams on the five subjects I haven't learned yet.

404
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,350
I think so.

405
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,560
Can I take a leave?

406
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,950
I don't think so.

407
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,180
I can only say, bro,

408
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,200
you have a long way to go. Take care.

409
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,920
You can always find someone

410
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,620
to kick Big Mouth Xu's ass after graduation.

411
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,770
Any other questions?

412
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,470
Yes.

413
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,330
Say it.

414
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,990
I want to drop out.

415
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,910
If I don't cram up now,

416
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,970
I'll end up with five zeros tomorrow.

417
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,770
As for Chinese and English,

418
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,110
I don't have much time now. It depends on fate.

419
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,220
Math, Physics, and Chemistry can be saved.

420
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,180
Wait.

421
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,750
What good are the exam papers then?

422
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,770
It's not like they're going to test everything on the papers.

423
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,400
Who said I wanted to do those questions on the papers?

424
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,860
I want to check

425
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,180
the distribution of the scores on the exam papers.

426
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,020
What?

427
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,360
In short,

428
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,960
although test questions vary from school to school,

429
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,920
the key points are pretty much the same.

430
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,240
I want to see the distribution of the scores on the exam papers

431
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,310
and find out the key points.

432
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,510
And I'll focus on the key points tonight

433
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,870
to cram up.

434
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,140
That way, my combat value will be higher.

435
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,020
Wow, you can do that?

436
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,660
What else can I do?

437
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,210
I'm grasping at anything now.

438
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,990
By the way, well,

439
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,090
do you still remember the formula for guessing the answers?

440
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,720
I forgot.

441
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,610
Wow!

442
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,970
Here comes the day when our Sheng Wang has to guess answers.

443
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,330
There's nothing I can do.

444
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,960
Well, for what it's worth,

445
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,000
my name used to be on the top row of the Honor Roll.

446
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,140
[Jiang Tian]

447
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,090
What do you think?

448
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,780
I can't let them mock me

449
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,130
right after I've just started at their school.

450
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,860
Plus,

451
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,750
I can't embarrass our school.

452
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,480
Yeah. That's right.

453
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,920
Let me think. I remember it very well.

454
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,200
Then why do you need time to think about it?

455
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,490
Quite.

456
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,620
Oh, I got it!

457
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,420
Choose the shortest choice among three long ones and one short one.

458
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,550
Choose the longest choice among three short ones and one long one.

459
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,620
If all choices are the same length, choose A. If all are equally short, choose B.

460
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,630
If the choices vary in length or are uneven, choose C blindly.

461
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,660
If there are two long choices and two short choices, you're D.

462
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,320
What D?

463
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,210
You are a D.

464
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,230
I'm helping you, and you scold me.

465
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,290
Alright. Enough chatting.

466
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:09,890
Bye.

467
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,150
Now it's the Math test answer sheet.

468
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,910
Start writing after the bell.

469
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,250
Everyone should have a sense of honor.

470
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,250
The exam is for your own good.

471
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,160
Cheating, looking at others' sheets, and copying from others

472
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,530
are all wrong.

473
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,810
You should be prepared.

474
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,740
Come on.

475
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,960
At least there is a new student who will be the last for you.

476
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,300
What are you going to do?

477
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,740
What else can I do?

478
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,410
Not a darn thing.

479
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,260
If worse comes to worst, just choose "C" for all the multiple-choice questions.

480
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,460
Why are you laughing?

481
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,130
Darn it.

482
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,190
You don't have multiple-choice questions on the Math exam.

483
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,590
What?

484
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,310
You should try to write "C"

485
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,130
for all the fill-in-the-blank questions.

486
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,530
I'll answer the question however I like. It's none of your business.

487
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,590
You actually poked me just to tell me that?

488
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,470
Are you crazy?

489
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,240
What?

490
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,950
How long are you going to

491
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,140
hold my test paper?

492
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,310
The exam starts.

493
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,810
Time's up.

494
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,890
Stop writing.

495
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,410
Pass the sheet forward.

496
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,840
Hey, where are you going?

497
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,730
Oh, my bottle is empty.

498
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,750
I wanna get some water for the next subject's exam.

499
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,150
Don't you know there is another exam paper?

500
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:04,970
Oh.

501
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,290
I forgot to mention that our school's Math test has two papers.

502
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,190
One formal test

503
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,590
and a paper about additional questions.

504
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,950
What other rules does your school have?

505
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:32,970
Hey.

506
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,540
There are no other rules

507
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,970
except for Math.

508
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,900
Give me the exam paper.

509
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,820
Did you all get the second test paper?

510
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,160
You may answer now.

511
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,900
I heard that the cute guy in Class A is going to get a zero on his test today.

512
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,170
I heard that he hasn't studied the entire textbook at all.

513
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,460
He's so handsome.

514
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,460
Okay, it's decided then.

515
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,900
I'll leave the upgrade of the school's network to you again.

516
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,380
Okay.

517
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,580
Your dad...

518
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,110
My dad and I have nothing to do with each other.

519
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm going if there's nothing else.

520
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,060
Okay.

521
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,190
Well...

522
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,790
I didn't eavesdrop.

523
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,120
It's just... Old He...

524
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,000
Our Homeroom Teacher asked me to come to the office.

525
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,980
Our Homeroom Teacher is only in his early thirties.

526
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,460
He is not old.

527
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,660
Isn't the Homeroom Teacher looking for you?

528
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,420
Come in now.

529
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,090
Oh.

530
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,800
Old... Well, Homeroom Teacher, you wanted to see me?

531
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,100
Yes, you're here.

532
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:09,630
Yes.

533
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,030
It's nothing, actually.

534
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,250
It's just that I happened to be away for a physics seminar,

535
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,240
so I was not at school.

536
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm sorry that I didn't

537
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,120
properly introduce you to the class.

538
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,180
Also, another thing is about progress.

539
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,390
I heard from Dean Xu

540
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,620
that you're a whole textbook behind.

541
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,240
I was not here.

542
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,720
Otherwise, I could have told them

543
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,690
that you didn't need to take the weekly exam today.

544
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,200
What?

545
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,840
I've already finished it.

546
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,540
So, you must have had a rough couple of hours

547
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,780
just taking the exam.

548
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,370
It's okay. We understand your situation.

549
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,340
Your grade this time doesn't count.

550
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,130
It's normal that you only get 5 or 10 scores.

551
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,390
Don't feel pressured.

552
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,970
Okay.

553
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,370
But

554
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,990
it is a problem for you to be so far behind.

555
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,740
Our Class A covers the textbooks very quickly.

556
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,660
Although it's only the first semester of the second year,

557
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,830
we'll finish all the classes of the third year.

558
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,390
We can't stop just for you.

559
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,230
So, you have to find a way for yourself

560
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,370
to catch up with the progress

561
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,100
and make up the missed lessons.

562
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:00,870
Oh.

563
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,090
Also, this test doesn't count,

564
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,210
but there's another weekly exam next week.

565
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,790
You can't go on like this.

566
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,240
So I've discussed it with other teachers.

567
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,230
How about we set up

568
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,240
a small target?

569
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,270
Let's catch up on the progress

570
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,930
one week after another, okay?

571
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,910
Okay.

572
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,750
Very good.

573
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,200
I hope you can get 50 scores

574
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,070
in Physics and Chemistry.

575
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,330
Without additional questions,

576
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,480
I hope you can get at least 60 scores in Math.

577
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,150
I won't set a goal for your Chinese and English.

578
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,680
Let's adjust it according to your situation.

579
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,400
Why? Is it hard?

580
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,190
Well...

581
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,920
No, this is it then.

582
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,390
Okay, I'm done.

583
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,380
Study hard.

584
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,100
Okay.

585
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,430
Are you kidding me?

586
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,060
The semester has just started,

587
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,870
and there are two to three test papers per subject.

588
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,530
Chinese has fill-in-the-blank questions and composition.

589
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,110
English has a whole set of grammatical questions.

590
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,510
It's your first day here.

591
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,130
You'll get used to it later.

592
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,710
I'm dropping out.

593
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,350
It's too late.

594
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,610
I was wondering what has gotten into you since you transferred to Danying

595
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,870
and joined our Class A.

596
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,290
The scores for yesterday's weekly exam came out.

597
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,360
I'm sure

598
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,800
you're all very eager to know your results.

599
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,820
Unfortunately, I have to say

600
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,860
that the average score of our class this time

601
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,190
is lower than last time.

602
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,660
What?

603
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,460
Some students

604
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,170
really put in a lot of effort

605
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,190
to lower the overall class average.

606
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:12,980
Hey. Hey.

607
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,910
How come you have the nerve to look at him?

608
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,300
I was about to say it.

609
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,620
Sheng Wang.

610
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,580
Please stand up.

611
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,390
He only joined our class the day before yesterday

612
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,010
and hadn't studied any of the subjects before.

613
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,840
However, he still scored higher

614
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,760
than the average scores

615
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,180
in Math, Physics, and Chemistry,

616
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,790
despite not passing.

617
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,460
His grades in Chinese and English are even much higher than the average scores.

618
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,690
He scored 10 to 20 points higher

619
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,220
than some of you advanced students

620
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,270
who have studied all the textbooks.

621
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,680
It only took him one day

622
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,380
to do it.

623
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,600
Sheng Wang, thank you for encouraging us.

624
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,240
Sit down.

625
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,530
Okay.

626
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,860
Next, I'll hand out the exam papers,

627
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,780
and you can correct your mistakes.

628
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,990
Hand it over after corrections,

629
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,050
and let's start today's test papers.

630
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,540
Let's not waste time.

631
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,870
Although it's only the summer vacation in sophomore year,

632
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,080
time is limited.

633
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,490
If you have any questions, ask the students sitting next to you.

634
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,090
If you're still unsure, consult the teachers.

635
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,020
Revise it quickly.

636
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,480
Thank you.

637
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
I'll confiscate it.

638
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,250
In case your hand gets itchy again.

639
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:43,930
You...

640
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,360
Do you want your test papers or not?

641
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,250
Give me money, and I'll give you your papers.

642
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,890
I don't have any money.

643
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,070
Weren't you listening to the teacher?

644
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,070
We need to submit the papers immediately after making corrections.

645
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,760
No.

646
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,130
Do you have a lot of time?

647
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,530
Let me run the simple math for you.

648
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,070
Assume you can finish a practice paper in 30 minutes.

649
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,050
One subject has two to three papers.

650
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,590
There are ten papers for five subjects.

651
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,450
Then it'll take you five hours to finish the papers.

652
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,790
With an extra hour for a shower and dinner.

653
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,000
At least

654
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,760
you'll need six hours.

655
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,200
What time do you think you can go to bed tonight?

656
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,690
Besides, you may not be able to finish one in 30 minutes.

657
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,640
Right,

658
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,170
there are some very challenging classic questions.

659
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,260
It may take you 30 minutes...

660
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,050
or 30 30 minutes to solve one question.

661
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,440
Hey!

662
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,280
Yes?

663
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,460
Lend me your red pen.

664
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,280
I have to use it.

665
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,280
I'll lend you my paper to copy later.

666
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,490
Here, try it.

667
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,380
See if it's marinated well.

668
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:54,870
Sure.

669
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,930
Yeah, it's good.

670
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,480
Hey, Wang, you're back.

671
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,380
Hey, Wang, wait!

672
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,600
I'm talking to you, Wang.

673
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,120
I called Xu today,

674
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,940
your Dean of Student Affairs.

675
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,790
He said you did well on the exam yesterday.

676
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,320
Then you must be very strict with me.

677
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,720
I failed three subjects.

678
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,180
It's really hard to communicate with him.

679
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,030
I told you I shouldn't have moved in for the time being.

680
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,830
It's okay.

681
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,510
It's always a process of getting used to it.

682
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,160
When dinner is ready, bring it upstairs for him.

683
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,110
No, he'll come down to eat when he is hungry.

684
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,780
But...

685
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,410
This kid...

686
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,250
He is hard on the outside and soft on the inside.

687
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,400
But he knows who's good and who's bad.

688
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,860
He's not targeting you.

689
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,580
He just...

690
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,990
He just needs time.

691
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,040
Yes. Yes.

692
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,250
Stop looking.

693
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,790
As long as he doesn't cry, it's nothing.

694
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,880
Well, Wang is back.

695
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,940
Where's Tian?

696
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:00,720
Right.

697
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,260
I told Tian to move in today.

698
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:05,790
But...

699
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,969
Let's eat.

700
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,320
Hello?

701
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,270
Hey, Crab,

702
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,410
have you asked the question I asked you?

703
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,870
Yes.

704
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,720
I've asked the top students in the second year about it.

705
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,200
They were not happy that they couldn't solve the question,

706
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,360
so they went to ask the seniors in the third year.

707
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,320
What kind of sick school is yours?

708
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,440
What kind of question is that?

709
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,450
They think they're having an international competition?

710
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,780
But seriously,

711
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,090
you're good.

712
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,910
You only don't know that one question on the whole paper.

713
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,200
Didn't you just transfer there?

714
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,860
How come you know everything?

715
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,860
It's easy.

716
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,480
Just take a look at the questions on the paper

717
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,790
and determine the scope of these questions.

718
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,610
Then, find the corresponding parts in the textbook and read them carefully.

719
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,050
And then do the same types of questions

720
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,670
in the workbook.

721
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,110
Then go back to this test paper

722
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,990
and find out what you're missing. That's okay for it.

723
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,060
Wow, that's amazing.

724
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,160
Enough chit-chat.

725
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,460
Did you get the answer?

726
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,370
The seniors in the third year

727
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,230
are going to stay up late to solve it.

728
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,230
What do you think?

729
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,090
What kind of sick question is that?

730
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,610
They've been scolding me while trying to solve it.

731
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,260
They said I'm the reason they can't sleep tonight.

732
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,520
If they can't sleep today, it's my fault.

733
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,120
Are you good students all having something wrong with your brains?

734
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,370
You can't sleep

735
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,370
if you can't solve that kind of question?

736
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,830
I don't know about others.

737
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,210
But if I lose to Jiang,

738
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,530
I can't sleep.

739

You're weird too.

Why are you so set on beating him?

741
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,940
Is it just because his surname is Jiang?

742
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,070
Do you have some kind of vendetta against all the Jiangs?

743
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,280
I gotta go. I’m hungry.

744
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,410
I'm going to find something to eat.

Do you have some kind of vendetta against all the Jiangs?

It's not that I want to win.

This moment will be forever etched in your mind,

After that, every time you think about it,

You know me.

I'm so hard to get along with.

773

We can just live our separate lives...
