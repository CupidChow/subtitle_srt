Welcome to the upside-down world.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,470
And now, let's check out this month's horoscopes.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,050
Venus and Mars are in a 180-degree opposition,

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,370
creating a fatal yet irresistible attraction.

00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,830
Everything impossible is possible.

Turn around and behold the splendor of the end of the century!

We will now flip your world upside down.

Why on earth did I have to drink that much?

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,960
Good morning.

12
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,430
Let's go.

13
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,410
Why are you just standing there?

14
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,280
After I climb this mountain...

15
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,180
I won!

16
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,200
My stomach hurts.

17
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,700
If possible,

18
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,530
I wish I could stay

19
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,730
in this room forever.

22
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,520
Tian, have a fried egg.

23
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,460
Mom.

24
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,950
Can you fry it a bit more?

25
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,760
Actually, we can give it a try.

26
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,710
Try what?

27
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,650
Try to get closer to each other.

28
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,230
Alright.

29
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,280
I'll fry another one for you.

30
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,530
Wang.

31
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,270
Come and have breakfast. Come on.

32
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,260
Thank you, Auntie.

33
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,730
No need to be so formal with me.

34
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,690
Come on. Have some porridge.

35
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll go fry some more eggs for you.

36
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,510
Isn't there one?

37
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,470
Hey, you...

38
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,720
Here.

39
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,670
Here come the fried eggs.

40
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,160
I need to go to school earlier today.

41
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,459
You...

42
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,089
Wait, Tian.

43
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,650
You don't eat... Are you not going to wait for Wang?

44
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,460
No need.

45
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,510
Didn't you say you wanted it cooked a bit more?

46
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,480
Auntie, I'm full.

47
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,060
Bye.

48
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,460
Weird.

49
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,510
Eat the raw one while...

50
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,570
Aren't the more well-done fried eggs better?

51
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,210
You still want to walk in a straight line?

52
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:35,190
Have you forgotten what happened last night?

53
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,390
Last night?

54
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,130
What walk in straight...

55
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,220
I'm going home.

56
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,950
Home is in the other direction.

57
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,700
I know.

58
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,970
I just wanted to test you.

59
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,150
Really!

60
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,659
If you don't believe me, get your phone out and record me right now.

61
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,430
I can still walk in a straight line.

62
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,740
What do you want?

63
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,860
Take it out and record it!

64
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,070
Here we go.

65
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,050
Did you start to record me?

66
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,260
How is it?

67
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,180
Isn't it a straight line?

68
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,710
Can you walk straight?

69
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,800
No.

70
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,909
Come to me.

71
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,560
See if you can walk straight.

72
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,680
No.

73
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,770
Come on!

74
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,780
You can do it too.

75
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,510
Thank you.

76
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,740
Hey, how am I supposed to record you like this?

77
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,460
I know it.

78
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,450
Hey, you...

79
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,420
Come on.

80
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,740
Since you can go straight, let's go home.

81
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,470
Let's go. I'll keep recording.

82
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,730
Let's go!

83
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,030
Let's go!

84
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,460
Don't shake around.

85
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,780
We're going home.

86
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,580
Go straight. Go straight!

87
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,670
Don't shake, okay?

88
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,920
What about now?

89
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,080
Do you remember now?

90
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,260
Go... straight.

91
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,300
No.

92
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,600
If only I had known,

93
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,800
it would have been better if I had actually had a stomachache

94
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
so that I could just take the day off.

95
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,980
It's not poisonous.

96
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,799
The haws help digestion and prevent diarrhea.

97
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,610
Even if you don't have a stomachache,

98
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,370
you just ate my mom's dark food.

99
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,740
You still need one.

100
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,480
Auntie Jiang gave it to you?

101
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,740
I just ate the breakfast that she prepared this morning.

102
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,160
Then she gave you this.

103
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,410
She's quite nice.

104
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,600
Why did you

105
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,250
suddenly tell me

106
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,580
that we should try to get closer?

107
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,180
So,

108
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,850
you don't want to get closer to me?

109
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,820
That's not what I meant.

110
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,890
So, do you want it or not?

111
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,310
Yes.

112
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,810
Then walk in a straight line for me.

113
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,140
Hey, can you drop that?

114
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,010
Oh, go straight.

115
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,110
You're such a pain.

116
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,990
The trajectory of a punch follows a straight line.

117
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,450
The initial velocity is 0, and the accelerated speed is 50 meters per second.

118
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,410
According to Newton's second law of motion, F=Ma...

119
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,200
Stop it.

120
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,110
Why are you two so late?

121
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,570
Go sit in your seats.

122
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,360
Why is Ms. Jin here so early?

123
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,770
Let's go to our seats.

124
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,020
Both of you, take out your question papers.

125
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,950
Oh no, I haven't finished it.

126
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,540
Neither have I.

127
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,610
That's why I said

128
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,090
-that there are two types of students with good English scores.
-Ms. Jin is here so early.

129
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,500
The first class hasn't started yet.

130
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,620
Why are there so many classmates standing?

131
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,290
I don't know who went to tell her.

132
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,070
She came and checked to see who had copied the question papers.

133
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,150
If I knew who did it, I'd kick...

134
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,460
Remember, love and peace.

135
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,350
Stand up!

136
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,570
I can tell without even checking

137
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,700
that some students definitely haven't done it.

138
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,450
Gao Tianyang,

139
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,710
I'm talking about you.

140
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,870
Take the initiative

141
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,790
and stand up!

142
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,780
Where is your question paper?

143
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,900
Some students

144
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,210
are different.

145
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,870
I can tell without even checking that they've finished the paper.

146
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,000
Come on, Sheng Wang.

147
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,910
Be a good role model for the rest of the students.

148
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,270
Sheng Wang,

149
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,780
I just felt like I was slapped in the face.

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Did you feel that way too?

151
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,740
Stand up!

152
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,890
Any other students who, like these,

153
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,670
havenâ€™t completed their question papers,

154
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,030
take your papers and pens

155
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,560
and finish them outside.

156
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,520
Come back only after you finish it.

157
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,550
Everyone, be more conscientious.

158
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,750
Jiang Tian.

159
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,320
-I shouldn't have gone to the barbecue yesterday.
-Where is your question paper?

160
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,070
Yes, it was so late.

161
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,530
It was midnight when I got home and showered.

162
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,150
Good.

163
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,550
Good.

164
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,670
The rest of you did well.

165
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,090
Don't copy mine. Write it yourself.

166
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,910
Later, if Ms. Jin sees it...

167
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,490
Tian stood up.

168
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:04,920
Jiang Tian?

169
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,420
Wow, Tian is out with us.

170
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,360
Well, it makes me feel a little better.

171
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,780
Don't try to compare yourself to Tian.

172
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,580
Did Ms. Jin say when she would let us go back inside?

173
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,070
Of course, after you have finished it.

174
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,270
Finish it?

175
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,910
By the time I finish these 150 questions,

176
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,030
I think her two classes

177
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,160
will be almost over.

178
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,590
Hey, wait.

179
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,020
We've only been out for a short while, and you're already on question 58,

180
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,470
nearly on question 59?

181
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,340
How long will it take you to finish the 150 questions?

182
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,590
Less than an hour.

183
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,280
Darn it.

184
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,570
C-O-W. You're the cow's horns.

185
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,200
Why haven't you finished it either?

186
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
What do you think?

187
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,410
Then why didn't you come to school earlier...

188
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,560
I need to go to school earlier today.

189
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,420
Are you not going to wait for Wang?

190
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,230
Choose A for this one.

191
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,250
It's about the present progressive tense.

192
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,150
What?

193
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,230
Do you all think being advanced students makes you
so impressive or special?

194
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,160
I heard that our class has just become a tourist spot.

195
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,200
Many students specifically came to watch the so-called advanced students
being punished and standing outside the classroom.

196
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,150
Please.

197
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,630
In the zone, okay?

198
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,440
Put some actual effort into your studies, okay?

199
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,210
Okay?

200
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,780
Okay.

201
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,710
Okay, I still need to announce

202
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,740
that we'll be selecting this year's Excellent Model Students.

203
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,890
As you all know,

204
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,820
as long as you are selected as the city's Excellent Model Student,

205
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,450
you'll get bonus points on the university entrance exam.

206
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,100
It's like getting a ticket to your first-choice university.

207
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
This year, our class has four spots.

208
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,680
As usual,

209
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,340
one spot will be based on grades,

210
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,810
another will be selected from the class cadres,

211
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,640
a third will be chosen through a class vote,

212
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,380
and the additional fourth spot

213
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,740
will go to the student who shows the most improvement in this monthly exam.

214
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,400
Okay, take out your textbook.

215
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,540
Turn to... page 91.

216
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,270
Monitor,

217
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,970
you write the last formula on the blackboard.

218
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,660
Others, take out yesterday's question paper.

219
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,090
Still angry?

220
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,070
I'm sorry. It's all my fault...

221
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,900
I'm down on my knees.

222
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,820
Focus on the class and stop texting me.

223
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,360
Well,

224
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,870
my pen has run out of ink.

225
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,000
Give me a pen refill.

226
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,420
Thanks.

227
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,160
Later,

228
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,710
let's go to the west gate together.

229
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,090
Focus on the class.

230
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,380
Don't tip your chair during class.

231
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,760
Also,

232
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,450
can you stop asking me for pen refills?

233
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,770
Sure.

234
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,740
Can you stop being mad at me?

235
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,880
I have something to do tonight.

236
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,890
If my mom asks,

237
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,410
just tell her that the teacher is keeping me after class.

238
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:42,980
Okay.

239
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,460
Can you stop being mad?

240
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,850
I'm choosing to forget about that, okay?

241
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,340
Sure.

242
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,910
Then, I'll tell Auntie Jiang when I'm back home tonight.

243
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,220
It has nothing to do with drinking.

244
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,440
You know it. During the day,

245
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,339
I have to attend classes with you.

246
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,230
At night, I need to study material from last semester that I haven't learned.

247
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,490
Not a single day do I go to bed before 3 a.m.

248
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,609
And you know what?

249
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,780
I find that your school is really crazy.

250
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,290
The next exam's seating will be arranged by rank.

251
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,290
The student ranked 31st

252
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,660
will be seated in the first seat in Class B.

253
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,950
The 65th will take the fifth seat in Class C.

254
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,750
My grades were so poor last time.

255
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,330
Which class will I end up in?

256
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,350
Uncle Zhao.

257
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,770
Well, I'll be going now.

258
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,940
Uncle Zhao!

259
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,520
I heard

260
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,830
that you went to my son's shop yesterday.

261
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,030
Yes, he opened his business yesterday.

262
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,660
Wait, you didn't go?

263
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,380
I'm not used to the food there.

264
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,450
Hey. What else is good to eat besides oily bean curd and fish ball soup?

265
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,660
Go inside and look at the menu.

266
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,160
Okay, I'm in a very good mood today.

267
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,900
I want to eat more.

268
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,620
Okay.

269
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,780
Okay, Chemistry is finished.

270
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,140
1:45 a.m.

271
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,450
Great. He can go to bed so early.

272
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,840
What is he doing?

273
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,360
It's so loud.

274
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,020
Why are you walking around in the middle of the night?

275
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,000
Paying so much attention to me?

276
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,000
I did not.

277
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,650
When are you going to sleep?

278
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,110
How much do you have left to study?

279
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,050
One more question booklet.

280
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,730
Which subject?

281
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,120
Physics.

282
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,970
Is your door locked?

283
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,940
My door?

284
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,110
Why did he ask that?

285
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,510
You're really busy.

286
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,330
You're still up in the middle of the night.

287
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,270
It's so noisy.

288
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,670
Where are you stuck?

289
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,210
No.

290
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,320
No?

291
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,110
Then why are you still studying at nearly 2 a.m.?

292
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,560
I have to attend classes

293
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,110
and learn new material

294
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,360
while catching up on the progress.

295
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,150
I'm pretty fast, okay?

296
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,570
Then you just texted me

297
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,060
to ask when I would go to sleep.

298
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,060
Which question do you want to ask me?

299
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,140
No.

300
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,770
Then you want me to find the key points and the exam questions for you?

301
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,620
Please.

302
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,300
Can I mark up your question booklet?

303
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,970
Sure.

304
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,180
I'm going to tear the pages off anyway.

305
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,570
Tear off?

306
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,860
Yeah.

307
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,700
I'll cross off the questions

308
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,410
once I've done them twice

309
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,520
and there are no problems.

310
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,820
If all the questions on the page are crossed off,

311
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,080
I'll tear the page off.

312
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,120
So, you won't waste your time

313
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,380
when you review the questions next time.

314
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,330
Then, I'll mark up your booklet.

315
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,860
This's the key point.

316
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,440
Key point.

317
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,850
You don't need to waste time on this question.

318
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,980
Neither is this one.

319
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,300
Take a look at this one.

320
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,370
As for the rest, review them if you have time.

321
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,970
It's okay if you don't have time to review them.

322
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,240
Got it.

323
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,540
I got it as soon as you marked it.

324
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,080
The first six major questions

325
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,940
are the most comprehensive ones.

326
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,350
As long as I master them,

327
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,250
I won't be afraid of any variations of the questions that come up in the exam.

328
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,710
As for the following questions,

329
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,610
they're basically repeating some parts of the six major questions.

330
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,980
So, I don't need to waste time on them,

331
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,860
right?

332
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,490
Yes.

333
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,530
I have a question.

334
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,430
Go ahead.

335
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,790
Haven't you been beaten

336
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,870
for explaining questions like that?

337
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,550
Wait. Don't.

338
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,980
Don't take this one away.

339
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,550
Whether I can go to bed early tonight

340
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,580
depends on it.

341
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,300
Let's start.

342
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,910
Hand me the pen.

343
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,540
Let me check the math exercises you just did.

344
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,490
If you have any objections to the key points I've marked,
you can appeal. It's okay.

345
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,530
[Class H Grade 2]

346
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,520
Is it okay?

347
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,450
What is Tian doing? Why is he so slow?

348
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,790
Faster, Mute.

349
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,700
Walk faster! Don't you understand?

350
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,870
Faster!

351
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,320
Speak something we can understand, okay?

352
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,110
Darn it!

353
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,470
You've gotten my shoes all dirty.

354
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,680
Stupid beggar!

355
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,770
Get out of my way!

356
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,330
Uncle Mute!

357
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,020
Come on! Let's see what you've got.

358
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,190
Come on!

359
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,360
Beat him!

360
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,210
Alright, I'm sorry.

361
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,450
I apologize, okay?

362
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,080
If you want to insult someone, insult your own mother.

363
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,740
Leave others's moms out of it.

364
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Fine, I'll just insult my mom, okay?

365
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,890
Let's go to the health room.

366
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,460
What do you mean?

367
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,250
He's saying that he doesn't need to go to the health room.

368
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,220
He has antiseptic at home.

369
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,160
What brand of antiseptic is it?

370
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,450
Is it expired? Is it good?

371
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,410
Don't care about his words. Let's go.

372
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,700
Let's go. Go.

373
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,870
Let's go.

374
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,820
He is fussy.

375
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,070
Let's go.

376
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,710
Hey, be careful!

377
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,410
I got it.

378
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,330
Be careful!

379
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,500
Sheng, let me tell you.

380
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,330
My grandparents and Tian's grandmother

381
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,860
used to be teachers in Danying and lived here.

382
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,530
The elementary school in this area is famous.

383
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,010
So, I moved here around five or six years old

384
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,650
and stayed until I graduated from elementary school.

385
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,530
Tian moved here before I did,

386
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,120
at around three or four years old.

387
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,450
But I remember that he moved before graduating from school.

388
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,660
Yes, I moved.

389
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,530
Let Uncle Mute sit there.

390
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,710
He lives in the back.

391
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,040
Sit there.

392
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,270
This is Old Ding's house.

393
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,440
Mr. Zhao of Joy also lives nearby.

394
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,020
By the way, listen.

395
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,130
Old Ding, who lives here,

396
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,990
is known as the meanest old man in the Little White House area.

397
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,560
He's very hard to get along with.

398
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,780
He is so fierce that...

399
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,370
But Tian is close to him.

400
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,250
So, he always has lunch here.

401
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
I can't.

402
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,900
I just accidentally broke his roof while climbing a tree

403
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,320
when I was a kid.

404
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,110
He's still holding a grudge against me.

405
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,540
Is it really necessary?

406
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,140
So petty.

407
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,710
So,

408
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,770
you usually have lunch here?

409
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,440
Yes.

410
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,280
What's wrong with Mute?

411
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,680
Darn, you!

412
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,200
Handsome!

413
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,910
You haven't paid for my roof yet!

414
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:26,680
You still have the nerve to come to my house?

415
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,970
I'll kill you!

416
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,910
I love you too! I love you too!

417
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,220
Love, my foot!

418
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

419
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,890
Mute, what happened to your knee?

420
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,990
He fell and injured his knee at school.

421
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,200
And who are you?

422
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,330
Oh, I'm his classmate.

423
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,690
Hello, Grandpa Ding.

424
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,140
Who told you that my surname is Ding?

425
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,040
The one who just ran away told him.

426
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,750
I should have broken his legs just now.

427
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,860
Did you and Tian send Mute back?

428
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,160
Yes.

429
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,690
Have you eaten?

430
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,040
Why are you looking at him?

431
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,310
Don't you know whether you have eaten?

432
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,780
No.

433
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,010
All right, you rest here.

434
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,650
I'll heat up the food.

435
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,340
You pick up the broom later.

436
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,690
I have a question.

437
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,750
Why can't we understand what Uncle Mute is saying

438
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,950
while you can?

439
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,810
I'm half-guessing.

440
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,770
The only person who can communicate with him

441
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,980
is Mr. Zhao from Joy.

442
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,080
No wonder

443
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,570
Uncle Mute often goes to Joy.

444
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,510
He is just sitting there as the cashier,

445
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,590
counting inventory,

446
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,950
or doing recycling.

447
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,980
He's always busy with this and that at the store.

448
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,830
If there is only one person

449
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,900
who can communicate with you,

450
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,510
that person is more important than anyone else.

451
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,700
Just now,

452
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,080
Zhai Tao insulted my mom.

453
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,730
Thank you.

454
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,890
Go inside.

455
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,890
I'll go get the broom.

456
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,310
Be careful.

457
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,100
Come on.

458
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,950
You eat first.

459
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,280
There are more people here today. I'll make another dish.

460
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,450
You go ahead.

461
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,210
What's wrong?

462
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,110
Do you want to go to Joy to eat instead?

463
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,090
Never mind. Forget it.

464
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,780
He's old and his cooking isn't very refined.

465
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,240
I don't know if you'd like his cooking or not.

466
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,670
So, you went through all this trouble

467
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,310
because youâ€™re worried I wouldn't like the food he prepared?

468
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,540
I'm just thinking it would be a waste

469
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,700
to make food and not eat it.

470
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,110
You...

471
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,930
You really have an annoying way of speaking.

472
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,120
Then, go to Joy.

473
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,770
No.

474
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,560
I'm not picky about food.

475
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,540
Right, Uncle Mute?

476
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,130
I really admire the guy you brought along for dinner.

477
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,580
He's too picky about food.

478
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,430
He doesn't eat coriander,

479
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,930
carrots, or spinach.

480
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,940
He can take scallion or garlic to enhance the flavor of a dish,
but only if they're chopped.

481
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,050
-But he won't eat the dish if he can recognize them in it.
-He slandered me!

482
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,430
Who slandered you?

483
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,440
Come on, eat.

484
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,750
What's your name?

485
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,000
Wa...?

486
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,100
Wa...

487
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:12,960
Wang.

488
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,710
Both Sheng and Wang are fine.

489
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,770
You can call me whichever you prefer.

490
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,550
Wang,

491
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,360
do you have enough rice?

492
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:21,490
Yes!

493
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,300
You're so tall and strong.

494
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,290
I'll get you another bowl of rice.

495
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,920
Thank you.

496
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,010
Why does Gao Tianyang call him Old Ding?

497
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,350
He really looks like it.

498
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,130
What's so funny

499
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,670
that you are laughing like that?

500
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,580
That funny?

501
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,360
There's only half a bowl of rice left.

502
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,960
Don't just pick out the meat from the shredded pork and green peppers.

503
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,760
Green peppers are both nutritious and delicious.

504
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,200
Shredded pork with green peppers. He...

505
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
I... eat green peppers.

506
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,290
Eat green peppers.

507
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,150
Do you eat green peppers?

508
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,250
It's my favorite.

509
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,810
Eat more.

510
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,130
It's good.

511
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,050
[Student Affairs]

512
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,390
Is he going to praise us?

513
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,520
Excuse us,

514
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,260
we're here to get the exercise books.

515
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,330
They're on the table.

516
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,540
Take them and leave.

517
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,210
Sheng Wang,

518
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,580
you did pretty well on this exam, didn't you?

519
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,020
Should I praise you?

520
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,670
Then,

521
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,220
I'll praise you for fighting. How about that?

522
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,230
You don't take exams seriously,

523
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,630
but you think about fighting every day.

524
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,010
Dean,

525
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,740
I was there that day.

526
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,200
You forgot to call me here with them.

527
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,300
Did you fight?

528
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,390
I did.

529
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,490
You did, as if.

530
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,550
So many cameras around here.

531
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,390
You think they're all toys?

532
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,200
Listen. Don't try to join in for fun.

533
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,860
Otherwise, I'll punish you along with them.

534
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,580
No one could stop me.

535
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,240
I struck...

536
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,400
Dean,

537
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,280
Gao Tianyang hit his head,

538
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,280
so he is talking nonsense.

539
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,010
I'll take him back to the classroom to rest first.

540
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,530
What are you doing?

541
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,660
Don't keep talking back.

542
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,020
The more you talk back, the angrier my dad gets.

543
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,820
It's bad for Tian and the others.

544
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,830
Dean, it was the two of them who beat me up.

545
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,750
I...

546
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,489
Why did you call me here?

547
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,780
You still don't know why you're here?

548
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,730
Didn't I just tell you?

549
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,340
We have cameras out there.

550
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,340
Also,

551
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,560
the onlookers have eyes and ears.

552
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,750
Do you think I called you here to hear your excuses?

553
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,570
Also, let me ask you.

554
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,650
Who called the mute a stupid beggar?

555
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:44,520
Also,

556
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,620
who kicked him down the stairs?

557
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,440
I...

558
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,620
Yes, it's you.

559
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,210
And you two.

560
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,090
I know

561
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,620
your original intentions

562
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,360
may not be necessarily bad.

563
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,980
But there are countless ways

564
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,410
to deal with things.

565
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,050
Do you have to choose to fight?

566
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,020
Jiang Tian,

567
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,030
you think you are so cool, right?

568
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,520
You must have felt awesome

569
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,070
fighting in front of your classmates, right?

570
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,360
Sheng Wang.

571
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,520
You threw your bag so far away.

572
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,870
Do you think you're tough?

573
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,870
Fine.

574
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,610
You three

575
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,170
all like to show off in front of others, right?

576
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,810
Well,

577
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,140
the path on the west side of the school

578
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,870
is covered with fallen leaves.

579
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,890
Isn't that a perfect stage for you?

580
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,220
Every day after school,

581
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,490
go sweep that path!

582
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,650
You won't know how long life can be

583
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,990
if I don't teach you a lesson sometimes.

584
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,830
Thank you, Dean.

585
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,150
How can we sweep up so many leaves?

586
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,650
And they keep falling!

587
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,520
Don't move!

588
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,750
Sometimes you just need to focus on the present.

589
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,740
Didn't you ask me

590
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,590
what I actually wanted to say afterward that day?

591
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,790
I wanted to say

592
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,500
that we should just live our separate lives.

593
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,540
We didn't cross paths before,

594
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,640
so why should we get involved in each other's lives now?

595
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,110
But later,

596
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,560
you had to go straight on the way back,

597
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,110
and you forced me to go straight.

598
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,280
As I walked,

599
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,620
I looked back...

600
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,430
looking at the road I had just walked.

601
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,910
I suddenly felt

602
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,590
that the past didn't seem so important anymore.

603
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,410
I didn't have what we have now, so the past was so important.

604
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,700
But I have it now;

605
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,200
the past doesn't matter anymore.

606
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,710
So, I want to live in the present.

607
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,640
If only we could stay at this moment forever.

608
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,660
Why stay at this moment forever?

609
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,410
There's a brighter future waiting for us.

610
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,560
Sheng Wang! Jiang Tian.

611
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,200
Alright, stop sweeping.

612
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,310
Dean Xu,

613
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,150
it would be best if you told them.

614
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,670
In the future,

615
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,310
your punishment will be

616
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,530
to go to Ms. Yang Jing every day after school.

617
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,360
I asked Dean Xu for you two.

618
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,650
The English competition is next week.

619
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,570
Two of the most assured winners at the school

620
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,120
are being punished by sweeping leaves here

621
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,370
instead of going back to study.

622
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,450
Dean Xu, do you think

623
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,790
it's a good idea?

624
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,390
Right.

625
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,720
This matter

626
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,840
is related to our school's honor,

627
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,490
academic performance,

628
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,310
and the number of students enrolled annually.

629
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,180
So, the principal takes it very seriously.

630
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,680
Then, I decided to give you both a chance

631
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,970
to redeem yourselves.

632
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,000
Stop sweeping.

633
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,690
Then, there are two conditions.

634
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,460
First,

635
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,630
you must win the English competition.

636
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,560
The second is that you must improve

637
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,510
by more than 50 places in this weekly exam.

638
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,860
You don't have to. I mean Sheng Wang.

639
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,370
You're at the top. There's no higher ranking you can go to.

640
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,600
Dean Xu,

641
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:48,160
you know it. The closer you are to the top of the rankings,

642
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,450
the more difficult it becomes to improve.

643
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,640
And in such a short time.

644
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,800
Of course, I know.

645
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,400
How else can you call it a punishment?

646
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,530
You either meet these two conditions,

647
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,820
or

648
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,230
you can keep sweeping here.

649
00:40:59,250 --> 00:40:59,900
No thanks, Dean.

650
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,590
Also,

651
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,540
you can stop thinking of

652
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,300
being the Excellent Model Student in your class.

653
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,530
Move up 50 places.

654
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,630
Move up 50 places in the ranking of the whole grade.

655
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,870
Why should I bear the consequences

656
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,530
of a mistake made by both of us?

657
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,510
No way.

658
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,630
I have to ask him to help me mark the exam questions and key points.

659
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,980
It's not really taking advantage of him.

660
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,660
What?

661
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,770
The air conditioner in my room is broken,

662
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,530
so I want to come to your room to enjoy the cool air.

663
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,010
Really.

664
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,350
Go check it out if you don't believe me.

665
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,480
It's really broken.

666
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,880
Don't go. Don't go.

667
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,140
If you really go,

668
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,890
I'll jump off the building.

669
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,700
It's so much more comfortable in an air-conditioned room.

670
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,830
Just busy with your thing. Don't mind me.

671
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,110
You don't mind if I sit on your bed?

672
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,720
Yes, I do.

673
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,440
Oh.

674
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,250
Sit.

675
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,920
It's okay. I can stand.

676
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,330
Sit down, or go back to your room.

677
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,700
Hurry up and do your homework.
