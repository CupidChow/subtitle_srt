1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,360
In Chinese,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,210
the same sentiment

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,570
can be interpreted differently by different people.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,160
Take Su Shi's "Jiang Cheng Zi" as an example:

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,530
"The distant lonely grave a thousand miles away; there is no place to express the sorrow and desolation in my heart.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,470
Even if we were to meet again, you wouldn't recognize me.

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,530
I am now covered in dust, and my temples are like frost."

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,830
This conveys the sorrow that, after enduring the vicissitudes of time,

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,030
when they meet again,

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,410
they have already been separated by death.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,620
Everyone,

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,740
can you understand?

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,480
It's okay.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,370
"The reuniting of a broken mirror."

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,630
You should have heard this idiom, right?

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,120
Yes.

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,710
Okay.

18
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,850
Do you know its origin and meaning?

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,350
Jiang Tian.

20
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,250
Come on, let me test you.

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,560
This is the true story of Princess Lechang of the Southern Dynasties.

22
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,430
She was forced to part from her husband.

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,310
Before they separated, they broke a mirror

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,539
and each took half.

25
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,400
Many years later,

26
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,590
they reunited because of the mirror

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,789
and spent the rest of their lives together.

28
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,080
However, behind this beautiful story

29
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,770
lies a deeper meaning.

30
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,620
You're home.

31
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,580
Welcome home.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,690
During the decades they could not see each other,

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,060
they could only look at the mirror

34
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,330
and long for the beautiful image of each other.

35
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,670
After their reunion,

36
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,440
in the mirror,

37
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:23,060
I could no longer see your enchanting face like a fairy from before,

38
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,820
only the desolate moonlight

39
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,150
reflected by the passage of time.

[Episode 11, Kissing: It was Just Four Lips Touching Each Other]

42
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,240
Last night,

43
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,120
I slept like this?

44
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,990
How is that possible? I'm not dead.

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
Oh, right.

46
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,220
Mr. Sun...

47
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,450
Damn!

48
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,000
Who put the ball here?

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,930
What's going on?

50
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,760
Hey.

51
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,090
It wasn't me.

52
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,430
What are you doing?

53
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,650
There are so many beds here.

54
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,380
Why are you sleeping together?

55
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,940
Well...

56
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,440
Didn't you guys just go home yesterday?

57
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,620
Why did you come back today?

58
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,890
The practice exam is coming up, right?

59
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,390
So, Shi and I thought

60
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,980
we'd review together

61
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,720
while the two top students are in the dorm, right?

62
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,130
No.

63
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,790
That's not the point now.

64
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,750
The point now is...

65
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,710
The point is that a thief came in last night, you know?

66
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,940
A thief?

67
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,300
Oh, right.

68
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,040
When I got back just now, I heard people from Room 308 talking.

69
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,260
The whole floor was burglarized.

70
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,780
And I think I even saw someone.

71
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,320
Someone?

72
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,700
Yeah, just a blurry figure.

73
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,660
I'm not sure if it was a person or a ghost.

74
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,280
A ghost?

75
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,080
Come on, Gao.

76
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,460
Did they catch it?

77
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,800
Was it a thief or a ghost?

78
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,610
How could it be caught so quickly?

79
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,490
The police were only called last night.

80
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,460
But the dormitory supervisor told us

81
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,330
to be extra cautious these days and,

82
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,490
if possible, to sleep in the same room or share beds

83
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,520
to look out for each other.

84
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,800
Shi,

85
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,860
let's share a bed.

86
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,550
Stop joking.

87
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,040
This is serious. There's a ghost.

88
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,050
No!

89
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,290
I'm really scared.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm more scared of you.

91
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,210
I'll kneel. I'm begging you.

92
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:03,870
Gao Tianyang.

93
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,220
Just agree to him.

94
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,180
Have you heard?

95
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,920
There was a thief in the boys' dorm last night.

96
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,000
Really?

97
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,250
That's not true.

98
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
I heard that in the middle of the night,

99
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,220
a shadow suddenly appeared.

100
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,620
The dormitory supervisor was afraid that people would panic,

101
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,460
so he said there was a thief.

102
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,790
No wonder I often hear someone crying in the middle of the night.

103
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,830
Then let's sleep together.

104
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,030
Okay, let's sleep together.

105
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,050
I'm scared.

106
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,280
I don't want to be the last one!

107
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,940
Get up.

108
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,760
It's morning.

109
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,950
Darn it.

110
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,750
I didn't sleep all night because of your snoring.

111
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,690
Come on.

112
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,909
They haven't caught the thief yet.

113
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,920
I'll sleep on the upper bunk when they do,

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,710
right?

115
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,090
Morning.

116
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,120
Morning.

117
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,110
Morning.

118
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,560
I didn't expect that sharing beds would become a trend.

119
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,490
How dare you say that?

120
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,810
Aren't you two the same?

121
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,170
I'm not.

122
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,610
I'm going back soon.

123
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,680
The doctor said my foot is healed,

124
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,960
so I can go back to the upper bunk to sleep.

125
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,740
It stinks.

126
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,580
I just changed it yesterday.

127
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,380
Alright then.

128
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,980
I'm going to the bathroom.

129
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,430
Or are you afraid

130
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,110
and want me to stay with you?

131
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,810
Whatever.

132
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,960
Whatever?

133
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:17,960
So casual?

134
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,930
I'm not.

135
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,250
I'll go up now.

136
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,070
I'm going back.

137
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,210
Hello, long time no see.

138
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,990
Sheng Wang.

139
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,880
Yes?

140
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,870
What's wrong with you?

141
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,770
Tian,

142
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,360
you've become naughty.

143
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,480
Really?

144
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,290
You don't think so?

145
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,120
Darn it!

146
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,050
Why so sudden?

147
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,700
Shi Yu, are you done?

148
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,860
Cut it and let me use the bathroom first.

149
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,040
Damn.

150
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,710
Attention, everyone.

151
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,840
Lastly, I have a few things to tell you.

152
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,000
First, I'm sure you've heard that this time,

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,400
the practice exam will follow the new class division system.

154
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,450
In the past,

155
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,040
only the bottom three students in the exam would leave this class.

156
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,130
But this time,

157
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,490
it won't be that easy.

158
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,340
So, Jing,

159
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,490
what's the new rule?

160
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,020
The new class division rule is that

161
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,020
your class will keep 30 students.

162
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,850
If you rank in the top 30,

163
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,220
you can stay in Class A.

164
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,740
Those ranked after 30 will be transferred to other classes.

165
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,470
Quiet.

166
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,590
Don't get too excited.

167
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,540
Yeah.

168
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,980
We're so excited that we're almost dying.

169
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,220
Xu Tianshu.

170
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,050
Yes! Jing.

171
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,420
At least you can stay alive until I finish talking, right?

172
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,510
No problem, Jing.

173
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,680
If you don't want to fail this time

174
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,160
and want to stay in Class A,

175
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,130
the upcoming period is crucial.

176
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,290
Students in the front row,

177
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,780
come up and get today's English exam papers.

178
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,130
From today on,

179
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,840
there will be an extra exam paper every day.

180
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,790
Damn. I'm doomed.

181
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,450
I used to be the lucky fourth-to-last.

182
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,870
Now I'm straight into the elimination zone.

183
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,920
Oh, don't say that.

184
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,160
I'm in the elimination zone too.

185
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,040
You're not in the elimination zone.

186
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,220
You're just passing by, okay?

187
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,030
Tell me,

188
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,380
since the first day you've been here,

189
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,930
is there even one exam you didn't score incredibly high in?

190
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,080
I haven't taken an exam for so long because of my foot injury.

191
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,140
I'm not in the zone.

192
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,660
I'm not just passing by.

193
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,270
It's okay.

194
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,150
If you transfer to another class,

195
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,410
I'll keep you company.

196
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,110
Sure.

197
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,630
I'm just kidding.

198
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,760
I'll find someone to keep you company.

199
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,020
There's another announcement to make.

200
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,480
As you all know, last time,

201
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,710
Li Yu, Qi Jiahao, Sheng Wang, and Jiang Tian from our class

202
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,970
represented the school in the citywide English competition.

203
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,450
The results are now out.

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,330
Did you guys not do well?

205
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,330
I don't know.

206
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,590
You and Tian are probably the most likely to win.

207
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,620
-Here are two certificates.
-Didn't Jing tell you anything?

208
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,610
-One is the second prize and the other is the first prize.
-She did.

209
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,400
We turned in our papers early.

210
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,790
-Take a guess,
-She said...

211
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,010
which student from our class won the second prize.

212
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,220
she would come after us later.

213
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,570
And which one won the first prize?

214
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,450
Our results were really good this time.

215
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,990
Let's see who won the second prize and who won the first between the two of you.

216
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,170
First, let's congratulate our little English teacher,

217
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,270
Qi Jiahao.

218
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,650
He won the second prize this time.

219
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,660
He performed as expected.

220
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,450
Not bad. Let's give him some encouragement.

221
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,310
What's going on?

222
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,400
One of you didn't win an award?

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,320
Next, we have

224
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,460
our class monitor,

225
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,880
Li Yu,

226
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,130
who really surprised me this time.

227
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,260
Congratulations.

228
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,370
It shows that

229
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,490
as long as you performed as expected,

230
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,950
-Neither of you won an award?
-you could achieve good results.

231
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,080
But we had four students participating in the competition.

232
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,990
What about Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian?

233
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,520
I reminded you

234
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,230
thousands of times

235
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,800
not to turn in your papers early.

236
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,560
Well,

237
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,170
don't get too complacent,

238
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,140
or problems might arise.

239
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,870
So why didn't Jiang Tian and Sheng Wang win any awards this time?

240
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,190
Actually,

241
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,070
they advanced to the next round of the competition.

242
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,000
That's right.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,970
They made it

244
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,780
into the last 20 spots for the training camp.

245
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,100
After the training,

246
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,540
they will participate in the finals.

247
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,640
If they place in the finals,

248
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,690
they will receive awards

249
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,350
for the entire Taiwan region.

250
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,770
Even if they don't place,

251
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,040
they will still receive an Excellence Award.

252
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,020
Jiang Tian ranked 11th

253
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,150
and Sheng Wang ranked 5th.

254
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,180
They were only

255
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,870
2 points apart.

256
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,810
The students who placed between them

257
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,460
were from the First School.

258
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,190
But it's okay.

259
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,240
Each of them

260
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,170
has already

261
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,100
secured a spot

262
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
for early admission to university.

263
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,920
Fifth place in Taiwan.

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,800
No.5!

265
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,670
Five, eleven. Eleven and five.

266
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,520
Hey, Jing.

267
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,200
Didn't you say you would come after Jiang Tian and me?

268
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,600
Come after?

269
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,840
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

270
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,330
Sheng, you're so amazing.

271
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,770
What gods do you worship? Tell me.

272
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,160
And tell me what you like to eat.

273
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,220
I want to try it too.

274
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,460
Okay, everyone,

275
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,500
you can start your self-study now.

276
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,320
Everyone!

277
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,950
One, two, three.

278
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,880
Sheng. Tian.

279
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,140
Five, eleven.

280
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,280
Awesome!

281
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,300
[Class A Grade 2]

282
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,410
Class is over.

283
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,250
Students on duty, please help me put away the rackets.

284
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,160
Class is over!

285
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,140
Hurry up and get changed. We're going to head out.

286
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,280
What's wrong?

287
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,460
Oh, nothing.

288
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,870
What are you doing?

289
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,540
Let's go.

290
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,620
Get changed.

291
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,220
Okay.

292
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,230
Hey.

293
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,360
Do you remember?

294
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,360
We did this at the start of the school year as well.

295
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,080
We were also going to the cafe.

296
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,380
But how do you pronounce the name of that place?

297
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,370
I still don't know.

298
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,390
Alors.

299
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,190
It's French.

300
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,160
French?

301
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,680
It means "so."

302
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,540
I think what they are trying to express

303
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,000
is to cherish the present.

304
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,490
Cherish the present.

305
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,130
And then,

306
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
you mentioned living at school.

307
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,950
And you actually moved into the school.

308
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,850
So did you.

309
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,800
Where is Jiang Tian?

310
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,470
Tian!

311
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,970
He disappeared just now.

312
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,620
I didn't see him after we left school.

313
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,950
I didn't see him either.

314
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,760
It's okay. He's not a kid.

315
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,200
And he's familiar with Xi and Lin.

316
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,490
He'll find his way there on his own.

317
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,240
Let's go.

318
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,300
I need to go to the bathroom.

319
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,190
Sheng,

320
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,790
you're not trying to escape because you're supposed to treat us, are you?

321
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,580
What are you talking about?

322
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,840
Do you think Sheng is that kind of person?

323
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:25,740
Sheng!

324
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,700
Where is he?

325
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,540
How is that possible?

326
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,920
Sheng, stop hiding. Come out.

327
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,960
How is that possible?

328
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,920
It's okay, just come out.

329
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,500
Just come out.

330
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,360
How about you go down and find him?

331
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,770
You go.

332
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,420
What if I can't get back up later?

333
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,170
The view here is really nice, though.

334
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:42,570
Right.

335
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,070
Did you bring your camera?

336
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,850
Wait a minute.

337
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,280
Come on, let's take a photo secretly while Sheng is not here.

338
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,090
It's just like last time.

339
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,820
Okay. One, two, three.

340
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,200
Excuse me.

341
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,849
Excuse me, have you seen Jiang Tian?

342
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,180
Oh, thank you.

343
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,790
Hey, have you seen Jiang Tian?

344
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,390
No.

345
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,310
Oh, thank you.

346
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,780
Hey, have you seen Jiang Tian?

347
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,930
I just saw him

348
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,270
in the gym, I think.

349
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,210
Gym?

350
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,910
Yes.

351
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:26,990
Oh, thank you.

352
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,920
You're welcome.

353
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,410
Jiang Tian.

354
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,650
What are you looking for?

355
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,460
Something.

356
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,570
Don't forget we're having dinner with Xi.

357
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,500
What are you looking for? Let me help you.

358
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,700
Why should I tell you?

359
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,400
I...

360
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,710
I thought we were friends.

361
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,580
No need.

362
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,470
It's dirty.

363
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,440
What are you looking for?

364
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,190
No need.

365
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,000
Just tell me what you're looking for.

366
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,010
I can help you.

367
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,070
It's okay.

368
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,520
Ticket wallet.

369
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,410
You're amazing.

370
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,720
What gods do you worship? Tell me.

371
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,250
And tell me what you like to eat.

372
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,310
I want to try it too.

373
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,650
Class is over!

374
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,790
Students on duty, please help me put away the rackets.

375
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,650
What's wrong?

376
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,140
Nothing.

377
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,440
So,

378
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,410
you're doing it for me.

379
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,360
Why?

380
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,960
I think there must be something important inside.

381
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,220
I guess it's an amulet, right?

382
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,870
But I find it ridiculous

383
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,790
to put your hopes in something

384
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,550
you don't even know what it is.

385
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,320
But then I thought,

386
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,050
without it,

387
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,260
what if you fall outside the top 30?

388
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,680
Actually,

389
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,720
it's not an amulet.

390
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,690
Found it!

391
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,360
Is this it?

392
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,560
Check if it's still there.

393
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,160
I forgot.

394
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,290
You are picky and high-maintenance.

395
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,950
You probably wouldn't want it

396
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,980
since it was found here, right?

397
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,770
Give it to me.

398
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,130
It's dirty.

399
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
It's still there.

400
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,210
Thank you.

401
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,760
Hey, there are people inside here!

402
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,070
The security staff must not have noticed that there were people inside,

403
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,010
so they locked it.

404
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,210
What should we do now?

405
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,240
Let me see if there are any tools to open it.

406
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,300
Why not just call someone?

407
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,260
There's no signal.

408
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,440
No wonder you didn't reply to my message earlier.

409
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,450
Didn't Sheng just go to the bathroom?

410
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,120
It's taking way too long.

411
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,170
Yes.

412
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,120
He didn't really run away, did he?

413
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,840
Hey.

414
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm just kidding. Why are you angry?

415
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,410
You just said he wouldn't do that.

416
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,470
What are you doing?

417
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,150
We're waiting for Sheng.

418
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,990
Sheng Wang won't come.

419
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,100
How did you know?

420
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,950
Because I just saw him heading towards the classroom,

421
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,400
He must be going to get ready for evening study.

422
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,280
I'm leaving now.

423
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,890
Bye.

424
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,750
-How is that possible?
-Evening study?

425
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,380
Right. Didn't we agree to go to the cafe?

426
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,190
Come on.

427
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,310
The thing is, Sheng is missing now,

428
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,960
and we don't know if Tian will be there.

429
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,290
Should we keep waiting?

430
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,510
Or should I call Sheng first?

431
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,560
Okay.

432
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,610
It went to the voicemail.

433
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,430
Why don't you call Xi first and let him know?

434
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,250
Okay.

435
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,910
Isn't Jenny coming today?

436
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,860
She said that if she comes, the students won't dare to have fun.

437
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,860
Students have always been like that

438
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,930
when they see their teachers—like mice seeing a cat.

439
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,400
So, why are we here?

440
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,220
Do you think we look like teachers?

441
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,470
You don't.

442
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,510
I'm glad I don't.

443
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,890
It'd be worse if I did.

444
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,680
Like Big Mouth Xu?

445
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,070
No thanks.

446
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,870
Hello?

447
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,500
What?

448
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,380
They're not here yet.

449
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,360
Okay, I got it.

450
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,380
I'll let you know as soon as I get any news.

451
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:03,970
What's wrong?

452
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,480
Jiang Tian and Sheng Wang are missing.

453
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,140
The students can't find them.

454
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,990
I'll go and help find them.

455
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,970
I'll go with you.

456
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,710
What should we do?

457
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,040
Where is there a signal?

458
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,390
It's gone again.

459
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,030
Don't move.

460
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,150
What's wrong?

461
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,440
Jiang... Jiang Tian,

462
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,750
what are you doing?

463
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,050
A big cockroach is behind you.

464
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,000
I've got it pinned down.

465
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,370
Slowly come this way.

466
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,220
Sheng...

467
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,200
Did you catch it?

468
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:09,960
Yes.

469
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,550
Sheng Wang. Jiang Tian.

470
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,290
What happened?

471
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,170
We lost something.

472
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,670
When we were looking for it just now,

473
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,300
it seems the security staff accidentally locked the door.

474
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,630
Luckily, your classmates were proactive enough

475
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,400
to find you.

476
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,230
Otherwise, you two

477
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,710
would have had to spend the night here.

478
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,870
I'm glad you're fine.

479
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:42,890
Hey, Lin.

480
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,360
Yes?

481
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,190
Send a text to let everyone know we found them.

482
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,580
I bet everyone must be starving.

483
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,620
I'm starving.

484
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,700
Let's go and eat first.

485
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,320
Let's go.

486
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,580
Hey, did you guys order in advance?

487
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,930
It's all ready.

488
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,980
We're waiting for you two.

489
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,850
It was all my fault.

490
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,590
Let's go.

491
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,990
Come on, let's drink tea instead of wine

492
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,410
to celebrate Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian making it to the finals of the English competition.

493
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,080
Cheers!

494
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,760
Cheers!

495
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,500
Next time, if anyone gets a good ranking,

496
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,460
the treat will be on me.

497
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,390
Okay!

498
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,810
Sheng, go! Tian, go!

499
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,970
Here! Go, go, go!

500
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,190
Go! Go! Go!

501
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,370
Finish it.

502
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,630
-What?
-Cheers.

503
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,150
Wow, it looks delicious.

504
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,160
Drink up. Cheers.

505
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,640
I'll go get some more food.

506
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,520
Where is Lin going?

507
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,330
He's afraid there won't be enough food,

508
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,730
so he's going to get more.

509
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,540
Seriously?

510
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,860
We're not gluttons.

511
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,320
And there are girls here.

512
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,710
They're always talking about dieting.

513
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,510
One minute they're fasting,

514
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,730
the next they're on some extreme diet.

515
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,040
They won't eat too much.

516
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,960
Who are you talking about?

517
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,060
You hit too hard.

518
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,860
So what?

519
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,560
What?

520
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,550
Were you just trying to hit a girl?

521
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,660
Were you just trying to hit the class monitor?

522
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,610
Yes.

523
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,660
You don't need to fast or go on some extreme diet.

524
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,860
You eat more than all the boys, alright?

525
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,080
Big eater!

526
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,600
Stupid.

527
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,640
He wants to die.

528
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,090
Quite popular.

529
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,070
Me?

530
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,830
What do you mean?

531
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,690
A girl chasing someone all around

532
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,520
just because he said she eats more than the boys in front of you.

533
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,850
Why do you think that is?

534
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,100
Troublemaker.

535
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,310
What does that have to do with me?

536
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,770
Gosh!

537
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,100
Let's call a truce.

538
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:09,830
I'm starving.

539
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,350
Shall we eat something first?

540
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,740
Watch your mouth.

541
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,410
If you're hungry, just eat and drink as much as you can.

542
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,000
Today, Sheng Wang is treating.

543
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,930
Right, I'm treating. Enjoy.

544
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,110
Thank you, Sheng.

545
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,120
Gao,

546
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,340
being chased by Pepper is better than being chased by Big Mouth Xu, right?

547
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:25,970
Exactly.

548
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,820
I guess so.

549
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:29,970
Sorry, Little Mouth,

550
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,750
for insulting your dad.

551
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,840
Haha.

552
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,840
It's okay.

553
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,250
Anyway, when I'm out here playing,

554
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,380
I always cut off ties with my dad first.

555
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,640
Plus, I heard last time

556
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,580
he caught a guy who went online secretly

557
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,790
When they took him to the Student Affairs,

558
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,170
he was wearing a black plastic bag on his head.

559
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,280
That's not the scariest part.

560
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,500
Last time, when I went to the office to help a teacher grade exam papers,

561
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,000
I heard that someone next door got caught dating.

562
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,130
Then his dad called both families to arrange a marriage.

563
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,410
They were so scared they broke up on the spot.

564
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,310
A marriage?

565
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,120
Yes.

566
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,100
That's crazy.

567
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,950
Yes.

568
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,900
From now on, he is not my dad.

569
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,370
Don't call me Little Mouth Xu anymore.

570
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,570
Call me...

571
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,790
Xu Xiaocai.

572
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,000
Xu Xiaocai!

573
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,430
Pepper.

574
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,010
Do you want to eat this?

575
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,090
Here.

576
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,080
Thank you.

577
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,890
Hey, Xi.

578
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,160
Why are you laughing so mischievously?

579
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,650
Did you do anything bad in high school?

580
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,560
What?

581
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,070
For example,

582
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,340
secretly dating!

583
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,860
Did you?

584
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,980
I'll share this

585
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,270
from an objective and rational perspective.

586
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,040
Are you just trying to lecture now?

587
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,810
So boring.

588
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,280
Yes.

589
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,460
Here comes the chicken soup for the soul.

590
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,960
You're taking it too seriously.

591
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,900
Bummer.

592
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,750
What are you doing?

593
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,500
Alright.

594
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,600
I admit it.

595
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,200
When I was in school,

596
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,700
I secretly dated.

597
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,020
See?

598
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,560
But,

599
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,330
it was a secret crush.

600
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,270
Come on.

601
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,530
A secret crush. And then?

602
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,160
Yes. And then?

603
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,810
Yes.

604
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,490
And this secret crush affected my grades so badly

605
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,440
that it nearly gave my homeroom teacher a heart attack.

606
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,850
So you were dating when you were in school?

607
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,660
I didn't know it until now.

608
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,410
Really?

609
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,350
Yeah. I heard you received love letters

610
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,950
every day during college.

611
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,240
Speaking of which,

612
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,030
I think I heard from my dad that

613
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,280
Xi was already a campus heartthrob when he was at Danying.

614
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,510
Campus heartthrob?

615
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,000
Didn't you cut ties with your dad?

616
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yes. Didn't you say you are Xiaocai?

617
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,550
I got it!

618
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,850
I got it!

619
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,870
Song Sirui didn't change his underwear this morning.

620
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,920
Get out!

621
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,080
Let's play Truth or Dare.

622
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,330
Okay!

623
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,960
Mr. Zhao,

624
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,660
how many girlfriends have you had?

625
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,770
How many? How many?

626
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,540
50? 40?

627
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,760
It's a secret.

628
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,720
Come on!

629
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,230
Tell us.

630
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,370
Xi.

631
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,740
Let me help you, Xi.

632
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,770
It's a secret?

633
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,270
Sirui, why didn't you change your underwear?

634
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,990
Please don't be so disgusting.

635
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,360
[Cafe]

636
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,020
I did.

637
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,080
I was just saying that randomly.

638
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,010
But I caught you.

639
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,980
That Xi.

640
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,020
He didn't let me pay the bill.

641
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,340
But on the other hand,

642
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,020
it's really nice to have a brother like him.

643
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,330
So, by that logic,

644
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,610
you are my brother too.

645
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,040
What's wrong?

646
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,120
Are you suddenly in the mood for writing a lyric essay?

647
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,220
Not really.

648
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,330
It's just that every time I see the moon,

649
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,320
this melody pops into my head.

650
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,540
Maybe it's because

651
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,230
my mom really loved the moon

652
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,550
and Teresa Teng.

653
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,750
People have their ups and downs,

654
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,360
and the moon has its phases and changes.

655
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,700
It seems like everything related to the moon is sad

656
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,050
and full of regrets.

657
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,140
The moon shines on Earth every day,

658
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,190
but only half of it is visible.

659
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,110
Can a half

660
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,860
be considered a form of eternity?

661
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,960
I don't agree with you.

662
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,950
I think the moon

663
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,010
often represents light and hope.

664
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,240
So even if it's only half,

665
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,730
or even just a moment,

666
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,570
as long as it stays in your mind,

667
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,120
it's eternal.

668
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,490
And you know what?

669
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,770
My mom really loved the moon.

670
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,390
When I was a kid, she often took me to read books about the moon.

671
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,330
I've forgotten the author,

672
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,410
but I think the book was called The Moon and Sixpence.

673
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,160
After reading it, she asked me and my dad

674
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,680
whether we would choose to look at the moon

675
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,430
or look down at the sixpence.

676
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,160
My dad said

677
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
he thought the moon was too far away,

678
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,910
so he'd choose to look at the sixpence in front of him.

679
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,090
But later, my mom secretly told me

680
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,860
she hoped I would choose

681
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,210
to look at the moon for her.

682
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,670
At that time, I didn't really understand what she meant.

683
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,410
If it were you,

684
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,940
would you choose the moon

685
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,430
or the sixpence?

686
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,610
Do you think thinking about this at our age is too...

687
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,080
What does that poem say?

688
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,820
To force oneself to express sorrow just to write new poetry?

689
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,260
Yes.

690
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,460
Why do you think about these things?

691
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,190
But,

692
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,220
I would choose the moon.

693
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,660
Here's this!

694
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,190
I haven't played it in a long time.

695
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,000
Your foot has just recovered, and you're being naughty again.

696
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,780
Are you okay?

697
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,380
It might have become a habitual sprain.

698
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,610
Go sit over there.

699
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,780
Over there.

700
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,600
Where?

701
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,960
Stay here.

702
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,360
I'll just take the late-night snacks to Old Ding.

703
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,420
-I'm fine. I'll just rest a bit.
-Sit.

704
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,199
And keep looking at your moon.

705
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,150
Wait for me to come back.

706
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
With a jug of wine among the flowers,

707
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,280
I'm drinking alone, with no one to share it with.

708
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,420
I raise my cup to invite the moon to join me,

709
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,550
and now there are three of us—the moon, my shadow, and me.

710
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,420
You majored in Western history.

711
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,230
Why are you reciting a Tang poem?

712
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,710
I could also recite a Shakespearean poem

713
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,430
about the moon for you.

714
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,920
But forget it.

715
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,660
I'd rather not play the lute to a cow

716
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,490
and spoil tonight's moonlight.

717
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,010
So to you,

718
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,750
am I just a cow?

719
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,380
Yeah.

720
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,140
You know yourself well.

721
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,320
Right.

722
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,990
You're more interesting and talented.

723
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,340
No wonder Yang Jing likes you.

724
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,440
Do you like Yang Jing?

725
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,840
Why do you think I like Yang Jing?

726
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,540
Because you always talk about Yang Jing.

727
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,600
That's because...

728
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,640
Because?

729
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,450
Because what?

730
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,910
She wants to gauge your feelings

731
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
and see if you're interested in her.

732
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,390
So, do you like Yang Jing?

733
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
Give me an answer.

734
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,610
But...

735
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,770
But that was not a big deal.

736
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,570
Not a big deal?

737
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,420
Yes.

738
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,610
It was just four lips touching each other.

739
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,450
It was just four lips touching each other?

740
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,650
Wang.

741
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,730
Wang.

742
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,970
A young heart's flutter is like a midsummer night's wasteland—

743
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,790
it's endless

744
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,190
and impervious to fire.

745
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:58,970
As the wind blows,

746
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,260
the wild grass

747
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,490
merges with the sky.

748
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:49,300
[Jiang Tian's Very Moment]

749
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,390
Dad.

750
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:29,890
Tian!

751
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,030
Tian!

752
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,920
Tian.

753
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,220
I...

754
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,050
Don't come over.

755
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,670
Tian, I...

756
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,140
Tian!
