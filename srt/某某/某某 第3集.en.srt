You gave me money after kissing me?

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,480
You treat me...

18
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,289
as that kind of person?

19

Even so,

What water?

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,390
You bought me a bottle of water in the store this afternoon.

24

I'm paying you back.

25

The money for just a bottle of water?

26
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,320
There's no need.

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,380
Right.

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,700

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,990

In recent years, English has increasingly emphasized speaking skills.

The first is "It's up to you."

00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,520
The second is "It's down to you."

Excellent. Please sit down.

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,640
Your breath disturbs me.

177
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,840
I won.

178
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,470
[I won.]

179
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,050
You...

180
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,210
Sheng Wang.

181
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,290
What's wrong? Not focusing?

182
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,810
No.

183
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,140
Sheng Wang did pretty well in this test,

184
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,400
only getting seven or eight questions wrong.

185
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,860
What about you, Qi Jiahao?

186
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,750
I got four wrong.

187
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,030
Excellent.

188
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,030
Come to my office after class.

189
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,400
Alright,

190
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,360
let's move on to the next question.

191
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,060
Sit.

192
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,820
Do you know what your score is?

193
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,890
Yes, I do.

194
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,380
Don't you think it's strange?

195
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,510
You got full marks,

196
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,760
but I said you got seven or eight wrong.

197
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,830
Are you upset?

198
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,500
Honestly?

199
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,560
Sure.

200
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,830
Not really.

201
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,730
Because the score is for others to see.

202
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,950
Abilities are my own.

203
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,390
You have a way with words.

204
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,830
Do you know

205
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,830
why I said you got seven or eight wrong?

206
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,890
I know.

207
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,720
You do?

208
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,980
Then tell me why.

209
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,110
Because I just transferred here,

210
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,400
I haven't fully integrated into this class.

211
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,530
The only friend I really have here is Gao Tianyang and...

212
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,690
And who else?

213
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,620
Oh, no one,

214
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,630
just Gao Tianyang.

215
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,300
Oh.

216
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,050
It's because he's easy to get along with,

217
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,640
but it doesn't mean I'm accepted by the class.

218
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,290
Actually, many students in the class

219
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,880
still see me as an outsider,

220
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,490
just watching me for fun.

221
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,950
So,

222
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,800
my grades can't be too low

223
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,960
or I won't fit in with the class.

224
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,660
But it also can't be too high,

225
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,660
or I'll

226
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,720
take resources from others.

227
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,800
I have to be good

228
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,710
but I can't be too good.

229
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,160
That's the best way.

230
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,590
I didn't expect

231
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,070
you were so insightful.

232
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,530
No,

233
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,060
just a random thought.

234
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,220
That's pretty much the idea.

235
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,280
As long as you understand.

236
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,040
In the Advanced Class,

237
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,200
the environment can be simple

238
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,490
or complicated.

239
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,670
Everyone is at the same level.

240
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,700
Besides mutual appreciation,

241
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,790
it's more about competition.

242
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,589
Most students are simple,

243
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,099
but some are more

244
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,160
competitive and guarded.

245
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,859
So I hope you can keep a low profile for now.

246
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,170
Madam,

247
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,170
about the 150 questions earlier,

248
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,270
I might not

249
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,780
be able to stay low-key.

250
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,900
Why?

251
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,540
You know,

252
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,560
well,

253
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,850
during morning self-study,

254
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,440
students usually will check the answers.

255
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,680
How many checked them?

256
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,410
With Gao Tianyang spreading them,

257
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,470
there should be...

258
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,550
20 people.

259
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,030
20?

260
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:02,980
Here he is.

261
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,750
The English Master in our class, Sheng Wang.

262
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,870
Bravo.

263
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,020
Are you crazy?

264
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,290
Treating me like a tourist attraction.

265
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,740
You should be a tour guide.

266
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,670
No, seriously, getting all 150 questions right is insane.

267
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,570
Copying from you this morning was a smart move.

268
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,790
How dare you say that?

269
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,400
Heartthrob.

270
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,950
I need to discuss with you.

271
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,080
What did you call me?

272
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,770
No, no.

273
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,600
I checked the forum of your Shanghai International School.

274
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,070
It says

275
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,520
you were the school heartthrob.

276
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,790
When I call someone, I usually use just one word

277
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,500
So it's "heartthrob."

278
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,190
I have no problem with your habits.

279
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,720
But can you change the word?

280
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,380
"School" won't do either.

281
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,900
How about...

282
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,650
Shen?

283
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,620
You pronounced it wrong.

284
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,410
I'm Sheng.

285
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,330
How about

286
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,240
Wang?

287
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,120
Ask him, not me.

288
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,110
Wang.

289
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,410
I don't really mind.

290
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,920
But don't you think it's weird?

291
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,160
Call me Wang and see how it feels.

292
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,200
Wang. (Sounds like bark in Chinese.)

293
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,280
It suits you perfectly.

294
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,120
Gao Tianyang dog.

295
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Dog Gao Tianyang.

296
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,530
How about we just call you Sheng?

297
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,600
That's good.

298
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,320
I'll call you Sheng then.

299
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,410
-Sheng.
-Sheng.

300
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,780
I'm okay with anything, up to you guys.

301
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,380
Sheng,

302
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,620
can you do me a favor?

303
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,260
Next time when you hand in your test paper,

304
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,120
could you not let Gao copy off you?

305
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,500
The class teacher asked me

306
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,040
to make sure no one cheats.

307
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,190
It's my duty as the study monitor.

308
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,710
I don't want to get you in trouble.

309
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,620
Exactly, and phones.

310
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,980
Don't cause me trouble.

311
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,550
Write it down.

312
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,590
Have you never used a phone

313
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,230
or copied homework before?

314
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,610
Don't think I dare not.

315
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,620
I've recorded everything.

316
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,410
I'll give it to the class teacher at the end of the semester.

317
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,110
I was just kidding.

318
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,970
What time is it?

319
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,160
A lot.

320
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
I don't think so.

321
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,230
Tian, where were you?

322
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,770
The health room.

323
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,710
[Gao]

324
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,490
Health room?

325
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,920
No way.

326
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,150
You went to get cold medicine for Sheng.

327
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,700
My mom scalded her hand,

328
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,960
so I just picked up some medicine for her.

329
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,930
[On duty: Sheng Wang Jiang Tian]

330
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,700
Sheng.

331
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,860
Come on.

332
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,940
What's wrong?

333
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,910
Are you free tonight?

334
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,920
Qi's friend has a cafe at the bank.

335
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,090
It's opening today.

336
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,800
They serve coffee, barbecue,

337
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,170
and cold drinks.

338
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,370
It's perfect for the hot weather.

339
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,060
What do you say?

340
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,030
We don't have much homework today.

341
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,230
Let's have fun together.

342
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,360
Qi is already there.

343
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,430
I'm not going...

344
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,990
It's inappropriate not to go.

345
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,580
I'll go.

346
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,420
OK.

347
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,040
Bye, Tian.

348
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,690
Hey,

349
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,170
you seem close with Jiang Tian.

350
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,030
Why didn't you invite him?

351
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,440
We're not just close.

352
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,890
We grew up together

353
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,120
in the Little White House community.

354
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,350
But Tian never participated in such activities.

355
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,240
He is very busy.

356
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,060
But I'm surprised that you asked about him.

357
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,040
Why?

358
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,370
Well,

359
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,820
you two haven't gotten along since your first day here.

360
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,520
If Ms. Jing hadn't forced you to be a couple,

361
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,040
you probably wouldn't talk much.

362
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,200
I thought you weren't close and you didn't want him to come.

363
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,430
Yeah,

364
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,410
we're not close

365
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,400
at all.

366
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,830
I'll be home late today.

367
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,120
If my mom asks,

368
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,450
tell her that the teacher wanted to see me.

369
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,860
Not close at all?

370
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,760
He even let you know his schedule.

371
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,670
No, he just...

372
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,530
It's not letting me know,

373
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,550
but his family.

374
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,380
Anyway, it's complicated to explain to you.

375
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,910
We're just

376
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,530
roommates now.

377
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,130
He...

378
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,490
If you want to know more, you should ask Jiang Tian.

379
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,650
So, you guys are like

380
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,670
living together at night and strangers by day?

381
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,740
Is this some kind of secret relationship?

382
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,030
What secret relationship?

383
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,100
I live in my room, and he lives in his.

384
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,410
Are you close with your neighbors?

385
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,310
Yeah, very close.

386
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,370
My grandparents live across from me.

387
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,670
Almost done.

388
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,020
Ready to go?

389
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,440
Let's go.

390
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,040
Slacking off again?

391
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,430
[On duty: Jiang Tian]

392
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,830
Hey, this place is beautiful.

393
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,780
Look at me.

394
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,300
Come on, let's take a photo.

395
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,330
Come on.

396
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,970
Go over there.

397
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,670
Hey, don't push.

398
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,660
Everyone get in the shot.

399
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,360
One, two, three.

400
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,970
Another one.

401
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,940
Get the river in the background.

402
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,400
One, two.

403
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,120
-Why is there only Gao Tianyangâ€™s head?
-Handsome.

404
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,020
So handsome.

405
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,210
Ridiculously handsome.

406
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,440
I heard the owner of this cafe

407
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,500
knocked down the walls on the first floor.

408
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,970
There are tables and chairs outdoors

409
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,700
with a view of the Tamsui River.

410
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,880
Cherish this moment.

411
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,250
It's the last year.

412
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,910
Next year, in our senior year,

413
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,620
the school will suggest we all live on campus

414
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,830
to focus on studying.

415
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,780
Everyone will move into the dorms.

416
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,200
The more dedicated ones

417
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,230
might even rent a house in Little White House,

418
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,630
turning that area into an off-campus dorm.

419
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:38,860
I see.

420
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,890
Sheng,

421
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,200
you seem tempted.

422
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,510
Don't tell me you're already thinking about dorm life.

423
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,420
When will the registration start?

424
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,540
I'll tell you when the school announces it.

425
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,130
Oh.

426
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,180
Sheng, you wanna live in the dorms?

427
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,760
Yeah, it's lively,

428
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,900
and if you don't finish your homework,

429
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,920
there are 180 others to cooy from.

430
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,200
Good point. Well said.

431
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,960
More likely they'll be copying from you.

432
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,410
Yeah, he'd be the one letting us copy.

433
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,050
Right?

434
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,590
Alright, Qi is waiting for us over there.

435
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,240
Let's go.

436
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,100
How could it be him copying from them?

437
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,730
Yeah.

438
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,360
Why aren't your classmates here yet?

439
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,690
I don't know, but they should be here soon.

440
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,230
Come in quickly.

441
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,280
Qi.

442
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,840
What took you so long?

443
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,640
Tianyang.

444
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,550
Xi, long time no see.

445
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,630
Long time no see.

446
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,340
I will never forget

447
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,620
when you took me to steal sausages from Ding's place.

448
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,780
They were so good!

449
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,860
I got plenty of sausages here, eat as much as you want.

450
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,390
Thanks.

451
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,150
Are these all your classmates?

452
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,910
They are my friends.

453
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,750
They both call me Xi.

454
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,160
If you don't mind, you can call me Xi too.

455
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,040
-Hello, Xi.
-Hello, Xi.

456
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,850
Let me introduce someone to you.

457
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,960
He is my partner,

458
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,360
Lin.

459
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,040
You can call him Lin.

460
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,530
-Hello, Lin.
-Hello, Lin.

461
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,540
Hello, everyone.

462
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,850
Lin will show you to your seats.

463
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,200
Okay.

464
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,660
It's inside.

465
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,800
It's a trial run today. Help yourselves.

466
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,180
Come on in.

467
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,200
Wow.

468
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,110
Enjoy your meal.

469
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,410
I'll go prepare some more.

470
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,340
OK. Thank you, Lin.

471
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,760
-Qi.
-Thank you.

472
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,820
How did you know Xi?

473
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,050
He used to be my tutor.

474
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,820
I'm telling you, he's so great.

475
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,280
Our school has an Honor Roll on the first floor,

476
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,540
he used to always be the top.

477
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,520
He also won the Taiwan's Excellent Model Student.

478
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,220
How's the food?

479
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,840
It's good, thank you.

480
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,690
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

481
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,840
Who ordered the wine?

482
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,260
Sorry, Xi, that was me.

483
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,010
I took a break from school, so I'm already 18.

484
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,550
You might be 18, but your classmates aren't.

485
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,350
How about this?

486
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,350
Tonight everything's on me

487
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,140
except wine.

488
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,080
Yay!

489
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,790
I'll have a drink too.

490
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,150
Hey, Tianyang.

491
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,360
Ask Jiang Tian

492
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,560
if he wants to join us.

493
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,850
Jiang Tian?

494
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,460
Are you in the same class with Jiang Tian?

495
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:07,950
Yes.

496
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,480
You know Tian?

497
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,960
Not just know him, I'm pretty close with him.

498
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,110
We've met before, right?

499
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:19,760
Me?

500
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,360
Yes.

501
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,230
Where?

502
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,830
Welfare service, fish ball soup, Gei.

503
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,870
Sorry, I don't recognize you.

504
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,750
You're the one who dined and dashed,

505
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,310
and Jiang Tian had to pick you up.

506
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,570
Oh, I remember now.

507
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,990
You dined and dashed?

508
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,820
You didn't pay?

509
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,910
You didn't pay for the food?

510
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,290
No, I paid him back later.

511
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,090
So you really are close with Tian.

512
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,220
No wonder you come to school together.

513
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,850
Hello, Jiang Tian.

514
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,390
Are you really not coming?

515
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,520
Your friend is here,

516
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,250
the one who dined and dashed.

517
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,750
Alright then.

518
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,840
Jiang Tian's busy and can't come.

519
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,840
Enjoy the food and drinks,

520
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,190
and let me know if you need anything.

521
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,780
Xi, do you have grilled skewers?

522
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:15,910
Yes.

523
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,180
Lin,

524
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,060
grill more skewers.

525
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,660
Yes!

526
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,350
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

527
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,650
Eat as much as you can.

528
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,310
Grandpa,

529
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,920
your feet is acting up again?

530
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,570
No, I told you I'm fine.

531
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,060
Why'd you come all the way here?

532
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,690
I just hit my knee,

533
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,340
it's fine.

534
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,830
Alright, stop it.

535
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:48,910
Let me take a look.

536
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,740
No need.

537
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,290
It's nothing.

538
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,210
No big deal.

539
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,610
Are you used to living there?

540
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,540
You never answer my questions.

541
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,760
Are you doing alright?

542
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,400
You know, everything in this world has a cause and effect.

543
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,490
I dried

544
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,380
the fish for myself,

545
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,470
that's the cause.

546
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,440
The fish being eaten, that's the effect.

547
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,490
The cat ate the fish. Easy.

548
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,900
Okay, hang in there.

549
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
The cat ate the fish being the cause,

550
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,940
and I caught the cat and beat it being the effect.

551
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,950
The cat got beaten being the cause,

552
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,610
so it saw me as an enemy.

553
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,370
When I went out, it jumped down and scared me.

554
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,790
That's the effect.

555
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,240
In the end, I bumped my knee.

556
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,750
Many things

557
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,020
seem to be alone,

558
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,420
In fact, they are all closely related.

559
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,900
If you

560
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,530
keep running from your destiny,

561
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,920
you're just

562
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,320
avoiding facing yourself.

563
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,870
Everything happens for a reason,

564
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,070
and it's best to confront it.

565
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,830
What did I tell you?

566
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,840
Stay steady

567
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,890
to handle things with ease.

568
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,570
Alright, you sit down.

569
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,390
What?

570
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,910
Let me take care of it.

571
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,380
You made me

572
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,190
bump my knee.

573
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,920
Alright,

574
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,070
I'm not blaming you.

575
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,440
Did you eat my green pepper?

576
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,120
You ate what he ate. You have a crush on him?

577
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,540
I ate the other side.

578
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,450
Can you really eat that?

579
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,980
Save the yellow ones for me.

580
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,910
Okay.

581
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,050
Drink more water since you're sick.

582
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,130
Who told you I'm sick?

583
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,140
Take a guess.

584
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,690
Jiang Tian?

585
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,670
He's not even here.

586
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,720
Why does he care?

587
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,410
You're drinking it all?

588
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,410
Slow down.

589
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,340
Wow.

590
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,830
Sheng, you're so thirsty.

591
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,320
Here, grilled skewers.

592
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,120
Thank you, Lin.

593
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,500
Move, move.

594
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,360
I want this one.

595
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,140
-Why does it taste weird?
-Who knocked over my chopsticks?

596
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,760
Let me know if you want more.

597
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,210
Raise your glass.

598
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,990
Cheers.

599
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,270
Hey, you know what?

600
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,320
Even though Ms. Jin seems like

601
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,870
she's been single for long,

602
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,820
a lot of male teachers are after her.

603
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,710
But she's not interested in any of them.

604
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,980
Makes me wonder

605
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,040
if her type is someone

606
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,530
like me.

607
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,830
No way.

608
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,460
How dare you talk about that?

609
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,710
Your dad is the one who won't let us date!

610
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,670
Yeah.

611
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,430
Did you listen?

612
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,780
Did you?

613
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,480
What?

614
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,450
Do you know

615
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,440
the two girls from the other class who always come to see Tian?

616
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,390
I heard they've recently started

617
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,790
liking the new transfer student.

618
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,010
We have a new transfer student?

619
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,350
It's you. Are you...

620
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,170
Damn.

621
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,200
Give me back my green tea.

622
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,910
This is not green tea.

623
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,770
This is wine.

624
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,880
He's not even here. Why does he care?

625
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,400
Slow down.

626
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,570
No wonder the taste was weird.

627
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,700
I'll go to the bathroom.

628
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,630
Be careful.

629
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,110
That's too much.

630
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,430
Don't sneak a drink.

631
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,450
Just try it.

632
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,080
Is he drunk or not?

633
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,070
He looks fine.

634
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,490
I think you look more drunk.

635
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,460
Always acting crazy.

636
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,570
Oh, it just came to me,

637
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,350
is the selection for

638
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,840
the Excellent Model Student starting soon?

639
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,590
You're well-informed.

640
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,740
The class teacher will probably mention it tomorrow.

641
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,800
Each class usually gets three spots.

642
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,980
But based on grades and class roles,

643
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,030
I probably don't stand a chance.

644
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,820
But there's still a spot chosen by class vote.

645
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,820
Yeah.

646
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,980
That's why I'm treating

647
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,940
everyone today,

648
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,780
to thank you all for your votes.

649
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,210
Waiter, check please.

650
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,420
No problem.

651
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,470
Qi, you suck.

652
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,390
You want to pay?

653
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,400
Someone who went to the toilet just paid.

654
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,949
Sheng?

655
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,199
Sheng, are you okay?

656
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,520
I'm fine.

657
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,520
Sheng,

658
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,530
did you pay the bill?

659
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,520
Yes.

660
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,699
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

661
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,000
Well, thanks for inviting me to this party.

662
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,400
I'm finally not alone anymore.

663
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,440
So,

664
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,530
enjoy yourselves.

665
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,250
Here.

666
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,889
Yay. Cheers.

667
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,570
Let's eat.

668
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,679
Xi, take care of Sheng.

669
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,580
We're leaving.

670
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,860
[Cafe]

671
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,500
My head hurts.

672
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,560
What are you doing here?

673
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,180
Weren't you at Ding's?

674
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,270
You gave him wine?

675
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,570
I gave him water.

676
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,650
He insisted on drinking cold ones and grabbed it wrong.

677
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,850
I only had a big glass of green tea,

678
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,400
and before I could grab a second one,

679
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,100
someone took it.

680
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,040
Let's go. Can you stand?

681
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,040
I didn't drink wine.

682
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,220
Where's Gao Yangtian?

683
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,490
His name is Gao Tianyang.

684
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,500
Where did Song Sirui, Little Mouth Xu, Qi Jiahao,

685
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,080
and that pepper fish guy go?

686
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,710
They all left.

687
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,610
You were so drunk.

688
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,520
I was going to take you home after I'm done.

689
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,690
It's okay. I'll take him home.

690
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,110
Can you walk?

691
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,610
Tian,

692
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,080
let's head back

693
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,970
home.

694
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,590
After I climb this mountain...

695
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,470
Be careful.

696
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,420
Hurry up.

697
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,930
You used to wait for me.

698
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,260
Should I wait for you this time?

699
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,240
What's that?

700
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,850
Cockroach poison.

701
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,550
We don't have cockroaches at home.

702
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,810
It's for you.

703
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,990
I'm faster than you.

704
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,950
I won.

705
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,450
Sit down.

706
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,070
I'll go get some water.

707
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,910
I don't want to.

708
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,950
Sit down.

709
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
They all said we're close.

710
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,400
My dad also told me

711
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,190
that we can be good friends.

712
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,090
Our classmates say

713
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,550
we look like we're really close.

714
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,940
Even Zhao Xi, the cafe owner,

715
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,870
thinks we seem close.

716
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,180
They all think we're close,

717
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,420
but we haven't even talked much.

718
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,020
Actually, we can...

719
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,220
Actually, I've been feeling awful with this cold all day,

720
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,590
and you won't even buy me medicine.

721
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,090
What's this?

722
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,070
Drink it to sober up.

723
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,440
Take the cold medicine later.

724
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,050
Ask me for it

725
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,780
when you sober up.

726
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,600
What brand is it?

727
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,740
You know I'm picky

728
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,230
about what I take.

729
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,210
Take it or not.

730
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,900
This tastes awful.

731
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,320
Good medicine tastes bitter. Drink it.

732
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:23,620
Finished.

733
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,530
I feel like I'm already sober now.

734
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:30,950
Really?

735
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,980
Yes.

736
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,870
Then count from one to ten.

737
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,100
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

738
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,350
Back from ten to one.

739
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,450
Ten, nine...

740
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,990
Why should I listen to you?

741
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,890
Let's go home.

742
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,750
I'm not drunk.

743
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,860
You're finally back.

744
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,820
Don't touch me.

745
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,000
Why are you two so late?

746
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,970
I thought...

747
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,700
Why does it smell so heavy?

748
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:14,890
Did you drink wine?

749
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,300
Wang, are you okay?

750
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,470
Yes, I'm fine.

751
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,620
Be careful.

752
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,240
Careful.

753
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:22,840
Careful.

754
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,320
Come, sit here.

755
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,480
Careful.

756
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,330
Do you feel like throwing up?

757
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,310
Why did you take him to drink wine?

758
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,420
Keep an eye on him.

759
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,740
Make sure he doesn't throw up.

760
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,090
Mom,

761
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,670
is your hand okay?

762
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,880
My hand?

763
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:41,960
It's fine.

764
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,670
I brought some ointment for burns.

765
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,580
Appy it when you have time.

766
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,460
You bought it for me?

767
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,660
Okay.

768
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,240
Keep an eye on him.

769
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,500
Don't let him throw up.

770
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,790
Mom, are you okay?

771
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,400
Actually,

772
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,960
I kind of understand Wang.

773
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,400
Even I'm not used to this house yet,

774
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,160
so it must be even harder for him to adjust to us.

775
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,480
Add lemon and honey.

776
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:19,570
Tian,

777
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,630
this one's for you.

778
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,310
It helps prevent colds. Take it.

779
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,380
Wang.

780
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,700
Come.

781
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,030
Honey water can help you sober up.

782
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,230
I'm sleepy.

783
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,310
I'm going to bed.

784
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,800
He's drunk.

785
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,320
Really drunk.

786
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,820
I think seeing us reminds him

787
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,640
of his mom.

788
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,010
Who is it?

789
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,010
[Ju Dian accepted your friend request. You can start chatting now.]

790
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,280
Ju Dian?

791
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,960
Jiang Tian?

792
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,520
I can't believe he just accepted my friend request.

793
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,200
Is the door locked?

794
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,540
No.

795
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:12,810
I'm going in.

796
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,880
If you come...

797
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,940
Drink this.

798
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,310
When I was little,

799
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,070
every time I had a fever,

800
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,510
my mom would make me honey lemon water.

801
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,250
After she passed away,

802
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,070
for a while,

803
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,510
I'd dream of her every night.

804
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:19,280
I felt so awful

805
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,100
that I'd crawl into bed with my dad,

806
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,110
just to feel like someone was there.

807
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,200
It made the pain a little less.

808
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,690
But later,

809
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,910
as I got grown up,

810
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,400
or maybe because my dad got busier,

811
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:56,620
that closeness

812
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,980
couldn't last anymore.

813
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,550
The house got bigger,

814
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,760
but I had no one to share it with.

815
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:22,880
As time passes,

816
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,090
I don't need that kind of closeness.

817
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,240
My dad respects me.

818
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:48,110
People call it being open-minded,

819
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,460
but I know

820
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,010
it's just politeness

821
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,870
and distance.

822
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,830
I'll drink it.

823
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:13,380
You can go now.

824
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,700
Finished.

825
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:57,800
Here.

826
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:09,920
Get some rest.

827
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,300
I remember

828
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,890
I wanted to ask you something,

829
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:27,960
but I can't remember what it was.

830
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,300
Oh, right.

831
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,010
Well,

832
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,940
today by the river,

833
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,200
I said

834
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,420
people think we look close,

835
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:53,590
but we haven't talked much.

836
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,410
But actually

837
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,590
you did say something to me.

838
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,360
You said...

839
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:12,370
Actually...

840
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,240
Actually...

841
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:18,390
Actually, we can...

842
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,610
Actually, I've been feeling awful with this cold all day.

843
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:20,700
Actually...

844
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,980
Actually, we can give it a try.

845
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,100
Try what?

846
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,060
Try to get close.

847
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:51,970
At this moment,

848
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:55,230
I completely forgot what the English teacher said

849
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:58,490
about the difference between "up to you" and "down to you".

850
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,040
Later I realized

851
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,230
the moment Jiang Tian said that,

852
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,180
my world

853
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,910
was upside down.

854
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,120
My world has been completely changed.

855
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:43,080
[Jiang Tian's Very Moment]

856
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:40,850
Report.

857
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,870
You are Jiang Tian from Class A Grade 2, right?

858
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:45,940
Whatâ€™s up?

859
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,770
My mom got burned.

860
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:50,700
Can I get some ointment for her?

861
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,180
It's against school rules,

862
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,510
but...

863
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,810
It's okay. I'll get it for you.

864
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:57,450
Thank you.

865
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,750
Remember to apply it three times a day.

866
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,830
By the way, your English teacher called earlier.

867
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,400
Someone in your class caught a cold.

868
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,690
Can you take this back?

869
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,650
I have something else to do.

870
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,170
Okay. I'll ask someone else.

871
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,460
[Health Room]

872
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,070
It's inappropriate not to go.

873
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:42,700
I'll go.

874
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:43,550
OK.

875
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,130
Bye, Tian.

876
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,160
You seem close with Jiang Tian.

877
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:52,970
Why didn't you invite him?

878
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,940
We're not just close.

879
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:56,460
We grew up together.

880
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,600
But Tian never participated in such activities.

881
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,500
He is very busy.

882
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:02,850
Oh.

883
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,750
But I'm surprised that you asked about him.

884
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:06,950
Why?

885
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,830
Well, you two haven't

886
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,160
gotten along since your first day here.

887
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,830
If Ms. Jing hadn't forced you to be a couple,

888
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,310
you probably wouldn't talk much.

889
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:21,510
I thought you weren't close and you didn't want him to come.

890
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:23,610
Yeah,

891
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,750
we're not close

892
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:25,670
at all.

893
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,860
I'll be home late today.

894
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,290
If my mom asks,

895
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,650
tell her that the teacher wanted to see me.

896
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,550
Not close at all?

897
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,380
He even let you know his schedule.
