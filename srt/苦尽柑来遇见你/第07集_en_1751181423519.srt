Are you the only one hosting the Olympics? We also host the Olympics here every day.

5
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,799
Their Olympics are a way to make a living

6
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,968
No, it's not what you think.

7
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,512
It's not like that so...

8
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,933
They compete in their own grand but cruel Olympics every time.

00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,975
Please leave!

10

No medal pension or retirement benefits

11
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,024
Why did you destroy my stall?

12
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,654
Why are you trying to destroy my business by hosting the Olympics?

13
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,991
Are conch and saury protesting the Olympics?

I am really impressed!

17
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,376
How many times have I said this?

18
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,129
The Olympic torch will pass through here!

19
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,798
Americans will watch on TV

20
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,383
We want to show them

21
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,886
Messy fish and fishy smell?

22
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,597
Their TV has a nose?

23
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,143
The government said it would clean up things that lack aesthetic appeal

24
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,727

government!

26
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,397
Aesthetics?

27
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,982
Aesthetics?

28
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,693
You guys are destroying our livelihoods.

29
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,237
Just to please someone on the other side of the world?

30

31
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,159
Is this how Americans do things?

32
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,953
Even taking away the jobs of the poor?

33
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:42,871
OMG

34
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,166
Why don't you stop selling saury and fight for your country?

35
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,377
Everyone has to sacrifice a little for the greater good.

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,046
You always nitpick over every little detail!

37
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,591
Someone bribed you?

38
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,094
What? I don't have money?

39
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,556
How much did they pay for the blood and tears of this town?

40
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,557
How much?

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,642
You still call yourself our president?

47
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,697

Wu Aichun!

50
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,869
What about Aichun?

51
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:26,164
Our vice president is a high school graduate!

52
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,957
She dropped out of high school.

53
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,419
What graduate? But she went to high school!

54
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,380
Where is our vice president?

55
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,133
Aichun! Our vice president is the smartest!

56
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,552
Aichun! Why are you looking for her?

57
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,930
She didn't know what to say!

58
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,350
Just because the country is hosting the Olympics, I can't sell saury?

59
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,727
How important is your saury?

60

They said even the 63 building would be flooded.

63
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,113
Do you know what current events and the big picture are?

64
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:03,743
Can saury be more important than... great history?

65
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,578
Of course it’s important!

66
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,622
Very important! It's fatal

67
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,710
Do you think the rebellion happened for no reason?

68
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:17,924
If you knock over a dog's food bowl, it will poop everywhere and walk away!

69
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,717
Do you want to see how powerful we are?

70
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,636
Let go! Do you want to see it?

71
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,555
Love pure!

72
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,059
She is here, Aichun is here

73
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,143
You are here

74
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:30,853
Hey!

75
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,690
Hey Deputy

76
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,567
Hey! Deputy!

77
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,501
Is this the trouble you're talking about? Is it her?

78
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,007
You better get up for me

79
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,385
This is a silent protest...

80
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,470
What did you say?

81
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,265
Whipped by the whip of winter...

82
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,226
If you feel embarrassed, just get up and stop making trouble

83
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,146
When you choose to leave...

84
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,188
Hey, get a forklift!

85
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,398
Let it run over me!

86
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,151
Hey, this is a gangster, not a high school graduate.

87
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,821
The one who takes away everyone's livelihood is a gangster, I am not

88
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,781
What did you just say?

89
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,824
Run over

90
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,035
What the hell are you doing?

91
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,411
Run over it!

92
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,663
Do as I say!

93
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,540
I said roll over!

94
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,002
Run over it!

95
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,386
Hey, what happened to our literary girl?

96
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,638
What's the meaning?

97
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,474
Life is like this

98
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,225
hateful!

99
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,395
Oh my God!

Episode title: "A Harvest of Autumn"

102
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,775
You will pay the price for betraying the people's trust.

103
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,277
(Opposition parties could not agree on a single candidate)

104
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,363
Politics is like a gust of wind, you know?

105
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,739
Rumors spread like wildfire

106
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,575
It is said that Wu Aichun will become the next president of the fishery cooperative

107
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,620
Please, I have no interest in politics.

108
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,913
I think you're going to run.

109
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,749
People like her will eventually run for election.

110
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,753
This election will be a showdown between puppets and freedom fighters

111
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,339
That traitor lackey

112
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,591
If we support that puppet

113
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,052
They're gonna screw this up right under our noses.

114
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,429
So what if he's the president?

115
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,723
How dare he call someone "deputy"?

116
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,976
Vice President is the official title, but he always says: "Deputy!"

117
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,104
"Hey Deputy!" He always calls me that.

118
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,189
She doesn't like being a deputy at all

119
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,316
If a dog can be the president, why can't you?

120
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,277
We want to elect a female diver as the president

121
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:47,323
I'm really not interested in politics!

122
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,619
Don't you want to make dear Kuanzhi's dream come true?

123
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,665
What's wrong with you?

124
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,002
Our captain must be canvassing for someone else.

125
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,838
What is this for?

126
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,756
Who do you want us to vote for?

127
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,301
Captain Liang, since you have bribed me, just tell me.

128
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,678
All right…

129
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,473
I'm not saying this because she's my wife.

130
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,185
But Aichun used to be a class monitor

131
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,478
I saw it with my own eyes

132
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,065
I mean it.

133
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,194
I've never seen anyone as smart as Aichun.

134
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,822
Have you ever been class monitor because you are smart?

135
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,583
Let's just be frank

136
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,794
Do you really want Aichun to be the president?

137
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,507
Then your wife will become the first female president of Dodong-ri

138
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,717
Then who are you?

139
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,387
Real men have self-respect

140
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,182
Yes she will be the first but I also

141
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,767
If Aijun becomes the first female president

142
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,729
I am the first president's husband

143
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,483
It's better to be able to hold your head high without any effort

144
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,985
That's enough, right?

145
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,279
You make us men look like shit.

146
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,990
The captain's dream is very different from ours.

147
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,662
This is something completely new

148
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,711
I will do everything. I want to be the president of the fishery cooperative.

149
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,005
I will be the monitor for the fifth time.

150
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,676
Who do you want to be?

151
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,512
Don't ask him!

152
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,765
First Mr.

153
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,768
First Mr.

154
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,895
this…

155
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,813
What? Mr. First

156
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,984
I think there's real banana in this.

157
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,653
Premium Banana

158
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,490
You finished drinking

159
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,202
Hey man

160
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,246
This bottle of banana milk is nothing.

161
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,332
That miser is buying pork for everyone

162
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,125
Who doesn't like pork?

163
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,460
(Salt-grilled pork)

164
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,836
This is no ordinary pig.

165
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,880
Do you know Jeju Black Pork?

166
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,465
Jeju Black Pork

167
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,926
Premium Jeju Black Pork

168
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,804
Give each table an extra double portion

169
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,806
We only serve Jeju black pork

170
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,810
I really have no other purpose

171
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,896
Look, I don't need money or honor.

172
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,316
The only thing I care about is

173
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,237
“How can we provide more food to the cooperative members?”

174
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,991
"What else can I give them?"

175
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,746
Listen and pay attention when eating

176
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,585
You cram us into this little place just to fill our teeth with pork

177
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,422
You can order more after finishing the plate.

178
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,758
I didn't think you would vote for me but you came anyway

179
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,429
I've never seen anyone so stingy when treating others

180
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,098
In conclusion

181
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,727
I don't know where Wu Aichun came from.

182
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,979
I'm from Dodong-ri

183
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,607
I am the legal heir...

184
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,943
I ordered a soda a long time ago

185
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,195
Not everyone can be in a high position, right?

186
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,449
Candidates' past and family issues are subject to scrutiny

187
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,535
There are also family issues of candidates

188
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,829
What's the problem, Vice President?

189
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,957
Kuanzhi has received awards. Have you?

190
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,710
That's a thank you card, not a commendation.

191
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,212
I can easily get a dozen.

192
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,506
You know... but you don't have any

193
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,508
Have you ever saved someone from drowning?

194
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,927
Stop interrupting me!

195
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,221
Listen carefully when others speak.

196
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,516
These women interrupted whenever they had the chance.

197
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,394
What about you? Why are you pretending not to hear me asking for a soda?

198
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,105
Everyone knows

199
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,275
They're not a model family.

200
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:56,614
They ran away from home at the age of 18 and had a daughter

201
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,908
She is a student at Seoul National University.

202
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,618
Their second child is not

203
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,539
No need to talk about other people's children but...

204
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,167
Never mind. I shouldn't have said that.

205
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,711
Then don't ask me to order a soda!

206
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,547
You reap what you sow

207
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,593
Did you know that mental disorders are hereditary?

208
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,184
(Mother of Liang Yinming, Vice President of Daodongli Fishery Cooperative)

209
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,936
(President of Dodong-ri Fishery Cooperative)

210
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,154
Wait, did you go to the hair salon?

211
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,410
Take this off

212
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,831
How many class leaders' mothers will come?

213
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:47,832
Are they all here?

214
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,753
But wait, you're the sports commissioner?

215
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,505
Why you?

216
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,590
So interesting

217
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:03,973
Other mothers would be in chaos if they came here.

218
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,851
How did your sister get into Seoul University?

219
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,770
What's the secret, oh my god?

220
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,355
Some people are really happy

221
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,608
Is it four o'clock? Let's go.

222
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,820
Mom, am I early?

223
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,323
Mother! Am I going to the teaching office?

224
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,867
No other mother

225
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,288
Why? Didn't you say that all the mothers of the class leaders were invited?

226
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,039
Only You

227
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,207
Why?

228
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,463
Hello teacher

229
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,715
No need to come in, let's go out

230
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,632
What?

231
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,760
Let's go out

232
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,856
My car has become Onata?

233
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,112
The ancient Chinese teacher's carriage turned into a horse-drawn carriage!

234
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,698
Our dear Yinming is helping children go to college

235
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,576
Just give them the abbreviation and they can get people in?

236
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,161
Is this how your sister got admitted?

237
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,540
He not only gave them away, he took them down and sold them.

238
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,837
Mom, this is serious.

239
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:21,467
The principal's car is now a Terra!

240
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,805
I have been teaching for almost 20 years.

241
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:30,476
Liang Yinming was the first to transform the teacher's car into an Onata!

242
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,228
sorry

243
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,230
Your son seems to be here for work.

244
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,357
I heard he's very skillful.

245
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,820
Cut a set of 10 tickets into 11

246
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,488
Earned 50 won

247
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:46,283
Are you playing a coin game outside? That must be Yin Ming

248
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,246
Is the school a casino? Is he doing business here?

249
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,331
Does he consider himself a teacher?

250
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,835
How can students come to school to make money?

251
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,212
sorry

252
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,549
You're so concerned about your daughter that you're neglecting your son, right?

253
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,553
Do you know what kind of kids your son hangs out with?

254
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,443
Don't come near me

255
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,822
Don't talk to me

256
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,703
You said it was just a class meeting!

257
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,539
Who asked you to make money?

258
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,916
Why don't you study? Why are you only thinking about money?

259
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,918
I've never been so embarrassed

260
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,462
Go pick up your sister from school

261
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,632
But now I can't even lift my head!

262
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,676
Stop fighting!

263
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,808
What's wrong with you? What have I done to you?

264
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,394
Did I tell you that you only need to be half as good as your sister?

265
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,062
I'll raise you guys.

266
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,189
I can just do half of what my sister does and then you can be the president?

267
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,483
Mental disorder is hereditary so you can't become the president?

268
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,445
Don't listen to what other people say!

269
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,364
I hate Fu Shangji. Do you think I am ashamed?

270
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,825
You just want to be Jinming's mother, right?

271
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,936
Her family isn't all crazy.

272
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,563
But education is not everything

273
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,649
Whose daughter is she?

274
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,653
Yes, she is in Seoul.

275
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,032
But I only know about dating

276
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,784
(Celebrating the direct presidential election)

277
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,919
Is he her boyfriend because he keeps picking her up recently?

278
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,337
Does he have money?

279
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,423
Even if he had money, how could a college student drive that car?

280
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,801
That girl has a problem

281
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,055
I saw on the news that many college students go to hostesses

282
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,225
Get paid to date an older man

283
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,268
Zhujing

284
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,229
Be careful when speaking

285
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,159
Is he from America?

286
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,539
Isn't it embarrassing for him to open the car door for her in public?

287
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,333
That kind of guy would cut pork chops for girls in a restaurant

288
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:14,199
I only know love

289
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,957
Whose child is she?

290
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,754
I know things that are well known without even looking at them.

291
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,505
(1 Roh Tae-woo 2 Kim Young-sam 3 Kim Dae-jung 4 Kim Jong-pil)

292
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,968
That family never cared about the difference between men and women.

293
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,389
Hey you bought the tree but the stone isn't yours right?

294
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,557
(President of the 5th and 6th Fishery Cooperative Fu Shangji)

295
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,018
Why do you write your name on a public stone?

296
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,061
Think about it

297
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,564
Her becoming vice president is a great honor to her ancestors.

298
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,690
But she doesn't understand

299
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,233
Who does she think she is?

300
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,151
Hey Captain

301
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,487
Do you have any campaign promises?

302
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,571
What?

303
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,157
I think you're just wasting money to attack your opponents.

304
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,287
I didn't attack anyone.

305
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,081
Just discussing moral issues

306
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,583
Don't you think everyone has a right to know?

307
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,626
Don't you know?

308
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,585
(Ocean Seafood House)

309
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,588
Why did he involve your child?

310
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,884
Suanji has crossed the line this time

311
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,095
You fight back too.

312
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,349
If you continue like this, Aichun will fight back.

313
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,268
Aichun only endures it because she is well-educated.

314
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,479
If she really wants to play dirty

315
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,232
You won't be so good.

316
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,653
During the Japanese occupation, Shang Ji's father was

317
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,240
The first person in Jeju Island to change his name to a Japanese one

318
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,077
etc.

319
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,330
Even if you want to criticize me, you can't find any excuse.

320
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,790
I as a man

321
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,585
Donated to the government

322
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,295
Where is Wu Aichun?

323
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,508
I'm pretty sure she never donated a penny to charity

324
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,638
The political field is full of shit

325
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,641
If you're going to roll around in it, black fur is better than white fur.

326
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,477
Who cares what color the dog is when it's rolling in shit?

327
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,104
That's a shitty dog.

328
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,273
I want to win with promises

329
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,902
Wow, Wu Aichun is still so noble

330
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,822
You didn't hand out soap or treat everyone to pork.

331
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,490
Are you going to play the gentleman?

332
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,993
Then you lose.

333
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:27,624
All members of Aichun Cooperative should know the true face of Shangji

334
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,210
He was the one who crossed the line first

335
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,462
You should do the same

336
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,967
If you don't break out of your cocoon on time, you will be devoured by your predators.

337
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,597
Only by breaking out of the cocoon quickly can you become a butterfly

338
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,976
You have to learn to open the door in front of you like this

339
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,062
On every ferry arriving at Oryukdo

340
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:55,903
Everyone can take turns saying bad things about me

341
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,989
But no matter how hard they try

342
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:05,204
You won't find a speck of dust on me.

343
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,999
That's my worst part.

344
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,921
Try to find what you want in me.

345
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,047
Stop singing!

346
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,299
If I didn't have an appetite I wouldn't vote for you

347
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,093
hateful

348
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,720
Hey, where's my noodles?

349
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,724
He always bullies his wife.

350
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,854
You even cook noodles so slowly

351
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,065
Let's walk home.

352
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,651
Don't ride in my car, you hear me?

353
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,944
Feeding husband Shangji

354
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,155
Your last name sounds like "Fu" anyway.

355
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,741
You are the deputy captain on the ship.

356
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,743
You are the vice president of the cooperative.

357
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,040
Hey! Will you vote for me?

358
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:54,002
Why are you always picking on me? Is it because I didn't buy you a soda?

359
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,130
Hey if you lose the election...

360
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,382
How could I lose?

361
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,426
Do you know how expensive pork and noodles are?

362
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,388
Just be content to be the vice president.

363
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,515
In the show Animal World

364
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,725
After the leader is defeated

365
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:13,855
You will immediately become the target of bullying.

366
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,565
Yeah! "Yeah"?

367
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,900
Did you say "Yeah"?

368
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,403
"Yeah?" Can I have noodles today?

369
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,615
If you want, please vote for Wu Aichun

370
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,785
(Fu Shangji No. 1 candidate)

371
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,247
The Wu family may be smart, but the Husband family may be stupid

372
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,875
But a female president? There is none in the whole country!

373
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,628
No, of course not. A pack of cigarettes per person.

374
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,881
I wish it was always election season

375
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,552
How can a breeze caused by a pine tree compare to a typhoon?

376
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,555
Democracy? All in the numbers

377
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,682
Follow the majority

378
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,351
The president must be from the husband’s family!

379
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,063
That’s right!

380
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:55,981
Pour me some

381
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,774
Come!

382
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,278
The president is... my husband's family!

383
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,364
The president is... my husband's family!

384
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,993
The president is... my husband's family!

385
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,706
You are so lucky

386
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,333
I hope you will always be the president.

387
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:19,296
That family's shamelessness is hereditary.

388
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,672
I named my daughter

389
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,008
Xianshu means "virtuous" and Zhenshu means "chaste".

390
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:23,925
And I

391
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,970
Like virtuous people

392
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,181
What a load of nonsense.

393
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,357
I am

394
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:43,320
A candidate without shame

395
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,490
The problem is

396
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,744
My life is so hard.

397
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:56,249
We can clear out the street stalls but I still can't make any money

398
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,172
This small town's real estate office barely makes any money

399
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:06,927
I just want to make some money during the Olympics

400
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,304
But those sea girls are too stubborn

401
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,057
Honestly, you know me.

402
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,393
Be soft on me

403
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,144
Meishu, you know me

404
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,688
I'll take care of everything.

405
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,148
No suspense

406
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,027
I will be re-elected president

407
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,071
Really?

408
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,324
Can you really take care of everything?

409
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,785
Don't you need me to pay you something?

410
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,911
Give me 30%

411
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,831
What? You keep 70% and I want 30%

412
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,127
Ah, that's how it is

413
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,505
Even the smallest fly leg is meat, so it’s better to share it

414
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:49,177
Misook is the husband of Dodong-ri, Sang-gil

415
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,762
Mei Shu

416
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:56,476
My life is not romantic but I have money

417
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,394
I just

418
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,522
A lonely man

419
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,653
Don't be shy in front of me

420
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,115
I'm not shy

421
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,952
No, I mean...

422
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,707
Do you think I help you for money?

423
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,711
So what are you for?

424
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,799
What are you looking at?

425
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,470
Don't come

426
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,806
This is the Olympics, right?

427
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,809
Even the Soviet Union wants to join hands

428
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,520
Breaking down barriers

429
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,814
How can we not break...

430
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,151
What's the gap between us?

431
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,910
Eat something or your stomach will hurt.

432
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:55,827
etc.

433
00:24:55,911 --> 00:25:00,248
Mi-sook's saury just pierced my heart like an arrow

434
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,087
Maybe this is not an ordinary saury

435
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,758
Can I see it as Mi-sook's heart?

436
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,677
Can

437
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,429
abalone?

438
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:19,392
That would make my world rain

439
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,065
Then eat shrimp

440
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,946
At this point you got me the shrimp...

441
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,739
You are crazy!

442
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,949
What? What happened?

443
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,700
You really turn me on.

444
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,370
You got me excited, so what?

445
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,914
You are really good. I admire you.

446
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,755
Hello you...

447
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,260
Come here to taste the sea squirt

448
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,055
Why do you want to comfort my loneliness?

449
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,726
Very itchy

450
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,814
So disgusting

451
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,276
Really disgusting.

452
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:14,864
You have to learn to open the door in front of you like this

453
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,369
Wait, how come...

454
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,123
What are you doing here? Damn it.

455
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,043
I'm still wondering why you want to be a follower

456
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,131
You're so disgusting. We can't even open the sea squirt.

457
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,800
Why do you appear in front of me?

458
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:38,138
Who do you think you are to keep interfering in my life?

459
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,099
This is my part-time job, so what?

460
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,228
When the saury pierces your heart

461
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,939
She opened another sea squirt

462
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,900
Wait, why are you eavesdropping on us?

463
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,985
Why? Hey!

464
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,865
Do you want to be the president so you can touch other women's feet?

465
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,577
hateful!

466
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,247
But you can't be the president.

467
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,004
Why can't it be done?

468
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,088
Why?

469
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,343
Stray dogs are running around and causing trouble everywhere.

470
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,638
You're just a bastard who wants to have sex with all the women

471
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,889
Hey!

472
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,184
We won't even give you a jerk like you a bad meal.

473
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:28,313
You still want to be the president? Stop dreaming!

474
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,150
hateful!

475
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,404
Hey come on, do you know what happened?

476
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,531
What do you know?

477
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:43,286
She said her toe was cramping so...

478
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,955
Your wife's heart is cramping

479
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,124
"Model family"?

480
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,960
You're the only one who's talking about the candidate's "family problems"?

481
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,171
The candidate's son is insane

482
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,839
Better than a candidate being insane.

483
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,550
He's actually quite smart.

484
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:02,472
What do you say now? Are you going to tell anyone about me?

485
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,891
Of course we would say

486
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,519
We will make Aichun the president.

487
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,561
I see

488
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,856
Hey, is this your position?

489
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,442
“Right to know”

490
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,319
"Morality"

491
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,114
I didn't attack anyone.

492
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,949
Just discussing moral issues

493
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,702
Don't you think everyone has a right to know?

494
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,453
Don't you like this?

495
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,206
Wow Love Pure

496
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:30,959
hateful!

497
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,300
This is so childish.

498
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,011
(Congratulations to Wu Aichun for being elected as the 7th President of Dodongli Fishery Cooperative)

499
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,807
Wu Aichun!

500
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,935
Aichun threw a small ball...

501
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,396
Oh my god look at this!

502
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,814
Is this loaned from the school?

503
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,233
They only use it once a year for sports.

504
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,945
...and came back broken in two

505
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,447
Jeju Island has...

506
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,364
President!

507
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,574
...the first female president

508
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,493
President! President Wu!

509
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,245
exist!

510
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,122
Is the rice cake here?

511
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,209
President Oh has finished his Makgeolli, right?

512
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,128
President Wu

513
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,504
Can I have a blanket?

514
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,797
good

515
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:22,177
President! The school wants to know when you can return the colored balls.

516
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,222
This must have tugged at her heartstrings.

517
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,062
Many years later, my mother joined Lin Yingxiong's fan club

518
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,691
The username is "President Wu"

519
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,695
President!

520
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,074
President, come and try it!

521
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,075
Here we come!

522
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,036
I am coming!

523
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,547
Take it away.

524
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,682
(President of the 5th and 6th Fishery Cooperative Fu Shangji)

525
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,447
Can we still eat meat?

526
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,908
Are you deliberately not letting us eat?

527
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,829
Did you come all this way just to get mad?

528
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,623
How can the predecessor miss the inauguration ceremony of the newcomer?

529
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,585
I, the former king, am here to check on the work of the unknown.

530
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,005
Are you afraid that you will appear petty if you don't come?

531
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,842
I resigned from my job

532
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,177
I resigned voluntarily.

533
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,849
You know that 80-year-old guy who owns the grocery store?

534
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,811
He almost never speaks.

535
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:59,315
But he asked me if I knew that my husband Shangji had massaged the feet of a real estate agent.

536
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:04,529
Come on! Her toe is cramped!

537
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,407
I have to save people first!

538
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,673
It seems that I will have to serve my daughter-in-law, the president, for the rest of my life.

539
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,343
After she did this, all of our family members are leaders.

540
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,054
She is the president and Kwan-sik is the princess

541
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,765
Then I become the Queen Mother, right?

542
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,102
Oh my god, she's making a fuss again.

543
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:40,231
She is really amazing. Her luck changed after she met Kuanzhi.

544
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,775
Are you bragging?

545
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:44,777
boast?

546
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,364
I heard your daughter-in-law can play cards.

547
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,325
Hey that's...

548
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,994
Are the scallion pancakes not ready yet?

549
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,371
Our first gentleman is really busy

550
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,081
Don't call him Mr. First.

551
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,419
Hey, could you please not wear that apron?

552
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,754
What happened to mom?

553
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,631
Make it bigger

554
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,175
hateful

555
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,887
He's really pissing me off.

556
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:16,935
You are happy to have a president's wife, but you don't like this wife

557
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,770
Is it funny?

558
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,230
I haven't seen you before.

559
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,398
Do you know me? President Wu

560
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,025
Ok, here I come!

561
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,485
President Wu is coming!

562
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,283
Oh my god! Why are you so surprised?

563
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,161
As if you didn't ask me for help?

564
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,081
Is this revenge? Are you taking revenge on me?

565
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,084
Can't you give me some face?

566
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,001
I can't believe it

567
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,588
How could my ex-wife be allowed to make pancakes here?

568
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,554
Listen to me, Fu Shangji pinched her feet!

569
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,979
As you know, during the election

570
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,982
People always like to talk nonsense

571
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,443
Like whose great-grandfather had a mistress or something?

572
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,446
Like when I used to go dancing?

573
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,198
You never mentioned this.

574
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:19,998
I didn't mean to do that, but I feel like I've caused trouble for your family.

575
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:26,838
But we've got the real estate agent lady.

576
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,840
I don't care

577
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,969
Kyung-sook from the barber shop and Mi-sook from the real estate agency

578
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,971
On this small island

579
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,057
Many women have a terrible eye for men.

580
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:44,313
Well, maybe I, Park Young-ran, have the worst vision.

581
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,361
Okay, you should go.

582
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,197
Some people gossip for no reason.

583
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,575
Do you think they would say I have no dignity?

584
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:02,373
No, but I feel a little bad for asking you to make pancakes for us.

585
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,251
I'm here for a reason.

586
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,670
I have the right to stay here

587
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,049
I voted for you

588
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:17,638
So I thought you should buy me a drink

589
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,393
Rong Lan

590
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,356
After returning home, I will never

591
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,318
You have to tell your husband that you voted for him, okay?

592
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,613
Hey Park Young-ran!

593
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,406
I asked you who you voted for!

594
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,920
Why didn't you answer me? You didn't vote for me?

595
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,339
Are moms the easiest targets in the world?

596
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,341
Hey you damn boy

597
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,468
You don't respect me? What do you know?

598
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,554
You don't understand anything

599
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:03,893
Why?

600
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,771
Why?

601
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,690
Why did the governor come?

602
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,236
Why did he come to attend the inauguration ceremony of the president of the fishery cooperative?

603
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,779
He didn't come to my ceremony.

604
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,114
The governor is here?

605
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:20,993
The governor gave Kuanzhi a plaque of thanks

606
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,662
The guy who jumped into the water?

607
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,833
If I saw them, I would jump in and save them.

608
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,210
I can be honored too!

609
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,464
And what about rewards? He's sending them on a trip?

610
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,844
The governor likes Kuanzhi

611
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,887
He likes him very much

612
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,016
Of course he likes Kuanzhi

613
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,186
I know he likes

614
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,189
Why?

615
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:55,069
Why does everyone like Leung Kuan Chi?

616
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,655
(Governor Hwang In-soo congratulates on his inauguration)

617
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,996
If your grandma was here she would throw a box of red beans

618
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,223
What the hell are you doing?

619
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,266
Hey!

620
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:26,893
come over!

621
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,060
Go to hell!

622
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,354
You are such a disgrace

623
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,905
You have to keep her under control. She's really out of control.

624
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,204
Oh my god, she really loves Busan.

625
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,623
She always calls herself a literary girl

626
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,499
You are not a bookworm!

627
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,500
You are a bug!

628
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,093
Look, she's dancing around the pole.

629
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,930
Throw red beans at her! Throw!

630
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,605
Father!

631
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,608
Let her have her fun.

632
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,779
Fortunately, I raised you.

633
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,906
Let's go, my good child.

634
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,242
Where is the rhubarb?

635
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,743
Come on my rhubarb

636
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:30,414
Oh my god, let's go home, good boy

637
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:42,969
Father!

638
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:44,887
Let me carry her.

639
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,597
Are you that happy?

640
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:48,891
right

641
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,476
I am happy

642
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,730
I am so happy

643
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,694
You are no longer the runner-up, vice-class leader or vice-president.

644
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,779
You really became the president.

645
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,449
But you know

646
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:10,288
I finally got rid of the title of "Vice" that had been with me for 30 years

647
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,626
But the person I want to tell most is not here

648
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:25,011
I had a hard time as a kid. I never miss that time.

649
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,181
But if I were to go back...

650
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,519
I'll come again

651
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,272
So I can hold it again

652
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,233
Mother's Hand

653
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,654
In fact, the reason why I am the deputy monitor and the second

654
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,615
Because I want to be the president someday.

655
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,284
It's like diving

656
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,162
You start in shallow water and work your way deeper

657
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,708
I will slowly accumulate experience and become the president one day.

658
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,336
No one can defeat the president.

659
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,590
Even Aunt Keiko has to pay back her debt to the president

660
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,719
Yes, this way I can be the president's mother.

661
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,764
Prepare enough rice cakes by then.

662
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:14,268
I want to make rice cakes piled up like a mountain

663
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,812
Because are you happy? Happy with me

664
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,314
I am happy too

665
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,734
I will endure

666
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,154
Because I want to express my happiness again on that day

667
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,368
I won't stand it

668
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,579
As long as I'm really happy, I'll let everyone know.

669
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,497
Why should I endure it?

670
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,503
Can you guys take double portions?

671
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,422
Oh my god

672
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,302
You raised me with these red silk nets

673
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,263
Now praise me for my mother.

674
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,432
Oh my god

675
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,643
You must have used a lot of rice.

676
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,395
Why do you make so many rice cakes?

677
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,607
It looks like this is a gift from the Light!

678
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,526
Oh my god

679
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,361
Guangli!

680
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,573
Your daughter has grown up and is now the president.

681
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:15,287
She sat here in mourning when she was ten years old

682
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:20,209
I wondered if she could survive.

683
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,088
Who knew she would not only survive but also live well?

684
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,714
If the light is still there

685
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:29,885
She would take the drum and play it everywhere on Hallasan

686
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,180
Digging the cold ground with my little hands

687
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,974
Bury your heart

688
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,268
Now must be your harvest season

689
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:43,983
Guangli's persimmon tree has so many fruits!

690
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,152
really

691
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,320
Autumn is the harvest season

692
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,700
All kinds of fruits are ripe

693
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,633
They all have their own messed up stories.

694
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,181
Each one grows under its own sunshine.

695
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,566
Hello

696
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:35,701
What's wrong?

697
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,453
What?

698
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,497
How come you're sitting in the front row again?

699
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,625
Just because

700
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,211
Fun

701
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,673
I do this kind of thing

702
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,260
She will be really sad.

703
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,054
That bad girl you told me about?

704
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:55,971
right

705
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:56,889
Yingfan!

706
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,479
Yingfan

707
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,410
You just want noodles?

708
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,580
So you don't recognize that car either?

709
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,833
Isn't Liang Jinming's story a bit weird?

710
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,710
Stop saying weird things.

711
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,630
Not all poor people have no taste

712
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,216
Yelin, stop speaking for her.

713
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,761
She has always been mean to you, why are you always so nice to her?

714
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,431
That's because she's psychologically twisted. I can understand her.

715
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,100
What do you mean she's twisted?

716
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,563
My dad talked to me about Jin Ming.

717
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,983
He said that people who start from scratch tend to have a distorted mentality

718
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,652
She must be the best in her town.

719
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,738
But it's different here so her mind must be twisted

720
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,033
She feels more and more inferior every day

721
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,703
My dad said better people should be more tolerant

722
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,454
That is self-cultivation

723
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,372
Can…

724
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,959
Why would she do that?

725
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,461
Her GPA is higher than yours.

726
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,547
0.2 Just 0.2

727
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,048
She is two centimeters taller?

728
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,133
and…

729
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,886
You must remember everything about her.

730
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,931
What else? Anyway…

731
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,433
Don't say "anyway" what else?

732
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:27,396
Anyway, Jinming was the first one to be selected to go to Japan.

733
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:31,191
If she hadn't given up, you wouldn't have been able to go and you still have to thank her...

734
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,611
If I were a professor, I would choose her too.

735
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,113
My family can afford to send me abroad

736
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:39,617
Of course the school will support a girl from a disadvantaged background

737
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,534
Yelin

738
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,620
Jin Ming's family is not bad

739
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,872
Her father is a captain. He is a fisherman.

740
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,582
Birds of a feather flock together!

741
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,668
You are really well-educated.

742
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,422
I don't eat anymore

743
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,762
Did she dump you?

744
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,264
What's the matter with that foreign car? Tell me!

745
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,184
You really want to know, right?

746
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,771
(The ban on private tutoring has led to a strange incident: someone actually gave lessons in the car)

747
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,569
(Typhoon Phyllis No. 23 Fishing Village Prevention Warning)

748
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,154
Are the waves safe today?

749
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:23,243
My dad will go out to sea no matter if the waves are safe or not

750
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,122
I'm the only one who's always worried about his safety

751
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,000
See you later.

752
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,053
Okay, come on!

753
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,639
Speak politely!

754
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:44,848
Shut up…

755
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,185
"Shut up" Oh my god

756
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,605
Where did you learn that swear word when you can't even spell "Wednesday"?

757
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,569
Jenny, can you spell Wednesday?

758
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,030
Write it down now. Don't

759
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,410
Why are you called Jenny Wu?

760
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,662
I thought you were from abroad.

761
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,415
If it were anyone else, they would have been fired long ago.

762
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,874
Not just fired...

763
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,501
Fire me now!

764
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:17,506
Seriously, why don't you fire me? I heard that no tutor can last a month.

765
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,216
Okay, wait then.

766
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,719
Put your feet down!

767
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,388
Really!

768
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,984
Hey little Jenny, you didn't memorize the words, did you?

769
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,862
Are you just here to eat?

770
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,491
I think your maid can cook dishes from all over the country

771
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,785
She said these fans are from Busan

772
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,080
That auntie always borrows flowers to offer to Buddha

773
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,626
You are such a piece of shit, she might quit soon

774
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,505
She's been here the longest. Mom must have her reasons for keeping her.

775
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:04,219
Everyone doesn't stay in your house for long, right?

776
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:05,971
Why?

777
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:08,807
Tell me why?

778
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:12,853
that

779
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:18,400
Why have I never met your parents?

780
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,319
But this is better, isn't it?

781
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,113
I'd like to meet them just once.

782
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,990
Mom has seen you, but you're not at home.

783
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,451
Has your mother seen me?

784
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,619
Where?

785
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,454
Your photo is on your resume

786
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,331
Let's get down to business.

787
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:35,459
You came here to save money, not because you like me

788
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,544
I really have a love-hate relationship with you

789
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,546
It is a sincere love for saving money

790
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,967
Can you fix your bangs? How do you part your hair?

791
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,928
You don't look like you're from Seoul!

792
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,097
Why are you so interested in my hairstyle?

793
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,018
Seriously, do you and I really look alike?

794
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:53,936
What?

795
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,730
Am I sexier?

796
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,650
"Sexy"? Did you just say sexy?

797
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:01,985
Hey!

798
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,987
Spell "sexy" here Spell it out

799
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,532
I can spell this SE...

800
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,449
stop

801
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,078
SE! Stop it!

802
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,871
Are these the only things you're interested in?

803
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,998
You are so bold indeed.

804
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,387
Mom said you get paid as much as you work, not too much, not too little

805
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:36,603
Your mother always tests me

806
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,200
Hello? What?

807
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,827
Just grab a handful

808
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,579
Stupid students should be charged double the money

809
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:55,998
What?

810
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,003
My mother is here and she wants to see you

811
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,881
What? Now? Go!

812
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,426
I told you to go

813
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,244
Teacher Liang

814
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,413
That's real white porcelain.

815
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,419
I have everything now

816
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,047
There are even white and blue porcelain in the house.

817
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,759
The only thing missing is a good education

818
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:51,803
I see

819
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,556
I deeply regret my limited education

820
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,600
I want to make up for my regret now

821
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,186
But unfortunately she inherited my intelligence

822
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,525
We will gradually improve her performance.

823
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,154
We can't wait to gradually improve

824
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,448
Life is not accumulated bit by bit.

825
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,533
I see

826
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,245
You mean I shouldn't come here again...

827
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,873
Jenny has money but she has no brains

828
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,626
You went to school on your own but you are very smart

829
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,670
I mean we should share what we have.

830
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:29,466
I'll help you arrange everything.

831
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,802
You just need to enjoy the benefits

832
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,639
It took us two years to find a tutor who looked like Jenny.

833
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,641
Then I won't beat around the bush.

834
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,267
Teacher Liang

835
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,312
Please take the college entrance examination for her

836
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,834
(Student ID card Jenny Wu)

837
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,085
(Admission ticket Jenny Wu)

838
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,838
If she gets into the top three universities

839
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,298
I'll buy you a three-bedroom apartment in Seoul

840
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,843
Get into any other university and buy a two-bedroom apartment

841
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,145
(Note: List of approved dormitory applicants)

842
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,233
If I am not on the list, can I stay in the dormitory?

843
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:29,776
cannot

844
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,947
I want to know here

845
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,575
How much is the rent for a boarding house?

846
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,578
Very expensive

847
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,830
It will be expensive

848
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,318
Does he want to fight?

849
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,822
The historic election day is coming on December 16th

850
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,366
The eyes of the whole world are on us

851
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,787
Because this is the first direct vote for the president in 16 years

852
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,122
The atmosphere is solemn and serious

853
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,251
They said the dormitory selection was random.

854
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,253
But I think it's a bit suspicious

855
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:34,508
South Korea is apparently one of the most corrupt countries in the world

856
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,012
So who are you voting for?

857
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,850
I think we need to call the officers to take him away.

858
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,603
What? Why are there soldiers near the girls' dormitory?

859
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,606
The boys' dormitory is nearby

860
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,193
They come and go during their vacations

861
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,114
Who do you vote for?

862
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,868
Can we put him in solitary confinement?

863
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,168
one two three

864
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,176
Hello uncle!

865
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,060
We met once at the entrance ceremony.

866
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,814
My name is Park Young-Bum and I'm Jin-Ming's friend

867
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:41,658
I also took a few photos of your family that day...

868
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:49,791
So you must have taken a plane and then a bus to see Jinming

869
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,294
Why?

870
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,130
What? Why are you calling me "Uncle"?

871
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,216
What? You said: "Hello uncle"

872
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,594
Why do you call me "Uncle"? Why?

873
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,012
(Admission ticket Jenny Wu)

874
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:02,929
Oh my god.

875
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,307
Oh my god

876
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:09,769
Madam, you will get into trouble if you do this.

877
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,857
Tutoring is illegal, so my heart beats faster every time I come.

878
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,028
You have to have a heartbeat to make money

879
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,822
How to win the jackpot without placing a bet

880
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,949
If I get caught I'll be fired.

881
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:27,829
Yes, the risk of being fired is high, that's why you need an apartment.

882
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:34,336
Exams are no joke. How can I be Jenny?

883
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,840
No matter who the invigilator is, I will make arrangements first.

884
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:44,054
I'll take care of everything so you don't have to worry

885
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:50,602
You make money by doing what you are good at

886
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,146
I will support you by doing what I am good at.

887
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,273
So fair, legitimate, and profitable

888
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,525
What's wrong with making a living doing something you're good at?

889
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,905
Just take the risk and accept the benefit once

890
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,243
Madam, the question is...

891
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,160
Don't

892
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,746
You don't have to answer me now.

893
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,539
Think about it

894
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,251
Think before you speak

895
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,427
Your scholarship is running out and you have to move out of the dormitory, right?

896
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,429
Do you want to give up studying abroad?

897
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,307
How do you know this?

898
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,017
Like I said, think about it.

899
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,979
Don't just think about yourself

900
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,023
Think about your parents who work hard for you.

901
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,360
To help the real dragon leap into the stream

902
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,114
The stream must dry up, right?

903
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,659
Come with me

904
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,620
Hey! Go back to your room.

905
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,086
classmate!

906
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,089
Classmate! Wait!

907
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:02,924
Oh my god

908
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,677
Did you come out from No. 908?

909
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,346
Sorry? Why are you...

910
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,556
If you run away

911
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,100
I can't catch up

912
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,185
Why should I run away?

913
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,895
Did you steal something from there?

914
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,355
What?

915
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:21,484
Leave it to me to not make things worse

916
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,032
Did that lady say that?

917
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,369
I don't want to hear your answer now.

918
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,830
Take these away.

919
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,667
Watch it two or three times or even more

920
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,835
Then we'll talk

921
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:40,670
To be honest

922
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:41,588
(Seoul Apartments for Sale)

923
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,758
Did you know that the real dragon leaping into the stream is quite selfish?

924
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,553
Long wants to repay his parents.

925
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,138
So think about it again.

926
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:53,558
And your father is still on the ship

927
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,853
He will stay on the boat forever.

928
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:04,861
My father also trusted his eldest son and said he was going to take the judicial examination.

929
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,031
As a result, the cows were fed to death

930
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:14,579
If I think about my parents, there's nothing to think about.

931
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:17,916
It would be nice for me to have an apartment by doing something I'm good at.

932
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,543
Yes, I like your honesty.

933
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,837
But I can't do it when I think of my parents

934
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,381
What?

935
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,717
I was taught not to cheat even if I was at the bottom of the class.

936
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:32,013
I was taught not to pick up ten-won coins on the playground.

937
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:35,892
My parents would never agree to my living shamelessly

938
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,104
What do you want to tell me?

939
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,230
besides

940
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,858
If I take the test for Jenny and she happens to be accepted

941
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,944
Then there is a girl like me who can't pass the exam

942
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,447
Thinking about girls like me who failed the exam because others cheated

943
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,408
I can't stand the thought.

944
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,452
She'll be heartbroken.

945
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,746
Ms. Leung Kam Ming

946
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,668
You are capable of doing noble things and will be considered a person of virtue.

947
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:05,004
But when a poor girl pretends to be noble, such courage is reckless

948
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,675
It would be foolhardy to send a girl who couldn't spell "Wednesday" to a top three school...

949
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,177
Reckless courage hey!

950
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:16,349
Let Jenny do what she is good at and follow her own path

951
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,769
Isn't this fair, just, and profitable for Jenny?

952
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,188
Yes, I want to be a singer

953
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,570
I'm leaving now

954
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,700
That's why I hate self-made people.

955
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:39,372
Having nothing but showing off your self-esteem!

956
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,460
Stupid and rude, should get four times the pay

957
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,548
I'll take the extra pay

958
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:07,734
I'm not a thief

959
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,612
I know but people avoid her not because they are afraid

960
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,364
This is my money but I don't want it to avoid this kind of people

961
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:17,535
What about the ring?

962
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,120
What?

963
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,456
Diamond Ring

964
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,389
They make a wish every day

965
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,769
The world away from their embrace is always gentle

966
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,437
lady!

967
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,482
lady!

968
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,235
Hey! Little Jenny!

969
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,278
Hey, open the door!

970
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:59,202
Hey! How come I am a thief? Why?

971
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,871
But away from the world in their arms

972
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,249
It's a jungle

973
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:55,545
("The same sky, the same stars, the same heart")

974
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:05,555
