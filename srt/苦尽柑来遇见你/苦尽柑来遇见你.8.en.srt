Are you the presiding judge?

Are you who decides what happens to us,

-The diamond ring.

Was it Yeon-sun?

Tell her to come here. We need a pat down.

[officer 2] Yes, sir.

18
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,484
Why would anyone need to pat me down
if I am not a thief?

00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,820
Listen to her?
You're hiding something, aren't you?

Are you a tutor?

23

[officer 2] She said
she cut this girl some slack

You're guilty.
That's why you're acting like this.

If I told Dad I was suspected

Nobody would believe a thief.

We make her look like a thief

100
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,608
so she starts saying all kinds of things.

101
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,902
That way, it won't backfire on us.

102
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,696
What if she starts a rumor
about Oh Jenny from Daechi-dong

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,366
who's looking for someone
to take the test in her place?

Then we need to cope with all that shit.

and she's the thief.

In life, you either
have the upper hand, or you don't.

You're either the hunter or the hunted.

There's absolutely no need
to pity the losers.

Don't waste time
with crap like compassion.

About half a carat?

Call the police.
Make sure they know it's here.

-Damn it, woman!
-But you already lost it, right?

Yes, you reported it stolen
and said the girl was the thief?

that I threw it down to the street?

No, no reason. I just wanted to call.

Can't I call just because I feel like it?

178
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,127

183
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,726
Come on, Mom.
I told you to stop street vending.

195

Oh, why don't I ever have money, huh?

Dad's coming?

203

Your father got a reward

Where on the mainland? Which museum is it?

208
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,958
He wanted to see you
if you could make time for it.

Uh, where on the mainland?

210
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,171
On the mainland.

211
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,131
The one museum that opened, you know.

214
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,307
I'm busy, Mom. What do you want me to do
if you visit without notice?

215
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,519
So tell me,
is Dad coming to see me or not?

216
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,356
Geum-myeong, he'll get there.

How can she accuse you of being a thief?

00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,047
Did the cops call your house?

Oh, no.

You're not going to tell your family?

No way. I can't.

229
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,233
I don't care if everyone knows.

230
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,153
As long as my parents don't find out.

231
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,869
[Geum-myeong] <i>Parents never have</i>

at practice right now, Gwan-sik.

520
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,897
What are you doing here?

521
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,567
I raised my hand
and said I… wanted to see you.

522
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,987
You know what people say around town?

523
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,491
They say Gwan-sik wakes up
just so he can follow Ae-sun around.

524
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,494
You will win this. 100%.

525
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,665
I think you're going to be
a renowned poet, Ae-sun.

526
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,208
A renowned poet.

527
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,128
-Think so?
-Mm.

528
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,173
Well, what do you know?

529
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,300
Nothing really.

530
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,177
I can't write.

531
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,605
[sighs]

532
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,191
I'll send an anonymous complaint
to the board.

533
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,694
Athletes need to study hard too.

534
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,196
{\an8}It's not like
they're going to provide for your future.

535
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,615
{\an8}This is so upsetting, seriously.

536
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,578
A moth? Erase it. Why did you draw a moth?

537
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,704
Butterfly.

538
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,955
Jeez.

539
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,457
Can you write me a poem too?

540
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,127
Name it "Yang Gwan-sik," dear.

542
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,589
Why would I?

In life, you never know what will happen
unless you go for it.

546
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,534
Who knew that I'd still be sitting here

547
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,828

552
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,341
[middle-aged Ae-sun]
I'm not in high school anymore.

553
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:11,095
The sheet was just lying on the ground,
so I just scribbled a few lines.

554
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,348
I still think you better send it in.

555
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,642
[chuckles] No, I'm not sure.

556
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,896
Sports day tomorrow is canceled again.

557
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:20,813
Why?

558
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,691
Well, they're rehearsing for the Olympics.

559
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,609
All the time.

560
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,777
[groans]

561
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,655
We get the most sales
on sports day though.

562
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,240
What about starting a store?

563
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,951
We might even take out a loan.

564
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,746
I'm fed up of
carrying this bundle everywhere.

565
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,916
[woman] Excuse me.

566
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,210
Oh, hello. Would you like to try some?

567
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,254
Ae-sun? You're Ae-sun, right?

568
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,298
I'm Chang-suk. Go Chang-suk.

569
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,967
We went to high school together.

570
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,388
Oh, Ch… Chang-suk.

571
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:57,183
How long has it been?
I haven't seen you since school, have I?

572
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,936
All the girls are wondering
what you're up to.

573
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,021
Why don't you come to reunions?

574
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,690
Oh, do you not get them?

575
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,191
The reunion invites?

576
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,902
Is your info not on record
because you were expelled?

577
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,237
[chuckles]

578
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,906
Oh, I… Why don't I give you some for free?

579
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,408
I'll… I'll give you plenty.

580
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,785
-These are real.
-Oh God.

581
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,037
The poor woman can't even look at him.

582
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,499
Is she, uh, self-conscious about school?

583
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,544
Oh no, not the old friend from school.

584
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,178

[middle-aged Gwan-sik sighs]
How old are you?

587
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,360
[boy] Fifteen.

588
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,404
Year of the Tiger.

589
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,994
[boy 2] Hey, where?

590
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,289
Is that "in" these days?

591
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,584
-Sorry?
-What else is popular right now?

592
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,711
Thank you, mister.

593
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,465
Of course. Be sure to enjoy, kids.

594
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,466
Yes, sir.

595
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,096
[Geum-myeong] <i>In Dad's heart,</i>

596

<i>Dong-myeong kept growing up.</i>

597
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,522
I think that sympathy
truly is also a part of evolution.

598
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:31,069
Look at the grandmothers in the country.
They go on fine after their kids die.

599
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,571
They'd have eight kids, and two would die.

600
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,240
They'd casually say things like,
"You had a brother once,"

601
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,158
like it's nothing.

602
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,868
-Mm.
-[Ye-rim] Does that make sense?

603
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,745
How do you live after losing a child?

604
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,205
But they do.

605
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,249
What are they supposed to do?
Cry every day? Starve themselves?

606
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,376
No, no, the point of this is

607
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,880
to prove the correlation between
empathy and developing civilization.

608
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,298
Right?

609
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,803
[Geum-myeong]
Because you're better than them?

610
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,098
What?

611
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,434
You think they live that way
because they're less civilized?

612
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,019
[sighs]

613
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,314
[Ye-rim] Just keep on dusting away
your eraser debris.

614
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,484
It's not because
they're not as good-natured as you.

615
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,194
They pretend nothing's wrong

616
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,321
not because
they're not as evolved as you are.

617
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,698
They live on 'cause they need to.

618
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,537
Geum-myeong, I'm sorry to ask this.

619
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,582
Are you jealous of me or something?

620
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,417
Me, why?

621
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:33,089
Well, um, for several reasons.
I'm going abroad in place of you.

622
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,008
You're only going
because I turned it down.

623
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,927
Turned down? [laughs]

624
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,974
Then maybe you should go.

625
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,351
You can go.

626
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,738
You're still acting
like as if you yielded it,

627
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,117
but you don't get to go
just because your GPA is higher.

628
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,119
Family circumstances
are all taken into account.

629
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,372
Who said that? Was it your father?

630
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,709
Events in life are decided
by multiple things.

[young Ae-sun] <i>I don't get it.</i>
<i>I got 37 votes.</i>

632
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,761
So what if you got 37 votes?

633
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,555
So what if you got more votes?

634
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:26,058
In the real world,
it doesn't even matter who got 37 votes.

635
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,811
It's between Man-ki and you,
you understand?

636
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,356
There's something that goes beyond
the nine-vote difference. All right, kid?

Yeah, here. Take it.

641
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,575
Leave it here. Take one. Hmm.

642
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:46,412
Man-ki's dad brought buns to celebrate him
becoming class president, got it?

643
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,789
You got snacks from him last time too.

644
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,751
If you took food from Man-ki's family
but didn't vote for him,

645
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,211
you'd better feel bad.

646
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:13,356
If you're staying behind,
you'll only get a bun after you're done.

I really thought that
my life was already over.

I heard you were after a man from Seoul.

668

So, I'm practically from Seoul myself.

669
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,707
I got an education on the mainland
as good as any in Seoul.

680
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,963
Yeah, the educated one
better name the store.

"Sun and the three Aunties."

682
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,720
We don't need a name that's difficult.

683
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,015
Even a poetry collection will sell well
if the title is understandable.

684

Thousands of people are called
"Sun" in the world,

so if we're able to attract them,
it'll be lots.

690
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,530
Let's just stop having lunch
by the street from now on?

691
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,823
I'm going

692
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,950
to have lunch at a table.

693
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,827
You eat at the table.

694
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,870
So each of us gets a quarter?

695
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:19,041
Ae-sun, you take what's left
and just pay for this section, okay?

696
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,626
[Gyeong-ja] The water pressure is weak.

697
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,878
-Huh?
-[woman 6] Oh, the water pressure.

698
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:27,341
This is enough, right? You can manage
to clean sea cucumber and sea squirt.

699
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,593
-I don't think so.
-I'll do the washing.

700
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,304
[Geum-myeong] <i>However,</i>
<i>while there was barely any water</i>

701
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,848
<i>dripping out of the faucet,</i>

702
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,562
<i>the money my family made</i>
<i>gushed out steadily.</i>

703
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,107
ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE-FUNDED STUDY ABROAD

704
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:47,486
I just think it's odd
for an English lit major to go to Japan.

705
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,656
It also means I'll graduate later,

706
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,366
so I don't think…

707
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,287
Well, I should…

708
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,796
I, um,

709
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,132
would like you to go.

710
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,469
[sighs] Ye-rim is a little…

711
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,597
uppity.

712
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,273
Since you don't qualify
for the state-sponsored scholarship,

713
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,817
as I said earlier…

714
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,028
Oh, no, no, don't.

715
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,112
Don't. Please don't.

716
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,365
I'm going to leave, and I won't come back
if you call me again.

717
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,285
No. My family has money.

718
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,996
You can pay it back later.

719
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:44,168
You told me your car was the cheapest
in the faculty lot before.

720
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,546
What's so important about my situation?
You need to be brazen and take it now.

721
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,256
Or you'll end up just like me.

722
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,301
[chuckles] But you're
a fantastic person though.

723
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:56,847
I'm pretty sure you're the only professor
who feeds apples to sparrows.

724
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,102
But anyway, thank you so much
for looking out for me.

725
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,604
From the bottom of my heart.

726
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,774
Feels like I already went to Japan.

727
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,276
You have a way with words, girl.

728
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,491
[Geum-myeong] <i>For others, it was as though</i>
<i>I was writing a love letter.</i>

729
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,620
<i>I was mindful of every word</i>
<i>that came out of my mouth.</i>

730
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,123
Yeah, yeah,
she's such a good person. She is.

731
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,709
[Geum-myeong] <i>When others treat you well,</i>

732
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,920
<i>you think</i>
<i>they're the greatest gift to you.</i>

733
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,046
PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

734
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:32,550
[Geum-myeong] <i>Yeah, so you have to send</i>
<i>the best tangerines you can find.</i>

735
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,093
<i>She's so good to me.</i>

736
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,594
So what did she do for you?

737
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,680
Say you did well, or she likes you?

738
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,348
Oh, what did she say?

739
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,559
<i>I wanna hear</i>
<i>the nice things she said to you.</i>

740
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,688
Oh, she's about to take a loan out
to send me to study abroad.

741
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,232
<i>Not easy to do for someone else, right?</i>

742
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:51,527
<i>She calls me to the faculty cafeteria</i>
<i>and buys me food.</i>

743
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,947
But you didn't want to study… abroad.

744
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,907
<i>That's what you said.</i>

745
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,035
I know. Just send me a box of tangerines.

746
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,996
Do you wanna study abroad?

747
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:03,998
You wanna go?

748
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:09,086
<i>Oh, but I couldn't go</i>
<i>even if I wanted to, right?</i>

749
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,212
Uh, how much is it?

750
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,047
<i>How much is it?</i>

751
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,550
You don't need to know.

752
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,845
<i>Well, I'm not saying I'll pay for it.</i>
<i>Just tell me how much it costs roughly.</i>

753
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,014
The Japanese yen costs so much.

754
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,432
Don't you watch the news?

755
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,018
Say how much it is.
Just tell me how much, at least.

756
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,145
You're making me mad now.
You're not that needy.

757
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,521
<i>You have parents.</i>

758
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,065
<i>Why should someone</i>
<i>have to take out a loan for you?</i>

759
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,900
<i>What did you tell her for her to say that?</i>

760
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,153
You think I present like someone
who comes from wealth?

761
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,531
<i>All the kids at school know how poor</i>
<i>we are because I chose not to go to Japan.</i>

762
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,659
How much is it, then?
Tell me just how much it costs to go!

763
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,746
<i>So what if I tell you? You'll send me</i>
<i>to Japan with street vending money?</i>

764
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,706
If you can afford it,
stop selling on the street.

765
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,167
<i>Listen, I wanna stop too. I do.</i>

766
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,209
<i>But how can I?</i>

767
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,502
[sighs]

768
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,716
Whatever, forget it.

769
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,801
Don't even send the box.

770
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,220
<i>Talking to you just makes me mad.</i>

771
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,513
[sighs]

772
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,975
[Geum-myeong] <i>But I treated the one I owed</i>
<i>my whole life to as harshly</i>

773
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,436
<i>as if I was writing on scrap paper.</i>

774
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,355
[sighs]

775
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,066
Oh, what now?

776
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,152
[Geum-myeong] <i>I wasn't mindful…</i>

777
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:18,364
-You always just drive me nuts.
<i>-…of my words or my heart.</i>

[soft pop music playing]

779
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,166
{\an8}I don't qualify at all.

[rain pattering]

783
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,847
[Geum-myeong] How much is that?

784
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,517
Just 300 won. Give me 300 won.

785
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,229
[thunder rumbling]

786
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,940
[soft pop music continues]

787
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,451
How much for all of it, ma'am?

788
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,368
Hmm?

789
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,537
I like beans a lot.

790
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,081
[Geum-myeong] <i>A kind-hearted mother…</i>

791

<i>and fond of each other.</i>

793

[middle-aged Ae-sun]
<i>And they broke each other's hearts.</i>

[music fades]

795
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,305
Sure I wanna stop street vending.

796
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,600
Who wants to be a street vendor
if they have a choice?

797
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,438
Once I was coy and girly too.

798
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,398
I was a bookworm as well.

799
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,275
Jeez.

800
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,651
You know when I see

801
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,197
a friend from the past passing by
as I sit there eating on newspaper,

802
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,407
I wanna stop eating the food right away.

803
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,993
I lose my appetite for the whole day.

804
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,794
[sighs] She's not the only one with pride.

805
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,505
Does she think we live like this
because we lack pride?

806
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,715
But what can we do?

807
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,092
There are a lot of things
she wants to experience,

808
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,054
and us not being able to provide them
makes me die inside.

809
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:52,935
[sighs]

810
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,229
I knew there was something wrong
when you started drinking

811
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,523
each time you'd come home
from seeing Geum-myeong.

812
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:03,904
Well… [tuts] …I have nothing to say anyway
to both you or her.

813
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:04,905
So…

814
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,203
My mom must've cried

815
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,541
because back when
I didn't get to be class president,

816
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,918
she couldn't provide for me.

817
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,547
Oh, I get it now. I get it.

818
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,180
What did she say?

819
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,140
Did she cry about going abroad?

820
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,892
Was she frustrated?

00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,449
These are our last persimmons. Look.

825
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,244
You have them all, Ae-Sun.

826
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,204
Don't give them to anybody else.

827
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,331
[chuckles] Not even to the kids?

828
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,334
Not even to the kids. Only for you.

829
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,711
[laughs]

830
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,506
We knew raising kids would only get
more and more expensive.

831
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,092
We knew that about parenting
from the start.

832
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,386
It's a losing business, isn't it?

833
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,724
[Geum-myeong] <i>She left the house behind.</i>

<i>whom she could never mention,</i>

837
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,236

[tender piano music playing]

841
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:53,281
Mom, I didn't… grasp how young you were.

842
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,411
You need to get rid of the cracked ones.
Throw these out.

843
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,541
I dreamed about you when we moved here.
Did you return 'cause we're leaving?

844
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,293
It's bittersweet to see you.

845
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,005
You should've visited me more
in my dreams.

846
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,299
Oh, Mom, I'm so upset.

847
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,928
I still have so many things
that I wanted to speak to you about.

848
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,641
Why are you writing him a letter?
He can't even read.

849
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,478
He never learned to read,
so what's the point?

850
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,607
[middle-aged Ae-sun] In case
he comes to see us during the holidays.

851
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,610
I didn't want him to be surprised
to see that we were gone.

852

[music fades]

854
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,833
You and Gwan-sik…
still never talk about him?

855
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,256
So why not talk… of Dong-myeong?

856
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,095
Why would we?

857
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,099
We already know
