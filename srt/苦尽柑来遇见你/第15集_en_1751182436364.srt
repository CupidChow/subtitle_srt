《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,196
No, we don't want this child.

3
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,240
Tell them not to deliver babies!
What if Aichun died in childbirth?

4
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,327
God, he'll only get worse after the baby is born.

5
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,162
How can I bear that?

6
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,289
Episode title: "Every Day is Spring"

7
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,252
When holding a baby, you should support his neck like this

8
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,048
No, I don't want to hug

9
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,177
No, I might hurt her.

10
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,429
Just don't get hurt.

11
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,183
You know

12
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,770
This kid is a little...

13
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,776
You mean a little weird? Wrinkled?

14
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,864
Look at her nostrils, they're as big as cotton swabs.

15
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,867
She is so small

16
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,285
Too small

17
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,955
How is she going to survive in this world?

18
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,415
Dogs can take her away if they see her

19
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,961
What is there to worry about?

20
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,046
Her father with a heart of steel

21
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,051
Let us protect her.

22
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,473
We give her everything.

23
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,394
Look! She's smiling.

24
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,020
They didn't know at the time

25
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,647
I can…

26
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,276
What are you looking at?

27
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,778
...I owe them so much

28
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,912
What's wrong with you?

29
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,456
You always hate me packing things for you

30
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,586
You can't even pack it? How precious are these?

31
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,676
Was your husband expelled from school?

32
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,220
Of course not

33
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,641
You know, money is tight at home.
The first thing to save is fruit

34
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,310
Okay, I won't eat it.

35
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,191
Why don't you let us
Visit your new place?

36
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,610
Okay, come on.

37
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,070
Then we'll go tomorrow.

38
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,489
You have a lot of stuff to take away anyway.

39
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,868
Why go tomorrow? I'm busy.

40
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,120
I must go with you, don't try to stop me

41
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,997
Why so sudden?

42
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,874
What happened again?

43
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,254
You can't fool me

44
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,216
You act like Yinming.

45
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,302
As long as he doesn't let me go to his school

46
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,265
I just have to go see for myself...

47
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,350
We have no place

48
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,437
Even if you come, there is no place

49
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:52,815
Why not?

50
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,027
We live in a large studio

51
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,490
I quit

52
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,705
I want to start a business with all my strength

53
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,084
So there is nothing left

54
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,629
Mom, it seems that even Jinming wants to make trouble

55
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,423
I guess she wants to take over Yinming's role

56
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,008
Wait what…

57
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,136
Why did you quit...

58
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,187
What's wrong with you?

59
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,481
What happened again?

60
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,526
Let’s all go!

61
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,988
If you ignore my words, just go away.

62
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,864
But I'm hurt

63
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,367
How many times have I told you

64
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,829
Uncle Hanlin just froze his fingers off

65
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,915
I keep telling you to wear gloves when handling ice!

66
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,793
Am I talking to a cow?

67
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,130
Your uncle Zhongjiu keeps talking about starting a business.

68
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,091
Now if you want 100,000 won, you have to borrow from me.

69
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,219
Mom, don't you want to know what this business is?

70
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,682
I've never been in trouble, have I?

71
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,599
This is for me...

72
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,601
This is the first time in my life...

73
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,438
What about the kids? You don't plan to have kids?

74
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,482
You wanted to say this

75
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,318
You're young now, it doesn't matter

76
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,487
What to do when you get older and don't have children...

77
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,990
Is the purpose of having children so that someone can take care of you when you are sick?

78
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,993
- Hyun-sook already has two!
- It's not the end of the story once you give birth!

79
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,119
This is for me...

80
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,538
Do you think children will grow up on their own?

81
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,498
Do you know how much it costs to raise a child?

82
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,167
Who says only rich people can have children?

83
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,254
I want to raise my child in a well-off family.

84
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,008
I want to buy them clothes every season
Buy shoes that fit well

85
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,428
I want the best for my children
If I can’t do that, I won’t give birth!

86
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,096
I don't have much money but still...

87
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,682
These were bought by Xianshu's family, right?

88
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,143
At least Zai Yi has a rich grandfather!

89
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,371
Did you pick today to have a quarrel?

90
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,709
It's not easy for me, really

91
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,087
Being penniless would really torture me to death

92
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,383
Son got frostbite and daughter moved into open room

93
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,594
after all…

94
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,097
Why do you do this?

95
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,556
Seriously

96
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,142
The trouble never ends.

97
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,435
There will never be an end!

98
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,188
…My always tolerant mother said something

99
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,483
Let Dad take a bold step

100
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,610
Damn

101
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,738
I'm so pissed off.

102
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,325
So the first bold move in my father's life

103
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,786
It's direct firing.

104
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,622
I heard your daughter also started a business.

105
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,749
She must have backup, right?

106
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,210
All it takes is one stroke of luck to be a good father

107
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,804
You are crazy

108
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,306
Why do such a reckless thing?

109
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,310
Anyone can see that something is wrong, right?

110
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,814
How can you find someone to buy that cabbage patch?

111
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,483
I heard that a boss wants to build a holiday home there.

112
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:27,071
Can money come so easily?

113
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,531
What on earth is in this crappy place?

114
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,742
Who would open a store in such a remote place?

115
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,579
Are you going to sell raw fish to wild dogs or deer?

116
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,332
They are going to build a golf course

117
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,587
What a coincidence that a golf course is going to be built here!

118
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,922
Haven't you watched the show "Police"?

119
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:49,802
When you are cheated, the scammers always say it is a coincidence.

120
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,055
Do you want to be homeless when you are old?

121
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,017
Who will be in their fifties?
Use your house as collateral to buy a shop?

122
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,437
If he doesn't do this at the age of 50, he will never be able to do it in his life.

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,356
So when will he take the bold step?

124
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,484
I'm proud of you

125
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,069
Even if there's a haunted house around the corner

126
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,697
No, even if there's nothing there.

127
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,867
I will never abandon you

128
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:17,788
The relationship between you two is incredible.
Day and night like this

129
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,750
Oh my god

130
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,419
Ask him to stop the car so I can get off

131
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,810
I can see some banners

132
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,479
(New Jeju Island Tourist Area
Worth investing (a wise investment)

133
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,772
where?

134
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,566
(Commercial real estate prime location for sale!)

135
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,318
Oh my god wait a minute

136
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,489
How could there be such a thing here?

137
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,074
Oh my god, "hospital"?

138
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,453
- The building already has...
- "Supermarket Specialty Restaurant"

139
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,080
(All quality commercial properties available)

140
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,040
(Commercial real estate leasing consultation)

141
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,426
If they built a golf course here

142
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,762
Then even Pak Se-ri will come to our store

143
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:20,560
Thanks to your good son, you can meet Pak Se-ri

144
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,437
This shop is also owned by the Liang family, right?

145
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,357
Is it Kwon Gye-ok’s son’s?

146
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,694
How come you still remember this?

147
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,656
Just because I said that the ship belonged to the Wu family
Not from the Liang family?

148
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:39,370
Seeing him sailing on the boat your grandma bought for him
It's so nice

149
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,123
I heard that Kuanzhi

150
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,376
At the age of 50, I switched from being a captain to doing manual labor...

151
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,711
Oh My God

152
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,549
He is your husband for life.
But to me he is the only son

153
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,428
It breaks my heart to see him suffer.

154
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:57,888
sorry

155
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,933
I stole your baby son.

156
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,644
It will only make him suffer.

157
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,980
What apology?

158
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,151
You know

159
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,696
Do you still remember those things in the past?

160
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,281
I know it clearly

161
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,659
Kuanzhi only stands on my side

162
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,912
No, I mean once.

163
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,417
I accidentally slapped you

164
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,503
You will bear grudge, right?

165
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,173
How could I forget then?

166
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,510
That was the first time I was slapped in my life.

167
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,971
but

168
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,515
We're even.

169
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,726
How to say it?

170
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,145
I haven't done anything for you

171
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,650
When you lose your copper

172
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,696
You didn't tell me anything

173
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,783
You've never blamed me in all these years.

174
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,370
You can't let a cow that has lost its child plow the field

175
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:07,041
I'm worried you can't hold on.
So I go to see you early every morning

176
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,385
I still have the golden toad
The one you took when you eloped.

177
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,429
I will leave that to you and not to Jingyu

178
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm sorry I made things difficult for you.
Thank you for surviving.

179
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,935
So I'm gonna give it to you

180

There are so many delicious things in this world, right?

If the couple has a common hobby

193
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,505
Will the relationship get better?

194
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,258
Do you play mixed doubles to bond with others?

195
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,260
Why are you bringing this up now?

196
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,387
Mixed doubles is a sport too!

197
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,890
Is that why you went to Mi-sook to look at the house?

198

00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,028
We rode around the block

Wait, look at mine.

204
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,628
See it?

You don't even know what a colleague is.
You never knew

Hey, then why are you still riding with me?

221
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,954
Is this a farewell ride?

222
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,623
After all, we have lived together for 30 years

223
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,293
We've never walked around town together.

224
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:41,505
Is it because of my mom’s citrus fields?
Do you want to sell it and start a real estate company?

I don't have to eat the white rice you bought anymore.

You thought I would

231
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,065
You took me for a spin on the street and then your tail wagged?

Come take their shoes or throw them away yourself

235
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,791
Why do you keep your shoes after you move out?

236

Okay, OK

Stop acting.

239
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,733
This is not acting

What do you do at home besides eating all day?

242

Huh? Why is she always like this?

243
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,088
I'm so busy, why should I chase after my eloped daughter?

244
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,257
Did you put my door back in place?
Don't invade my privacy!

So what? You still encourage her?

255
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,636

Damn

264
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,930
At that time, I cursed and made a scene

265
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,391
You hit me with a clothes hanger

266
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,227
Hey, did I hit it? You bumped into it yourself.

267
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,064

You won't stay

When you said you wanted to buy this store

00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,709
I think the expression on your face
It's been 30 years since it appeared

How can it spoil the fun?

Why are you suddenly doing something you've never done before?

326
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,905
Is it because Jin Ming wants to start a business?
Or is it because of Yinming’s hand?

327
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,158
Because I always miss opportunities

00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,953
Worrying about being stuck in a game you can't win

329
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,749
I don't stand a chance living with you.

I hope to at least make it to the middle
But the game went badly.

Money is everything

00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,361
How could you take such precious land?
Change to this crappy place?

359
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,490
Why did you say you would never sell your cabbage field?

360
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,116
What about that cabbage field?

361
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,161
Forget about the boss's holiday villa
They are building a hotel

362
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,831
But he said they were going to build a golf course
There is also a hospital

363
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,708
It's all bullshit.

364
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,543
My dad was fooled by the real estate agent!

365
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,339
dad

366
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,426
I think you have no luck with money.

367
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,677
You understand, right?

368
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,014
So what do we do now? Are we going to live on the streets?

369
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,265
Will I be homeless?

370
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,977
How about we pay interest and put this place up for sale?

371
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,938
Who will buy this place? Can we afford the interest?

372
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,439
You want a loan shark?

373
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:29,778
I'll go to the bank on Monday to explain the situation...

374
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,696
Why do you keep telling lies?

375
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,282
The bank will definitely auction it off.

376
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,202
If you're not sure, ask your child.

377
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:41,081
Leave the cabbage patch
You can also send Zaiyi to study abroad

378
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,500
That's your dad's money!

379
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,043
It's your father's, not yours!

380
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,088
What makes you say he was wasted it or sold it?

381
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,883
Do you know why he did that?
Because you keep talking about money

382
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,845
Even if he wanted to give it, he couldn't
He did this so he could leave something for you.

383
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,140
Before you do business or get into trouble
Have you discussed this with us?

384
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,811
"If you're not sure, at least ask the child"?
"Why can't you just stay still?"

385
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,146
What makes you say that?

386
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,439
What makes you say that?

387
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:13,863
Don't look down on your father's life
He never lived for himself.

388
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,996
We go home

389
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,665
I got you money.

390
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,963
god's celebrity parenting diary

391
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:36,094
In order to make the people
Become healthier and smarter children

392
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,930
God members came to the playroom to accompany him

393
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,766
He found all kinds of new rides

394
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,020
Let's see how smart Jaemin has become

395
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,908
We didn't ask you to get money.

396
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,249
- Where did you get it?
- Is there any other way besides me?

397
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,628
- Where do you get the money?
- Borrowed

398
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,672
I spent my hard-earned savings

399
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,885
I put aside my pride and went around borrowing money

400
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,387
Why are you putting on airs just to borrow money?

401
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,807
Why are you here without saying anything?

402
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,476
Who asked you to borrow money?

403
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,646
Why did you do that? Why?

404
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,064
How could I not go?

405
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,358
I am the eldest sister...

406
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,070
He's the damn pillar of the family.

407
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,658
- Isn't this why you raise me?
- How can you say that?

408
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,201
When will I...

409
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,621
Maybe you didn't want to train me like this
But that's how I grew up.

410
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,504
Starting from my first part-time job

411
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,215
I will send you at least 100,000 won every month

412
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,841
I need that money too.

413
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,302
Sometimes I really don't want to
Send out one-third of your income

414
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,887
Who asked you to send it?

415
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,640
I kept telling you not to send it.

416
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,517
To be honest, the reason why I sent money

417
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,229
Not because I'm so grateful...

418
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,191
It's because I feel guilty.

419
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,652
If I don't send it, I will feel guilty.

420
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,863
Because I will feel bad

421
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,909
This is what home feels like to me

422
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,247
You don't know the constant guilt.
How does it feel?

423
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,958
Stop it, your dad can hear you.

424
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,794
Why do you sacrifice so much?
Send me to study abroad?

425
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,505
Why do you do everything for me?
Let me be overwhelmed by guilt?

426
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,928
You are struggling every day.

427
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,181
After so many years of suffering
Put all your hopes on me

428
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,100
Do you know how heavy this is?

429
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,311
A dragon from the stream?
I'm tired of being a model kid.

430
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,898
I’ve had enough of my sister, the pillar of the family and the eldest daughter!

431
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,692
Liang Jinming!

432
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,697
This is the first time my dad yelled at me.

433
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,824
"Liang Jinming"

434
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,160
He only said this...

435
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,663
But it hurt me deeply

436
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,876
As if he was the one who was supposed to stand by me
Saying I'm useless

437
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:19,966
That stinky girl

438
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,137
Think you are superior

439
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,432
Just get angry and leave

440
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,268
What about me?

441
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,315
I put up with all her teenage tantrums

442
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,861
She didn't even realize I was going through menopause

443
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,205
But I feel guilty too.

444
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,374
Being the eldest daughter is a heavy burden for me.

445
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,169
I put her through the same thing.

446
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,837
You had her when you were 18

447
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,799
You've already raised two kids at her age.

448
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,093
You have a child buried in your heart
I still have to go out and sell goods on the street

449
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,554
No one can be like you

450
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,181
No one

451
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,188
That stubborn girl

452
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,524
She should at least take these away

453
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,445
She is not stubborn

454
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,072
Don't you know yet?

455
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,742
She must be crying her heart out now.

456
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,760
I had no idea

457
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:52,684
This day will be my day at my mother's funeral
The first thing I recall

458
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,859
Don't bother peeling quail eggs

459
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,236
She doesn't want it anyway.

460
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,281
Stop and take a break
You said you were having hot flashes again.

461
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,992
Oh god why am I so angry?

462
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,370
Whatever the fucking hormone is, I really want to kill it

463
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,635
what to do?

464
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,387
Oh my god

465
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,930
What happened? What happened again?

466
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,348
Oh my god!

467
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,934
No!

468
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,064
(My hormones are also in a mess
Sorry, sorry, sorry…)

469
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,275
It's hormones versus hormones

470
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,068
Mom lost again

471
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,323
She should at least take the food away
Why didn't she take it?

472
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:54,579
She must be like me when I was pregnant
Borrow money everywhere

473
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,125
She must be helpless too.

474
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,711
OMG

475
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,282
Dad's universe once weighed 6.2 jin

476
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,118
She also carries her own universe

477
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,498
Honey, I can't do it.

478
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,333
Tell them I really can't stand it anymore

479
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,380
Honey

480
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,301
Does it hurt? Are you okay?
Do you want me to ask your mother to come over?

481
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,806
Can you ask again?

482
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,392
Can they give me an epidural?

483
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,518
Painless? Good

484
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:00,853
The nurse is here

485
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,067
- Can she have an epidural?
- We can't call her now.

486
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,486
Why not?

487
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,572
The cervix dilates too slowly
So we decided to stop epidurals.

488
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,283
This won't work.

489
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,994
She has been in pain for 12 hours.

490
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,871
My wife is weak

491
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,917
The real problem now is that the baby is not moving

492
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,879
Mr. Park, you need to sign the consent form.

493
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,256
In case one of them...

494
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,173
I choose

495
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,633
Protect my wife

496
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,344
I choose my wife

497
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,182
Why isn't the baby moving?

498
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,196
Hello mother-in-law

499
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,325
I'm not sure what's going on now

500
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:01,748
Her cervix is fully dilated.
But the baby doesn't want to come out

501
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,420
It's a difficult birth, they all...

502
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,631
Not a good situation

503
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,301
What…what do you mean?

504
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,429
What's wrong? Is she in danger?

505
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,680
What went wrong?

506
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,642
Mum I'm really sorry but could you please come over?

507
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,561
Jin Ming

508
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,481
I've been calling you

509
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,110
What's wrong, honey? What happened?

510
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,946
When the young branches sprout new buds

511
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,284
The whole tree trembles quietly

512
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,202
(Delivery room)

513
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,828
one two three

514
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,371
No, not yet.

515
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,333
Try harder

516
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,128
One Two Three Four

517
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,299
No, you can't relax now or it will be bad.

518
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,009
it hurts

519
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,304
Now take a deep breath.

520
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:02,058
One Two Three Four

521
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,518
Come on, work harder!

522
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,353
I feel like I'm going to faint

523
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,065
One, two, three again

524
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,150
Hold your breath

525
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,611
Try harder.

526
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:17,073
One, two, don’t stop refueling!

527
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,909
Don’t wake up!

528
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,036
No, you can't relax now.

529
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,747
Jin Ming, don't give up the baby, it's in danger!

530
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,250
She's got her shoulder stuck, you have to push!

531
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:31,963
Jin Ming, don't you want to see your child?

532
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,677
Jinming goes to grandma's house

533
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,430
Let's go eat first, okay? I'll bring my brother over right away.

534
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,475
It's okay, there's nothing to be afraid of, okay?

535
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,363
The child is still alive. Stimulate the baby.

536
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,044
Two thoughts flashed through our minds.

537
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,297
Be kind to our mothers

538
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,840
besides…

539
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,383
We won't have a second child.

540
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,303
We won't have a second child.

541
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,680
Don't make me laugh

542
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:26,267
The government has repaid the IMF
Borrowed emergency funds

543
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,811
South Korea regains control of its economy

544
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,396
The risk of national bankruptcy...

545
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,900
Xiaochun is really an IMF baby
Is that right?

546
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,695
The day we met again
It was the day when the IMF crisis began.

547
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,239
She was born on the day the crisis ended

548
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,909
Isn't this timing too coincidental?

549
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,627
What's wrong? Do you want to call a doctor?

550
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,087
Are you still in pain?

551
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,884
I just can't believe it

552
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,719
how…

553
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,307
Yes, it is incredible. A full 28 hours?

554
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,184
Any cow would be exhausted to death!

555
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:12,104
How come she had a child at the age of 18?

556
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,107
18 years old…

557
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,736
I left my parents' home, got married, and became a mother myself.

558
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,989
The farther she is away, the brighter she is in my heart

559
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,783
Only a mother can do this

560
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,453
Her mother wasn't even with her at that time.

561
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,081
There was no painless delivery at that time.

562
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,167
At the age of 18, she...

563
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,752
How did she...

564
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,798
When she gave birth to Yinming, she was brought there on a wheelbarrow.

565
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,596
baby!

566
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,723
mom

567
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,891
Mom is here

568
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,018
mom!

569
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,565
- You did a great job and I'm proud of you.
- Their baby had a baby

570
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,483
Oh my god

571
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,278
Wherever they were there was a fortress

572
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,240
I became a baby again

573
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,124
Dad asked me to...

574
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,379
Dad sometimes

575
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:22,967
I feel like I married a citrus princess.

576
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,884
Do you have any comments?

577
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,845
That Xiaochun...

578
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:29,682
This is sea urchin kelp soup with real sea urchin

579
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,767
The aunts went to pick

580
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,103
Who do you think Xiaochun looks like?

581
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:38,441
My mother and aunt think her nose looks like Jin Ming

582
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,442
Her nose looks like hers?

583
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,401
nose?

584
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,821
- Have you seen her? You should have seen her, right?
- Let's go see her now.

585
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,244
Do you think your daughter is more important than our daughter?

586
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,787
You have to be nicer to me.

587
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,790
I'm their baby, you hear me?

588
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,876
What did the doctor say?

589
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,003
Is everything okay now?

590
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:03,341
She is very healthy and weighs 7.2 jin
Shoulder X-ray results are normal

591
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,634
No, I'm talking about Jinming's diabetes.

592
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,763
Did her gestational diabetes get better after giving birth?

593
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,558
Your daughter is healthy.

594
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,146
Why do I feel like you've forgotten your roots?

595
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,191
Every time I go home, the chicken drumstick is always mine

596
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,777
I will always be their first

597
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,363
Oh, you've bought baby clothes?

598
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,990
These are expensive

599
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,327
Dad doesn't care about the price, he only wants the most expensive one

600
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,288
Why buy such expensive clothes for babies?

601
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,125
Dad has a new dream now

602
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,211
Be a rich grandfather

603
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:46,008
Dad, that’s not what I meant. Why did you take it seriously?

604
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,427
Feed us and go

605
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,805
Let's go see Xiaochun

606
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,598
With the birth of Xiaochun

607
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,517
Spring is really here

608
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,647
(Real estate agent Han Manzhe! Curse your whole family!)

609
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,274
Why abandon these buildings?
Return everyone’s money!)

610
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,909
(Daytime temperature in Jeju Island in January
Reached 21.4 degrees Celsius)

611
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,578
As usual

612
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,206
They finally

613
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,708
Push the winter away

614
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,935
Do you really want to open a restaurant?

615
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,271
Do you think anyone will come?

616
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,940
They only need to take a five-minute detour.

617
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,734
You can come and have a meal

618
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,611
We will make them feel that it is worth their money.

619
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,072
Will they take a detour?

620
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,617
It's okay. If they don't come, I'll send them there.

621
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,079
Do you really want to deliver food?

622
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,791
People only order jajangmyeon for takeout

623
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,170
I've been catching squid for 30 years

624
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,464
Squid can be cooked in any dish

625
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,508
What do they know about squid?

626
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,510
They have to pay a lot of money to buy dead squid from other places.

627
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,847
We want Jeju Island
The freshest, tastiest and cheapest squid

628
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,267
And the delivery is faster than anyone else.

629
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,560
How could they refuse?

630
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,817
But dear

631
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,530
There's really no other way.

632
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,575
Honey

633
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,911
Did you know?

634
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,459
I have confidence in hard work

635
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,464
Me too

636
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,928
I have no other skills

637
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,064
They decided to do what they were most confident in.

638
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:09,652
Because of reclaiming stone fields and catching sea fish

639
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,820
It is the attitude of loving purity and generosity.

640
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,939
Hello

641
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,326
(Gold, Silver and Copper Restaurant
Strive to deliver within 10 minutes! )

642
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,083
Even God feels embarrassed

643
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,752
So keep giving them corner kicks

644
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,380
Football games mean takeout

645
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,715
finally

646
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,676
2002 is coming

647
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,471
- Park Ji-sung!
- Park Ji-sung! Goal!

648
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,974
South Korea leads Portugal one to zero!

649
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,642
Did we score?

650
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,732
Hey Leung Kuan Chik!

651
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,317
Come on South Korea!

652
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,820
I said Park Ji-sung can score a goal

653
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,865
I played football for 20 years

654
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,366
Hey Leung Kuan Chik!

655
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,493
Give me a box of raw squid!

656
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,829
Come on South Korea!

657
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,582
Come on South Korea!

658
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,500
In our business strategy

659
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,838
Dad has always been Park Ji-sung
Mum has always been Huss Hiddink

660
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,506
Tell me the truth

661
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,343
Who is Jeju Island's top squid expert?

662
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,428
Those people from the peninsula don’t know anything!

663
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,514
They tried to run a seafood restaurant but failed.

664
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:06,185
For them, squid is just a side dish.

665
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,813
They can do without squid
But for us the squid is the star

666
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,441
Squid is our striker, our Ahn Jung-hwan

667
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,570
- Is that Kuan-sik's wife?
- right

668
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,822
Captain, take your squid franchise

669
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,075
Give us

670
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:25,120
Tell me how much you plan to pay.

671
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,914
We can't give you much now.

672
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,415
Oh my god, come on.

673
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,127
Even if you beg us later
We don't want your squid either.

674
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,587
It will be too late then!

675
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,007
She is really powerful and picky

676
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,967
Kuanzhi was defeated by her, right?

677
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,095
Isn't it obvious? He loses every time

678
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,056
Why is it you who came to discuss Kuanzhi and not him?

679
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,643
Their family is run by women.

(Gold, Silver and Copper Restaurant

681
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,064
Don't beat around the bush with me

682
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,233
Just say yes or no

Whether you buy Samsung Electronics
Is it 300,000 or 3 million won...

685
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,243
It all depends on your personal judgment

686
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,206
In fact, Mr.

687
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,043
I have two more people to meet later.

688
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,838
If you don't choose me

689
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,632
I'll go dig for other treasures.

690
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,844
Make them the best in the industry

691
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,972
I will surpass your predecessors

692
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,515
Oh my god

693
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,643
I believe it will succeed

694
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,105
It’s not just about making changes
Redefine the entire industry

695
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,524
Why is your company's name...

696
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,986
This is because of my mom

697
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,949
My mom is my inspiration

"Jeju Island duty-free shops will be open to domestic customers"

701
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,549
Even Koreans can
Did you buy cigarettes at the Jeju Duty Free Shop?

702
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,885
Is it appropriate for you to talk like that?

703
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,429
No, every time I go to Seoul

704
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,432
They always ask me to bring cigarettes from the duty free shop

705
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,977
Gu Mahjong and Li Sanmei said they could buy anything there

706
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,104
It's Gu Mi-jeong and Lee Sun-mi

707
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,650
I never thought I could get any benefit from the government.

More tourists means
People at the resort will order our takeaway

709

Today the crew at the motel
Didn't you call?

710
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,619
Maybe they ordered from somewhere else.

711
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:31,246
What on earth were they filming on Jeju Island?

712
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,374
They said that guy would be in there

713
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,127
The one with beautiful teeth

714
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,216
That's right! Lee Byung-hun

715
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,593
Lee Byung Hun

716
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:48,347
(Unlimited refills of squid soup for dine-in customers)

717
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,349
They keep taking free kicks

718
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,143
Yes, if you don't order takeout.

719
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:57,064
You can get a 10% discount if you dine in the restaurant

720
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,359
Yes, 10% off.

721
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,902
Come in!

722
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,364
This must be Byung-hun's favorite
Here is his signature

723
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,907
Here are his photos

724
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,617
Have to speak Japanese again?

725
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,118
Please wait

726
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,870
Please wait

727
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,956
I want to know where he sits.

728
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,040
This side

729
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,124
This way?

730
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:19,503
Someone is selling restaurant chairs on the second-hand forum

731
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,671
Should we buy some?

732
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,799
Do we really need it?

733
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,677
At that time, the second-hand forum was just starting to take off.

734
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,594
Hey!

735
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,181
Hey family!

736
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,392
Really? "Hey, family"?

737
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,602
Why don't you watch your kids running around?

738
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,730
Who would have thought of a second-hand forum?
Associated with another name?

739
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,648
Zhelong

740
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,277
Zhelong!

741
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,405
They caught Park Cheol-yong!

742
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,031
Oh my god!

743
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,367
They found the powder-green sandware!

744
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,998
Hey who would buy something worth 70 million won?

745
00:47:56,081 --> 00:48:00,836
He can't sell it.
Foolishly put it on a second-hand forum

746
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,257
So the pink sandware is mine?

747
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,552
Damn it!

748
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,511
right

749
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:10,971
right

750
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,514
Who are you?

751
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,142
It's fate.

752
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,435
who?

753
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,777
In this season

754
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,906
Kindness finally pays off

755
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,744
She is like a white dove

756
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,799
I came to Jeju Island just to eat this

757
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,595
The squid soup here is my comfort

758
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,349
This bowl of soup gave me a new lease of life

759
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,522
Is she a regular?

760
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,565
I've never seen her

761
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,694
Senior, can you say that slogan again?

762
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,864
Director, we have already agreed not to do that.

763
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,366
I just wanted to take a picture just in case.

764
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,327
bring it on

765
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,703
Let me say

766
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,751
Selling soup!

767
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,252
Is this ok?

768
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,133
She's still so awesome.

769
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,184
(Selling soup!
Squid Soup at Gold, Silver and Copper Restaurant

770
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,978
(I recommend this store Zheng Meiren)

771
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,533
You must like squid.
I've never seen you eat like this.

772
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,619
- I don't eat seafood
- What?

773
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,998
You go out and smoke a cigarette
How to get to the next place?

774
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:02,874
OK

775
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,383
Meiren, I hope you can be honest with me.

776
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,761
I don't care whether you went to Macau for plastic surgery or not.

777
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,346
Just don't lie to me

778
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,185
Is there nothing going on between you and that man?

779
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,147
Will it not cause me trouble later?

780
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,065
- Hey
- No?

781
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,401
If nothing, why am I here?

782
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,319
Have you considered me?

783
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,655
I have to raise my kids with dollars

784
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,201
That's the man paying you.

785
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,705
Because of that man
You can wear a Rolex now

786
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,504
I wanted to die when the scandal came out

787
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,427
But I think if I died of carbon monoxide poisoning
Photos of the remains will be released

788
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,344
(Resident ID card)

789
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,431
Falling from a height, people will stare at me

790
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:08,065
So I got on a fishing boat

791
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,318
Give

792
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,751
Yuling once said she wanted to hang herself

793
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,378
But I decided to shave my legs first

794
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,298
I thought it was ridiculous to shave my legs, so I gave up.

795
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,217
She didn't lie

796
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:41,389
I have no attachment to my life
Even dogs don't want to live like this

797
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,685
But that man saved me

798
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,189
I must be crazy

799
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,651
I heard people and ambulances.

800
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,696
But even then I just wanted to cover my face

801
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,826
But that man

802
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,080
Took off my coat and covered my face

803
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,334
That was the first time in my life

804
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:10,836
Zheng Meiren

805
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,548
Everyone wants to expose me, who will cover up for me?

806
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,424
(garbage)

807
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,344
Hey man what's this banana milk

808
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,640
I can't forget what he did for me.
So I went to see him

809
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,225
Oh my god

810
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,852
He can buy all the pork if he wants.

811
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,687
It's a secret ballot anyway.

812
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,648
They will eat but not vote for him

813
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,441
They will all vote for Aichun

814
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,612
He lives like a human being

815
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,512
Don't you recognize me?

816
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:07,058
I won the Best Supporting Actress award yesterday
Playing a fisherman's wife

817
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,897
I'm doing well now

818
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,442
Is there anything I can do for you in return?

819
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,195
Nothing, don't worry.

820
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,740
I told you already

821
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,410
Life isn't that bad after all.

822
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,120
Worth living

823
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:31,291
I really want to repay you for saving my life

824
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,252
Give me a chance

825
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,759
I am doing well now

826
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,013
It's not luck

827
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,557
It's the reward of kindness

828
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,352
What if the man has a fight with his wife?

829
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,187
Anyone would find it strange, right?

830
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,439
Why did Zheng Meiren suddenly appear?

831
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,359
- His wife might know.
- I don't think so.

832
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:02,364
There are some things men try not to tell their partners

833
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,281
That's right

834
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,577
These things will determine a man's fate in his later years

835
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,289
Why are you looking at me when you talk?

836
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,214
See? I was right.

837
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,883
I told you she came to thank you a few years ago.

838
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,970
You have said it countless times

839
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,680
You must be very proud.

840
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,599
I saved a star.

841
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,686
How interesting, who doesn't think so?

842
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,278
Look how sloppy Shangji has become.

843
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,989
Look how dirty his collar is.

844
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:47,200
You reap what you sow.

845
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,578
One that has never wavered in any storm

846
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:54,541
Another one flutters in the wind like an inflatable man

847
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,876
How could their old age be the same?

848
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:05,051
(So-called “silver divorces” increased by 18%)

849
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,140
These shoes are nice

850
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,436
Very light. This is what the Maasai should wear.

851
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,577
Where did you buy it from?

852
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,830
I don't know what they give me, I wear it.

853
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,791
Did they buy you shoes?

854
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,710
My wife and children sometimes

855
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,852
You eat something before you go.

856
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,021
I can go home for dinner

857
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,357
Since no one's home, let's eat here.

858
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,527
Your stomach is like this because you keep eating ramen...

859
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,032
You should get a haircut.

860
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,368
Not having much hair is no excuse for not getting a haircut

861
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,541
Well, thank you for inviting me, Arigato.

862
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,543
Say thank you

863
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,505
Aren't you supposed to fulfill your responsibilities as a father?

864
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,594
Eat before leaving

865
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,354
(The bride's husband, Jung-sook
Daughter of husband Sang-gil and Park Young-ran)

866
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:44,776
Don't do this to him.
He still fulfilled his father's responsibilities.

867
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,654
I admit that he gave us white rice.

868
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,447
No, I'm talking about Zhelong.

869
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,951
I think Dad caught him.

870
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,955
No amount of money can be removed

871
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,165
The nail you hammered into your child's heart

872
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,584
Do you think you're the only one thinking about this?

873
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:06,714
I've thought about it too, and I think further than you!

874
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,844
I know you work day and night

875
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,972
But in the busy
You can still prioritize

876
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,600
The Chief Detective couldn't even do that?

877
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,770
Spend money to get him out?
Reconciliation is the best option

878
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,940
Isn't that just a direct confession?

879
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:27,777
Whoever commits a crime will be punished
Why should the victim be made to bear the brunt of the blame?

880
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:31,072
Even if he pays to settle, people will still talk about him.

881
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,283
As if he was a thief with a criminal record

882
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,871
Although he is your son-in-law, you said you would not see him.

883
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,622
I know that kid.

884
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:44,085
Yinming doesn't have the courage to do that kind of thing

885
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,589
After he was beaten several times by Wu Cheng and Han Yin

886
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,925
I don't even dare to take the bus that passes by our house.

887
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,143
Hello

888
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:03,730
Wu Cheng, don't go to that casino.
I won't turn a blind eye anymore

889
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,691
Bow, idiot

890
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:07,942
He is your uncle!

891
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,320
No, no need to bow.

892
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,738
Hey give me

893
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,744
Oh my god, this thing...

894
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,248
You know this is...

895
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:26,503
Deer antler

896
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,963
It's really okay. Take it back.

897
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,131
Take it

898
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,674
- etc
- Seriously!

899
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,092
Don't move

900
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:37,222
I have to take care of my eldest brother's health
Otherwise who will take care of it?

901
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,476
alright

902
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:50,985
You know

903
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,489
The actor I respect most is Choi Bok-am

904
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:57,575
A search squad leader who works tirelessly for the country

905
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,161
Catching a thief is a piece of cake, right?

906
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,378
I am Fu Shangji from Dodong-ri

907
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,965
It would be okay even if you swallowed it all in one gulp, right?

908
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:15,843
that…

909
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,096
Oh my god!

910
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:21,891
You really are a father.

911
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,062
Every father will do his best for his children.

912
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,566
I've been a captain, a president, and a father

913
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:34,153
But being a father has the worst rewards

914
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,490
- Open your mouth.
- No

915
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,826
Open your mouth. I wrapped this roll specially for you.

916
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,037
- All right
- Don't eat from my hand!

917
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:47,542
Hyun-sook asks you to pay to save her husband

918
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,460
You flatly refused

919
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,630
I lost my feelings for you then.

920
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,841
So you bought an Azera with my money?

921
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,050
Hey Shangji

922
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,885
Take your car away and we'll talk.

923
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,805
You said you'd never give up
Then why give up Park Cheol-yong?

924
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:01,889
("Never give up")

925
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:06,227
Who parked the car in front of the police station?
Stop like this?

926
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,396
I know what's going on!

927
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:13,735
Looks like you got the money.
So you're kicking our deal?!

928
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,528
I did my best in my investigation...

929
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,781
- Is he the Jailbreak King or Jean Valjean?
- Why mention Jean Valjean?

930
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,326
Why can't you catch him?
That's because you didn't investigate deeply enough!

931
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,202
Now is the era of globalization

932
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,247
In the Internet age, you can't even catch him?

933
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,290
Have you been drinking?

934
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,667
No one feels good after losing their money and their wife

935
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,461
Yes, I have nothing now.

936
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,463
If you don't want your name in the newspaper

937
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:38,676
Even the principal and interest
Or find Park Cheol-yong!

938
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,094
Choose one

939
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,554
“Both principal and interest”?

940
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:46,351
Wow it seems Dodong Rif Sang-gi has changed now?

941
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:51,981
Screw Dodong Rif Shangji!

942
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:58,488
Do you think Zhelong found it through a second-hand forum?

943
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,615
This is ridiculous.

944
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,825
Is that Shangji’s little secret or something?

945
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,328
- He keeps things to himself.
- What?

946
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,413
About you dancing around?

947
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,462
I used to go to nightclubs like you...

948
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:16,673
Dance to survive

949
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,384
Every time I come home late

950
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,554
I'll look through the crack in the door.
Is Dad asleep in the living room?

951
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:27,684
No matter whether his daughter comes back or not
He fell asleep as soon as he lay down

952
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,018
No, he didn't.

953
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,812
I saw him once

954
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,147
He heard the door open.

955
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,776
Just turn off the TV and pretend to sleep

956
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,404
Now think about it

957
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,493
Maybe it's because Dad is a coward.

958
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,831
That's why I yell
But he won't fight a losing battle.

959
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,668
I think Dad is just a little scared

960
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:57,547
We might actually leave.

961
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,635
Damn, seriously.

962
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,889
Whether I see him or not, he's always in the way.

963
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:18,192
Time turns everything in front of us into watercolor

964
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,154
Blurred resentment

965
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,282
Softened the heart

966
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,743
Those damn idiots

967
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:30,246
They grew up eating white rice.
I never bought these.

968
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,582
These days

969
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,418
I live on instant rice.

970
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,170
Come back tomorrow.

971
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,172
Do you think I'm that idle?

972
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,049
I have a place to eat

973
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:45,136
Why don't you come to help your relatives?

974
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,556
We might get rich on TV.

975
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,308
Becoming a millionaire overnight

976
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,770
Hey people are starting to flock to

977
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,980
If the food is not good, all is for naught

978
01:02:56,063 --> 01:03:00,985
Dream of getting rich overnight?
With this mentality, you are doomed.

979
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,321
- Can you put it nicely?
- Why would I do this?

980
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,655
So are you coming?

981
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,451
You mean

982
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,703
Do you need me?

983
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,248
Come on, you don't know
What happened in our family recently?

984
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,344
The eight dwarfs began to gather

985
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,932
In an abandoned building in the forest

986
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,450
Drink this first

987
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,285
All right

988
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,538
Yinming took this

989
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,085
finally…

990
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,924
Bells began to ring deep in the forest

991
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:56,887
(“If you can’t do it, forget it
We are always behind you")

992
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:06,063
