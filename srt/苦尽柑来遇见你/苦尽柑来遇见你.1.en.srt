00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,544
He says it's my fault
Oh Jong-gu is at the bottom of his class.

174
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,505
The yellow croaker
isn't even the worst part.

175
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,883
It's how he treats me at the table.

176
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,260
It's not fair.

177
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,512
I'm so sad that I can hardly eat.

178
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,598
Every time I'm there,

179
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,349
I just get too choked up.

180
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,061
Please, Mom,
can I just live here with you?

181
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,605
Can I?

182
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,732
Maybe someday?

183
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,111
-Never, ever?
-What are you choked up for anyway?

184
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,362
Did you do something wrong?

185
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,115
How do you expect anyone to love you
acting like that?

186
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,951
Go.

187
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,869
Go!

188
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,955
Learn how to defend yourself. Figure out
some way to make them love you.

189
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,042
Well, what do you know?
Sun-ae is here again.

190
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,376
Ae-sun, not Sun-ae!

191
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,586
Are you an idiot?

192
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,296
Ae-sun, right.

193
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,006
[chuckles] Staying for dinner?

194
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,342
No, I'm going home.

195
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,427
[gentle acoustic guitar music playing]

196
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,396
[sighs]

197
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,316
[Ae-sun's mom] That little brat.

198
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,531
Daddy. Have some water.

199
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,283
Thanks. [sighs]

200
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,619
She's always such a pain in the ass.

201
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,665
[young Ae-sun]
<i>Cigarettes can kill you, Mom.</i>

202
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,585
<i>Haenyeo </i>rely on their lungs.
You must have a death wish.

203
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,554
[Ae-sun's stepdad]
<i>Why don't you just let her live with us?</i>

204
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,808
For one thing,
she'd be much better off here.

205
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,017
Surely you see that.

206
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,522
[Ae-sun's mom] You do nothing for your
own family, so mind your own business.

207
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,149
We don't have the money
or space to raise her.

208
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,652
This tiny hut we rent
is too small as it is.

209
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,697
You blame a child for wanting
to feel her mother's embrace?

210
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,659
[scoffs] Why do you care?
You prefer her to a cow.

211
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,994
You want her to look after
her half-siblings?

212
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,372
She'll always be family to you.

213
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,335
Look, the only reason we're living here
is so you can be close to her.

214
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,630
She's over practically every day
whenever she has the chance.

215
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,760
She can't wait to live here with you,
but you insist on keeping her there.

216
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,096
You're just setting her up for heartache.

217
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,599
The Oh family has money. At least there,
she'll get a proper education.

218
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,186
What's the point of letting a girl get
an education? It'll just frustrate her.

219
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,272
-Oh!
-[sighs]

220
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,817
Don't <i>haenyeo </i>start learning
how to dive when they're teenagers?

221
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,736
Would you say that about
your own daughter?

222
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,863
Is that the kind of life you want for her?

223
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,454
You damn island women
will pick a fight over anything.

224
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,956
I will never let her dive.

225
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,917
You're better off being born a cow
than a <i>haenyeo</i>.

226
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,879
I slave away every day for nothing!

227
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,214
It's unbelievable
what we're expected to endure.

228
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,717
What good would living here do her anyway?

229
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,720
She's too soft.
She'll end up being your maid.

230
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,555
Guess I'll throw this out, then.

231
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,726
Reading it would just break your heart.

232
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,729
Stop, you're crumpling it!

233
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,690
That's no way to treat a winner.
It won second place.

234
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,775
[grunts]

235
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,819
There, there.

236
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,281
I mean it.
You're better off not reading it.

237
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,746
[percussive music playing]

{\an8}GYONGGI NOODLE

239
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,223
This is an "F," kid.
"F" as in you're a fool.

240
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,368
That kid must have a death wish too.

241
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,961
[man] I only bought five.

242
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,963
There's an extra one for free.

243
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,673
Did your mom say that?

244
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,094
Well, did she?

245
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,515
You have six people in your family,
but for some reason, you only buy five.

246
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,934
Think you're rich enough
to give 'em away, is that it?

247
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,477
Mind your own business.

248
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,396
[sighs]

249
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,022
He's so annoying.

250
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,691
Yi-suk.

251
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,859
-Huh?
-Here.

252
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,818
Yeah?

253
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,447
Ae-sun, start with the pot.
Wash the pot first.

254
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,534
Oh. What? What is that woman doing?

255
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,663
[uneasy percussive music playing]

256
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,589
[dog barking in distance]

257
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,383
Here are some damn yellow croakers!

258
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,887
What is the meaning of this?
Have you gone nuts?

259
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,388
How dare you come in here and--

260
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,598
Money's tight, huh?

261
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,183
-Wh… wh… what?
-You can't afford to feed my little girl?

262
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,146
And you, mother-in-law,
isn't she a daughter of the Oh family?

263
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,857
Are you so surprised
that she takes after her father?

264
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,276
It's not just wrong.

265
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,235
It's mad!

266
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,446
Your dear son!

267
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,031
Your eldest brother!

268
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,450
Right now, he's turning in his grave!

269
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,368
I can see why
he couldn't survive your marriage.

270
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,746
How dare you come here
and blather about my brother!

271
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,081
[screaming]

272
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,169
You must be possessed by a demon
or God-knows-what.

273
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,547
You blame me for my husband's death,
is that it?

274
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,925
Don't you feel sorry for her?

275
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,010
The girl who lost her father?

276
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,058
That's it. I'm taking my daughter now.

277
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,688
Damn you, making her do your dishes.

278
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,066
How dare you!

279
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:04,296
I'm glad they never gave me any croaker
'cause I get to live with you now.

280
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,091
You like me that much, huh?

281
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,137
What's my secret?

282
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,472
You're my mom.

283
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:14,932
Goodness.

284
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,559
I like you because you're my mom.

285
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,103
Why would you ask that?

286
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,938
You like me so much?

287
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,439
Better grow up.

288
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,525
'Cause every day,

289
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,528
I'll be expecting my hundred won.

00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,939
How did I get so lucky?

313
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,574
[Ae-sun's stepdad] Told you so.

00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,369
[upbeat melodic music playing]

315
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,135
Give me 100 won every single day,
and I won't have to dive.

316
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:18,931
That way,

317
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,892
I'll have all day
to spend with my daughter.

318
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,354
You see why it was second place?

319
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,189
Judges must have been blind.

320
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,024
You didn't like it?

321
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,818
They only gave it second place?

322
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,986
They should've made it first!

323
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,882
Don't mistreat her.

If you do,
your ass will be out on the street.

325

My dear, you have no luck with husbands,
but your children are another story.

326

Oh, this little brat.

327
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,269
The worst brat of all brats.

328
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,729
Still a pain in the ass.

329
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,440

any day of the week.

[both groan]

331
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,447
My father and mother
were up to their ears in debt.

332
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,658
My first husband was bedridden.

333
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,369
And my second husband's a deadbeat.

334
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,330
I've accepted it.
It was my destiny to bear all that weight.

335

All anyone did was
climb onto my back to be carried.

This tiny thing.

337
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,006
She keeps climbing down.

338
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,718
She keeps asking
to share some of the burden.

[sighs]

340
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,183
And that makes her a brat, um,

341
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,270
because that's the thing
that breaks my heart more than anything.

342
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,564
[Ae-sun's stepdad] Just you wait. [sighs]

00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,359
That brat will be taking care of you
long into the afterlife.

344
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,822
My goodness. I'm a worthless mother
who wouldn't even dare to dream.

345
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,700
[sniffles]

346
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,577
I can't leave her yet.

347
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,621
I wanna be around

348
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,958
to see the day
when the world praises her as a scholar.

349
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,252
[grunts]

350
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,464
She'll be the next Han Seok-bong one day,
mark my words.

351
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,466
Our Ae-sun.

352
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,220
If any of us can make
something of our lives, it's her.

353
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,264
[uplifting piano music playing]

354
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,519
{\an8}THE FIFTH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION

355
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,774
[young Ae-sun crying]

356
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,486
[Ae-sun's mom] Oh my, do you realize that,
thanks to you, I have a new title now?

357
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,823
You, being VP of your class,
makes me a VP's mother.

358
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,533
Let's celebrate with rice cakes.

359
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,328
[young Ae-sun] Who said
I wanted to be vice president?

360
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,996
The whole fishing industry is like that.

361
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,666
Behind every captain
is a vice captain ready to lead.

362
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,669
If everyone's on top,
then who's vice president?

363
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,255
The second-in-command has more influence.

364
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,508
Who would wanna be second-in-command?

365
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,635
I've never even been a hall monitor.

366
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:05,430
I want "Ae-sun, voted vice president"
written in the family history book.

367
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,642
Don't write that down.
Don't you dare write that down!

368
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,395
You know, I thought Oh Ae-sun
was actually voted president.

369
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,563
Uh-huh, I'm sure she was.

370
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,400
You just make sure to serve
your president well, then.

371
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:20,195
Ae-sun got 37 votes,
Lee Man-ki only got 28.

372
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,197
So why is Lee Man-ki class president?

373
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,199
Why do I have to be vice president?

374
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,201
My presidency was stolen!

375
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,828
"It was stolen"?

376
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,331
CLASS PRESIDENT ELECTION
OH AE-SUN, LEE MAN-KI

377
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,334
[teacher] Don't you think
you're being a little selfish here?

378
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,837
I don't get it. I got 37 votes.

379
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,341
Honestly, you have some nerve, young lady.

380
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,846
Didn't you eat the cream buns
Man-ki's father handed out?

381
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,726
And haven't we all enjoyed the floors
waxed with the candles he gave us?

382
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,521
But I still got 37 votes.

383
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,443
I say it was unethical of them
to not vote for Man-ki

384
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,069
after taking the stuff he gave them.

385
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,656
A real leader needs to have it all. Eh?

386
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,868
Both the material aspect,
as well as the moral.

387
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:08,785
You know?

388
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,079
But I got 37 votes.

389
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,708
Who cares how many votes you got?
You may as well have a hundred!

390
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,792
Because in the real world,

391
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,128
it doesn't matter a bit
who gets more votes!

392
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,838
I'm sorry, but between you and Man-ki,

393
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,843
there's a certain something
that just matters more. Understand?

394
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,844
[sniffles]

395
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,351
It'll be embarrassing for you
to get kicked out.

396
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,810
There's no shame in just resigning.

397
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,812
It's for the greater good.

398
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,148
Sometimes you have to lose to win.

399
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,984
[young Ae-sun crying]

400
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,195
A loser is still a loser.

401
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,114
And nothing I do will change that!

402
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,699
Why is this happening to me?

403
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,034
It's not fair!

404
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,410
Oh, cut it out!

405
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,287
Why are you chasing that crap?

406
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,748
Look at the posters of the men
running for office.

407
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,875
They're all going bankrupt for nothing.

408
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,877
[young Ae-sun] But the presidency is mine!

409
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,880
Give me back my presidency!

410
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,757

[grunts]

415
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,572
After that fit you threw,
I thought you'd never come see us again.

416
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,325
You know, if I'm being completely honest,

417
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,036
your household needs a rude awakening.

418
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,205
Did they want a daughter-in-law or a cow?

419
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,833
I mean, really, how the hell
are you gonna plow this field?

420
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,042
Well, I can't pay you.

421
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,210
[sighs]

422
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,715
Uh, will you just go? Go on!

423
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,677
My mother-in-law
would kill me if she found out.

424
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,555
Besides, you can just run away.

425
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,391
I'm afraid my ghost will be
haunting that family forever.

426
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,269
I can plow this for you
and get all the sesame as well.

427
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,937
I swear, I can't pay.

428
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,858
What, you don't believe me? Just look.

429
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,859
I have nothing.

430
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,070
Yes, you do. You know what I mean?

431
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,029
[chuckles]

432
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,574
-Huh?
-Do whatever you want with me.

433
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,868
Nothing will change the fact
that I'm penniless, okay?

434
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,370
Please. I don't want cash.

435
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,331
I'm after the… thing.

436
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,666
Uh…

437
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,419
Y… Y… You know.

439
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,007
No way. Impossible.

440
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,634
Why not? Why not?

441
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,054
I'll plow the whole field for you.
And harvest all the rest too.

442
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,265
I'm doing all this.
You could at least let me borrow it.

443
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,351
There's no way in hell.
I don't even wear it. It's so pricey.

444
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,773
Listen, in just two days,
I'll plow this entire field.

445
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,110
We can pretend you borrowed a cow
or something, all right?

Come on.
Who lends their wedding jewelry out?

448
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,744
You should have asked for something
when you remarried.

449
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,164
Don't you know me by now?
I work harder than a cow.

[Ae-sun's mom]
A loyal family. Yeah, right.

456
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,368
You think a child wrote this?

457
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,703
Obviously,
the parents did the whole thing.

458
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,871

459
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,498
Hey.

460
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,333
Come look at these.

461
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,919
This one is clearly the best, hmm?

462
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,838
Who cares about the gold frame?

463
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,800
This one here is much better written.
Don't you agree?

464
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,511
[scoffs] Well, I see.

465
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,514
The general's son's always first, hmm?

466
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,849
The general's son
gets to be class president?

467
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,519
We all have to bow down
to the general's son?

468
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,729
Ho-ho! We'll see about that!

469
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,772
[scoffs]

470
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,232
[teacher] Excuse me, ma'am?

471
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,192
Are you Ae-sun's aunt?

475
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:36,219
So… I'm not Ae-sun's aunt.

476
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,971
I'm her mother.

477
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,849
Oh, oh. Oh, of course.

478
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,810
She's always had a mom, just so you know.

479
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,604
Yes, right.

480
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,689
I was so busy making a living,

481
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,191
I never had the chance to visit you.

482
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,654
I brought along some rice cakes
for you to share with the students.

483
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,282
Hmm, you shouldn't have.

485
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,869
Actually, I brought these for a reason.

486
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,958
My daughter is
a very "presidential" vice president.

[jaunty music playing]

490
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,554
What did my teacher say?
Did he admit I won?

491
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,264
Did he say I could be president again?

492
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,018
You got angry, didn't you?

493
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,479
Did you make a scene
like you did at Grandma's place?

494
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,689
I made a scene, all right.

495
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,900
He'll think twice
before opening his mouth.

496
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,446
Yes, well, the students and I
will enjoy these…

497
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,740
Uh, my child is in your care,

498
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,826
and… and I'm just trying
to make a decent living.

499
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,080
Of course.
I have 70 students in this class.

500
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,541
They're always so hungry,
as you can imagine.

501
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,836
So I'm not sure this will be enough
to share with everyone.

502
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,757
Well, I'm sure that all their parents
feel the same way I do.

503
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,134
Please, if you would,

504
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,512
take kindly to my daughter.

505
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,639
Does it make a difference
if I take kindly to her?

506
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,349
Every child has to earn it. Hmm.

507
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,976
The rice cakes might not be enough,

508
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,815
but surely, every parent on earth wants
their child to be loved by their teacher.

509
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,110
Uh, if I could have,

510
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,570
I would have brought a cow for you

511
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,322
if I had one.

512
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,076
But I got you these.

513
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,994
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

514
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,331
Ae-sun's teacher should keep
his feet warm. That's what I thought.

515
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,669
Nylon. They're nylon.

516
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,047
[sighs]

517
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,425
[chuckles]

518
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,637
[accordion music playing]

519
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,895
[sighs]

520
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,693
[chuckles]

521
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,695
She has manners.

522
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,821
[laughs]

523
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,949
[exhales sharply]

524
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,369
That's too much. She shouldn't have.

525
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,664
Did she go out of her way
to stop by the bank?

526
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,166
These are new bills.

527
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,627
[young Ae-sun] Why are you so dressed up?

528
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,963
[Ae-sun's mom] Because I didn't want
to smell like the sea.

529
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,507
I was always taught
to show my teachers respect,

530
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,594
so I didn't want me
or the rice cakes to smell salty.

531
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,139
Listen to your teacher.
It's the only way to get ahead.

532
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,099
Wouldn't it be great to make a living

533
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,643
sitting at a desk,
writing like your teacher does?

534
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,396
But he's not giving
my presidency back, is he?

535
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,192
He wants you to buy him something,
right? Like a broom?

536
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,279
Well, that's the "material" part, I guess.

537
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,574
You know, I've been thinking,
and vice president is better.

538
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,285
My title might have the word "vice"
in front of it,

539
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,454
but it's basically the same role.

540
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:53,374
I don't lead the class in the morning bow.
But otherwise, it's the same job.

541
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,710
When Lee Man-ki says, "Attention, bow,"

542
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,670
I say it to myself under my breath.

543
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,090
Honestly, vice president is better.

544
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,176
[gentle acoustic guitar music playing]

545
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,889
Ae-sun, your mom is not wealthy,

546
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,849
but you are you, okay?

547
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,893
Don't ever back down.

548
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,061
If you want it,

549
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,979
go and get it.

550
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,399
I won't back down if you won't, Ma.

551
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,820
When I'm all grown up,
you know the first thing I wanna do?

552
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,905
[gentle acoustic guitar music continues]

553
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,787
What's gotten into you?

554
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,831
I need to live a long life.

555
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,209
Today, my daughter promised me
that when she grows up,

556
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,711
she'll buy me a pearl necklace.

557
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,588
I can't miss out on that.

558
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,091
Oh boy. In which lifetime?

559
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,094
[Ae-sun's mom] Children grow up
before you know it.

560
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,847
I'll have my pearl necklace
in the blink of an eye.

561
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:53,393
It's not just children who grow up fast.
Before you know it, we'll be old too.

562
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,436
I just read it in the news.

563
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,439
The average life expectancy
of Koreans is 52.

564
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,774
I'm gonna beat that.

565
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,403
I'll be 70, enjoying all the rewards
that come with it.

566
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,280
And, you know, once I get there,

567
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,741
the little pain I'm in now,
it'll be laughable.

568
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,993
Just funny.

569
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:10,994
[laughing]

570
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,294
[feel-good music playing]

571
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,963
Hang on, but I didn't quit cigarettes.

572
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,381
You will from today.

573
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,300
[laughing]

574
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,427
Hey!

575
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,721
Very funny. Knock it off.

576
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,307
-Ah, ah, ah…
-You gotta be kidding.

577
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,517

-[bell ringing]
-[branch rustling]

586
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,023
Will you stop being so damn stubborn?

587
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,902
You can barely hold your breath.
You can't dive anymore.

588
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,695
You can all quit your nagging.

589
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,073
These walls will rot
before I let myself die.

590
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,284
[woman 5] You keep diving with
the smell the blood in your lungs.

591
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,203
You may as well dive with
a coffin on your back.

592
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,747
Death is all the same on land or sea.

593
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,749
Hey. Can't you see the Grim Reaper

594
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,709
standing right outside
your house over there?

595
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,171
He's standing there with his black cloak,
waiting for you.

596
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,591
If you go into the sea, that Grim Reaper
over there will follow you.

597
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,803
He'll peek his head under the waves
and snatch your soul right out of you.

598
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,014
If I was scared of him, I would never
have gone into the water.

599
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,933
<i>Haenyeo's </i>lives are one big gamble.

600
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,311
I've overcome death countless times
in the great blue ocean.

601
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,732
Are you just afraid?
Afraid your children will starve?

602
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,152
Gwang-rye. <i>Haenyeo </i>live and die together.

603

We'll make sure
you don't go hungry, please.

604
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,449
Enough! I won't die begging.
I'll die making another buck.

605
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,202
I won't stop
until my child has more than I had.

606
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,245
I can't die.

607
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,163
I won't die. [scoffs]

608
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,332
[woman] You know why ghosts haunt people?

609
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,837
Your regret will become anguish.
Then obsession will turn you into a ghost.

610
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,256
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
I fear for my children.

611
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,758
I will take everything I can
from the underworld

612
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,386
and give it to my children,
or I will die trying.

613
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,392
[Gyeong-ja] Well done.
She can't go diving without those clothes.

614
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,560
That little brat.

615
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,979
I should have never taken her back.

OH AE-SUN IS YANG GWAN-SIK'S WIFE
AE-SUN IS GETTING MARRIED

Just please, leave her alone!

[sobs] What's wrong with you, Dragon King?

You can't do this to her.

628

You can't do this to her.

629
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,412
My mom worked herself
to the bone her entire life.

630
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,124
She never even got on a plane.

631
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,627
I have to get her a pearl necklace.

632
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,338

What's wrong with you?

It's not fish. It's chicken.

You must be stupid.

Crying makes you hungry.

00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,521
Do you feel sorry for me?

655
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,606
Is that what all the food is about?

656
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,276
If that were true,
I would've given that to a beggar.

657
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,488
You are always so annoying.

What will happen
to her poor little children?

Hold on, am I the axe?

Are you going somewhere, Mom?

Why didn't you just wait until tomorrow?

678
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,327
If I had, the others would have stolen it.

679
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,330
You could have sold them
for a hundred won.

if I ever die…

685
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,978
leave this house immediately.

686
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,565
Go to your uncle and beg for your life.

687
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,234

[radio] <i>Things have reached</i>
<i>the point where there are calls</i>

860
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,556
<i>to crack down on the trend</i>

861
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,559
<i>They tell us to wear short clothes,</i>
<i>and now they're complaining about it?</i>

862
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,061
<i>In this broadcaster's opinion,</i>

863
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,356
<i>this is just a distraction from</i>
<i>the real problems this country is facing.</i>

864
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,857
[Gwan-sik] Would you like a cabbage?

865
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,736
The cabbage is good.
Everything over there is good.

866
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,030
[woman 5] They're all good to you,
I'm sure.

867
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,701
Gye-ok, you've got some explaining to do
about that son of yours, eh?

868
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,411
Oh, lucky me.

869
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,495
[women laugh]

870
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,707
-So how much is the cabbage?
-One for 50 won. Three for 150.

871
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,333
Huh, that's not fair.

872
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,962
It's perfectly fair for three cabbages
to be 150 if one is 50.

873
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,381
{\an8}OH AE-SUN

874
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,799
{\an8}It's just math, you know.

875
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,927
Look, miss.
I didn't ask you how to buy my cabbages.

876
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,804
I want one, not three.

877
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,558
Well, lady, I don't make much
selling cabbages as it is,

878
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:20,934
and everyone wants a lower price.

879
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,270
I beat them to the punch this way.

880
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,605
Who wants to be punched
for doing their shopping? My gosh.

881
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,525
-All right.
-There he goes.

882
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,486
-One it is.
-Saves her yet again.

883
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,946
I gave birth to a dumbass.

884
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,033
I only want one, okay? That's it.

885
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,996
Sometimes, I wonder if that girl
has hands of her own.

886
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,247
I'm not forcing him.

887
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,583
He does it because he wants to.

888
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,043
No one's making me do a thing.

889
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,171
Oh God.

890
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,131
Should've raised a stray dog instead.

891
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:52,466
Better watch out.

892
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,260
Your grandma will kill you
if she catches you together again.

893
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,679
At that age,
they think they're invincible.

894
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,848
You think they're afraid of an old lady?

[man] Chicken! My chicken!

897
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,936
[Ae-sun] Oh no.

898
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,567
Wait!

899
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,319
Out of my way!

900
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,278
Grandma!

901
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,362
Oh!

[gasps]

903
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,494
How many times have I told you
not to set up shop next to that girl?

904
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,662
Why do you keep coming
all the way out here?

905
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,665
Haven't you heard that daughters
take after their mothers? Huh?

906
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,417
I can't believe you let a girl

907
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,295
who has her mother's ghost following her
be near your baby.

908
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,047
Wake up!

909
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,507
That grandma needs Jesus.

910
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,467
I take after my dad, thank you very much!

911
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,177
Ah, you little brat, Ae-sun!

912
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,804
-Come back here, Ae-sun!
-Whoa, whoa!

913
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,806
-[woman 7] Damn you, girl!
-What did I do?

914
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,599
I told your grandson no!

915
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,936
-I said, "No, thank you." All right?
-[woman 7] Move aside.

916
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:49,147
-Just wait till I get my hands on you!
-[Gye-ok] Please, Mom. Let it go!
