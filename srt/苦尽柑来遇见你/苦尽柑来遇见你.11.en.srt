1
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,900
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,100
EMERGENCY ROOM

3
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,200
Actually,

4
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
I used to live in that room
a few years ago.

5
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,500
The window frame was a bit warped,

6
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,900
so fortunately,
I think it allowed a lot of ventilation.

7
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
Goodness, what if I'd missed it?

8
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,700
What if I had missed the flight?

9
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,300
For some reason, I wanted to come.

10
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,800
I just wanted to come.

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
You saved her, ma'am.

12
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
No.

13
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,500
Geum-myeong saved me.

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,200
Our Geum-myeong is much kinder than I am,

15
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,400
so she went easy on me.

16
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,800
I really can't go on.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,600
I really can't go on anymore.

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,300
You have to stay healthy
so you can keep Geum-myeong safe.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,700
Oh my.

20
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,900
By the way,

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,500
are you the landlord's son-in-law?

22
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, actually…

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,600
He's…

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
That's Park Geum-myeong's son.

25
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,100
Huh?

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,100
You know Park Geum-myeong's son?

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,000
Sorry?

28
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,100
Well, I didn't know whose son he was.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,900
Give me that.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What…

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,700
<i>Am I a maid dating a prince?</i>

32
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,700
You. I choose you. You.

33
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,900
Hey, keep your voice down.

34
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,100
Why are you bringing that up here?

35
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
Let's just get married. Okay?

36
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,500
Let's just get it done already!

37
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,500
Hey, my mom's here.

38
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,200
Hey, kick them out
and tell them to play elsewhere.

39
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,100
Goodness, she's all grown up.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Excuse me.

41
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,800
Have you done this yet?

42
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,100
Right.

43
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,100
Why take the ring
if you're gonna do whatever you want?

44
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,800
You took the ring, so that's it.
It's a done deal!

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Don't go. Marry me.
You have the ring on, so that's it.

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,600
Where did she manage to find
the exact same type?

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I told you to move.

48
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,200
-I don't feel well.
-I told you I didn't like that area.

49
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Have you ever inhaled gas?

50
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,200
The doctor said being nagged
would give me more headaches.

51
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,700
So why should you be inhaling gas?

52
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,400
Let's just get married and live
in an apartment with an oil boiler.

53
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,900
Who proposes with an oil boiler
instead of a diamond?

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,300
Dear me, they're just talking on and on
without any shame.

55
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Am I asking for something extraordinary?

56
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,800
They don't even replace the streetlights.

57
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,800
I hate that you go up and down alone.

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
You shouldn't be able
to see your breath in your bedroom.

59
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
I hate that you live in a place like that.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,900
That you don't sleep enough
'cause you sell late-night tickets.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,300
I hate that we can't call
because of your landlord!

62
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,500
Why do you do everything by yourself?
Ye-rim and Min-seon don't.

63
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
Who else…

64
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,400
Who else…

65
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,700
Don't you watch the news?

66
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,500
In the blink of an eye,
you can get in an accident and die.

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
What if you died alone from inhaling gas?

68
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,400
What if you die from something bad?

69
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,800
But I didn't die.

70
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,500
-How could I live?
-Come on.

71
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,900
You're still like this
even after the army?

72
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,300
Did you really finish your service?

73
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,600
If you die,

74
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,600
I'll die.

75
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,700
That's all I thought about in the taxi.

76
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,700
Hey.

77
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,000
Life goes on for the living.

78
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,900
So you'd live if I died?

79
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,900
I mean, barely…

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,500
I'd barely get by.

81
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,300
Stop smiling.

82
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,200
You're so cute.

83
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,200
So annoying!

84
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,300
I just inhaled a tiny bit of gas,
just a tiny bit.

85
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,600
You know my little nostrils, right?

86
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,300
I can't inhale much with these.

87
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Geum-myeong.

88
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,400
Please don't be alone.

89
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,000
Please?

90
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,700
You'll be marrying me.

91
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
You won't be marrying my mother.

92
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,600
I really will
do something about my family.

93
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,600
Ae-sun will be living with me,
not my grandmother.

94
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll keep Ae-sun safe from her.

95
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,100
I'll do whatever it takes
to handle my family.

96
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,600
You just need to get on
my mom's good side from now on.

97
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,800
Why should I?

98
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,900
I don't like your mom either.

99
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,300
My mother is soft at heart.

100
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,400
If she's so softhearted,
how could she say that to my face?

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,100
Say what to your face?

102
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,800
Oh my God, you scared me.

103
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,400
Hello, Mother.

104
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,200
Does your mother disapprove
of my daughter?

105
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,800
No, Mom. That's not what we meant--

106
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
Why would she? Why?

107
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,700
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

108
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,100
Are you really Sang-gil's daughter?

109
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah.

110
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,900
This is hilarious.

111
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
What's so funny
about her being his daughter?

112
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,800
What a devoted daughter.

113
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
You must be fulfilling
your father's wishes.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
Enough with your yapping.

115
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,200
Your mom and dad also sat across
from each other at that exact spot.

116
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,600
-Hey.
-Back when this was a café.

117
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,400
-There was coffee on the table.
-Hey!

118
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,500
They were set up on a date.
You two came so close to being siblings.

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,200
Ae-sun will kill you now.

120
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,000
What are you, Romeo and Juliet?

121
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,300
<i>-So who's the winner?</i>
-Just a bit unpolished.

122
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,600
<i>The winner for the final week</i>
<i>of December is…</i>

123
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,600
<i>Whether this grand first love would become</i>
<i>a love song or a break-up song…</i>

124
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,600
<i>The winner for the final week is…</i>

125
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,900
<i>…I didn't know back then.</i>

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,300
<i>I was just blazing with love</i>
<i>without any shame.</i>

127
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,300
What doesn't she like about Geum-myeong?

128
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,000
No, it's not like that, Mother.

129
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,700
Ms. Yang Geum-myeong's guardian.

130
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,400
-Me?
-Aren't you filling it out?

131
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,400
We need her guardian's signature.

132
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,000
Her guardian would be…

133
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,700
You rushed in
with her on your back earlier.

134
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,300
Who are you?

135
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
-Who are you and why--
-You know what?

136
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Same here.

137
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,800
I don't like you either.

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,400
<i>Tell me if they dated or not.</i>

139
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,800
Just tell me yes or no.
You're just messing with me, aren't you?

140
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,300
Are you sure you won't tell your father?

141
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,700
I won't fall for it. Where's that tiger
you said you had at home?

142
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,300
Then just forget it.

143
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,500
Shut your mouth!
Some things are better left unsaid.

144
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,000
They didn't date.

145
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,600
But they did consider marriage.

146
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Was that funny?

147
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,500
You don't think that was funny?

148
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,900
THREE AUNTIES'
FRESHLY PICKED BY HAENYEO

149
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,000
Aren't you going to fix your mop?
You off to a farm or what?

150
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Father.

151
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,500
Are you happy?

152
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,800
Do you think your hair looks cool?

153
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,200
Just shave your head.
I'll give you 50,000 won if you do.

154
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
THIS IS NOT TRASH

155
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,100
THIS IS MY PRIDE I'VE THROWN AWAY FOR YOU

156
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,400
COME BACK TO ME, YEM

157
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,300
HYEON-SUK LOVES YOU FOEVER

158
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,100
26 MONTHS OR 26 YEARS
I PROMISE I WILL WAIT

159
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,500
Do they really not hit people
in the army anymore?

160
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,500
-Did Cheol-yong tell you that?
-Why come along if you're gonna cry?

161
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,500
Seriously.

162
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,800
You should've just gone to college.

163
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,400
<i>This year, the College Scholastic Test</i>
<i>replaces the Academic Ability Exam,</i>

164
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,000
<i>causing ongoing confusion for students.</i>

165
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,200
<i>The new exam focuses on reasoning</i>
<i>rather than memorization.</i>

166
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,800
<i>This has increased the number</i>
<i>of students falling behind.</i>

167
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,200
How can they expect kids
who can't walk to run?

168
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,900
If they change things randomly,
how will the fools get into college?

169
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,400
<i>The army?</i>

170
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,900
He left suddenly.

171
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,200
Wait, he hasn't been to the army yet?

172
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,700
He looks like he's been
to the Korean War, right?

173
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,500
But it turned out our Picasso was 28.

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,900
The soju and popcorn are for the boss,

175
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,000
and we can take anything else we want.

176
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,900
The popcorn too?

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,700
Is someone stopping him or something?
Why did he leave without a word?

178
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,500
I can't eat all of this.

179
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,900
-It's too much.
-We've known each other for years.

180
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,700
Now that you're leaving, too,
you two won't see each other again.

181
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,600
Still, we might run into…

182
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,800
You won't see him.

183
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,500
Maybe in the next life, not in this one.

184
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,700
They say you need countless lifetimes
of fate to meet even once in this life.

185
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,500
If you miss it when it brushes past,
that's the end.

186
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,900
But he rushed in with me on his back.

187
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,300
NEVER LET YOUR GUARD DOWN
NEVER LET THEM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT

188
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,500
AND NEVER FALL IN LOVE
THE BODYGUARD

189
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,200
People from Seoul are heartless.

190
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,200
<i>In the year all of my windows</i>
<i>swayed like waves…</i>

191
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,900
<i>The 1993 KBS Korean Music Awards.</i>

192
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,700
<i>The grand prize.</i>

193
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,500
<i>Kim Soo-hee for "Sad Love"!</i>

194
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
<i>…Kim Soo-hee beat Seo Taiji.</i>

195
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
<i>The fall storm beat the spring frenzy.</i>

196
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:44,900
<i>The eventful year of 1993</i>
<i>is finally coming to a close.</i>

197
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,000
<i>Who could withstand the storm</i>
<i>that blows within one's fist-sized heart?</i>

198
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,800
Don't you recognize me?

199
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,300
<i>Fall was fall.</i>

200
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,400
<i>Spring was spring.</i>

201
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,300
How am I supposed to sell this?

202
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,500
<i>So it was a season</i>
<i>where the wind never rested.</i>

203
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,500
At least I'd like to think so.

204
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,000
<i>And so it was a life</i>
<i>where the heart never settled.</i>

205
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,500
<i>Though I'm poor</i>

206
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,500
<i>I loved the beautiful Natasha</i>

207
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,000
<i>So tonight, the snow whumps down</i>

208
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,500
You saw that too.

209
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,200
Did you write that
because you like the poem?

210
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,800
No, I just…

211
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,000
You have a girlish sentiment.

212
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,400
You know,

213
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,000
a poem can even make
poverty seem picturesque.

214
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,400
There's nothing cool about being broke,

215
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
but poetry makes it seem somewhat cool.

216
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,900
Well,

217
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,500
things like painting…

218
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,800
I couldn't paint even if I wanted to.

219
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,300
Making money off your talent

220
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
is something not everyone can do.

221
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,300
So,

222
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,900
Mr. Park Toto, you're not poor,

223
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,400
and more importantly,
that Natasha of yours isn't beautiful.

224
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Don't hang back for no reason.

225
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,800
I'm not sure

226
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,000
if this will help you get over her.

227
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Your Natasha,
without makeup, is just a donkey.

228
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,100
You know…

229
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
my mom asked

230
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,200
if you're planning to take the TOEFL.

231
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,900
She has… books for you.

232
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,300
If you keep pitying yourself
and saying your life sucks,

233
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,000
your life will really suck.

234
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,200
If you think you're only worth 100 won,

235
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,600
who would think you're worth 1,000 won?

236
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,600
Stop pitying yourself

237
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,400
and say something sweet to yourself
so you can stand tall.

238
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,400
You're hunched
like Master Roshi right now.

239
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,800
Do you read Dragon Ball?

240
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,600
Honestly, it's a good thing
you're not family.

241
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,300
If you were my little brother, my God,
I'd give your back a good beating.

242
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,500
You do know how to laugh.

243
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,800
Yeah, I didn't know I could either.

244
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,800
This is that tree, right?

245
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,000
The biggest tree in Korea.

246
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,000
I chose this place
because of that thing up there.

247
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,300
Up there, you'll see
the biggest Christmas tree in Korea.

248
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,900
Wow.

249
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,500
We really have seen each other
in so many embarrassing situations.

250
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,700
Ms. Yang, you're like

251
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,100
a Christmas tree.

252
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,900
A tree just does its job
no matter where you put it.

253
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,900
What's its job?

254
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,800
Whether a Christmas tree
is in a room in a basement

255
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,000
or a corner store no one visits…

256
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,500
it's always sparkling.

257
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,100
It always makes your heart pound.

258
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,300
I just said it since it's today.

259
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,400
I just wanted

260
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,300
to say something sweet to you.

261
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,700
Are you leaving or something?

262
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,300
MY LOVE BY MY SIDE

263
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,600
MY LOVE BY MY SIDE
DAVICHI

264
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,900
<i>Student passenger.</i>

265
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
<i>This stop is Neung-dong Intersection.</i>

266
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,500
Ma'am. This is Neung-dong Intersection.
This is your stop!

267
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
<i>There was a time</i>
<i>when people held their heads up.</i>

268
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,800
A time when people stayed true
<i>to their hearts.</i>

269
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
KIM HYUN-SIK BEST HITS

270
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,700
<i>A time when we looked at each other,</i>
<i>not our cell phones.</i>

271
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,500
Do you like it?

272
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,600
I do.

273
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,800
When did you record all this?

274
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,800
-You like Kim Hyun-sik more than me.
-It was a joke.

275
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,100
Is work tough?

276
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,000
Is it not fun?

277
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,400
Who goes to work for fun?

278
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,300
People go for the money.

279
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,700
Are you taking the bar exam for fun?

280
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,800
Still.

281
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,900
Wasn't there something you wanted to do?

282
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,200
An office job wasn't your dream, right?

283
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,800
I've also had a dream for a long time.

284
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Being independent.

285
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,200
Living an independent life

286
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,600
is actually quite a feat.

287
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,500
<i>We constantly struggled to be independent.</i>

288
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,400
<i>From college entrance and graduation</i>
<i>to meeting the in-laws,</i>

289
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,500
<i>life has been a series</i>
<i>of parental summons.</i>

290
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,800
Let's go. Tell them I won't give her away.

291
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,100
They're almost here.
The traffic is really bad in Seoul.

292
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,900
We even took a plane to get here.

293
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,300
He should've brought his parents earlier.

294
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,400
Just how bad is the traffic?

295
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,100
Geum-myeong.

296
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,000
Why are you fussing?

297
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,200
You told me not to be like that.

298
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,800
Call it.

299
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,800
Don't be like that. Don't be.

300
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,900
Call this off.

301
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh, you must have waited a long time!

302
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,000
The traffic around here was terrible.

303
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,000
Welcome.

304
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,900
The traffic was terrible, wasn't it?

305
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,500
I hope the traffic didn't
make you feel carsick. Did it?

306
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,500
<i>Daughter was awkwardly polite that day.</i>

307
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
We're late.

308
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,600
It's okay. It's completely fine.

309
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,700
<i>Mom was the first to say it was okay</i>
<i>to someone who didn't even apologize.</i>

310
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,500
That was how
the law of gravity worked in that room.

311
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,400
I believe we've met before.
I'm Park Geum-myeong.

312
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,900
<i>That day was the first time I saw</i>
<i>how my dad shook hands.</i>

313
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,500
I'm Yang Gwan-sik,

314
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,100
Geum-myeong's father.

315
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,900
No parents can win
against their child, right?

316
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,600
I told her off.

317
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,500
If they're doing it,
just get it done quickly.

318
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,900
Dragging out a relationship
is unforgivable.

319
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,800
It's all at the girl's expense, isn't it?

320
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeong-beom isn't in a hurry, is he?

321
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,900
-Listen--
-Father.

322
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,800
Right.

323
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,300
We'd rather they get married
so he could just call her "wife."

324
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,100
It must be odd for my son
to call his girlfriend "Geum-myeong"

325
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,700
since it's my name too.

326
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,900
That name just doesn't sit right with me.

327
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Help yourselves.

328
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,900
<i>I shouldn't have. I really shouldn't.</i>

329
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,600
<i>A child definitely does</i>
<i>what it saw growing up.</i>

330
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,400
Let's eat.

331
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,800
Aren't you serving the scorched rice soup?

332
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,200
<i>I should've shown</i>

333
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,200
<i>only precious things to my precious child.</i>

334
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,800
Here, have some steamed fish.

335
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,700
<i>My heart sank as I realized</i>
<i>that I was a mirror for my child.</i>

336
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,000
The ribs here are great.

337
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,900
Yes, so we'll choose a few dates
for the wedding in Jeju and…

338
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,200
Did you not tell them?

339
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,700
Why look at Yeong-beom?

340
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,600
Mother, as I told you already--

341
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,800
It's a little embarrassing for us

342
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,400
to have two weddings.

343
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,600
There's no need to go down there
and make Yeong-beom play the monkey.

344
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,600
I understand
the island may have its own customs,

345
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,500
but Geum-myeong
will leave your family and join ours.

346
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,200
So shouldn't our family come first?

347
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,400
Anyway, let's just choose one place, then.
Would you like to have it in Jeju?

348
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,600
Then we won't do it here.

349
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,800
No, let's just have it in Seoul.

350
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,000
I suppose you are finally retiring
from household duties.

351
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,000
I doubt that.

352
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,400
Look at how she ladled your soup.

353
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
We have a long way to go, don't we?

354
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,100
She doesn't know anything.

355
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,900
I'm not sure if I can trust her
with a large household.

356
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,500
Well,

357
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,200
regarding housework,
as a working woman, it will probably be--

358
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,600
That's why I asked her to quit her job.

359
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Didn't I?

360
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Mother, can we talk about this--

361
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,500
Son, was I speaking to you?

362
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,000
Give me some scorched rice soup.

363
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,500
Sorry?

364
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,000
Of course.

365
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,200
Don't tell me you don't even know
how to ladle that soup.

366
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,600
Eldest daughters normally manage fine,

367
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,500
but Geum-myeong is a bit different.

368
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,500
As long as she can make
a good soybean paste stew.

369
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,000
Peas, I want some peas.

370
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,300
Peas, here are your peas.

371
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,600
<i>Mom never forgot the moment</i>
<i>Dad turned around that day.</i>

372
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,300
<i>She told me a hundred times</i>

373
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,800
<i>that he was probably</i>
<i>the first husband in Dodong-ri</i>

374
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,700
<i>to join his wife at the other table.</i>

375
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
I'll eat at this table from now on.

376
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,400
Why?

377
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,100
<i>Dad chose to fight his own war.</i>

378
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Why? You punk!

379
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,900
<i>He never left Mom stranded alone</i>
<i>on the battlefield.</i>

380
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,900
I also want to eat with you, Mom.

381
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,600
Dogs are better.

382
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,200
<i>In those days, Dad turning around</i>
<i>was truly revolutionary.</i>

383
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,300
<i>I realized that</i>
<i>as I ladled that scorched rice soup.</i>

384
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,500
I'll do it. I'm good at ladling too.

385
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,000
No, just sit down.

386
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,600
It's okay. Let me.

387
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,800
Give it.

388
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,900
-I can do it well.
-Please eat.

389
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,700
Your mother does everything for you,

390
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,600
so you don't know anything.

391
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Isn't that right?

392
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,300
I couldn't teach her.

393
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,900
She was so precious,

394
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,500
too dear…

395
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,200
so I chose not to teach her.

396
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,900
No, I don't want to.

397
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,800
You should give your parents a ride home.
We prefer the subway.

398
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,700
Let's just go.

399
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,200
Then how about a taxi?

400
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,400
Oh, no, no.

401
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,000
There are so many cars in Seoul.
We'll be late if there's traffic.

402
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,000
Just take a taxi, will you?

403
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,800
Take a taxi.

404
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
You managed well today. See you.

405
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,100
We'll go now.

406
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,900
Bye.

407
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,600
Bye.

408
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,900
Mother, Father, have a safe trip home.

409
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,300
Bye, Geum-myeong.
We'll call you when we get home.

410
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,100
Don't worry about a thing.

411
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,300
You do everything well. Dad knows you do.

412
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,700
Let's go! Quickly!

413
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,800
Bye. I'll call you when I get home.

414
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,000
Have a safe trip, Father.

415
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,200
My mom's crying.

416
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,800
I messed up again, didn't I?

417
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
You're so sweet.

418
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,000
You're just such a sweet boy.

419
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,600
My goodness.

420
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,900
Geum-myeong,
it turns out you're an indoor plant too.

421
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
-Mother.
-"Mother," what?

422
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,800
You interrupt me
every time I open my mouth now.

423
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,400
Why didn't you stick up for her more
in front of them?

424
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,900
Would it kill you to stay quiet for once?

425
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,600
What did I say
to make her tremble like that?

426
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,800
Too precious to teach?

427
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,000
She said that to mess with me.
Even if they begged, I'd be fuming.

428
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,800
-Mother!
-What?

429
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,000
Mother,

430
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,700
the thing is…

431
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
I am an indoor plant.

432
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
What was that?

433
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,500
I also grew up

434
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,500
in an unbelievably safe greenhouse,

435
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,100
treated as the most precious thing.

436
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
So…

437
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,400
please stop being so harsh to me.

438
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,400
It'll make my mom and dad cry.

439
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,700
Good God.

440
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,700
Did I send her to college
to make soybean paste stew?

441
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,700
She acts like she's so great around me.
Why couldn't she say a word there?

442
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,000
Why did you do that?

443
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,100
You couldn't stand it?

444
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,100
Our Geum-myeong has parents.

445
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,400
She has her family!

446
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,200
So that's what you wanted her to know?

447
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,400
You were holding back well.

448
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,000
I thought you'd throw a fit
and refuse to give your girl away.

449
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,100
I wanted to,
hundreds, maybe thousands of times.

450
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,300
But she says she likes him.

451
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,700
I held back because calling it off
might make our baby hurt.

452
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,700
It's not because she's any less than him.

453
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,400
I want to do everything for her marriage.

454
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,900
I won't let anyone say my child
couldn't even bring a silver spoon.

455
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,400
Our Geum-myeong has parents.

456
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,100
Both Mom and Dad.

457
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,000
Do it. Do it all.

458
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,200
<i>I was the boss at my house</i>

459
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,700
<i>but just a minion in theirs.</i>

460
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,600
I told you we should take a taxi!

461
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,400
My mother-in-law really hates waiting.
Seriously!

462
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,500
Is she trying to make me mad, or what?

463
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,900
Come on, run!

464
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,700
What is she, your master?

465
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,500
We have to cross now!

466
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,000
-I'm not going.
-Mom, come on!

467
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,000
I told you my feet hurt, didn't I?

468
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,000
I told you we should take a taxi,
didn't I?

469
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,000
Is she waiting
with a stopwatch or something?

470
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
So what if we're a little late?

471
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,500
They kept us waiting for an hour
at our first meeting, didn't they?

472
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,100
Come on, Mom! What is wrong with you?

473
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,500
Did you do something wrong?
Do you owe them money?

474
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,300
You act like you're the boss at home.

475
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,100
Aren't you the boss at our home?

476
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,300
Be a minion there,

477
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,000
and Mom and Dad
become the lowest of minions!

478
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,100
It's so pretty. You look beautiful.

479
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,900
You look so good in pink, you know.

480
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,300
Like you're in your thirties.

481
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,900
There's no way
I look like I'm in my thirties.

482
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,800
No way.

483
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,500
Let's go with pink, then.

484
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,400
We had another shade of pink.

485
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,100
Why did you come
if you're not going to help me choose?

486
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,000
Well…

487
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,200
What?

488
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,300
Won't you add flowers?

489
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,700
Flowers? No need.

490
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,400
You should add floral embroidery
to the pink.

491
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
I'm just worried

492
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
I might come off as over the top.

493
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Do you have another daughter?

494
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,800
This is the only time you'll sit
as the bride's mother.

495
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,700
Do whatever you want.

496
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,200
Well…

497
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,400
Actually,

498
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,500
you know
those tiny flower patterns in rows?

499
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,600
I saw it
when Cheol-yong's brother got married.

500
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,500
So you do want flowers.

501
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,400
If we cover it with flowers,

502
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,200
it will look like she's the bride.

503
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,300
Your mom is actually quite young, right?

504
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,300
Go with the previous one.
The red bean soup color.

505
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,300
But, ma'am,

506
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,100
pink is so much better than that color.

507
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,600
Is this your wedding?

508
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,700
Sorry?

509
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,100
I'll have mine with this emerald color.

510
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,500
Mother.

511
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,300
My mom likes pink.

512
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,700
Pink is tacky.

513
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,900
It's not just your guests
who will be attending.

514
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,300
What a relief that we came here together.

515
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,300
A huge relief.

516
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,900
You kept turning it down,

517
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,500
so I'd like to…

518
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,200
There's no need.

519
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
Otherwise,

520
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,900
if you could specify what you'd like,
we will--

521
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,200
I appreciate the thought.

522
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,800
But…

523
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,700
why just appreciate the thought?

524
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,700
Please don't be like that.

525
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,700
Well, if you could just…

526
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,300
Fine, then.

527
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
I'll take it.

528
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,700
Our Geum-myeong may not be
very gentle or soft-spoken…

529
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,100
but she has a deep heart.

530
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
She's also quite caring.

531
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,500
So please see her

532
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,800
in a good light.

533
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,100
I find Yeong-beom quite… endearing.

534
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,900
More than anything else,
my daughter likes him,

535
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,400
and she says he really cares about her,

536
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,100
so I've grown to like him.

537
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,500
Mrs. Oh.

538
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,800
Yes?

539
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,100
I have a condition where I might die
if I don't speak my mind.

540
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,500
Hey! Come on.

541
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Why are you so late? It's been so awkward.

542
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,000
-Why are you out here?
-Just in case you couldn't find it.

543
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,600
It's just them?

544
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,200
Yes. Why?

545
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,500
Is that a problem?

546
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,500
Look at you. Your hair's a mess.

547
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,000
Where is it? Which way?

548
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,800
-It's this way. Yes.
-This way?

549
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,700
What's wrong?

550
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,500
Is there anything a mother wouldn't say
for her child's sake?

551
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,900
I fear if I get dragged into this
without saying anything,

552
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,100
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

553
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,900
I see.

554
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,000
Mrs. Oh.

555
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,300
Please stop this wedding.

556
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,000
I've had the patience of a saint
while trying to go along with this,

557
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,200
but as a mother, you must know, right?

558
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
My Yeong-beom

559
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,200
is my life.

560
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,300
My masterpiece.

561
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,700
I'm sorry to say this,
but I don't find Geum-myeong endearing.

562
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,600
She's hard to like.

563
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,700
Do you really have to send her
to a family like this?

564
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Let's each convince our own children.

565
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,500
Whatever happens,

566
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,500
let's do our very best
to stop this once and for all.

567
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Could we?

568
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,600
What is it about Geum-myeong…

569
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
that you are so displeased with?

570
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,900
Why were you so quiet at lunch?
Do you know how uneasy Yeong-beom felt?

571
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,100
So what if he did?

572
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,700
Do you like him that much?

573
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,600
What?

574
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,000
What do you like about that boy?

575
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,100
Don't you like him?

576
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,600
-No. I don't like him.
-Why not?

577
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,000
He's hard to like.

578
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,600
Is there really
anything special about him?

579
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,300
It's not like he passed the bar exam.

580
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,300
He's got nothing and isn't any better, so…

581
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,200
What about me?

582
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,600
So what do I have?
What am I better than him at?

583
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
You think I'm less than him, too,

584
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,000
so you couldn't even say
you liked the pink hanbok.

585
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,300
No, I would never think that!

586
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Then why didn't you say anything to her?

587
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,300
-Why grovel before her?
-Because she might be cold to you!

588
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,200
I held back so she wouldn't hate you,

589
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,500
not because I thought
you were less than him.

590
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
What could you be lacking? What?

591
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,700
What a load of crap, seriously.

592
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,300
What is it?

593
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,500
Did Yeong-beom's mother say something?

594
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,200
I'm worried my child will be disliked
just sending them to kindergarten.

595
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,500
How can I act on my temper
when I'm sending you to her family?

596
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,900
Just go ahead and act on your temper!

597
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,200
So you'd better

598
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
get it together.

599
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,200
Get your act together for my sake.

600
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,500
Even a small scratch on your heart
deeply bruises both mine and your dad's.

601
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,200
<i>I was a bad brat at my house,</i>

602
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,300
<i>but a barbarian at theirs.</i>

603
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,900
<i>Everything was my fault.</i>

604
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It was you, wasn't it?

605
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,100
I told you it was my decision.
Don't I have my own thoughts?

606
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,600
Geum-myeong, do you have a house?

607
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Do you have money?

608
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,400
You thought he'd get you a house
if you wheedled him into moving out?

609
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,900
It's because you're making it hard for me.

610
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,800
How much did you roast him
to make him act like this toward me?

611
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,300
You've really got him under your thumb.

612
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,700
Mother, don't you hear me?

613
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,600
Mother.

614
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,600
I never talked to Yeong-beom
about moving out.

615
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,500
How sly and shameless.

616
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,200
<i>If I don't even flinch</i>
<i>when she pokes a little…</i>

617
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Mother, go home.

618
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,000
Who do you take after?

619
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,700
<i>…she'll inevitably cross the line.</i>

620
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,300
I thought I made myself quite clear
to your mother.

621
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,300
Does she still insist on
becoming related to me by marriage?

622
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,800
-Mother, just go home.
-Let go!

623
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,600
What did you say to my mom?

624
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
Your mother didn't even tell you?

625
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,100
She must really want to force you
into our family.

626
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,200
Mother!

627
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,300
What did you say?

628
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
I told her
we should both stop the wedding.

629
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,500
Can't I say what I must?

630
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,800
<i>That big-nosed woman.</i>

631
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,600
All her age has gone to her nose.

632
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,300
She's just worried
you'll make her look older and uglier.

633
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
It's obvious.

634
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,100
Why emerald for her
and red bean soup color for you?

635
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,600
I'd be happy to wear

636
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,400
the red bean soup-colored hanbok
a thousand times

637
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,200
as long as she treats Geum-myeong well.

638
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,600
Who in the world would hate Geum-myeong?

639
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,700
She was the teachers' favorite.
Everyone ends up liking her.

640
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,600
That elementary school teacher

641
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,300
who'd only send Geum-myeong
to fetch coal for the furnace.

642
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,500
That horse-faced one.

643
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,800
Eventually, he gave her
the Good Child Award.

644
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,900
I actually gave him an envelope.

645
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,400
30,000 won.

646
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,900
I never sent our kids on a picnic
with just one roll of gimbap.

647
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,600
I always made sure to send two rolls,
one for the teacher as well.

648
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,400
I didn't want my kids to feel lacking,
financially or emotionally.

649
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,000
Is that why you gave her
so much money as a wedding gift?

650
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,200
What could be more upsetting
than my child being hated?

651
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,100
Why can't she understand that

652
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,400
when she's a mother too?

653
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,400
Did that big-nosed woman say something?

654
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,900
It's just…

655
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,300
She's too harsh.

656
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,400
She's too harsh on Geum-myeong.

657
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,500
Geum-myeong does everything well.
She does well on her own.

658
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,800
What does she do well?

659
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,400
I know from experience that walking
on eggshells only makes life miserable.

660
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,700
Geum-myeong is different.

661
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,600
<i>We raised her</i>
<i>so she wouldn't tolerate such misery.</i>

662
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,000
You're set on driving a wedge
between me and my son, aren't you?

663
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,600
I didn't say much, and you're crying?
Did you learn that from your mom too?

664
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,300
Mother, why did you do that?

665
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,100
How far are you going to go?

666
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,000
Educated people don't say much.

667
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,400
-I only said a few things with dignity--
-Mother.

668
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,000
You've never once shown any dignity.

669
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I can imagine how you treated my mom.

670
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:44,900
What?

671
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,400
The reason I've been putting up
with you until now

672
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,000
isn't because I'm less than him.

673
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,900
I know how embarrassed
Yeong-beom is of you.

674
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,900
That's the only reason I held back.

675
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,600
He's embarrassed of me? Me?

676
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,300
I thought your father was a lowly laborer
when I saw his hand!

677
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,800
-Mother!
-I never found his hands embarrassing.

678
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,300
Not a single thing about my parents
embarrasses me.

679
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,500
Throughout the wedding preparations,

680
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,500
our family showed

681
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,300
far more dignity than yours.

682
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,700
Do you think it's a done deal
because the invitations went out?

683
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,200
If I wanted to call it off… you know?

684
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,400
Got it?

685
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,500
I won't do it.

686
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,200
I can't do it.

687
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,900
How can I get married like this?

688
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,400
My mom and dad will cry.

689
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,100
You're breaking off the engagement?

690
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,400
You? You are?

691
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,600
Please stop! Stop it!

692
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,900
Why should I stop?

693
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,700
You owe 80% of your life to me.

694
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,100
You are my pride! My life!

695
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,800
Yeong-beom's life is his.

696
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,600
The life that you say you're living.

697
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,000
It belongs to Yeong-beom.

698
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,900
<i>What is it about Geum-myeong</i>

699
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,600
that you are so displeased with?

700
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,100
I'm sure she's a smart girl.

701
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,000
But this is marriage.

702
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,400
It should be between two similar families
to avoid trouble.

703
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,300
I never let Geum-myeong go hungry
a day in her life.

704
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,700
Whatever she wanted to do, I--

705
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,700
You think she grew up without shadows
in a struggling family, don't you?

706
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,000
But a family like that doesn't exist.

707
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,000
In a struggling family,
shadows are bound to be cast.

708
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,500
How could it be the same as a sunlit tree?

709
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,800
Sorry for being so blunt.

710
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,300
But now that I've spoken my mind,

711
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,300
I feel like a boulder
has been lifted off my chest.

712
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,600
Ma'am.

713
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,200
Do you know
where you're putting that boulder down?

714
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,700
On your son's heart.

715
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,900
That's where you're putting it down.

716
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,600
<i>You're just taking your son's life</i>
<i>and living it as your own.</i>

717
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,600
<i>Hi, my name is Pororo.</i>

718
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,600
<i>Hi, Pororo.</i>

719
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,900
<i>Hello, friends.</i>

720
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,100
<i>Pororo, what are you doing?</i>

721
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:30,000
<i>Pope Francis arrived in Korea</i>
<i>for the first time this morning.</i>

722
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,600
<i>Kim Seon-hee reports from the scene.</i>

723
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,900
<i>Pope Francis has arrived at Seoul Air Base</i>
<i>in Seongnam on a chartered plane.</i>

724
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,900
<i>Of all the popes…</i>

725
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,400
<i>The extreme heat intensifies,</i>

726
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,400
<i>leading to a sharp rise</i>
<i>in heat-related conditions.</i>

727
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,500
<i>The Korea Disease Control Agency</i>
<i>stated that since May…</i>

728
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,500
Are you still up?

729
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,300
Son, don't drink too much.

730
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,500
Good night.

731
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,500
Please stop it. Stop.

732
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,200
Why should I walk on eggshells around her?

733
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,300
Why should I

734
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,900
live like this?

735
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
Please go to bed.

736
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,900
After everything I went through
to raise you?

737
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,900
Was it all just to see this?

738
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,900
You've only felt sorry for yourself,
haven't you?

739
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,700
What about me?

740
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,900
What do you have to complain about?

741
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,000
You're just too sensitive!

742
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,800
I did it all for you.

743
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,700
I lived for you.

744
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,900
If you had married that girl,
you would've been even more unhappy.

745
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,600
How can you do this to me?

746
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,900
How could you humiliate me like this?

747
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,900
You are my life.

748
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,900
My life!

749
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,600
It's my life.

750
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,200
It's my disgusting life, where I've never
once had what I truly wanted.

751
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,100
Still, it's good
that you're at least happy.

752
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,600
You're happy, aren't you?

753
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,100
Look.

754
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,100
You're the only one smiling at my wedding.

755
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,600
<i>My first love didn't end up</i>
<i>as a fairy tale.</i>

756
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,900
Geum-myeong.

757
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:01,900
Hey, wait.

758
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,800
Did you know your mom made my mom cry?

759
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,900
I don't even want to cry right now
because of your mom.

760
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,600
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

761
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,600
<i>North Korean leader Kim Il Sung</i>
<i>died at 2:00 a.m.</i>

762
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,300
<i>With the deepest grief,</i>

763
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,000
<i>we announce to the people of North Korea</i>

764
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,200
<i>that our great leader,</i>
<i>Comrade Kim Il Sung, passed away</i>

765
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,300
<i>due to sudden illness</i>
<i>at 2:00 a.m. on July 8, 1994.</i>

766
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,700
<i>How is it</i>
<i>that our great leader's heart of steel,</i>

767
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,900
<i>so resilient to external attacks,</i>

768
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,700
<i>has truly stopped beating?</i>

769
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,500
<i>Thirty-four hours</i>
<i>after the news of Kim Il Sung's death,</i>

770
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,800
<i>at noon today,</i>
<i>the Pyongyang Broadcasting System…</i>

771
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,100
<i>When our engagement ended…</i>

772
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,600
<i>The broadcast announced</i>
<i>the news of Kim Il Sung's death.</i>

773
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,900
<i>…I cried like a North Korean spy.</i>

774
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,400
<i>It is said to be a heart attack</i>

775
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,800
<i>due to a combination of fatigue</i>
<i>and cardiovascular disease.</i>

776
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,400
<i>The North Korean broadcast also…</i>

777
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,200
Geum-myeong.

778
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,900
<i>We were together for seven years.</i>

779
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,300
<i>And we spent a year breaking up.</i>

780
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,700
So just be a sweet son.

781
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,100
A sweet son.

782
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,200
You're the type
who has to be nice to everyone, right?

783
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,100
What woman would be happy with you?

784
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,200
Everyone is unhappy and frustrated
while you keep acting nice.

785
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,100
Did you have to say that?

786
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,900
<i>We jabbed at each other,</i>
<i>spoke harshly to each other…</i>

787
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,000
Have you ever lived with me?
Give it a try before deciding.

788
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,000
Why should I?

789
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,400
Why should I be treated like crap
by your family?

790
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,100
Can you live without me?

791
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,300
-You're okay with that?
-Yeah.

792
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,300
I'd be so happy without you.
It'd be perfect if not for you.

793
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,900
Who asked you to hug me?

794
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,300
<i>…and worried sick about each other,</i>

795
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,700
<i>pouring our hearts out,</i>
<i>leaving nothing behind.</i>

796
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,300
It's cold.

797
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,200
You'll freeze to death.

798
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,400
It's past midnight.

799
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,800
I can still give you flowers, right?

800
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,400
Just flowers.

801
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,500
Why give me flowers on your birthday?

802
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,600
A gift to myself.

803
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,300
Aren't you cold?

804
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,100
It's freezing.

805
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,700
Yeong-beom.

806
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,100
Stop it.

807
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,700
It's exhausting.

808
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,700
Really exhausting.

809
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,900
Is it really over?

810
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,900
No matter what?

811
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,100
Don't you love me anymore?

812
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,600
Of course I do.

813
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,300
How can I not?

814
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,100
I do love you deeply.

815
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,700
But I love myself deeply too.

816
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,000
I feel so sorry for myself…

817
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,600
that I can't do it anymore.

818
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,800
I'll cut off my family.

819
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,600
-Okay?
-Who wants to live like that?

820
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,100
If your heart aches, mine will ache too.

821
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,300
I think if we became a family,

822
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,400
we'd end up hating each other.

823
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,000
I can't let you go.

824
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,400
I just can't. What should I do?

825
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,100
Of course you can.

826
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,400
I always tell you this, don't I?

827
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,200
Life goes on for the living.

828
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,000
I'm sorry…

829
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,200
for being so harsh at the end.

830
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,600
I'm the one who's sorry.

831
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,100
I was so…

832
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,600
Thank you.

833
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,600
To be honest…

834
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,100
I was just grateful for everything,
Yeong-beom.

835
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,700
I'm so glad that you're the one
who'll remember me

836
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,300
in my twenties.

837
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,400
Do we have to do this?

838
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,500
Do we really have to?

839
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,900
Come on.

840
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,000
No.

841
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,200
But it's our last time.

842
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,600
I'm going to miss your scent.

843
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,200
Still,

844
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,700
call me if anything happens, okay?

845
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,100
You don't have anyone in Seoul.

846
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,100
Promise you'll call me, okay?

847
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,300
I will.

848
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,700
I promise.

849
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,800
Does this mean…

850
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,200
we'll never see each other after tomorrow?

851
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,000
How can we?

852
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,000
How can we not?

853
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,300
Why can't we? It's so unfair.

854
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,200
<i>In Seoul, where I had no one,</i>

855
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,000
<i>he was my lover,</i>

856
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,900
<i>my family,</i>

857
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,900
<i>and my best friend.</i>

<i>Suddenly becoming strangers</i>
<i>with my closest buddy</i>

859

<i>felt like the Little Prince was leaving</i>

860
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,200
<i>the small planet</i>
<i>only the two of us lived on.</i>
