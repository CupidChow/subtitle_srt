00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,151
Oh, sweet justice.

171
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,820
Your daughter's just like you. [laughs]

172
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,698
Be honest.

173
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,492
I frustrated you, right?

174
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,578
How did you raise three kids?

175
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,581
Eat the drumstick.
You do what you have to do.

176
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,999
You have to live your own life

177
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,086
so you don't feel resentful
about anything.

178
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,296
Otherwise,
you'll always question your choices

179
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,798
and wonder what could've been.

180
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,258
She will figure that out.

181
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,052
She'll be able to tell
just by looking at you.

182
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,223
Right now,
you're Sae-bom's entire world, you see.

183
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,061
But

184
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,398
that won't last too long.

185
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,568
You won't be a priority.

186
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,197
Later in life,
she won't put you first anyway.

187
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,576
So just do what you want now.

188
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:37,952
Okay?

[gentle music playing]

190
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,957
Mom, do you regret anything?

191
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,043
Not doing everything you wanted?

192
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,838
[chuckles] No, I wanted to do it all.

193
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,466
Oh Ae-sun, the orphan alone in the world.

194
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,094
Oh Ae-sun the housekeeper.

195
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,388
Dropping out of high school Oh Ae-sun.

196
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,101
The best job I ever had was being
Geum-myeong and Eun-myeong's mother.

197
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,561
I really lived.

198
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,398
I lived life to the fullest in my own way.

199
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,775
Don't look down too much on my life.

200
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,030
Yeah, um,

201
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,824
maybe I'm missing maternal instincts.

202
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,909
Sometimes, I get so angry.

203
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,830
I scream at that girl.

204
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,498
I think I'm losing it.

205
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,877
In the beginning,
no mother knows anything.

206
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,671
Your child will grow,
and then so will you.

00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,011
are you going to chew your food
a hundred times in the morning?

210
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,472
Will you change your clothes ten times?

211
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,725
Why do you give me such
a hard time every morning? Huh?

212
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,435
Why?

213

00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,113
you go to work.

216
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,492
Is that why you do that?

217
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,661
So I can't go?

218
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,412
Oh.

219
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,123
I'm sorry

220
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,210
that I yelled at you the other day, okay?

221
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,795

That's getting closer.

365

I don't want Dong-myeong

"The Most Adorable Uncle."

Uncle Dong-myeong.

381

When our kids told their kids,
"This is Uncle Dong-myeong,"

382
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,536
it was so strange to hear.

383
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,955
And as strange as it was,

384
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,000
I loved it.

385
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,336
Maybe Dong-myeong would feel less lonely.

386
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,046
Oddly enough,

387
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,673
I, uh,

388
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,259

-Dong-myeong was our angel.

and dreaming.

397

I can't sleep because
I find myself staring at your wings.

398

Hey, Dad, the star of the family
wants to talk to you.

399

Mom? She's right here.

405
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,724

-Yeah.
-She wants to talk to me, right?

407

Uh-huh.

408

[doctor] You've had rheumatoid arthritis
for a long time.

I don't know how you bore
so much pain for so long.

449
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,686
Sometimes, the symptoms of
multiple myeloma are mistaken

450
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,605
for rheumatoid arthritis in joints,

451
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,357
which can delay a correct diagnosis.

Multiple myeloma

453
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,612

This has already progressed

00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,736
Well, at this point,

if we start the treatment now,

469
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,908
he could have a slight chance.

but a nuisance to her children.

519
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,264
Don't make me grow old on my own.

520
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,516
Of course.

521
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,143
I'll never leave you.

522
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,313
[sighs]

523
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,858
I wouldn't dare leave
Ae-sun behind all alone.

524
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,236
[Geum-myeong] <i>The rest of my dad's life</i>

525
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,280
<i>passed like a cherry blossom's.</i>

526
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:08,496
Oh! That was tough, huh?
Did it make you feel queasy?

527
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,581
Not really.

528
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,040
There was no pain.

529
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,168
It was painful. Don't say it wasn't.

530
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,086
Of course it hurt. How could it not?

531
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,337
Is Yang Gwan-sik here?

532
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,089
Oh, yes, yes.

533
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,509
Drink this, okay? Drink it, okay?

534
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,387
-[nurse] Mr. Seo Ji-won.
-Yes.

535
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,390
Did you get the blood work done already?

536
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:32,103
Oh, no, I was told downstairs
to come here first.

537
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,272
The instructions are written right there.

538
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,232
[middle-aged Ae-sun] Oh my.

539
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,651
-[nurse 2] Please leave.
-[middle-aged Ae-sun] Sorry?

540
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,528
-[nurse 2] Please go out.
-I'm supposed to be…

541
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,698
You can't just walk in.
You have to put those out here. Here.

542
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,076
-Oh, I, um, didn't see…
-It's written right here.

543
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,790
Ms. Park Gyeong-ja. Come in, please.

544
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,626
[chuckles]

545
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,008
Uh, so he can eat meat of any kind?

546
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,678
Someone said it wouldn't actually be
healthy for him to eat it.

547
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,096
Sure, he should eat well.

548
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,349
-Ah.
-[doctor] Then see you next month.

549
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,685
Well, sir, would moxibustion be
a good thing he should get?

550
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,105
I hear moxibustion would be good for him.

551
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,025
[sighs] Will you be asking me about
everything on the Internet?

552
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,360
Uh…

553
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:31,913
[middle-aged Ae-sun] Is this not it?
I have number 832.

554
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,541
You can't bring the number
for the payment window

555
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,000
to the reception window.

556
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,754
Oh. So this number is…

557
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,715
-[man] It's written right over there.
-Oh, so it's…

558
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,801
[man sighs]

559
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,597
Last call for 835.

560
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,934
Cut us some slack.

561
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,143
Can you, please?

562
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,604
There are a lot of people here.

563
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,732
We didn't know.
Please, would you cut us some slack?

564
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,151
[middle-aged Ae-sun] What's wrong?

565
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,363
Why are you sighing?
How dare you sigh in front of people here!

566
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,700
-Oh, my dear.
-Of course, first-timers don't know.

567
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,994
You all give us attitude
and yell at people all day.

568
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,412
Who do you think you are?

569
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,914
You treat us like complete idiots
if we don't follow everything

570
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,875
you already know,
like we're committing a crime.

571
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,544
She's as smart as anyone.
Smarter than you. She is!

572
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,754
-What happened? Mom, what?
-Geum-myeong, hi.

573
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,299
Where have you been? We need you.

574
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,719
Come with us when we visit the hospital.
Promise you will.

575
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,470
You have to. Be here.

576
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,597
[sighs]

577
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,808
It's because Dad's sick.

578
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,686
When you're sick, you get more frustrated.

579
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,732
You get frustrated easily,
even if you only have a migraine.

580
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,319
He's not mad at you, okay?

581
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,445
[chuckles]

582
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,866
You think Dad's always on my side,
no matter what?

583
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,492
He's not.

584
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,161
When you and I fight,

585
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,788
Dad will always side with you first.

586
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,956
[both chuckle]

587
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,501
[Geum-myeong] If I'm his number one,
you're number zero.

588
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,213
I think Dad sees you
as the precious One Ring.

589
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,591
Anyone messes with you,
and they're dead meat.

590
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,346
[gentle music playing]

591
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,896
[Geum-myeong] <i>All Dad saw was Mom.</i>

592
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,816
<i>He saw Mom</i>

593
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,277
<i>who would be sitting here</i>

594
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,030
<i>all alone one day.</i>

595
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:38,915
Don't bother.

596
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,293
Put me in a four-person room tomorrow.

597
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:46,130
[sighs] I didn't get this room for you.
I did it for Mom's peace of mind.

598
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:47,840
All right?

599
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,388
I wouldn't have booked you
a VIP suite if you got sick. [laughs]

600
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,431
I guess I lucked out with
you as my daughter.

601
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,226
Then get well soon
and pay me back in other ways.

602
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,812
You can watch Sae-bom for me

603
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,106
and keep scaring my husband.

604
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,860
He's being good to you, isn't he?

605
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,904
The apple of his eye.

606
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,331
So Chung-seop and I will come tomorrow.

607
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,333
-We'll wash your hair.
-You're going?

608
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,294
What? Like me to stay?

609
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,880
You always tell me to go.
Why do you want me to stay?

610
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,883
Sleep here. I'm all alone.

611
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,268
They give the guardian
a pillow in the VIP suite.

612
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,310
Wow, this is nice.

613
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,397
How much is this place?

614
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,441
You can go to Geum-myeong's to wash up.

615
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,901
She'll be staying here tonight.

616
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,654
[gentle music playing]

617
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,659
[Geum-myeong] Crazy, because her mom
didn't have enough to bribe the teacher?

618
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,495
That's how that kid's dad took away
Mom's class presidency?

619
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,956
-That homeroom teacher was a bad man?
-A dick.

620
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,624
A dick.

621
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,877
[Geum-myeong laughs]

622
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,420
[both laughing]

623
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,050
So Mom head-butted that lady, really?

624
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,470
-Yeah?
-Cracked that motel owner's nose…

625
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,804
Pow! …with her head.

626
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,681
[both laughing]

627
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,102
So did you see Mom?

628
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,147
Did you see her lying next to
Dong-myeong's grave?

629
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,274
I did.

630
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,609
[sobs]

631
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,778
I followed her secretly 'cause I believed

632
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,030
maybe she'd dive in the sea.

633
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,407
How did she live through that?

634
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,451
Your Mom was

635
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,828
twenty-eight at the time.

636
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,706
Twenty-eight.

637
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,753
When I asked your mom to marry me,

638
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,756
I promised her I'd either
pay for college on the mainland

639
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,634
or help her become a poet.

640
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,055
I vowed I'd do
one of those things for her,

641
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,391
thinking I wouldn't even fulfill one.

642
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,394
Mom's been writing these days.

643
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,855
I love watching her write.

644
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,234
She won a local writing competition once.

645
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,112
In her high school class, she was first.

646
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,740
That's how exceptional she is.

647
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,078
Mom could've been
so much more than what she is.

648
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,834
Be good to her.

649
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,919
Promise, hmm?

650
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,048
Dad, you're so annoying.

651
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,176
You had me stay behind to tell me this?

652
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,389
I'm sorry to burden you up to the end.

653
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,392
I'm sorry I'm entrusting my bride to you.

654
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,270
Where do you think you're going?

655
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,897
You're not going anywhere.

656
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,692
I don't want you to. I'm still a kid.

657
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,777
You can't go till I'm grown.

658
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,321
Why are you hell-bent on leaving us?

659
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,489
[music fades]

660
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,117
Geum-myeong, having you

661
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,245
as my daughter was like

662
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,039
catching a whale in a dinghy.

663
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,668
You memorized the multiplication table
before anyone else.

664
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,795
You went to Seoul National University.

665
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,839
[chuckles]

666
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,134
I had a full heart, yet I was sorry.

667
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,720
I was sorry for you each day.

668
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,515
I am truly sorry to you,

669
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,850
but to your mom…

670
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,353
my guilt is terrible.

671
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,232
It keeps me awake.

672
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,610
I can't sleep.

673
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,863
Stay by Mom's side, then,
if it's that hard.

674
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,866
Just stay with us a bit longer.

675
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,285
Geum-myeong,

676
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,246
you are my baby…

677
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,500
and I'm sorry I'm leaving you.

678
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,712
[sobs]

679
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,339
Your mom

680
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,092
means the world to me, okay?

681
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,721
Don't treat her like

682
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,598
she's being a pain.

683
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,975
Don't get impatient with her,

684
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,770
and be sweet to her.

685
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,232
[sobs]

686
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,442
Treat her well.

687
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,819
[crying]

688
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,406
How can I…

689
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,621
How can I say goodbye to you? How?

690
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,088
[wistful music playing]

691
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,675
Oh, but Dad,

692
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,802
I'm sorry, Dad.

693

I'm sorry.

694
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,057
Dad, sorry I get so annoyed. Mm?

695
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,104
Sorry I'm always hanging up on you
and always rushed.

696
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,986
But I was never actually
frustrated with you, you know?

697
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,114
It was never that.

698
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,615
Really, Dad.

699
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,621
[middle-aged Gwan-sik] I know.

700
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,165
Of course I know.

701
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,502
I have the best daughter in the world.

[Geum-myeong] <i>But my dad</i>

I really hate that saying.

What good is it that you're a fish
that made it out of the pond?

709
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,403
The pillar, the older sibling.

Is that what you want?

714

Yes, because I didn't wanna live like you.

715

[middle-aged Ae-sun] Careful.

725
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:43,506
Dad, sit on this stationary bike
so your back feels better, okay?

726
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,009
Or you can sit here
and just listen to Kim Kwang-seok.

727
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,763
I also scoured the Internet
and got this vinyl.

You gotta be strong, son.

I'll buy you those secretly then,

Then you'll keep this our secret, yeah?

761

Hello, my name is Yang Geum-myeong.

804
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,329
I studied in Japan,

805
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:47,458
and I used to listen to lectures
over and over again.

806
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,294
<i>Because I couldn't speak the language,</i>

807

<i>this was all I had to rely on.</i>

808
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,758
<i>I thought to myself,</i>

00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:59,261
<i>"Wouldn't it be great if I could</i>
<i>keep the teacher in my pocket?"</i>

810
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,765
One day, I was in my hometown,
staring at the bookcase.

811
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:03,849
And it

812
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,893
hit like a truck.

813
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,731
I, uh, saw an old workbook

814
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,568
for my mom's college entrance exam.

815
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,780

Is she talking about me?

816

<i>My mother was exceptional through</i>
<i>every part of her life.</i>

817

<i>She was smart and diligent,</i>

818
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,039
<i>and she really wanted to pursue</i>

819
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,500
a higher education.

820
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,962
Had my mom been given access
to classes in the palm of her hand,

821
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,215
she could have studied
to her heart's content.

822
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,676
My mom would've thrived.

823
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:43,430
Even if she never lived in Daechi-dong
and didn't have expensive tutors,

824
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,559
the bookworm on Jeju Island
should've been able to study.

825
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,606
I think anyone who wants to study

826
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,693

as my mother's dream.

01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,872
<i>And she still had dreams.</i>

1202
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,333
Let's go to the hospital together.

1203
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,752
You don't need favors from our kids.

1204
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:36,505
If you get sick, I'll take care of you.

1205
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:40,384
Better that you take
a bit more care for yourself.

1206
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:42,970
What are you doing about that belly?

1207
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,389
The kids are already judging you.

1208
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,350
And you should dye your hair. God.

1209
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:51,270
Dye it?

1210
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:53,981
-Will you help me?
-[sighs]

1211
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:59,945
So is there an age limit to first love?

1212
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,239
God, stop talking, please.

1213
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,118
-If there isn't, I was wondering if we…
-All right, let me out. Let me out.

1214
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,370
But the car is moving.
How can you ask that?

1215
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,664
Keep driving. Eyes on the road.

1216
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:14,251
[Sang-gil] I'm not
your chauffeur now, am I?

1217
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,421
[Geum-myeong] <i>In a season</i>
<i>of unchanging youth,</i>

1218
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:22,551

<i>with crushed balsam flowers.</i>

1219
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:23,969
Oh.

1220
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,389
You never age, do you?

1221
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:31,602
What's the big deal with aging?

1222
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:36,065
Did you feel any different
going from your thirties to your forties?

1223
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:38,192
You feel the same at your age?

1224
01:10:38,275 --> 01:10:40,110
Oh, exhausting.

1225
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,404
It's the same.

1226
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,699
It's the same.

1227
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:48,619
You feel the same inside,

1228
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,373
but when you look in the mirror,

1229
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:55,542
an old woman stares at you.

1230
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:57,878
That's all aging is.

1231
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,297
Mom. It's here! It's here!

1232
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,758
It wasn't a scam, you see?

1233
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,802
SEAFLOWER PUBLISHERS

1234
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,888
I made it very clear to her
that my sister is successful

1235
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,765
and that I own a franchise.

1236
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,226
I thought the publisher
would charge us more

1237
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:14,895
just because I wanted to publish
a poem collection so quickly.

1238
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,272
It was very last minute.

1239
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:19,024
But it wasn't a scam, you see?

1240
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,236
Oh, this is just unbelievable.

1241
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,198
Oh Ae-sun's poem collection.

01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,158
[Geum-myeong] Mom,

How do you feel about it?

1254

Well, the flowers

[middle-aged Ae-sun] Excuse me, ma'am.
Don't stand there.

1259

Ma'am, who did you come here to see?

1260
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,937
Well, my mother-in-law
said to pick the pretty lady.

1261
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:43,025

SHE LEFT BEHIND HER THREE CHILDREN AT 29

1266
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:12,137
WHEN I TURNED 29,
I CRIED LIKE I WAS TEN AGAIN

1269
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:50,926
Hey.

1270
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,886
Are you crying?

1271
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:56,932
[chuckles]

1272
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:59,059
Oh, what's happening?

1273
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:02,354
Why is this making me cry?

1274
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:05,482
Is it that good?

1275
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:07,943
It's just

1276
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,070
that I'm…

1277
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:12,406
I'm…

1278
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:17,911
How can I say it?

1279
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:21,748
Proud of her.

1280
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,585
So proud.

{\an8}SPRING IN A HEARTBEAT
THE BLAZING SUMMER SUNSHINE

1284
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,804
[Geum-myeong] Should we do something
for your debut publication?

1285
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,766
Can you at least pretend
you want something?

1286
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:43,812
Your daughter's doing quite well now.
I even bought you your house.

1287
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:46,231
See me more.

1288
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,359
I want to see my busy daughter at least

1289
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:52,279
a hundred more times before I go.

1290
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,617
Why would you say that?

1291
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,745
I get to see you

1292
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:02,456
maybe ten times a year.

1293
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,461
So I'd like to see you
a hundred times a year.

1294
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:10,255
[moans]

1295
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:13,342
So you should move to Seoul with me.

1296
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,261
Why do you go to
the nursing home that often?

1297
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,391
You still need a calling in the world.

1298
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,393
It's important at my age.

1299
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:26,271
I hate being treated
like I'm a waste of space.

1300
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,358
I'd just be relaxing mostly
in that situation.

1301
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:33,070
You were so, so busy your entire life.

1302
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:35,364
I only go 'cause

1303
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,616
I get excited doing that.

1304
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,955
See, when I'm there,
"Teacher Ae-sun" is what I'm called.

1305
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:48,210
Basically, I'm moving up
quite a lot in this world.

1306
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:56,635
<i>Once, I was a </i>haenyeo's <i>daughter</i>
<i>who cried every day at sea,</i>

1307
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:01,431
<i>then a bookworm who was so embarrassed</i>
<i>about everything in the world.</i>

1308
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:04,518
[Ae-sun] We have a house and a boat.

1309
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:08,605

<i>the fish-filleting lady at the market…</i>

1312
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,156
Crazy, right? And then I was chosen.

1313
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,284
<i>Supposedly a teacher at 70,</i>

1314
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,828
<i>and now, Oh Ae-sun the poet.</i>

1315
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:27,124
<i>You learn about life</i>
<i>if you live through it.</i>

1316
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:32,504
How shameful it would've been
if I gave up on life.

1317
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:36,508
I'm so glad I lived all that I could.

1318
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:41,680
So… your back in springtime now?

1319
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:43,682
Mm-hmm.

1320
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:45,601
It's spring again.

1321
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,269
Um,

1322
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,063
I thought life

1323
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:53,609
went from spring to summer

1324
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,694
to autumn to winter.

1325
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:58,030
That's not

1326
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:01,408
necessarily true.

1327
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:03,035
Sometimes,

1328
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,663
it's winter, sometimes it's spring.

1329
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,711
I had lots of spring days, dear.

1330
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,588
Many, many of those.

When I grow up to be a poet,

1359
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:42,300
I'll wear two-piece outfits
like Um Aing-ran.

1360
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:45,679
And, when I'm rich,
I'll live in a two-story house

and raise an adorable dog.

1362
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:51,017
And I'll pay for
piano lessons for our kids.

1363
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:53,019
I'll go out to eat nearly always.

1364

Um, then I'll drive Jeeps
and wear Ray-Bans.

Yeah.

I'm gonna take you

1369
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,994
I'm going to the States too.
