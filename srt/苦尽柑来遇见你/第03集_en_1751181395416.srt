Is he a spy? No?

3
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,572
I heard he was born and raised in Busan.

5
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,701
It is not up to the child to decide what his identity is.

6
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,745
It is decided by the Nanshan Intelligence Department.

7
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,542
Were you hungry now that we've finished eating?

8
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,046
Lower your head

9
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,507
Look down. Is this a movie theater?

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,343
The country feeds you kids and you just run away

11
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,679
All those bastards with shit in their heads should be sent to Nanshan

12
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,973
Put them in jail to be patriotic

13
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,980
How sweet! They are in love.

14
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,820
Are you crazy kid?

15
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,115
You are now in the big city of Jeju, kid.

16
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,491
What sleeves are you rolling up?

17
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,370
How dare you act so arrogantly in front of a senior police officer in a big city?

18
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,205
You bastard! Are you a high-ranking official?

19
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,672
Do we have to endure it if you do it? If you say you will send us to Nanshan, will we go to Nanshan?

20
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,508
How sweet Double Trouble!

21
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,053
Can you believe it? These little bastards are so shameless!

22
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:17,971
So what?

23
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,057
Is this illegal? Will I go to jail? Should I go to Nanshan?

24
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,809
Do you smoke?

25
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,937
You smoke and wear a mini skirt?

26
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,564
So should I go to Nanshan?

27
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,567
Was it that auntie who reported us for eloping?

28
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,153
She didn't dare to say anything else because she had something to hide.

29
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,364
What else? What did you steal? More trouble, huh?

30
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,659
We are not detained here because we beat anyone or stole something.

31
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:44,497
We are minors who need protection from the Busan police.

32
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,415
That's why

33
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,419
We will wait quietly for the guardian to come...

34
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,046
We still have to serve you? Don't hit him on the head!

35
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,512
This girl should be sent to Congress

36
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,139
Oh my god

37
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,100
I didn't expect them to be the Jeju Island version of Romeo and Juliet

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,477
Don't you want to call your mother?

39
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,604
They don't need

40
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,190
The woman camping outside is this kid's mother.

41
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,192
What?

42
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,235
This is handsome guy

43
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,404
This is a fox spirit.

44
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:18,907
She's here

45
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,826
Mother

46
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,456
Mother

47
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,589
Where's my bag? Where's my stuff? What?

48
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,257
Where are my jewelry?

49
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,721
My gold...Oh my God!

50
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,390
Where's my golden frog?

51
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,975
Where's my golden frog?

52
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,822
Is it true?

53
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,574
Is this real gold?

54
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,285
Yes

55
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,748
He always goes too far.

56
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,209
I like this every wedding anniversary.

57
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,962
Can't wait to buy me a gift on a special day

58
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,463
Really?

59
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,052
Our closet is filled with jewelry.

60
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,972
I will throw away the outdated ones.

61
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,682
Give me a good price

62
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,016
Really?

63
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,311
You gave me a good price for the jewelry last time.

64
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,356
When you came last summer you said it was your wedding anniversary.

65
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,609
Isn't summer the best time for wedding anniversaries?

66
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,196
Your husband bought you a gold bracelet, right?

67
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,660
No, it's spring.

68
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,371
Really?

69
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,040
What else?

70
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,293
Have questions?

71
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,045
Hello

72
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,881
How much? 300 won

73
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,966
Give me good

74
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,718
Don't give me, give me

75
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,220
Give me

76
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,389
Give it to me now

77
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,225
No, don't give it to me.

78
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,686
Hey I'm the boss why should he give you the money?

79
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,397
Is this your hotel? Anyway, this is my money.

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,484
This woman stole my bag so I'm taking it back bit by bit

81
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,402
Don't give me

82
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,862
I'll come back later

83
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,655
Wait a minute!

84
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,449
Where are you going? Wait...

85
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,580
Let's go

86
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,832
Are you going to stay here all night?

87
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,086
Hey, do you know why there are no thieves in Jeju Island?

88
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,047
Why? Are Jeju Islanders particularly generous?

89
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,592
We will keep on wasting time with you until you can't stand it anymore

90
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,510
The thief will die before the victim.

91
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,388
Because we won't give up

92
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,101
Oh my god you're crazy

93
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,603
Damn it.

94
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,396
You are a lunatic!

95
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,523
Absolutely crazy!

96
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,360
You are absolutely crazy!

97
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,364
I'm going to get my stuff back no matter what.

98
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,451
I will stay here day and night until I get the money back from the Golden Toad.

99
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,953
What? Did you just say golden toad?

100
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,664
Give me back my golden toad.

101
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,749
Hey

102
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,460
So the golden frog is now a golden toad?

103
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,628
You thief...

104
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,256
Are you a frog brain?

105
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,884
What can you do? You should return the golden frog to her.

106
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,305
It's too late now you have to give me back my golden toad

107
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,017
You are just a shameless robber, right?

108
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,936
I guess you have a criminal record.

109
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,270
Right?

110
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,897
Should I call the police?

111
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,775
Should we call the police? Auntie!

112
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,111
Auntie! What the hell?

113
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,325
Why did you go to the jewelry store? Why?

114
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,748
This is your tenth crime.

115
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,334
Think about your children, okay?

116
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,794
Let's go

117
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,255
Don't let people from Jeju Island stay when I'm away

118
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,674
Take her away

119
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,800
Let me go!

120
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,844
Is this her tenth crime?

121
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,389
Wow, she's really brave.

122
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,487
Hey you guys have to pay for the fans!

123
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,114
Pay the fan!

124
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,324
Are you performing acrobatics in there?

125
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,076
How can you break it?

126
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,786
You guys are awesome! Well done!

127
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,455
Hey don't push me!

128
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,299

Do you eat tofu?

130

no

131
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,687
I didn't buy it.

132
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,105
That sister bought it for us.

133
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,906
Where's your first birthday ring? Didn't you wear it?

134
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,699
Didn't you take it too?

135
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,285
Everything we took was in the bag.

136
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,289

Why do you want to drag someone else's eldest grandson into this?

146
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,957
I heard he was one of the top four athletes in Jeju Island

She is a poet in Class 8

148

You have completely ruined your life!

People on the island like to make a fuss

155

I don't dare to go to the wholesale market anymore

156

You have brought shame to our family!

00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,472

A man may lose his land or house in business.

160
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,979
Why do you keep mentioning him?

161
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,440
Did he do business? He played cards.

162
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,942
What now?

163
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,653
What are you going to do now? You can't get into the factory.

Did you see your grandma? Who raised you from childhood?

Do you only care about yourself?

How should I face my ancestors?

169
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,056
It's me who wants to marry her, not the ancestors.

Which good family would marry a junior high school graduate as a daughter-in-law?

173
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,529
Why did she only graduate from junior high school?

What do you want?

175
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,867
She eloped late at night and still expected the school to give her a diploma?

Go over there and ask for it!

177
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,165
Go and ask them to take you in as that guy's wife.

Eloping late at night and gambling with your life

184
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,435
I was just suspended from school.

185
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,437
Wow, I have to congratulate you.

186
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,855
But why only her?

187
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,900
Fired?

188
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,611
Junior high school graduates can't even do welding

189
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,654
Damn

190
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,905
Why is there only pure love...

191
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,532
You really don't know?

192
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,075
Even though we are two people together

193
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,952
But the boy will be called a hero

194
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,705
Girls will only be called shameless

195
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,332
You ruined her life without even figuring it out?

196
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,876
It was my idea

197
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,129
That fool just followed me

198
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,922
We are proud of you!

199
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,926
Remove him from the family tree!

200
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,512
Don't punish my child!

201
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,264
Aichun should be punished

202
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,350
Burn down the whole house for a maggot?

203
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,895
Why punish other people's children? It's our kid who's crazy about her.

204
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,650
Seriously, I want to catch that girl, scold her and pinch her and then...

205
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,818
Come on!

206
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,403
Did it work last time?

207
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,114
What's the point of pulling my hair?

208
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,658
Do you want me to watch my grandson being kidnapped?

209
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,288
When catching chickens, you cannot use a stick to chase them away.

210
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,998
You have to lure it with insects

211
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,916
You have to coax them.

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,919
If you chase them, they will run away.

213
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,841
How can they lock you up with a spoon? What the hell?

214
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,761
Oh my god

215
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,055
Oh My God

216
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,225
Have you eaten?

217
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,769
have eaten

218
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,564
Don’t miss any meal

219
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,151
So that's it

220
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,819
That's good

221
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,405
Kuanzhi never eats

222
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,033
Did he go on a hunger strike?

223
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,826
You know he's not that kind of person.

224
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,662
It was his father who told him not to eat a single grain of rice.

225
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,378
Aichun even if I want to help

226
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,716
But you also know that I can't fight his grandmother, right?

227
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,472
I married into the nasty Liang family and I am still suffering the consequences

228
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,266
You know how stubborn the Liang family is.

229
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,479
Do you remember how Kuanzhi stole fish for you almost every day for the past ten years?

230
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,900
I also give you cabbage from time to time

231
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,905
Who do you think he takes after?

232
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,990
Follow his father

233
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,662
His father even wanted to disown him.

234
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,580
Oh my god

235
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,792
It's just such a dead brain

236
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,130
I was madly in love with him and eloped with him late at night

237
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,842
But you can't rely on love to live your whole life

238
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,680
Before marriage, they will say you are the only one

239
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:12,768
But once I get married I will forget about you and only know how to be filial to my mother

240
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,522
You wait and see?

241
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,192
You'll definitely be lonely when you come to our house.

242
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,574
Okay... okay, what's wrong?

243
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,288
can I ask you something?

244
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,935
Our family is not well off and has not been stable lately.

245
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,147
I can't afford any dowry.

246
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,024
Anyway, I won't let her starve to death.

247
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,861
What do your family members say? Do they approve of her?

248
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,946
Can you beat the Shaman?

249
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,407
Your shaman grandmother said

250
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,368
Aichun is haunted by the ghost of her widowed mother

251
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,164
People here believe in the Dragon King instead of God and Buddha.

252
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,583
No one can stand up to Shaman.

253
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,795
Aichun will live with me, not my grandma.

254
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,839
I will protect Aichun's safety

255
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,383
So what? Are you planning on moving out?

256
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,801
Do you have a house under your name?

257
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,473
Who do you think you are to take care of me?

258
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,600
Do you think I'm a rotten fish sold at a cheap price?

259
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,895
You let her sleep in the bean paste room?

260
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,440
I don't agree. This will only make me feel wronged and cheap.

261
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,691
But I think

262
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,444
Why? Do you think I can't get married without you?

263
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,699
I want to marry a guy who is richer and more handsome than you and who won't be treated like a treasure by his family!

264
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,576
Then go and get married.

265
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,661
Marry whoever you can find!

266
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,996
I don't want I will never marry you

267
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,248
Just wait and see if I will marry you!

268
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,345
Hey! Bring me some tea.

269
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,099
Gao Jie served them tea. Good boss lady

270
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,101
Hello sir

271
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,187
You raised a pair of younger siblings all by yourself?

272
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,859
That's why I want to contact you.

273
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,403
So that's it

274
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,963
I heard that you really want to marry a man from Seoul

275
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,136
I am also from Seoul

276
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,641
I came from a well-off family and was sent to Seoul to study after liberation.

277
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,020
If I hadn't gotten married and moved here

278
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,272
I will become a powerful person

279
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,112
When I first got married...

280
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,699
Can I still have tea today?

281
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,377
Don't care about my opinion

282
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,255
After all, love is not a sin

283
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:35,012
I heard some rumors about your past.

284
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:35,929
But today

285
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,475
I risked my life to come here

286
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:45,022
I've seen a lot of things, so I can handle a little trouble without any problems

287
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,859
I am more like a Seoul person who doesn't care about these things

288
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,571
I heard that a second marriage is good for both parties.

289
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,364
You know, we understand each other, right?

290
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,577
It's too demanding to marry someone who has never been married.

291
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,871
Gives me a headache

292
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,297
You don't want to drink? This costs 50 won.

293
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,262
Yes, he was married.

294
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,972
But he has many ships.

295
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,517
More than one

296
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,686
You have to use his boat to take the boat in Daodongli

297
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,482
If you really want

298
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,194
I heard he will try to send you to college within ten years.

299
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,905
If you behave well

300
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,867
He might even consider funding a collection of your poems.

301
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,538
Only two kids...

302
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,375
At least not three

303
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,048
It seems that I am destined to be a nanny.

304
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,509
Oh my god

305
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,888
This spring rain lasted for a long time.

306
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,435
Maybe my mom is crying.

307
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,276
Maybe she cried because I got married like this

308
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,792
Guangli was so angry that he almost crawled out of the tomb!

309
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:34,381
You ruined a little girl's life and you still have an appetite to eat?

310
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,384
If you pity her so much that you let your son marry her

311
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,594
How about it?

312
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,971
Then you can't let her marry a married man!

313
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,641
Both families are so eager to get rid of Aichun

314
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,476
Makikawa

315
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,312
Although you are doing rituals

316
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,814
But you have no right to scold others.

317
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,275
If she married that man

318
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,903
I don't believe in your Dragon King and gods anymore.

319
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,238
Good people should be rewarded

320
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,781
Good people should be rewarded!

321
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,617
That’s enough!

322
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,452
Is Aichun getting married?

323
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,666
(Mrs. Bai Jinan's 60th birthday)

324
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:18,217
Would you like to re-send this gift box to my family?

325
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,135
This is American.

326
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,348
Just made in Korea

327
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,935
It's the same in the stomach

328
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,520
I don't care about those false ceremonies

329
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,943
Weddings are all meaningless formalities

330
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,487
Blackmailing people

331
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:46,453
To be honest, you will only wear a white wedding dress for your first wedding.

332
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,414
Let's just dress up and take some photos.

333
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,417
It's not the first time for either of us.

334
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,171
Speaking of which

335
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,466
I'm curious about something

336
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,343
that…

337
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,180
About Busan

338
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,396
Does your mother know about you?

339
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,693
My god, you must have emptied out the entire store.

340
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,153
Oh my god, this is stealing.

341
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,031
I won't let Aichun starve to death

342
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,742
I could give her a whole mackerel every day

343
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,703
It's not war time now.

344
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,121
Marriage is not about eating

345
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,875
Are you really her grandmother? Are you really her uncle?

346
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,296
I knew there was something wrong when you didn't even give her a yellow croaker!

347
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,131
Why mention yellow croaker?

348
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,467
I heard he was married at the age of 30!

349
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,512
Why did you introduce a man like that to Aichun?

350
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,765
Even actor Shin Seong-il is not worthy of her!

351
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,059
Why do movie stars look for Aichun?

352
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,187
Why would you abandon a pretty girl like Aichun?

353
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,444
She is smart and can talk.

354
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,903
Really cute

355
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,657
Why are you like this?

356
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,951
Keep talking.

357
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,083
Let me marry her

358
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,336
I gave her yellow croaker for so many years

359
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,921
I've been helping her sell cabbages.

360
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,507
I care about Aichun more than anyone else!

361
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,927
More than you care! Why take her away from me?

362
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,846
So what do you want me to do?

363
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,431
Put a rope on her?

364
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,310
Tie her up and drag her to marry you?

365
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,479
She doesn't want to, who can change her mind?

366
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,691
If an obedient cow decides to rebel, nothing can stop it.

367
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,444
You can't force it to plow the land

368
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,988
What happened to her?

369
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,656
Ask your mom

370
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,743
Ask her how she convinced Aichun

371
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,997
You know, in Busan

372
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,502
Were you caught on the day of your elopement or a few days later?

373
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,673
Kids nowadays don’t care whether they stay overnight or not and can do anything

374
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,592
Captain, what about you?

375
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:12,015
Did you get divorced soon after your marriage or did you wait a while?

376
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,518
hateful!

377
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,230
You have a bad temper.

378
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,607
Yes, that's right.

379
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,902
So I don't like rude people.

380
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,822
Does that guy know this side of you? Does he still like you?

381
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,782
That's why he likes me! Damn it!

382
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,617
You stinky boy!

383
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,453
Stop hindering this marriage!

384
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,371
Damn

385
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,747
It's lively now

386
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,460
Hey boy you little bastard!

387
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,921
What are you doing? What are you doing now?

388
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:43,839
Let's go

389
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,050
Come on, let's go!

390
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,303
Where? Where to?

391
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,222
Where can we go?

392
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,392
Damn it! Hey you little bastard!

393
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,146
How dare adults talk...

394
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,480
Shut up, uncle!

395
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,739
Don't go, marry me.

396
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,741
You wear the ring.

397
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,536
What's the use? Can we live on it forever?

398
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,872
Are we going to elope again? Be thieves?

399
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,373
Do you really want to marry him?

400
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,003
Why is this happening? Why?

401
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,797
He is married for the second time and has two children.

402
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,301
But why would you do this? Why?

403
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,386
That's right! Why me? Why only me?

404
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,430
Why is it all blamed on me?

405
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,516
Why was I the only one fired? Why was I the only one who had no sense of shame?

406
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,810
It's over. It's all over.

407
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,479
Go to college? Become a poet?

408
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,024
It's all over.

409
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,902
I can't even do welding now.

410
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,320
I said I would take care of you

411
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,405
I've told you a million times... but what are you going to do?

412
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,492
What have you done for me since I was ten?

413
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,911
Give me mackerel? Yellow croaker?

414
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:56,870
I'm not a beggar!

415
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,913
When you were ten years old

416
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,955
I am also ten years old

417
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,751
What can a ten-year-old do? He said he would do everything for me.

418
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,295
Send me to college and let me be a poet

419
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,213
I can do that too!

420
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,049
I can sail, I can lay bricks, anything is possible!

421
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,967
No! I don't want you to do this!

422
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,688
I don't stand a chance living with you.

423
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,611
What? I don't want to live this way anymore.

424
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,281
I'm tired of living with a family that hates me

425
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,620
I also want to have money and live a good life

426
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,706
Marrying you will only lead to more abuse

427
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,626
But if I marry him no one will say anything bad about me

428
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,669
Even you won't

429
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,422
Because you know everything and you see me...

430
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,680
I…

431
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,642
Live in shame all your life

432
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,811
One of them was sent

433
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,437
Did your mom give it to you?

434
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,231
Did she say that?

435
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,818
You have six people in your family but always buy only five

436
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,611
Can you get rich selling fish?

437
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,280
What a nosy little devil.

438
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,449
That little bad guy

439
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,412
You've seen it all

440
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,123
I…

441
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,668
I miss her so much

442
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,713
He asked me to go to Busan

443
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,465
He asked me to work in a factory!

444
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,968
I don't have a home anymore

445
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,762
You know everything

446
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,265
Do you want me to continue living like this?

447
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,519
If I were with you...

448
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,024
Even if I get married I won't be happy

449
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,527
Please let me live my life.

450
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,950
Let me change your pitiful fate

451
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,331
It's me

452
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,374
Is it blocking your way?

453
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,674
Wide planting

454
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,304
You have to leave me to live your life.

455
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,349
You have to leave...

456
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,685
I can live my own life

457
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,917
She stared at her 18-year-old first love for a long time

458
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,836
The one person she would never see again...

459
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,634
Buried her pure love in that yellow spring

460
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,345
Tears streaming down my face

461
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,389
My ring

462
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,563
My ring

463
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:25,245
They say you get what you sow, but raising children is not like that.

464
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,581
You're just different to me

465
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,667
You never considered me as your family.

466
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:36,005
She always gives me less fried eggs than you.

467
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,757
here we go again

468
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,343
Mom, why did you marry into such a family?

469
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,263
I choose my own path, no one else can blame me

470
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,307
I wouldn't choose to live like you.

471
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,184
No, absolutely not.

472
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,439
I'm going to marry in Seoul no matter what

473
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,401
Especially a man who doesn't even know what "nostalgia" is

474
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,318
Absolutely not!

475
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,115
That's right, it should be "absolutely not"

476
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,203
Do you regret it? Even a little bit?

477
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,832
Of course I don't regret it

478
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,002
If I hadn't met your dad, you wouldn't exist

479
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,754
No, not from a mother's perspective.

480
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,921
But from Wu Aichun's perspective

481
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,593
Eat your chicken.

482
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,386
What's wrong?

483
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,516
Do you regret it from Wu Aichun's perspective? Have you ever thought about what would happen?

484
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,769
Wu Aichun?

485
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,897
Wu Aichun…

486
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,694
That spring was really devastating.

487
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:18,191
Well kids if they touch them they die okay?

488
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,943
Give us something good!

489
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,861
Don't sell things no one wants on the island.

490
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,239
If I touch them they will die and I won't be able to sell them.

491
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,159
Don't cry, Guangli

492
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,455
Send your baby son to a safe place as soon as possible.

493
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,167
I hope he can find a wife from a good family.

494
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:43,174
This is how you feed worms to chickens

495
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,177
You are really

496
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,721
Very powerful

497
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,268
Um…

498
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,188
Can I ask you something?

499
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,987
Please treat me as your mother

500
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,241
Wide planting

501
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,871
Is it really one of the top four in Jeju?

502
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,916
He almost won a medal, didn't he?

503
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,589
If he hadn't been distracted, he might have won the medal.

504
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,466
He is not only fourth, he is almost third.

505
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,094
Almost tied for third

506
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,848
That idiot

507
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,226
Do you two argue when you talk?

508
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,104
He said he went there just for the free milk and bread

509
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,648
I never told him he was that great.

510
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:45,653
How could you follow me for ten years but never tell me what you like?

511
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,866
He always heard me nagging about wanting to be a poet but he...

512
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,118
But he...

513
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,412
The men of the Liang family are like this

514
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:58,291
They feel they shouldn’t express their opinions.

515
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,717
Love Pure

516
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:10,803
Wide planting...

517
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,767
I'll lose everything if I'm with you

518
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,228
He will lose his dream and his family.

519
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,232
You know what loneliness feels like

520
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,734
Right?

521
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,405
Don't take away everything from Kuanzhi

522
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,784
You want him to live his own wonderful life.

523
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,245
Love Pure

524
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,793
Let him live his life.

525
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:43,836
Please

526
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,464
Am I...

527
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,260
Blocking his way?

528
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,388
Am I...

529
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,474
Blocking your way?

530
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,259
Wide planting!

531
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,469
Give!

532
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,139
You will succeed

533
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,141
I have been a coach for ten years.

534
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,809
Only You

535
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,937
Ran 100 laps as required

536
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,858
Your mother sold fish to support you to study in the Peninsula

537
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,069
You have to train hard to win the gold medal

538
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,571
Once you get the gold medal

539
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,033
You'll forget what she looks like.

540
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,785
Have you seen those gold medals? What?

541
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,412
They are not pure gold

542
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,165
What?

543
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,253
Why go to all that trouble over fake gold?

544
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,963
I don't need

545
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,506
Is this how your life is going to be?

546
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,801
Aren't you always talking about gold medals and Peninsula?

547
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,094
That's because

548
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,681
Aichun wants to leave Jeju Island

549
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,268
Does your life revolve around Aichun?

550
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,352
My damn life

551
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,521
Disembarkation

552
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,900
I run 100 laps just for Aichun

553
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,112
I didn't make enough from selling fish and my grades weren't good either.

554
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,406
I ran 100 laps hoping for a chance

555
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,866
Who would be stupid enough to run like this?

556
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,786
Get off the boat, brat

557
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:43,414
I actually hate sports.

558
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,332
What?

559
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,501
Sports are not for me. I can only get fourth place at best.

560
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,169
Even if they gave me a chest of gold...

561
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,215
I will only fight for love.

562
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,011
Why are you going to Seoul now, you bastard?

563
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,973
You have to leave me to live your life.

564
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,770
You have to leave me to live your life.

565
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,123
I am a very modern person

566
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,669
I'm open-minded enough to ignore this.

567
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,631
Other people will never forgive such a thing.

568
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,346
How dare that nobody talk to me like that?

569
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,722
hateful

570
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,685
Didn't his family just run a tiny fish shop?

571
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,313
That impolite little bastard has nothing.

572
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,565
Bigger than a fart

573
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:55,111
What? It must be bigger than your fart.

574
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,488
Damn, I'm nicer to you.

575
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,615
Do you dare to talk back to adults like this?

576
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,784
Why would an adult marry a child?

577
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,120
Damn you, you stinky girl!

578
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,663
Don't be rude to me.

579
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,374
Listen, wake up.

580
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,543
I think you don't understand the situation.

581
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,796
I may have to pay you tuition. Don't teach me how to speak.

582
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,883
Am I marrying a rich girl?

583
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,384
I don't want your money

584
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,595
I don't want

585
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,806
Really?

586
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,059
Wait are you serious miss?

587
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,438
Can I go to college?

588
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:35,109
Can I be a poet? Can I go to the Peninsula?

589
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,739
I'm just a burden to the family.

590
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,040
Didn't you marry me to go to college?

591
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,334
Otherwise, what's the point?

592
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,588
Otherwise why would you marry me?

593
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,507
I don't…

594
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,510
place

595
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,555
What?

596
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,768
I have no choice

597
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,562
I do it all

598
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,440
I do it all

599
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,776
I want to be the leader of a fishery cooperative

600
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,570
I will be the monitor for the fifth time.

601
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,530
Great! Keep it up!

602
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,367
We, the female divers, can also have a bright future

603
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,079
It would be nice if she was born a boy.

604
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:33,334
How can such a little girl have such great abilities?

605
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,338
If she's that talented she should run for president

606
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,008
Go ahead, all eight of us will vote for you.

607
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,552
Nine votes

608
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,098
That's right! Nine votes

609
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,934
How many points did you get in math?

610
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,728
Who do you want to be?

611
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,150
Don't ask him!

612
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,569
First Mr.

613
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:04,949
First Mr.

614
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,538
Oh my god, this kid is so infatuated!

615
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,850
I got married because I had nowhere else to go

616
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,686
Even if I die, I have nowhere to go.

617
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,981
They say it's better to live on a pile of shit than to die so...

618
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,649
Am I a piece of shit?

619
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,986
Can you just hire me?

620
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,864
I can be a maid or a nanny to make you feel worthy

621
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,035
Hey listen

622
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,496
If I marry a wife, there will be someone to do the housework. Why should I agree to you?

623
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,248
Why should I promise you?

624
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,502
As the Queen of Love, you may dream of a passionate love.

625
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,421
But I just want a wife.

626
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,342
I want to find a docile daughter-in-law for my mother and a thrifty mother for my children.

627
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,760
You got it!

628
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:14,143
My ex-wife and I only met five times before we got married

629
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,603
People live like this

630
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,481
Do we have to make things so complicated?

631
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,985
Hey wait! Just use the cheapest fabric

632
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,415
Tell me anyway

633
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,418
Did you sleep with him?

634
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,643
That crazy girl!

635
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,271
If she hadn't run away that day...

636
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,816
If she hadn't run away that day...

637
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,112
Qingyu, let's go home

638
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,869
The damn rain is pouring down

639
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,540
Just let this matter pass.

640
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,085
Out of sight, out of mind

641
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,795
Are you crazy?

642
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,508
Then why is the rain today falling like the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl are crying?

643
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,717
Wide planting!

644
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,470
Wide planting!

645
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,598
Wide planting!

646
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,727
where are you going?

647
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,981
where are you going?

648
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,402
How could you just leave me like this?

649
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,112
That's right

650
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,029
Wide planting!

651
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,073
How can young people resist love?

652
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,867
Liang Kuanzhi!

653
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,785
Liang Kuanzhi!

654
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,914
Hey Leung Kuan Chik!

655
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,877
Wow, so noisy

656
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,549
Love pure!

657
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,221
Aichun! You're going to fall

658
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,807
Come here, why are you so cute?

659
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,560
Mom, I want candy.

660
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,280
Liang Kuanzhi!

661
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,658
Liang Kuanzhi!

662
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,830
Liang Kuanzhi!

663
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,129
Leung Kuan Chi

664
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,381
Leung Kuan Chi

665
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,593
Liang Kuanzhi!

666
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,601
Don't go!

667
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,771
Please don't leave

668
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,035
That damn girl is so annoying

669
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,329
Stop being so annoying!

670
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,289
Is it your business?

671
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,500
Let her be

672
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,585
Let her scream.

673
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,388
Why do you always take away everything from me?

674
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,351
Why do you only take away everything that belongs to me?

675
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,649
Mother

676
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,570
Mother

677
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,785
Mother!

678
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,208
Oh my god, what's going on?

679
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,586
Is it the Dragon King who is stopping us?

680
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,254
Why the sudden headwind?

681
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,881
Damn hey!

682
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,593
It's against the wind

683
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,094
Turn the boat around

684
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,679
Turn around! We are at sea!

685
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,805
Please turn around!

686
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,181
Please go back!

687
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,183
You have to turn around!

688
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,768
Get out of here!

689
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,480
Please turn around!

690
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,818
Let me go!

691
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,403
Wait! Please!

692
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,947
How did that little bastard get on my boat again?

693
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:38,782
captain!

694
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,075
Excuse me Captain!

695
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,620
You have to turn around

696
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,623
Kuanzhi! You won't die without her, right?

697
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,208
Are you going to die? You fool!

698
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,303
If she hadn't run away that day...

699
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,349
If she hadn't run away that day...

700
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,726
You ruined their lives.

701
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,520
Don't you know the story of Romeo and Juliet?

702
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,066
Heartbreak doesn't kill people

703
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:15,903
Once the ship starts moving, the Dragon King will be in charge.

704
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,113
What's the point of making things difficult for yourself?

705
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,698
Let's go

706
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,243
Aichun, come with us and I will cook pork for you.

707
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,953
Are pigs stronger than men?

708
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,414
Oh my god

709
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,291
Oh my god

710
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,002
If she hadn't run away that day...

711
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,213
Did someone fall into the water just now?

712
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,548
A person just...

713
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,177
Mom and brother fell into the water

714
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,261
What?

715
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,181
My brother just fell into the water

716
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,689
“Heartbreak doesn’t kill people”?

717
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,024
It will only drive a young man to jump into the sea!

718
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,528
No, mom.

719
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:11,417
If she hadn't run away that day...

720
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,464
Look! Is that a whale or something?

721
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,217
Something is coming!

722
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,599
If she hadn't run away that day...

723
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,396
Can she stop the fate that is rushing towards her?

724
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,992
U-turn!

725
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,369
U-turn!

726
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,082
Come on Kuanzhi!

727
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,183
You have to make him learn swimming among so many sports!

728
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,271
We should send him to North Korea as a spy!

729
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,448
Fate is so capricious

730
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,526
Oh my god!

731
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,116
Are you okay?

732
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,168
I have to pay for these clothes!

733
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,630
I have money

734
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,176
What did the man say? I don't know

735
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,762
He only knows how to eat candy

736
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,238
Oh my god

737
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,287
This is better than the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

738
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,375
You know, the problem is

739
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,880
Even the Heaven couldn't separate the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

740
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:08,385
Because they meet every July 7th

741
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,721
Your husband can't do that.

742
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,725
Young people's love cannot be stopped

743
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,241
Did you know?

744
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,369
Did your parents elope late at night?

745
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:36,872
Eloping late at night?

746
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,708
Your aunt is drunk again.

747
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,711
They made a lot of noise.

748
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,923
Turned Jeju Island and Busan upside down

749
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,258
Qingyu, you are drunk again

750
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,011
It was your mother who eloped late at night, not me.

751
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,679
But the interesting thing is

752
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,765
What happened in Busan?

753
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,141
Go home soon

754
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,184
It's time to get up

755
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,395
What happened in Busan? It took them two days to get caught.

756
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,272
That's enough! Then how...

757
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:06,568
Okay, drink some water to sober up.

758
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:11,406
Hello, can I call Qingyu's husband?

759
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,367
So a miracle happened in Busan

760
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,160
You are a blessing from heaven!

761
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,496
Do you want me to call your husband over?

762
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,622
hurry up!

763
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,582
You gave birth earlier than your due date

764
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,670
You were born just eight months after we got married.

765
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,797
They eloped for two days before they were caught.

766
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,176
That's why we say miracles happen in Busan

767
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,678
You are a blessing from God

768
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,723
So your hometown is Busan, not Jeju Island

769
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,103
Blame it on spring

770
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,564
Spring has its own charm

771
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,567
Spring in Jeju Island

772
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,736
Always come early

773
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,614
And particularly willful

774
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,202
I think

775
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,414
We should have three children.

776
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,166
I think three are the best

777
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,128
So if we have to pay

778
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,839
Education for three children

779
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:12,134
You have to plan your life

780
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,263
Have you heard of General MacArthur?

781
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,932
So strategically speaking

782
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,436
We should have a daughter first.

783
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,812
Then a son...

784
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,105
Then don't waste your time.

785
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,107
What?

786
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:31,862
No time

787
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,837
Are you performing acrobatics in there?

788
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,007
How did you manage to break the wall fan?

789
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:58,555
Even my mom thought it was Liang Kuanzhi and Wu Aichun who broke the fan

790
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,850
Hey, go home, you damn girl.

791
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:02,851
Go!

792
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,229
I'm curious why they gave you the nickname "Diya" before you were born

793
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,691
It turns out that they drank Diya Soju in Busan and then...

794
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,736
You are drunk, go away, you damn girl

795
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,489
Why are you taking it out on me when you're the ones going to Busan?

796
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,658
It was you who had to come to my house to eat chicken

797
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:20,994
Go home soon!

798
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,871
Don't chase me away if there's any left!

799
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,623
Can we pack it up for you?

800
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,666
Put on your coat and go

801
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,584
Walk

802
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,635
Jinming, look here

803
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,221
one two three!

804
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,269
I didn't expect a person's head could be so round.

805
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,646
Are you happy?

806
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,315
I didn't expect you to laugh like this.

807
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,692
Oh my god

808
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,820
Is she that cute?

809
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,280
She's a cute little badass

810
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,951
A little bad boy who delayed his mother's

811
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,002
Don't be silly, who cares about going to college now?

812
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:14,548
I have the whole world in my arms

813
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,968
You're my nostalgic thing, right?

814
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,560
At the National Games

815
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,271
A swimmer wearing boxers instead of swimming trunks

816
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,691
Won the 400m and 1500m freestyle titles

817
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,652
This is Zhao Wulian who suddenly appeared

818
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:42,200
He expressed his ambition to win the Asian Games in Bangkok

819
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,586
You will because

820
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,839
Are you sad because you can't be like Zhao Wulian?

821
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,430
Who cares about a gold medal when you have a daughter who is as precious as gold?

822
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,225
She is my dream now

823
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:13,481
The spring of their lives is fleeting.

824
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,152
At 18

825
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,447
My mom lost her mom and became a mom herself

826
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,909
At 19

827
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,996
My dad got the girl he wanted but not the gold medal

828
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:31,666
Will she play football in the future? Look at her legs.

829
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:36,046
I hope she can be a teacher. Chinese teacher

830
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,426
I wonder what she will become, right?

831
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,849
Their spring is not a season for nurturing dreams

832
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,268
But to shatter the dream

833
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,944
And they do it willingly.

834
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:06,201
(Jin Ming, our eternal nostalgia, May 4, 1969)

835
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,247
《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

836
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,250
Hi, can I ask you a few questions?

837
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,295
Are you here to enjoy the flowers today? What do you think of this trip?

838
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,007
These flowers remind me of my first love

839
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,927
First love is predictable, so you can live with her.

840
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,472
Huilan is so dirty

841
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:30,058
Thank you for the interview.

842
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,726
Huilan's is so dirty

843
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,895
Let's interview a few more citizens.

844
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,815
Hello, you must be a newlywed couple.

845
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:45,949
These are not my grandma's, they really belong to me

846
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,410
Your first birthday ring belongs to your mother, not you.

847
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,246
But I really want to buy her a ring

848
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,123
You are so annoying

849
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,711
Don't look at me like that.

850
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,213
I actually sneaked out

851
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,466
Before dawn tomorrow can you...

852
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,553
So you want me to come work early tomorrow morning for you?

853
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,478
Okay, put it here.

854
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,608
Who would live with a man without a ring?

855
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,120
Is the toilet clean?

856
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,038
clean?

857
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,539
Um

858
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,499
Can be used

859
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,215
New ring and new dress

860
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,510
This must be a celebrity wedding.

861
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,390
Do you really want it?

862
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,851
Is this a wedding or a fashion show?

863
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,479
Just rent a dress

864
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:58,480
Seriously

865
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,564
Put on

866
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,775
Wear whatever you want

867
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,903
Why not wear a big hat and parade?

868
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,404
Pick whatever you want

869
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,239
How can this be possible?

870
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,575
How do you like it?

871
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,119
Um

872
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,038
Do you want to move out?

873
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,956
If you have money, move away

874
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,167
Should I put my hair up?

875
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,755
Should I wear my hair up or down?

876
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:25,757
What?

877
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,008
My hair

878
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,427
Is it better to wear it in a bun or draped over your head?

879
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,598
actually…

880
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,516
Um?

881
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:36,893
Don't you think

882
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,312
You will

883
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,564
Is it possible to regret it?

884
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,233
Why?

885
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,028
I just thought maybe...

886
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,450
Awkward and...

887
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,958
Do you understand fashion? Do you know who Jin Fengnan is?

888
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,376
No, I don't know

889
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,923
If you can, move away!

890
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,216
It's so annoying.

891
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:15,807
By the way, can we go have quail noodle soup later?

892
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:19,060
You ate the little greedy pig yesterday

893
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,277
You are so beautiful

894
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,284
Mom, why are you wearing a hat like that?

895
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,703
Did you lose the bet?
