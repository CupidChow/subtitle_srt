00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,982
《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,943
Aichun that stinky girl!

3
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,571
You naughty girl! Mom!

4
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,822
I don't like him! Mom

5
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,783
Liang Kuanzhi? I don't like him!

6
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,201
I just can’t stand it!

7
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,621
Damn it! That damn girl Aichun!

8
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,372
Grandma, what are you doing?

9
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,707
What? What?

10
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,504
Why are you destroying her cabbage?

11
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,546
What are you doing, kid!

12
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,674
She said: "I just don't like it"

13
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,240
Barnacles and Conch

14
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,869
The fishmonger's son and the haenyeo's daughter

15
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,704
Almost the same

16
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,874
Am I dating a noble man?

17
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,899
Just playing together doesn't mean you'll fall in love with each other

18
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:35,113
We just want to do business together so that I can set up a stall next to your store.

19
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,532
I don't particularly want to get married.

20
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,078
Even if you give it to me, I won't take it.

21
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,081
Do you think I'm crazy? Why would I marry an islander?

22
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,126
My roots are in Seoul anyway.

23
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,377
Gyeonggi Noodles

24
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,131
Your uncle owns the Gyeonggi Noodle Company.

25
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,799
Gyeonggi-do is Seoul

26
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,099
The damn sea took my parents away

27
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,894
I feel sick looking at the waves around me

28
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,312
Do you think I'll stay here?

29
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,940
I'm going to marry in Seoul no matter what

30
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,692
I will never marry on an island.

31
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,738
Especially a man who doesn't even know what "nostalgia" is

32
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,655
Absolutely not!

33
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,205
Why don't you say anything?

34
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,208
I would rather live with Grandpa Shi

35
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,128
Take your hands out of my pockets and put them in the Seoul guys

36
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,442
If you want, send your son away.

37
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,738
I guess you don't mind giving him to that girl.

38
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,074
I will never go against you.

39
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:01,991
Yeah?

40
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,245
When you married me, you ran with the ball

41
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,206
Don't push them too much, it might cause trouble

42
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,999
You know what I'm talking about

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,627
I know that's why

44
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,922
If we don't take care of them they might run away in the night like you did.

45
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,050
Your son will be stolen from right before your eyes.

46
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:23,054
Are you saying I stole your son, mom?

47
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:28,518
Jeju Island is so small that it is prone to trouble.

48
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,187
Why are you pretending to be so considerate?

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,148
He was just a boy. They played together for a while and then separated.

50
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,733
Let them be

51
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,112
Once they've had enough fun they'll stop so why bother?

52
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,863
You know there's nothing you can do

53
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,493
The men in the Liang family are all fools from generation to generation.

54
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,036
It's all about right and wrong, black and white

55
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,497
I am the evil bitch they call me.

56
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,125
Leave them alone

57
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,337
No one would stay with a beggar out of sympathy

58
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,685
Is it mackerel today?

59
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,771
It feels so good to be pitied by others

60
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,357
My life is full of charity

61
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,111
If it's out of pity, I'd rather feed a beggar

62
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:25,408
The school always gives me the leftover milk powder

63
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,201
I have to be grateful

64
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,872
Do you think I gave you fish these ten years out of pity?

65
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,333
Then why did you give it to me?

66
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,210
Do you think I served as your henchman for ten years because I felt sorry for you?

67
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,087
Then why did you give it to me?

68
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,882
It's time to tell the reason

69
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,261
Where are you looking?

70
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,597
Look at me when you talk to me!

71
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,684
You just know that you give me food and never do anything else.

72
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:56,022
Was it your grandmother who told you to give me the fish and keep quiet?

73
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,734
Did she tell you not to talk to me so we wouldn't...

74
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,161
You little bastard! You are so bad!

75
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,541
Would you kiss a little asshole?

76
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,751
You kissed me!

77
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,294
I won't kiss a beggar.

78
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,088
Originally

79
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,257
Who would say that they like someone like that?

80
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,801
I won't live with my grandma.

81
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,010
I want to spend time with you

82
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,971
Seriously

83
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,226
Who would kiss someone so close and then say something like...

84
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,353
Stop whining!

85
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,606
I don't know what's wrong with me. I can't hear anything you're saying.

86
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,401
I can only see your grumbling mouth, what can I do?

87
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,153
You're just a selfish kid who puts his hand in my pocket

88
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,447
Why are your lips so shiny? I put something on them!

89
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,490
Why? To prepare

90
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,408
What?

91
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,914
I've been preparing for this moment since I was 14!

92
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,272
(Playful First Love)

93
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,941
This year's Jeju Rapeseed Flower Festival is held again

94
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,776
Jeju Island is full of tourists

95
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,904
People gather here to enjoy the beauty of rapeseed flowers

96
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:31,617
This year, the rich couple activities have attracted everyone's attention.

97
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,745
Let's interview some tourists.

98
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,665
Hi, can I ask you a few questions?

99
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,168
Are you here to enjoy the flowers today?

100
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,752
What do you think of these flowers?

101
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,257
These flowers remind me of my first love

102
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,800
First love is predictable, right?

103
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,718
(Love you so much)

104
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,886
Then you go with her.

105
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,681
Huilan is so dirty

106
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,642
Are mom and dad your first love?

107
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:58,936
Yeah?

108
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,815
I don't know I forgot

109
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,526
Was he your first kiss?

110
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,444
Are you crazy?

111
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,821
You are talking to your mother!

112
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,324
You must be crazy

113
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,533
Get out of here

114
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,453
The flower fields are so beautiful

115
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,705
Yes, our Jinhee is prettier than flowers.

116
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,500
Did you know that rapeseed flowers have a strong scent?

117
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,587
That tastes so sweet

118
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,592
It gives me a headache and I feel like I'm going to faint

119
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,683
I'm hungry!

120
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,770
Why haven't you eaten yet?

121
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,023
Can't you just get rid of this thing?

122
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,734
Dinner will be ready soon

123
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,035
Why are you watching such boring stuff?

124
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,084
(Marinated fried chicken)

125
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:15,221
If I had known then that spring would be the spring of my life

126
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,850
I will live my best life

127
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,354
I still can't marry you

128
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,280
Just because today's training was too hard...

129
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,282
Shut up and go your way

130
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:06,564
At eight in the morning I met that bald young man

131
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:15,031
I can't wait to see if I can see him again tomorrow

132
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,952
Shunnan was just eating

133
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:24,332
Now it's gone

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,337
Shunnan was just eating

135
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,883
Now he's hiding.

136
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,009
Got you!

137
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,597
Spring is so unpredictable

138
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,151
It started to get warmer, then turned cooler.

139
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,281
I just felt cold and then it got hot again

140
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,745
The speed of change is staggering

141
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,293
What did we do wrong?

142
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:11,921
Minyu

143
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,551
Morally speaking

144
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,303
I've never been married

145
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,099
At least my marriage history is clean.

146
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,016
Minyu

147
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,687
Why should I take care of your deceased wife's children?

148
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,647
Are you serving the little ancestor?

149
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,108
Why hide it?

150
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,443
Wait till next year when you...

151
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,410
Are you serving the little ancestor?

152
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,393
Mom, Zhong Jiu is your eldest grandson

153
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,729
Even if he is a jerk, it can't change this fact.

154
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,523
Zhong Jiu will take care of you, including your funeral arrangements.

155
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,984
What's wrong?

156
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,944
Is there anything on your mind?

157
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,821
So what?

158
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,324
You've been working like a slave for that family and now you want to beg us for something?

159
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,619
Grandma, do you have your own room?

160
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,831
Do you sleep and eat in the same room?

161
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,167
It's so difficult at home.

162
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,086
You should find a job in a factory or be a helper or something.

163
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,672
Why do you want to take care of outsiders?

164
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,634
Do they pay you enough to do this?

165
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,595
That's not enough to live on.

166
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,388
Just buy some rice cakes

167
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,848
What's next?

168
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,349
You are a bookworm, right?

169
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,144
Do you want to go to a university that even Jong-gu can't attend?

170
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,105
What?

171
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,900
Do you want to go to college?

172
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,071
Mom, we are in this situation, do you still have savings to give her?

173
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,450
Let that family pay for the maid's tuition to go to college!

174
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,452
We would rather let the rice go bad

175
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,954
I won't feed it to a runaway dog.

176
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,209
Why do you take it down?

177
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,169
This is not yours! Why are you doing this?

178
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,796
These are not yours at all!

179
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,674
Do you want me to live here with a picture of my dead wife on my head?

180
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,887
Shun Nan Shun Feng What were you doing when she took down the photo?

181
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,347
Are popsicles really that delicious?

182
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,849
Did you see what this girl did?

183
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,560
She started to act like a spoiled child and tried to pull them to her side!

184
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,814
You shouldn't have just bought four popsicles.

185
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,232
Why should I buy five?

186
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,400
Do I have to please your deceased wife's child?

187
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,611
Minyu, forget it.

188
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,696
You need to be more reasonable.

189
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,156
Minyu

190
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,033
Forget it

191
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,576
Give me my money

192
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,745
Even if you beg me to stay I will leave

193
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,163
etc.

194
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,749
Did you borrow money from your child?

195
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,417
Minyu!

196
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,211
Am I that kind of person?

197
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,629
I have never…

198
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,381
Give me the tuition

199
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,467
You said you would send me to college if I helped you take care of the kids

200
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,678
I see

201
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,848
He took care of you when you had nowhere to go

202
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,474
Now you want money?

203
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,352
Give me the money you promised!

204
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,231
I also sold cabbage, how could you not pay me?

205
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,609
You even swore to my mother that you would not lie to me!

206
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,903
What's there to be afraid of when your wife is dead?

207
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,030
He is afraid that the child will grow up too fast

208
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,198
Minyu!

209
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,869
He will have his third child next year.

210
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,954
Why should I pay you tuition?

211
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,375
More importantly, Lian Bingzhe was extremely poor.

212
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,963
Some people also said that he lived with me because he couldn't pay the debt.

213
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,048
What is Luo Minyu doing? I'm giving you face, Bingzhe!

214
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,267
Don't you understand? He lied to you.

215
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,395
You can only rely on yourself now

216
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,859
That's right, you can only rely on yourself now, who else can you rely on?

217
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,072
Everyone is on their own in life

218
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,241
Welding is the most promising field at the moment

219
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,037
The boss can teach you skills, give you food, give you money, and let you serve the country.

220
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,497
This is the best way out for you

221
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,958
And you can go to the Peninsula like you always wanted

222
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,001
(Busan City employs female welders)

223
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,839
After a few years of apprenticeship

224
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,925
You can get 15,000 won every month

225
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,678
The factory provides food and accommodation, so you don't have to spend money

226
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:35,017
You will send us half of your salary every month.

227
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,644
Every month

228
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,691
You have to pay back your eldest grandson's debt

229
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,070
Zhong Jiu will definitely help you find a good husband

230
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,451
Being born as a cow is better than being a woman in Jeju Island

231
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,829
My mom said so.

232
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,585
It was Jong-Ku who helped your father organize the ancestral worship ceremony.

233
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,671
What do you know?

234
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,173
Zhong Jiu's meal is getting cold

235
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,008
I don't want to work in a factory

236
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,593
I'm not going

237
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,515
I won't pick up the pieces for my younger siblings or my eldest grandchild.

238
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,308
Not for anyone

239
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,352
Where can you go if you don't work?

240
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:22,147
Do you want to live in this little house and cause us trouble?

241
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,234
I won't. I won't.

242
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,945
If I continue to live like a fool...

243
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,281
My mom will cry.

244
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,369
Love Pure

245
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,579
Think about it

246
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,873
Your mother is gone.

247
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,292
Okay?

248
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,964
There is no place in the world that can treat you well.

249
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,535
How many rooms are there in your house? Can you convince your grandma?

250
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,414
You can't beat her, can you?

251
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,293
What's wrong? Who made you angry again?

252
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,295
He asked me to go to Busan

253
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,256
He asked me to work in a factory!

254
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,800
I don't have a home anymore

255
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,847
Soon-nam and Soon-bong were bribed by Popsicle

256
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,850
My grandma's family went bankrupt

257
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,897
There is no warm place in the world that wants me

258
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,858
The only person in the world who cares about me

259
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,611
It's you, Liang Kuanzhi

260
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,488
so…

261
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,159
How could I be like this?

262
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,371
Why do I have to end up with the islanders?

263
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,213
This is a silent protest

264
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,925
The everlasting nostalgic handkerchief

265
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,052
Waving to the blue sea

266
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,014
I'm going to marry in Seoul no matter what.

267
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,725
A pure heart is like...

268
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,188
A pure heart is like a wave swaying in the wind

269
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,441
Especially a man who doesn't even know what "nostalgia" is

270
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,359
Absolutely not!

271
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,611
The first will…

272
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,280
Who will it be?

273
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,452
The first person to leave his sorrowful thoughts hanging in the air

274
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,331
Even if you know what "nostalgia" is, what can you do?

275
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,375
Can I go to college?

276
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,793
Can I be a poet?

277
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,503
Can I go to the Peninsula?

278
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,340
I can't give you all

279
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,680
But there's one thing I can do for you anyway

280
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,098
Come on

281
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:06,145
Can't you just give me everything?

282
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,731
Tell me you'll give me the moon and the stars!

283
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,236
How can I live with this kind of person?

284
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,322
I don't know I can't lie

285
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:23,203
You can't beat your grandma, can you?

286
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,753
This is a silent protest

287
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,338
Shut up

288
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,387
This is a silent protest

289
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,055
Stop talking!

290
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,100
The ever-nostalgic handkerchief...

291
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,787
You don't have to fight to win.

292
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,125
Even if you are professional wrestler Jin Yi

293
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,170
If you can hide, don't fight.

294
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,412
Maybe I'm running away but what's mine is mine

295
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,452
Your grandma might want to put me in jail.

296
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,429
You won't regret it, will you?

297
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,723
Once we leave Jeju Island by boat

298
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,267
There is no way out

299
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,894
Don't do that!

300
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,647
There is no retreat in life

301
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,402
If your life and my life become one

302
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,654
No matter life or death, we must stick together to the end

303
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,410
If you're scared, leave now.

304
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,288
Go home!

305
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,920
My 19 years of life...

306
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,968
I've never been so excited.

307
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,521
How fast can you run 100 meters? 24 seconds?

308
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,815
Forget it, let's go

309
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,699
Who can stop the influx of water?

310
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,827
(Special campaign to prevent women from running away from home)

311
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,870
Spring in Jeju Island

312
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,081
It seems always

313
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,458
Arrived extra early

314
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,804
To commemorate the bloodless May 16 military coup in Seoul Spring

315
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,057
Events are being organized across the country

316
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,558
to this end…

317
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:14,893
That Spring

318
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,356
That coup was as ambitious as their first trip...

319
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,652
Even if the country faces threats from North Korea's Kim Shin-jo and others

320
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,028
The President decided...

321
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,198
…but it’s not what they expected

322
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,908
Provincial ID card

323
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,080
Provincial ID card

324
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,167
If you don't have your ID, we will treat you as members of the Jin Dynasty.

325
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,546
Didn't you say you are an adult?

326
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,005
Take out your ID card.

327
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,009
Why are you sitting in the corner looking scared?

328
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,594
What do you mean?

329
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,221
I didn't understand

330
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,099
Excuse me

331
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,725
Are you underage?

332
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,271
Sir?

333
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,190
You are a runaway child.

334
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,902
How come you like her?

335
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,113
What do you mean?

336
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,115
I don't know what you're talking about

337
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,994
Kids nowadays have no shame

338
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,246
How dare you get on the boat by yourself?

339
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,584
So throw us overboard?

340
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,546
Throw us overboard.

341
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,549
What's your attitude?

342
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,927
Is your family rich? Is your father a politician?

343
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,473
Throw us overboard.

344
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,894
What's up? Who are you?

345
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,395
What?

346
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,147
Who are you?

347
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,565
couple

348
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,027
What?

349
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,362
We are a couple

350
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,242
How can we, the children of married adults, get married?

351
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,744
Let's go, dear.

352
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,563
Who are you?

353
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,190
couple

354
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,571
How to deal with this?

355
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,115
Why are you so rude to us?

356
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,909
Are these really yours?

357
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,994
Are people in Busan so rude when treating guests?

358
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,287
We are all adults.

359
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,539
Were these stolen?

360
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,957
It's his grandmother's.

361
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,259
I want to see your ID cards.

362
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,343
Lost

363
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,844
you do not say

364
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,721
It's strange that it's not lost

365
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,099
I was born in early 1949

366
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,267
Tiger?

367
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,310
Yes, it is the Year of the Ox!

368
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,773
What's wrong with you? Was this stolen?

369
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,151
Are you thieves? We ran away from home

370
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,956
(Nanpuso Hotel)

371
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,544
We have neither provincial ID nor citizenship certificate

372
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,089
Our wallet was stolen.

373
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,883
So I'm penniless

374
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:36,928
Take it out

375
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,316
We can use this to book a room first

376
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,776
Is it not possible?

377
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,405
Just bet here?

378
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,489
Newlyweds?

379
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,326
You look like a newlywed couple.

380
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,161
Are you here for your honeymoon?

381
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,832
fine

382
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,667
I can pay you tomorrow.

383
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,588
You are so generous! Are we running a charity?

384
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,341
Your wallet was stolen on your honeymoon.

385
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,176
It must be very sad

386
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,513
You want to give us a room?

387
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,018
Don't be upset about getting robbed

388
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,812
Busan people are very generous

389
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,669
You can try to be tough with her.

390
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,296
Is your grandma that scary?

391
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,507
I'm not afraid of her

392
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,094
Rather than facing her and being an unfilial descendant

393
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,679
Wouldn't running away be so bad?

394
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,391
I'm not afraid of grandma

395
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,102
OK

396
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm afraid she won't let you down.

397
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,327
You really can

398
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,830
Give up athletics?

399
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,041
I wasn't that great.

400
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,712
The reason for doing that is free milk and bread

401
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,214
Are you a pig?

402
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,056
You are going to take the college entrance examination

403
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,184
I go to work in a factory

404
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,281
Do you know why I married Liang Kuanzhi?

405
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,450
The least cool boy in Jeju Island?

406
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,455
Iron Man

407
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,124
You're like an iron man.

408
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,464
We may go hungry but you'll never break my heart

409
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,553
Even if someone gave me a golden axe or a silver axe

410
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,305
The iron axe is mine

411
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,891
The iron axe is the real thing

412
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,020
No one will give you a golden axe or a silver axe

413
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,190
You're really uncool.

414
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,411
You said we were married.

415
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,124
Is this reasonable?

416
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,589
How can this be a couple?

417
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,473
Leung Kuan Chi

418
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:14,896
Excuse me

419
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,206
Why are you so happy? Your ring was stolen and she also took your yellow dress

420
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,961
The woman from Kuanzhi's family

421
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,755
Even the golden frog was taken away

422
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,342
Her golden frog and her son were stolen

423
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,764
Is that what makes you happy? Do you find it funny?

424
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,643
That kid's grandmother almost fainted

425
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,395
God, they are so brave.

426
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,481
How did you think of escaping to Busan?

427
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,776
Rumor has it that they made quite a scene on the ship.

428
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,282
They said it was Aichun who was behind this.

429
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,371
Aichun is a bit romantic, right?

430
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,874
They are lovers who eloped.

431
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,333
Can romance be eaten?

432
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,462
Once they are hungry, they will start to hate each other

433
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,381
What if I'm hungry?

434
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,677
At their age, happiness is to be together all day long

435
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,346
Eat oranges together on the floor heating

436
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,640
Minyu

437
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,768
Have you ever been happy?

438
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,188
I don't remember eating oranges with you.

439
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,400
Then eat now.

440
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,069
Is anyone home?

441
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,286
Write down what she was wearing when she left. I heard she stole your clothes.

442
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,455
Are you going to chase them?

443
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,874
You look like a bounty hunter, this suit suits you

444
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,709
Where can I find them?

445
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,628
You'll never find them.

446
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,466
Stop talking nonsense and write it down. I don't know what she is wearing.

447
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,009
What?

448
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,845
I'm just a door-to-door salesman with a lot of clothes

449
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,101
Today is their first night

450
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,771
Shut your stinky mouth!

451
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,067
People in Busan are very generous, right?

452
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,155
This is a Busan specialty.

453
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,367
It would be a pity not to try it

454
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,913
Is it really included in the room rate?

455
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,249
Busan is a big city.

456
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,544
The floor is now hot too

457
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,715
Have a few glasses of soju and have a good sleep.

458
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,635
Lying tipsy on the warm floor

459
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,347
Melting like butter on a pan

460
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,725
But don't melt right away

461
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,187
Take your time

462
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,691
You know what I mean.

463
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,946
Is today your wedding night?

464
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,451
Look at you! Your faces are all red. Let's get straight to the point.

465
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,704
You guys have come to the right place.

466
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,290
Even an illiterate person can master the Four Books and Five Classics by heart when he leaves here!

467
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,542
Lady boss!

468
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,168
Oh my god

469
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,628
Please respect yourself

470
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,553
Have fun

471
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,446
Have fun

472
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,991
Have fun!

473
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,837
Selling river clam soup

474
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,675
Selling river clam soup

475
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,638
Selling river clam soup

476
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,434
Hey, it's nice to be here.

477
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,904
Is the bathroom clean?

478
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:34,822
clean?

479
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,240
Um

480
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,534
Can be used

481
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:41,871
etc.

482
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,581
Did you do this?

483
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,759
I think the screw is loose.

484
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,847
Then forget it.

485
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,933
What if they make us lose money?

486
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,311
Busan people are very generous

487
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,412
(Total bill: 640 KRW)

488
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,040
Didn't she say everything was included in the price?

489
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:26,958
What?

490
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,462
What's this?

491
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,964
What's this?

492
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,383
It hurts

493
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,393
What?

494
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,562
What's going on?

495
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,359
What? What happened?

496
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,072
What went wrong?

497
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,199
What's our luggage?

498
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,118
Where's our luggage? Luggage?

499
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,454
Didn't anyone else get robbed?

500
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,665
No strange guests?

501
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,916
What are you doing?

502
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,835
What?

503
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,504
No kidding, pay.

504
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,799
Room service is extra and there is a fee for a broken fan bracket

505
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,718
The broken stent is the evidence

506
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,261
How could it break? Yes!

507
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,555
It was a thief who broke in in the dark...

508
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:25,099
We know! You broke the bracket.

509
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,601
You guys did it.

510
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,518
How could it be us?

511
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,313
Maybe someone among the guests saw it.

512
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,397
Then go ask.

513
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,107
Wouldn't that let them know there was a theft?

514
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,359
Maybe your wife saw something.

515
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,527
Right door?

516
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,780
I've never seen any luggage.

517
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,617
You came here empty-handed.

518
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,701
Come here

519
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,620
Hey what?

520
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,289
Did you see these guys bring in their luggage?

521
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,542
What are you waiting for?

522
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,962
This is one of the packages.

523
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,505
This one is dropped on the ground.

524
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,800
We feel sorry for you because you don't even have a piece of luggage

525
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,969
Now you want us to give you one?

526
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,390
We took the keys after dropping off our luggage yesterday

527
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,850
You must be very sad

528
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,729
So why not call the police directly?

529
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,856
Ask us to call

530
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,734
Tell them you two ran away from home?

531
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,320
People in Busan are so generous

532
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,074
This is a Busan specialty.

533
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,493
It would be a pity not to try it

534
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,621
(Busan police during the anti-espionage security awareness campaign)

535
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,501
(Missing Persons)

536
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,294
(Liang Kuanzhi, 19 years old, handsome)

537
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,088
(Wu Aichun, female, 18 years old, vixen)

538
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,090
right

539
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,472
Madam, you are looking for a needle in a haystack.

540
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,892
How can we find a child who has made up his mind to run away from home?

541
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,188
The phone is running out of money, mom.

542
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,607
Stop telling me your dreams.

543
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,693
I have to hang up. Bye.

544
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,528
Dream interpretation?

545
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,326
How could a rooster kidnap a child?

546
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,247
Do you want to eat chicken?

547
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,082
Cluck

548
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,417
Newlyweds?

549
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,127
This is the chicken you ordered.

550
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,504
enjoy it!

551
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,131
Do you think I'm a fool?

552
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,591
Think you can fool me?

553
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,802
How could you be so kind to give us a room and wine?

554
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,429
Maybe you're after our luggage or our money?

555
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,596
Stop arguing

556
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,266
We're calling the police now.

557
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,020
Have the police call your mother in Jeju Island and ask her to come over

558
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,688
I need to teach this girl a lesson.

559
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,732
How did you know we were from Jeju?

560
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,363
Let's go, let's leave.

561
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,824
Just think of it as my bad luck and so on!

562
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,618
How do you know we are from Jeju?

563
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,706
Do you want us to call the police and have a thorough investigation of you?

564
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,665
Ferry Tickets

565
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,710
Did you see the ferry ticket in the stolen luggage?

566
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,087
You pig brain

567
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,505
You pig brain

568
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,633
My suitcase

569
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,928
Our bags!

570
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,722
Give it back to us!

571
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,558
That's all we have left.

572
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,105
My mom's photo is still in that suitcase

573
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,940
My suitcase

574
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,694
You kept the room heated and kept pouring us drinks.

575
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,448
Let us melt like butter just to steal our luggage!

576
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,950
They also stole those towels

577
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,162
(Subong-dong Sauna, Nampo Barber Shop, Central Sauna)

578
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,246
You thief!

579
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,415
A bad guy who steals things

580
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,417
Do you have any evidence?

581
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,170
You saw our ticket.

582
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,463
So what?

583
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,798
Do you have evidence?

584
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,715
Do you have evidence?

585
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,635
If you know what's going on, leave now.

586
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,305
Otherwise we will sell you to a remote place.

587
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,184
If you know what's going on, leave now.

588
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,231
All we have are those bags.

589
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,195
That's the only photo of my mother.

590
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,990
The golden frog is also in it

591
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,829
We are not beggars.

592
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,707
We are like those kids in the storybooks

593
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,961
Lured by bread crumbs and caught by the witch

594
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,256
I don't know what you're talking about

595
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,134
Candy House Adventures

596
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,928
I haven't heard of it

597
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,852
I always thought they were stupid.

598
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,896
I lose my soul when I see food

599
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,358
I had no idea I was going to be killed.

600
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,532
What happened to those kids?

601
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,451
Did they survive?

602
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,536
Killed

603
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,122
The witch killed them?

604
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,039
no

605
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,500
They killed the witch.

606
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,755
Those children...

607
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,593
Throw the witch into the oven

608
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,137
Burned her alive

609
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,598
Love Pure

610
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,141
They killed her

611
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,187
Took away all her treasures

612
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,232
Lived happily ever after

613
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:27,902
Wu Aichun

614
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,529
Those kids are amazing.

615
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,465
It's all included in the room rate.

616
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,550
Busan people are very generous

617
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,428
Have a drink in a warm room

618
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,556
You'll melt like butter in a pan

619
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,935
This is…

620
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,520
What's going on?

621
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:04,855
hateful!

622
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,566
Some crazy people came yesterday

623
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,276
It caused a lot of chaos!

624
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,488
Carry me on your back

625
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,405
alright

626
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,323
hurry up

627
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,576
Those little bastards moved in and made a scene.

628
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,412
I wanted to strangle them but I let them go.

629
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,748
We're really nice people, you know?

630
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,357
What's going on?

631
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,027
Excuse me

632
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,406
I don't need more free stuff

633
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,323
Free stuff…

634
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:00,202
If you get drunk they'll rob you she said you'd melt like butter right?

635
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,454
What do you mean?

636
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,457
Don't turn off the lights at all costs

637
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,101
Why isn't that girl asleep yet?

638
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,112
We won't make any money tonight.

639
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,407
Charge her double the amount for the liquor

640
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,301
First, find the photo of Jinwa and my mom, understand?

641
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,554
Let’s find our own things first.

642
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,182
If we can't find it, shall we just take their cash box?

643
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,896
No matter how you look at it, we are the ones who suffer.

644
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,522
That golden frog is worth much more

645
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,399
We're not stealing.

646
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,824
That's all our future is, right?

647
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,079
Wide planting

648
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,165
You are the head of the family now, okay?

649
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:37,675
baby

650
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:43,931
baby

651
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,230
come on

652
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:21,343
Not here

653
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,053
Not there

654
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,073
Don't take the cash box like that.

655
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,200
Cash Box

656
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,302
let's go

657
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,513
Come on, I'll buy you another one.

658
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:07,866
Hey!

659
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,203
Cash Box Hey Lady!

660
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,120
Put down your things

661
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,290
Put the cash box down in 24 seconds

662
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,376
Damn it, put the cash box down, you bastard!

663
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,670
Otherwise I'll beat this girl up!

664
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,674
I'm fine, go away!

665
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:24,925
Walk!

666
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:25,843
Go!

667
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:29,054
Do you want us to sell this girl to some godforsaken place?

668
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,850
Madam boss, you're pressing on my stomach

669
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,644
My stomach

670
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,480
Put the things down and I'll let her go.

671
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,232
Come to my place and drop off your stuff!

672
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,608
come over

673
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:47,865
Okay, relax a little.

674
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,324
I'm dying! Hey, stop it.

675
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,368
Put your stuff down now!

676
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,744
Boss lady, look at that bastard

677
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,622
Okay, go ahead.

678
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,500
Put your stuff down! Just run away, asshole

679
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,543
Let's go, asshole.

680
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,545
Walk!

681
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,591
Really!

682
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,509
I told you to put your stuff down asshole!

683
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,137
Yes, well done.

684
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,891
What the hell is he doing?

685
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,903
My mother's first love was karate master Cui Peida

686
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,533
As for my mother, she is a professional wrestler named Jin Yi.
