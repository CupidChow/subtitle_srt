00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,982
《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,193
Be careful

3
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,278
One Two

4
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,072
Be careful

5
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,365
Even though there is a long way to go...

6
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,495
Sorry for bothering you, Master!

7
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,456
It's really annoying! Be gentle!

8
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:25,460
...your biggest trouble is right in front of you

9
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,630
- Can you lift it?
- One Two

10
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,050
Is it necessary to move it up there?

11
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,969
Even if I move it up there's nowhere to put it.

12
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,597
It's just such a big place
Would you want to sleep with something this big?

13
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,975
This is the furniture I got married with.

14
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,144
My first set of furniture

15
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,523
Since you live in a small place, you should bring less things.

16
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,360
What era is it in which people still have this kind of mother-of-pearl wardrobe?
It’s all covered…

17
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,986
This was done in Tongyeong.

18
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,405
Okay, let's move.

19
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,324
- Move it up!
- Move it up

20
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,283
good!

21
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,409
- One more person
- good

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,744
Pour it down

23
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,789
Oh my god!

24
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,792
Why on earth should we move?

25
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,753
- Is that damn girl the only child in the family?
- "Dead girl"?

26
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,756
Zhelong's sister is a ticket seller
And give him pocket money.

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,882
That damn girl...

28
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,803
Is my sister the pillar of the family?
She's a bottomless pit.

29
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,513
- Damn
- "Damn it"?

30
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,016
Why are you always so mean to me?

31
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,144
You'd better fix your hair.

32
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,147
Did you go to school to be funny?

33
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,025
- pull
- Get ready to pull up!

34
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,610
bring it on

35
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,711
What's going on?

36
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,591
Oh no

37
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,265
What's going on? Is it going to become a shoe closet now?

38
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,856
What about your aunts?

39
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,569
They moaned when I was circumcised
Where are all the people now?

40
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,238
They are busy with the Olympics.

41
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,493
I really don't understand
What are they getting involved in with the Olympics?

42
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,371
People say that Haenyeo represents Jeju Island

43
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:30,001
Because of this relationship
They quickly reconciled with the government.

44
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,795
What else can we do if we can't reconcile?

45
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,593
Where are you going? The exam is coming up soon.

46
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:44,098
Do you want me to waste money on college too?
Is moving into a smaller house next?

47
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,312
What about the wardrobe?
That’s the first set of furniture you bought when you got married!

48
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,815
What? Will I let you starve?

49
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,026
Why do you always talk about money?

50
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,070
Don't waste electricity!

51
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,863
Going to Zhelong’s house again?

52
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,621
come over

53
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,263
That's better.

54
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,764
Better

55
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,935
I will also use your favorite prints to decorate the living room

56
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,104
The skin has started to peel off.

57
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,358
The place you chose is just right for the wardrobe

58
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,652
As soon as you get home, you can hang up your clothes

59
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,820
This connection is perfect

60
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,240
You are a smart person so you pick the perfect things.

61
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,076
How come you're so talkative all of a sudden?

62
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,496
Do you want patterned curtains?

63
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,624
Just call the home furnishing store

64
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,586
- Call...
- It doesn't matter

65
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,715
I like this place

66
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,222
That's the wardrobe.

67
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,059
It holds a special place in my heart.

68
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,478
That's why I'm anxious

69
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,066
Are you laughing now?

70
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,194
Have you ever lived in an apartment?

71
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,197
Can you get used to living in such a crowded place?

72
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,617
Where should the blanket be hung and where should the sauce jar be placed?

73
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,203
I never cared where I lived.

74
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,082
Whether it's at your parents' house
Or a one-bedroom rental

75
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,668
Wherever you are, that's home

76
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,340
You should marry a rich man.

77
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,426
Wu Aichun loves reading and pretending to be shy

78
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,554
You were born to be a rich wife.

79
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,893
All the ladies in Dodong-ri are jealous of me

80
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,396
Who can live in the flower fields here?

81
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,941
Really

82
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,445
This wallpaper is too outdated.
Where did you get it?

83
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,698
Even though there is a long way to go...

84
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,909
Let go and you'll be stuck.

85
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,912
Your greatest joy

86
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,498
Right before your eyes

87
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,628
You gave everything to your child.
Now I'm back to set up the stall

88
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,259
As stubborn as Guangli

89
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,719
"Aichun and Three Aunts" is actually a good name

90
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,012
(Auntie Seafood House)

91
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,224
I didn't pay, why should I put my name on it?

92
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,601
I don’t want it, I really don’t want it!

93
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,480
After so many years, can face still be used to make a living?

94
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,234
For so many years, I have been thinking about worthless things

95
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,280
You should charge me for setting up a stall here

96
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,365
Why don't you charge me?

97
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,702
Let me make it clear that I only sell by-products

98
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,745
I will never steal your business!

99
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,376
Why are you like this again? Why?

100
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,962
How do you still have time to play ball?

101
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:43,880
Whatever

102
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,383
And that hair! Where did you get the money?

103
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,301
Whatever

104
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,511
What are you selling again?

105
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,808
Oh my God, you really make me unbearable!

106
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,269
- Whatever!
- She's soaking wet.

107
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,938
Turn off the tap quickly

108
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,940
Aichun's clock is broken

109
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,984
Take your hands away if it hurts you.

110
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,910
Where has he gone if he doesn't even eat?

111
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,913
Oh my god, he always goes to Cheol-ryung's house.

112
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,377
Children are easy to deal with, right?

113
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,965
No matter what you do
They will still come back to you and call you "Mom"

114
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,511
Don't bully them just because they are easy to deal with.

115
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:36,098
The gentle rain can also tear the tender leaves

116
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,230
Aunt

117
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,273
When will I grow up completely?

118
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,443
I'm not fully grown yet.

119
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,906
We haven't grown up yet...

120
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,450
Why did you buy a big one?

121
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,913
You are bribing us.
Let us take good care of your wife?

122
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,540
right

123
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,542
His interpersonal skills have improved

124
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,965
...but every time I feel the pain of growing up

125
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,260
We grew up a little

126
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,722
What's wrong?

127
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,724
Hey, I'll get it out later.

128
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,017
come out!

129
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,435
Where do we stand?

130
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,645
- Aunt!
- You're here

131
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,188
- Stand in the middle
- Stand in the middle

132
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,189
Hey come here

133
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,233
Okay, is that ok?

134
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,985
- etc
- What?

135
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,778
- bring it on
- Don't touch my hair.

136
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:34,115
Let’s talk about eggplant!

137
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,314
Didn’t I tell you not to set up a stall on the street?

138
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:10,318
I said I hate you eating on the street every day!

139
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,070
What is she writing here?

140
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,364
（Welcome!）

141
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:20,369
(Daily direct delivery from fishing boats, all-day market price)

142
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,377
There are always moments when the heart grows quietly

143
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,799
Seeing them because I'm on the street again
I swore to myself...

144
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:44,769
Never take away their dreams.

145
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:51,067
(No. 108, Bongcheon 5-dong, Song Young-sam)

146
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,240
Boarding houses near schools are expensive

147
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,533
(distant countries and neighboring countries)

148
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,451
(Liang Jinming)

149
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,287
Although there are many mountains here, it is good for health

150
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,830
(Interest rates soar
Japan's economic instability

151
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,626
But if you can fix the door...

152
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,844
He is just a child
What’s the big deal if kids come and go?

153
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,641
But if you could put a latch in there...

154
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,397
Don't you believe us? You're so funny!

155
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,401
People who lived here before
But I didn't say a word

156
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,445
He also asked him to come over and take care of him and said he was cute.

157
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,988
Come and have a look

158
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,616
Look how cute he is.

159
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,535
Right

160
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,831
He is cute

161
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,876
You know how hard it is to find a room or a boarding house?

162
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,003
It's more troublesome than finding an apartment.

163
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:58,300
We get to pick our tenants but you don't.

164
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,262
(Eternal Dream)

165
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,932
Maybe it's because Yongxin's family has a house in Seoul
She has so many dreams.

166
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,810
Everyone should be more flexible

167
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,772
So accommodating

168
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,984
- I have to be more flexible.
- This reminds me

169
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,446
I say this because
You reminded me of my daughter.

170
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,449
No boyfriend allowed
If you bring it here, I'll kick you out.

171
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,159
Park Chung-seop is not good

172
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,411
If you were my daughter I would break your legs

173
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,455
If I were like your daughter,

174
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:33,419
(No trespassing! Knock!)

175
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,307
Be quiet. If we get caught, we're doomed.

176
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:53,981
Hello?

177
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,275
Your son, Zhelong

178
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:57,943
In my house

179
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,695
Yes

180
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,784
TV series are being broadcast at this time.
My son hasn't left the room yet.

181
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,036
right

182
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,162
That's right

183
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,791
Zhelong is really cool

184
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:16,462
If you are so afraid of your father getting angry
Don't take the last place.

185
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,508
I got the last place in the exam.
Now I'm away from home

186
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,118
Why lock the door?

187
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,079
privacy

188
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,498
What the hell?

189
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,834
Get out of my room!

190
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,587
This is not your room.

191
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,964
Did you buy this house?

192
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,382
Whatever

193
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:05,261
Is this the only thing you can say? "Whatever"?

194
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,680
go out!

195
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,182
- You really don't understand
- What did you say?

196
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,067
So what should we do?

197
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,446
What should I do if you keep silent?

198
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,451
Let's just break up now.

199
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,161
If you really care about me...

200
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,663
I don't love you

201
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,082
Tell me how I can stop loving you!

202
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,876
So what should we do now?

203
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,169
Can you quit your job and take the teacher’s certificate exam?

204
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,546
I also have self-esteem

205
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,923
I have to marry someone better than Sister Shujing

206
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,551
Is your crappy painting more important than me?

207
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,178
Should I put egg cartons on the walls for soundproofing?

208
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,265
How are you going to convince my dad?
At least shave your beard!

209
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,559
Am I not better than your beard?

210
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,563
Dad, can you give me the biggest one?

211
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,148
Give the youngest one to your sister!

212
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,566
good

213
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,033
The key isn't there

214
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,660
Fushan, are you there?

215
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,288
- Fushan!
- Fushan!

216
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,458
Song Fushan!

217
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,510
He is in adolescence!

218
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,137
So what?

219
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,350
I still remember you secretly brought it to me before
Croaker, mackerel and sea bream?

220
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,521
Your mother was so angry that she said she wanted to die on the spot

221
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,651
Give

222
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:45,903
Hey

223
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,072
I can handle my mom.

224
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,823
I can handle her.

225
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:57,915
Wait a moment

226
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,501
Why are there two forks?

227
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,004
Why did my mother take two?

228
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,635
Fushan!

229
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,720
Song Fushan!

230
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,224
I must have chosen the wrong place.

231
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,269
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

232
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,437
Song Fushan!

233
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,397
Song Fushan!

234
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,398
(Military mail sent by Park Young-beom)

235
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,149
Hey Song Fushan! Open the door!

236
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,113
Fushan

237
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,533
- Hey, open the door!
- Open the door!

238
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,743
- Don't open the door?
- What?

239
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,537
- Open the door!
- Oh my god

240
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,789
Song Fushan!

241
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,124
Who are you?

242
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,756
Open the door quickly!

243
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,385
Are you crazy?

244
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,637
What are you doing?

245
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,854
Hey! Open the door!

246
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,944
Sir or Miss, can you save me this time?

247
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,362
My dad will really kill me

248
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,864
Please, just this once.

249
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,533
Just this once

250
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,453
The look of that long-haired man

251
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,457
Like a mole being chased by a hunter

252
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,339
So I agreed

253
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:37,681
Dad, I...

254
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,312
I wanted to send some buns.

255
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,940
See if you are used to living here.

256
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,692
Um

257
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,944
Why are you back so early?

258
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,238
How is the factory?

259
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,491
When have you ever cared about my factory?

260
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,911
This wardrobe looks small but it can actually hold a lot of things, right?

261
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,329
How's dinner, Dad?

262
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,791
Is it just the right size to put the quilt?

263
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,709
Of course it's not appropriate

264
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,424
"Of course not"?

265
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,718
In fact, that

266
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,720
I really have to go out

267
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,805
Did you know?

268
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,058
We provide wardrobes for tenants

269
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,436
She said she was leaving

270
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,440
Wait, there's my underwear in there...

271
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,818
Why open your tenant’s closet?

272
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,450
I really have to go out

273
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,120
Okay, let's go.

274
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,210
But why are you standing there?

275
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,047
that…

276
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,301
I just want to see the new tenants.

277
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,428
When have you ever cared about what’s happening at home?

278
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,223
You only care about whether you can go on a date

279
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,226
That's not the case...

280
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,354
Come out

281
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,149
Come out now

282
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,775
- Dad, that...
- Uncle Song

283
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,901
landlord…

284
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,404
Are you coming out on your own, or do I have to drag you out?

285
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,780
come out!

286
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,449
Zhelong comes out

287
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,494
Come on, didn't we agree to be gentle?

288
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,745
Park Cheol-yong!

289
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,331
come out!

290
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,499
Park Chung-seop!

291
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,126
Park Chung-seop!

292
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,551
Grandma Minyu said on her 60th birthday:

293
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,929
“Honestly speaking

294
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,850
The only place to hide at home is the closet."

295
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,731
sorry

296
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,194
Could you…

297
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,207
sorry

298
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,792
I'm really sorry

299
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:18,258
It's embarrassing, but this is our first meeting

300
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,139
You bastard, Zhelong, you little bastard

301
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,017
Did you know that your dad lost all his fingernails?

302
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,811
Working day and night in the wholesale market

303
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,773
How dare you run away from home

304
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,358
How do you...

305
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,448
Become smaller?

306
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,284
He became smaller

307
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,584
Zhelong?

308
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,353
Who is this?

309
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,985
you

310
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,404
Is it a girl?

311
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,035
Oh my god

312
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,855
This hair

313
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,274
What’s going on, classmate?

314
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,278
Did you cut it yourself? Were there any difficulties at home?

315
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,030
no

316
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,490
It's a punishment

317
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,705
that

318
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,583
Your school bag...

319
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,503
By the way, is that what "Liang Yinming" means?

320
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,255
Yes

321
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,425
Why is Yinming's name on your schoolbag?

322
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,302
Are you familiar with each other?

323
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,055
Is it cooked?

324
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,556
We are dating

325
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,602
Oh my god

326
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,147
- It's been 500 days
- Where's my feather duster?

327
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,816
You deserve 500 slaps!

328
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,152
You guys have been dating since elementary school.

329
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,904
- We are more disciplined.
- Hey!

330
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,072
Who told you that?

331
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:45,989
Aunt Qingyu!

332
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,241
Call Liang Qingyu over!

333
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,451
Love is not a sin!

334
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,036
What did you say, brat?

335
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,538
This is a silent protest

336
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,208
The everlasting nostalgic handkerchief

337
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,668
Waving to the blue sea

338
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,837
Ah, who is it?

339
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,547
The first person to be hanged...

340
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,675
At first, because of her hairy face
I don't really like her.

341
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,345
But after watching it for ten years

342
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,181
One day, I suddenly couldn't see

343
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,934
What can I do?

344
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,354
I don't want to hear this

345
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,564
Anyway, I am just a supporting role at home.

346
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,485
But she said I was the best
She likes me more than my brothers at home!

347
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:31,159
Are you really happy as a fool?

348
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,079
Liang Yinming is as love-minded as his father...

349
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,705
The problem is

350
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,334
I always like naughty boys

351
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,086
...but my taste in girls is different

352
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,175
but

353
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,011
You shouldn't run away from home.

354
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,139
Do your parents know?

355
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,433
They don't know yet

356
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,311
I came out this morning

357
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,980
Which school do you study in?

358
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,065
May I have your name?

359
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,609
No name?

360
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,112
Hmm...Hyun-sook

361
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,324
Can't Xiaoshu speak?

362
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,622
A virtuous husband

363
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,420
Hello

364
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,426
Why is your last name...

365
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,595
What's your last name?

366
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:34,973
right

367
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:36,933
I'm really impressed

368
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,354
Such a small town
How could a little love affair involve two generations?

369
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,440
It's because the place is small.

370
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:47,486
Such a small place
How come the children are exactly the same age?

371
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,740
He didn't come to help with the moving, and he didn't come to help with the Hinch either.

372

in other words

373
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,121
The two families looked at each other during pregnancy.

374
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,083
Xianshu, please don't step on feces

375
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,629
You must marry someone like this lady's husband
Okay?

376
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,467
Xianshu is also going to Daodongli Primary School, right?

377
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,388
We went to the same school for ten years in such a small place.
It's strange if you don't get close

378
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,684
You gave everything to your daughter.
But you don't care about your son, right?

379
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,187
Do you know what kind of kids your son plays with?

380
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,024
It would be strange if you don't know him.

381
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,027
There is an amazing girl in the girls' class

382
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,197
He would never mess with girls.

383

He can't even play with his own sister.

385
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,208
Are all sisters like this?
My sisters don't hang out with me.

386
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,572
But it's more a matter of taste than probability.

387
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,324
Taste is hereditary

388
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,997

389
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,417
I named my daughter

390
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,503
Xianshu means "virtuous" and Zhenshu means "chaste".

391
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,923
I like chaste people.

392
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,353

393
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,235
At least come in and say hello

394
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,528

Are you angry?

404
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,345
Are you really that angry now?

405
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,056

Can you?

410
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,777

I don't know her

525

529
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,904
So this relationship is dangerous
Maybe we'll be together someday.

534
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,376

535

You should just focus on writing your script, right?

536
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,132
How is it impossible? Are you brother and sister?

537
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:35,967
perhaps…

538
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,721
Our acquaintance was awkward.

539
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,602
Why would they go there?

540
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,729
Good times

541
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,689
I think…

542
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:55,278
I won't fall in love again
Especially the girl who sells tickets

543
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,282

544

- What?

547
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,969
- My family doesn't know
- What?

548
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,554
I'm back in Korea

549
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,432
The original plan was to come back at the end of the month.

550
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,309
So they don't know I'm here.

551
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,478
You're such a bad boy

552
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:30,938
Want to tell them?

553
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,357
May I?

554
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,777
You dare

555
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,697

557
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,214
Hey you guy!

558
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,633
Why did he just leave like that?

559
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,970
I chose this place because from above

560
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:07,225
You can see the largest Christmas tree in Korea

561
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,685
You won't see anything this big in the US.

562
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,899
If you live too close to the school
My friends will keep coming to me.

563
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,735
Rooms near schools are always in high demand

564
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,779
Landlords are very bossy

What's wrong?

572
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:33,918
You can't live here

573
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,754
Look at this place, it's like Harlem.

The brain is sick

577
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,722
Why did you choose such a dangerous place?

578
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,809
I can't sleep if you live in a place like this.

579
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,980
Why are they arguing on my way home?

580
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,864
That's an artist

581
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,201
Working in our theatre

582
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,078
Don't make a fuss

How can I not worry?

585
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,959
What's going on around here?

586
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,086
Everyone lives well.

587
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,756
You should move away and live somewhere else.

588
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,760
- My neighbor...
- Where to move?

589
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,345
Where to get to your apartment?

590

You don’t know Seoul…

591
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,849
You don't know Seoul.

592
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,059
You don't understand

593
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,316
I'm worried about you saying this.

594
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,695
You go back
I won't tell you where I live.

595
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,990
Now all of Korea is the Harlem serial killer...

596
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,366
Then you go back to America.

597
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,285
Go back you American

598
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,417

602

Open-mouthed dumplings are also edible

603
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,273
Guess why he bought dumplings?

604
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,235
Then why did you yell at him again?

605
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,363
Waste of money buying dumplings

606
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,323
Give it to him yourself.

(So it snowed heavily tonight)

616
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,584
Because you don't like money?

617
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,795
Because you are a noble artist, right?

618
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,842
Anyway, I'm not the one who's poor, so why should I talk about money?

619
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,595
Is it okay if I don’t care about money?

620
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,555
By your side

621
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,266
I have to think about money all the time

628
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,036
Is this what your art is all about?

Do you have anyone else?

640

Have you found another girl?

641
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,952

Then what do you want me to do?
If I ask you to stay, will you do it?

Why don't you speak?

664

You say something

665
