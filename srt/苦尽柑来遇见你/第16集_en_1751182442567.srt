《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,568
Can I have some more squid soup?

3
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,070
- no problem
- sure

4
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,160
Should we watch it or not?

5
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,746
“There was a village…”

6
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,206
welcome!

7
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,415
welcome!

8
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,003
Have to wait a moment

9
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,630
- We'll call you right away
- Thanks

10
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,634
Please wait

11
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,390
Ladies and gentlemen, I told you that the queue here is really long.

12
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,560
Finally, the bells began to ring deep in the forest

13
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,313
There is also the sound of swiping the card

14
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,442
It's because of Aichun that I can't retire

15
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,196
The "garbage dumplings" scandal has far-reaching consequences
Even the handmade dumpling shops were affected

16
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,114
(Handmade Dumpling Crisis)

17
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,491
The nightmare faced by chicken shops during the bird flu period

18
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,159
Now it's the dumpling shop's turn

19
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,244
Choi Ji-woo was here

20
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,662
I'll pack it for you.

21
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,581
Make you a delicious meal.

22
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,582
Open your mouth

23
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,877
Don't glare at customers who ask for extra squid soup

24
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,171
- Eat this
- Change your attitude

25
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,465
Your daughter-in-law is better than my daughter-in-law

26
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,426
I don't want it anymore. I give it to you, Grandpa.

27
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,720
Who are you giving it to?

28
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,682
Which grandpa do you want to give it to? Which one?

29
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,892
You're right.

30
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,524
How can you ask with your mouth open like this?

31
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,360
- Can we have some more squid soup?
- no problem!

32
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,611
- More soup
- Us too

33
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,529
(Squid Soup Unlimited)

34
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,905
Ok no problem

35
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,451
Hey, why did you put so many squids?
No wonder they always add

36
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,330
Add squid soup to the menu or you'll lose money

37
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,628
We have to hire some people. You can't stand this.

38
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,631
Who said I can't stand it?

39
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,385
Damn money makes my mom dance

40
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,555
Singing in the rain

41
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,015
In the rain…

42
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,392
Why did you go down the stairs like that?

43
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,269
Is menopause over?

44
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,397
I don't know it's weird

45
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,734
I'm so excited. Is this what it feels like to be rich?

46
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,195
We are so busy from morning till night every day

47
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,617
But as long as the cash register keeps ringing
It's not difficult to continue like this.

48
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,119
Are you happy?

49
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,706
Well, I'm very happy

50
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,419
God may be blessing us just for once.
That's why he was so stingy with us before

51
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,255
Takeaway during the World Cup

52
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,924
Domestic duty-free shops in Jeju Island

53
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,259
There is also "Love in Los Angeles" filmed in Jeju Island

54
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,305
The second-hand forum also helped us catch Zhelong

55
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,808
A female star recommended our restaurant
What is going on?

56
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:51,231
It feels like I've won a jackpot.

57
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,316
Dear, do you know?

58
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,776
I think we should go traveling

59
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,237
Go to Guam and China

60
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,281
That damn Mi-sook can play around everywhere
Why can't I?

61
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,370
Why do you keep saying "Damn Mi-sook"?

62
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:12,377
If every day is like this, I hope I can live for a thousand years

63
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,217
Singing in the rain

64
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,762
Singing in the rain

65
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,224
My hard-working parents
Worked in a field full of stones

66
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,520
Now I have become a landmark builder

67
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:47,203
(Authentic squid restaurant)

68
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,247
Damn Misook

69
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,833
How dare she call herself "authentic"?

70
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,169
Have you taken over all the squids in Jeju Island?

71
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,671
Do you have a patent?

72
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,843
Do you have any patents that you have inherited from others?

73
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,638
No wait, maybe it’s a patent for foot massage?

74
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,099
I've said

75
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,102
My toe was cramping!

76
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,520
Change the sign

77
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,105
Change the menu!

78
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,649
Let her be

79
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,609
I have to thank her instead

80
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,237
It's better for her to steal our business.

81
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,577
Really? Why?

82
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:32,457
The real thing always sells better next to the fake one

83
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,964
Boss, can I have some more squid soup?

84
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:40,965
OK, no problem

85
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,843
Please sign here

(Squid Casserole Soup 4,000 won)

87
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,221
There is a person

88
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,557
Even my mom can beat it.

89
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,267
Feeding my daughter

90
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,103
I said I would eat it myself!

91
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,314
I will

92
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,566
I want it!

93
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,860
I will also meet such people

94
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:01,903
mom!

95
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,322
That’s what I want!

96
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,909
Even at the age of 37, which is annoying
Still can't leave mom

97
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,582
Oh my god, stop it.

98
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,835
I know she's in her annoying four years
But how can this be?

99
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,046
I just fed her.

100
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,049
I fed her when she wanted to eat by herself

101
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,055
Saying Goodbye to "Mom"

102
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,682
Bye I'll be back soon!

103
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,519
I only have eyes for my children
Mom only has eyes for me

104
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,604
She lost weight

105
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,522
I'll be right back

106
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,818
She is such a cunning girl, she pretends to be shy

107
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,112
I can see a thousand expressions on my daughter's face

108
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,698
But I can hardly remember any expression of my mother

109
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,077
I didn't know

110
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,414
One day I remembered my mother

111
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,626
Only through her embarrassing photos

112
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,468
Oh my god, why are you so stubborn?

113
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,596
Why don't you listen to your mother?

114
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,017
Even if you are my granddaughter

115
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,856
If you make my daughter too tired
I'll still be a little unhappy

116
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,153
You are the most indifferent person in this world

117
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,030
But

118
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,285
The most precious person to me

119
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,710
Please be nice to my daughter.

120
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,466
Please take good care of my daughter.

121
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:47,884
Okay?

122
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:55,892
Go to sleep, go to sleep, rock and rock

123
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,563
Baby sleeps soundly...

124
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,398
I don’t know why…

125
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,608
What are you doing?

126
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,776
...it feels awkward to say "thank you"

127
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,820
Who asked you to clean here?

128
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,530
Why do you clean the bathroom?

129
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,824
Go back to sleep. You said you would take a rest today.

130
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,328
Mom, this is why I don't want you to help.

131
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,580
Hey, 37-year-old idiot

132
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,790
Just say thank you

133
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,585
I know what you are thinking just by looking at your eyebrows

134
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,254
Put her down

135
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,091
You said you need cupping on your back.

136
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,514
I swear

137
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,599
Xiaochun made me for the first time in my life

138
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,768
There is a feeling of counter-intuition

139
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,854
Why is she so stubborn?

140
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,856
She never says yes the first time.

141
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,068
You deserve it

142
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,945
Your daughter is exactly like you.

143
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,492
To be honest, you feel annoyed too, right?

144
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,078
How can you raise three children?

145
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:01,999
You can do whatever you want if you grab the drumstick.

146
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,086
You have to live for yourself so that you won't be full of resentment

147
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,798
If you always doubt whether it is worth doing this
I want to know if this is right

148
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,258
Even children can feel it

149
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,885
She can feel it just by looking at your face

150
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,181
You are Xiaochun's whole world now

151
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,144
but

152
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,606
This won't last long.

153
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,526
One day

154
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:33,197
You will become a background character in your child's life

155
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,827
So you can do whatever you want now.

156
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,582
Mom, do you have any regrets?

157
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,043
Things you wanted to do but couldn't

158
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,838
Everything I do is what I want to do

159
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,844
Orphan Wu Aichun Nanny Wu Aichun

160
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,721
There is also Wu Aichun who dropped out of high school

161
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,141
My most precious title is

162
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,561
Jinming and Yinming's mother

163
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,398
I live an extraordinary life in my own way

164
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,775
Don't feel sorry for my life

165
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,946
You know

166
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,449
Maybe I lack maternal instinct.

167
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,868
Sometimes I get really angry...

168
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,830
Yelling at the kids

169
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,915
I feel like I'm losing my mind

170
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,168
Who wakes up to be a mother?

171
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,671
Your children will grow and so will you

172
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,008
Koharu

173
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,011
Will you have to chew your meal 100 more times tomorrow morning?

174
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,055
Do you need to change clothes 10 more times?

175
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,725
Why do you have to bother me every morning?

176
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,685
Why?

177
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,815
If I eat earlier, you will leave earlier.

178
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,694
As long as I finish my meal and get dressed

179
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,863
You will go to work

180
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,910
Is that why you did that? You didn't want me to leave?

181
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:09,418
I'm sorry I yelled at you that day?

182
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,795
I'm really sorry.

183
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,588
come over

184
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,007
Oh my god

185
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,552
Mom loves you Xiaochun

186
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,013
I love Xiaochun so much, okay?

187
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,682
Kiss

188
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,768
My daughter is also growing up to be my mother

189
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:32,024
The mother wants her daughter to be with her child
It won't be too difficult

- Honey
- What's wrong?

195
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,045
You remember we have some money
Is this the money you saved to buy a piano for Xiaochun?

196
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,132
Can I give it to my parents?

197
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,802
I just feel

198
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,847
If you don't do this now, you'll regret it later.

What's wrong?

201
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,978
Why are you asking me this?

202
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,521
You just

203
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,690
Just make a decision

204
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,114
What are you doing? Should I take my socks off again?

205
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,249
Patient No. 109, please go to window No. 2

206
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,459
How much will that cost?

207
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,045
Are medical checkups in Seoul more expensive?

208
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:39,049
I have to pay first so you won't delay.

209
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,428
Parents should also respect their children

210
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,680
Please take care of yourself, okay?

211
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,098
I'll do a blood test

212
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,560
Dad, your knee has been hurting for so long.

213
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,146
Mom, cupping is not a panacea.

214
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,775
- How much for the two of us?
- I'll just do a blood test

215
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,909
Hey Yongjian!

216
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,744
I'm in Seoul

217
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,079
No, I can't go.

218
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,375
Because our life is good now...

219
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,460
That's right.

220
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,087
...He is learning the guitar folk guitar

221
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,132

222

No need to wait for me, you can continue with your class.

Your father never tried it.

225

Kim Kwang Seok is his idol

226
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,477
OK

227
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,356
He had a hobby for the first time in his life.

229
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,244
I said I should get rid of age spots.

230
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,372
When did you get so old?

231
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,875
No, I mean...

232
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,463
I don't want to go

233
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,592
What?

234
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,762
Is someone calling you over?

235
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:08,973
The problem is…

236
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,020
I shouldn't have built the retaining wall.

237
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,903
I shouldn't have built the retaining wall.

238
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,286
Bronze Ming…

239
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,998
I shouldn’t…

240
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,793

Dad kept calling for a long time...

247
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,355
Bronze Ming!

Copper Ming

253
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,253
...saw the cage that trapped my father

254
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:26,926

(Endoscopy Center)

256
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,348
“I shouldn’t have built the retaining wall.”

257
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,850
“I shouldn’t have gone there”

258
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,687
He said

259
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,817
Your father keeps repeating Tongming's name

260
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,570
Then I finally understood

261
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:51,575
Why have we never discussed Tong Ming?

262
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,330
that

263
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,958
I asked them when they were anesthetized.

264
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,293
But they let me out because it was done.

265
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,881
Dad, aren't you hungry? You can eat anything you want.

266
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,300
- Pork belly?
- Pork belly?

267
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,343
right

268
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,053
In their hearts...

269
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,475
There is a tomb

270
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,812
Tiny and grand

You really are

274
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,968
Is this what you've been running all this way for?

275
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,517
You thought I was coming tomorrow
So you choose to come here today?

276
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,519
Tomorrow is the day

277
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,523
I had a feeling you would come today so I followed you.

278
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,279
Tongming definitely hopes that both his parents will come

279
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,824
It's different

280
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,913
The whole family can visit their parents' graves together.

281
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,375
But where the child rests...

282
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,213
I can't look straight

283

00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:19,950
go home

He is the youngest child and we love him very much.

301
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,819
He's an angel.

302
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:04,036
At least we had this angel for four years

303
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,041
If I could, I'd still like to do it again

304
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,544
We'll see him again when we get up there.

305
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,174
The day to see him again is getting closer

306
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,097
I don't want

307
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,059
I don't want Tong Ming to see me after I die.

308
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,144
I pray every day

309
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,774
I hope Tong Ming will forget us completely.

310
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,151
Miss him like I do

311
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,569
If he were a person

Missing us...

313
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,329
I'm worried about whether he can bear it...
Can he bear to miss us?

314
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,596
When can I watch it?

Uncle Tongming

318
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,033
I told the children: "This is Uncle Tongming"

319
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,160
It feels so strange

320
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,496
It feels weird but...

321
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,416
I am very happy

322
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,169
Maybe Tongming will feel less lonely

323
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,046
You know, it's weird.

324
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,259
But I will feel like I am no longer a bad mother

325
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:49,016
How can you be a bad person by nature?

What about angels?

329
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:54,896
Um, what's wrong?

330
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,316
- You said Tong Ming is an angel

Is she going to be in the newspapers again?

Mom? She's right here.

341
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,724
I thought you wanted to talk to me.

342
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,642
right

343
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,561
She wants to find me, right?

344
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,398
good

345
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,154
What's up?

346
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,489

Really?

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,915
What? What's going on?

"I'm so sorry"

356
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,427
They just wanted to check again.

357
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,388
Maybe it's nothing.

Don’t I know my own body?

368
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,629
What we don't know is

369
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:49,094
The heart of steel is so fragile

370
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,894
- Mother
- Um

371
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,398
No matter what the doctor says, don't cry.

372
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,277
Your dad will be fine.

373
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,488
There is no better person in the world than your dad.

374
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,824
Mommy?

375
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,659
- Um?
- Do you believe me?

376
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,330
Even if he is sick, I will cure him.

377
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,957
Okay, I believe you.

378
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,168
I believe

379
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,919
So don't cry in front of your dad.

380
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,007
Dad was also a little shocked

381
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,388
You have long-standing rheumatoid arthritis

382
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,557
Enduring pain for too long

383
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,060
Symptoms of Multiple Myeloma

384
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,646
Sometimes misdiagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis

385
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,107
Leading to delayed diagnosis

386
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,487
Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer

387
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,448
You can think of it as a distant cousin of leukemia.

388
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,743
He hasn't learned a single pop song yet

389
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,788
Every time I see a girl group dad, I keep asking:

390
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,248
“Is this Sung Yuri?”

391
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,211
Dad just wants to talk to his daughter

392
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,631
He is also a guy who wants to play guitar

393
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,967
But I don't know or I pretend not to know

394
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,638
Those who can endure
Often seek medical attention only after the condition worsens

395
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:19,351
She has developed renal failure.
Don't you know?

396
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,478
You must be working very hard.

397
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,230
that…

398
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,025
What happens next?

399
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,903
In the current state

400
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:34,658
Can be dangerous if not treated promptly

401
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,536
This is the situation now

402
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,543
God is so cruel to my father

403
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,463
He just started to like Kim Kwang-seok

404
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,509
good

405
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,679
You don't need to pick us up.

406
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,599
Jinming, we haven't been here for just one or two days.

407
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,186
Don't do that. You'll tire yourself out.

408
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:23,957
come over

409
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,629
don’t worry

410
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,174
I will make sure you recover.

411
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,802
Everything will be fine

412
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,014
Let's go

413
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:58,533
24 chemotherapy sessions melted even the heart of steel

414
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,162
Mom forgot what season it was

415
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,665
Hey, Aichunhuahua, look at these flowers

416
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,754
These things make people poetic.

417
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,134
Have you written any poetry lately?
When can I read it?

418
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,722
You love flowers so much but you only look at my feet

419
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,933
I can't let you fall or there will be big trouble

420
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,646
Let's take a look together.

421
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,041
Next year we will go to Zhangjiajie to see the fallen leaves

422
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,544
Damn Mi-sook also went there and kept bragging

423
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,468
Why are you holding my hand so tightly?
Are you afraid that someone will snatch me away?

424
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,722
If you're not by my side, I'll have no one to rely on.

425
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,140
You know, right?

426
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,934
Yes, you have children.

427
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:06,976
No

428
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,146
They all have their own families now.

429
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,733
burden

430
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,236
Burden of Love

431
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:21,783
When I was a kid, I thought of you not having yellow croaker at your uncle's house.

432
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,744
I was so angry that I couldn't sleep

433
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,122
Since then

434
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,710
I have this burden in my heart

435
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,507
So you have to get better.

436
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,969
Single mothers are also a burden to their children

437
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,264
Don't let me die alone

438
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,226
Of course I can't leave you

439
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,442
I dare not leave baby Aichun alone

440
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:00,280
Dad's time passes like cherry blossoms

441
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,371
It's very uncomfortable, isn't it? Don't you feel sick?

442
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,040
Fortunately, it doesn't hurt too much

443
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,460
It must be painful.

444
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,086
How can it not hurt?

445
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,921
Mr. Leung Kwong Chik

446
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,839
exist

447
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,509
Can you drink this?

448
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,970
- Mr. Xu Zhiyuan
- exist

449
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,390
Did you have your blood tested?

450
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:32,103
Without them downstairs, let us come up first...

451
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,522
The process is written here.

452
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,232
Oh my god

453
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,151
- Please get out
- Feel sorry?

454
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,403
- go out
- this…

455
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,239
You can't just come in here and put them here

456
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,366
Okay, I didn't see it.

457
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,118
Write it here

458
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,953
(Please put the medical record on the shelf and wait)

459
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,790
Ms. Park Kyung-ja, please come in.

460
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,008
So can he eat meat?

461
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,678
Some people say that eating meat is bad for him

462
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,096
Eating well is good for him.

463
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,432
See you next month

464
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,977
Doctor, can he go for moxibustion?

465
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,980
I heard that moxibustion is good for him.

466
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,484
You are going to use the information you found on the Internet
Do you want to ask them all?

467
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,699
- Patient 832
- Next person, please come in

468
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:32,121
Isn't it? I'm number 832

469
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:36,501
Your number is for the consultation, but this is the payment window.

470
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,629
So, this number is...

471
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,130
It's written over there.

472
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,215
Good this...

473
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,803
Please go to window number seven

474
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,930
Is No. 835 not here?

475
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,934
Did it for us

476
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,143
It's almost done

477
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,729
There are so many staff here.

478
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,024
Why can't you
What about those who were not aware of the situation?

479
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,484
Are you kidding me?

480
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,363
And why are you sighing?
Why do you sigh in front of others?

481
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,991
- Honey
- No one knew it from the beginning

482
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,410
Why do you have to scold her and make her feel useless?

483
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,412
How great are you?

484
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,289
You said what you know.

485
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,916
If people don't understand you treat them like fools

486
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,544
She is also very smart, smarter than you!

487
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,379
- What happened to mom?
- Hello Jinming

488
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,299
What are you busy with? Why are you always so busy?

489
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:29,345
You must always follow us to the hospital.
This is the rule from now on, understand?

490
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,516
Because dad is sick.

491
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,102
Pain can make people irritable

492
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,648
Even a migraine is enough to make a person lose control...

493
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,319
He's not mad at you, you know that?

494
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,866
You think Dad will definitely stand on my side, right?

495
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,868
He is not

496
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,161
If you quarrel with me

497
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,788
Dad will stand by you.

498
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,376
I might be the first one in his heart.
But you are his number zero

499
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,797
For Dad
You're like the ring in Lord of the Rings

500
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,591
The person who messes with you is dead.

501
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:14,223
Patient No. 848, please go to window No. 4

502
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,896
Dad saw Mom in that person

503
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,319
He can see her in the distant future

504
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,113
Sitting here alone

505
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:38,915
Cancel it

506
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,876
I'm going to book a quadruple room tomorrow.

507
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,130
This room is not reserved for you
To make mom more comfortable

508
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:47,840
Okay?

509
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,553
I can't arrange a single room for you.

510
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,640
I'm lucky to have a daughter like you.

511
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,059
Then get well soon and repay me

512
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:02,939
Take care of Xiaochun and your son-in-law for me.

513
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,276
Is he good to you?

514
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,321
He is obsessed with me

515
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,999
I will come with Chung-seop to wash your hair tomorrow...

516
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:21,916
Are you leaving?

517
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:27,255
Don't you want me to leave?
You always urge me to leave quickly, what happened today?

518
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,883
Sleep here tonight. This is a single room.

519
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,059
There are also companion pillows in single rooms.

520
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,310
Really good

521
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,355
How much is this place?

522
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,524
Dear, please go to Jinming's house and take a shower.

523
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,651
She's staying here tonight.

524
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,160
Is it really outrageous because you have no mental and financial ability?

525
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,495
So they removed mom from her position as class monitor?

526
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,956
- That class teacher is crazy
- asshole

527
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,624
asshole

528
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,751
Unreasonable

529
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,050
So mom headbutted the woman?

530
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,013
She broke the shop owner's nose with her head.

531
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,102
So you saw mom there?

532
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,731
Did you see her lying in front of Tongming's grave?

533
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,691
I see

534
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:33,863
I followed her secretly, worried that she would jump into the sea

535
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,449
How did she hold on?

536
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:37,909
At that time

537
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,703
Your mother is only 28 years old

538
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,706
28 years old

539
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,544
When I proposed to her

540
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,464
Promised to make her a poet

541
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,842
Either send her to college or send her to the Peninsula

542
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,097
I thought none of them could be achieved.

543
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,391
But your mother has been writing recently.

544
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,728
I'm so happy to see her like that.

545
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:10,817
Your mother once won a writing competition

546
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,694
She is the top student in high school

547
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,740
Your mother is so amazing

548
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,911
I can't express her talent in words.

549
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,834
Be nice to her

550
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,544
Will you take care of her?

551
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,965
Dad, you're annoying.

552
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,926
You let me stay just to tell me this

553
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,389
Until the end, I still felt sorry for my daughter.

554
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,392
I'm even going to leave my wife to you to take care of.

555
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,271
where are you going?

556
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,897
I don't want

557
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,692
I haven't grown up yet.

558
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,777
Please take care of me before you leave.

559
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,321
Why are you in such a hurry to leave us?

560
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,283
Jin Ming

561
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,203
You make me feel like I'm on a boat

562
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,039
Caught a whale

563
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,251
You are the first person to learn the multiplication table

564
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,962
Got to Seoul National University

565
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,006
Oh my god

566
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,842
I am happy but also feel sorry for you

567
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,720
I feel sorry for you every day

568
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,599
I'm sorry for my daughter

569
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,100
But when I think of your mother

570
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,353
I can't bear the feeling of sorry.

571
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,232
I can't sleep

572
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,526
I can't sleep

573
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:39,447
Stay with your mother more.

574
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,866
Stay a little longer

575
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,327
Jin Ming

576
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,330
Of course Dad wants to

577
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,542
I really want to

578
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,130
For Dad...

579
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,092
Your mother is the whole world

580
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,473
Don't take her as trouble. Don't be depressed.

581
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,059
Don't be mad at her

582
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,770
Be nice to her

583
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,442
Be nice to her

584
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,073
How could I...

585
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:29,247
How should I say goodbye to you?

586
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,299
dad

587
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,802
Dad, I'm sorry.

588
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,345
I'm sorry

589
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,890
I'm sorry I made you angry

590
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,104
I...I apologize for always being in a hurry to hang up the phone

591
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,273
but

592
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,986
I don't really feel annoyed.

593
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,615
It's really not like that, Dad.

594
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,496
I know

595
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,165
Of course I know

596
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,918
My daughter is the best

597
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,425
I have a loving father

598
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,762
Is dad coming?

599
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,766
But my dad doesn't have a loving daughter

600
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,769
"A Dragon from the Stream"

601
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,564
I really hate this saying.

602
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,693
Who will benefit from jumping over the dragon gate?

603
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,362
I’ve had enough of my sister, the pillar of the family and the eldest daughter!

604
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:44,780
Liang Jinming!

605
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,909
He asked me to be gentle and affectionate to my mother

606
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,038
It still hurts me.

607
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,166
Do you want me to live like you?
Do you really want that?

608
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,877
I do this because I don't want to live like you

609
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,671
I hate the idea of doing things within your means.

610
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,758
You're always covered in plasters
But what have you done for me?

611
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,427
We take it for granted that

612
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,847
Dad will always be by my side

613
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,808
Can he stay home?

614
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,187
He just wanted to do this

615
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,773
He said he wanted to stay home for a while.

616
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,025
He wants to see the sea

617
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,277
If he stayed at home

618
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,197
It will be fine

619
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,419
dad

620
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,506
You can just sit and ride the bike like this

621
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,134
I thought you could sit in this chair.
Listen to Kim Kwang Seok's songs

622
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,971
I searched all over the internet
Just found this vinyl record and...

623
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,056
Your guitar...

624
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,437
Dad, how...

625
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,856
how…

626
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,734
Why are you so thin?

627
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,362
dad

628
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,782
What's wrong with Dad?

629
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,617
come over

630
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,994
You are a father, don't be ashamed

631
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,289
What's wrong with dad?

632
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,085
I asked you to look at me

633
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,171
I said I would buy you a Mercedes

634
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,340
I said I would buy you a boat!

635
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,843
I saw it all

636
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,845
Dad is always watching you

637
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,057
You have always been a good son.

638
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,186
I already know

639
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,814
I always knew but I...

640
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,275
I…

641
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:49,572
Your brother died three days after your birthday.

642
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,323
Accept life without birthdays

643
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,034
But that's not fair!

644
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,454
I don't want it!

645
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,999
I don't want it!

646
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,711
Yinming comes out

647
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,180
Choose one

648
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:18,058
We can make rice cakes at home on your birthday
Or come out to eat sweet and sour pork

649
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,768
You can't choose both, you can only choose one

650
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,354
Robot toys and sweet and sour pork

651
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,068
Should I continue to buy it for you secretly?

652
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:28,986
want

653
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,364
Then you must keep it secret.

654
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,868
You won’t tell your sister, will you?

655
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,454
You big mouth

656
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,709
I think you like me more than Jinming

657
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,005
These are also for you

658
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,465
You only bought it for me

659
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,592
Bought it for me secretly

660
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,220
I knew it

661
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,183
I just choose to remember what I want to remember

662
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,643
You big mouth

663
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,020
Are you betraying me now?

664
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,106
I'm just an asshole

665
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,028
Is there anyone who insults your father like this?

666
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,661
These were caught by the aunts.

667
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,579
Damn sea

668
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:24,708
You must be giving more because you are not feeling well.

669
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:29,713
Even if we fish all our lives
The sea still gives endlessly

670
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,008
My son is back.

671
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,010
Wash quickly

672
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,137
Wash and eat

673
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,852
To us, Dad is the sea.

674
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,608
We all live on him.

675
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,532
This little guy

676
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:02,371
Bought me a cherry coke
She also asked me to sign a contract with her.

677
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,832
She said she wanted me to be a star lecturer

678
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,294
Honestly, I thought it was ridiculous.

679
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:13,299
But after seeing the company's name, I decided to give it a try

680
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,760
The next speaker I would like to introduce is

681
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,555
People who are changing the world

682
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,475
Liang Jinming, Executive President of the Company

683
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,438
(Today's lecture guest
Liang Jinming, Executive President)

684
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,231
Oh my god

685
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,191
Look, it's Jin Ming.

686
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,194
We must pay our debts

687
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,531
We made a big splash
Lighting his way to the stars

688
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,826
Hello everyone, my name is Liang Jinming

689
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,329
When studying in Japan

690
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,458
I used this to record lectures and listened to them again and again

691
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,755
Because I can't speak Japanese
And this is the only thing I can rely on

692
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:59,261
I thought: "If I could carry the teacher with me
How great would that be? "

693
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,765
One day I returned to my hometown and looked at the bookcase

694
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,768
Suddenly I felt like I had an epiphany.

695
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,481
That's my mother's.

696
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,485
Very old college entrance exam workbook

697
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,696
Is she talking about me?

698
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:22,076
My mom is truly an amazing person.

699
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,245
She is smart and hardworking

700
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,039
And I really want to

701
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,083
Further studies

702
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:34,088
If my mother could go to school like this

703
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,215
You will definitely be able to learn as much as you can

704
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,759
She will fly high

705
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,846
Even if you don't live in Daechi-dong
No expensive tutoring

706
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,518
A literary girl living on an island
If you want to learn, you can learn

707
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,020
I believe anyone

708
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,774
No matter who they are, no matter when and where

709
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,903
As long as you really want to learn, you should have the opportunity to learn.

710
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,322
That’s why

711
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,658
Regardless of the company

712
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,954
From my mother's dream

713
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,253
I can't believe it

714
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,338
What is she doing?

715
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,800
She's a sales wizard.

716
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:27,683
By then, the number of high-speed Internet users exceeded 10 million.

717
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,643
Portable media players are introduced to the market

718
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,813
Video calls bring together those separated by the Korean War
Families reunited

719
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,734
I am sure that the era of online lectures will come

720
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:41,447
I inherited my father's unremitting diligence

721
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,948
She also mentioned me

722
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,868
Some things

723
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,871
We must show it to Dad at all costs

724
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,124
To celebrate the history and resilience of Jeju Island’s female divers

725
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,752
The Haenyeo Museum officially opens today

726
00:45:55,544 --> 00:46:02,509
A museum dedicated to commemorate the Jeju Island Haenyeo
A Museum of History and Resilience

727
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,471
Let's show the world the Ama

728
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,974
To be included in the World Heritage List

729
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,978
We want to prove that we are alive.
Our culture is alive...

730
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,147
Live!

731
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,815
Yes, we are still alive.

732
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,401
We are still alive!

733
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,781
With Jeju Island Haenyeo
The indomitable pioneering spirit...

734
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,742
Are you serious? Is this a good son?

735
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,828
How can you take money from my wallet?
Buy a headband for Yalin?

736
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,247
It's Jung A-ran, not A-rin

737
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,543
Dear, did you give him these highlights?

738
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,213
- Open your mouth
- Look at him.

739
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:44,176
You go to school with this hairstyle
Is it for a date with Areum?

740
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,302
I know everything

741
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,638
Your dad knows everything. He's a big expert.

742
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,600
But why do I feel like my dad is always smiling?

743
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,019
You always seem to laugh when I teach my kids a lesson

744
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,897
Have we swapped identities?

745
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,900
You deserve it.

746
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,156
What's wrong?

747
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:12,788
Honey

748
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,499
What's wrong?

749
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,583
What's going on?

750
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,001
I can't believe it

751
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:22,005
What happened to this family?
There's never a moment of peace

752
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,882
What's going on?

753
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,301
You kept your promise

754
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,138
One of the three promises fulfilled

755
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,695
"To the Forgotten Heart"

756
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,240
Author: Oh Ae-soon, Dodong-ri, Jeju Island

757
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:53,370
When I was young, I believed
Only by holding your hand can I feel the warmth

758
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:58,125
But now I know
Even if you're not around, you're still with me

759
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,628
Now I have a warm corner

760
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,215
Whenever I think of you, my heart will feel warm

761
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:11,096
I will live well and tell myself
Even though the moon is still bright

762
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,934
If you have to go, please go gently.

763
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:20,147
After 50 years, you can finally let me go and be free

764
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,401
My dearest respect for all your experiences

765
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,281
My dearest, respect for everything you have been through

766
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,000
You've been crying lately

767
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:51,053
See? You did keep a promise.

768
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,641
My poems have been published, so I am a poet anyway.

769
00:48:56,642 --> 00:49:00,062
If you hadn't been with me
Maybe it has already been published

770
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,898
I can't do it without you

771
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,192
I can't write a poem like this

772
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,154
Oh my god, damn Aichun

773
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,448
Damn Aichun

774
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,410
Are you happy?

775
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,163
happy

776
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,626
I am so happy

777
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,510
They kissed.

778
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,595
Riding a horse?

779
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,514
I'm heavy

780
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:39,393
Okay, the kids are watching, pay attention.

781
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,187
Because of you two
Children think love is everything

782
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,564
Buy 100 copies and send them to the Fisheries Association

783
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,692
Do you have to buy it?

784
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,910
Mom prayed all night
Let time stop at that day

785
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:01,748
May this moment never end

786
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,338
Honey

787
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,633
Let's just live like this.

788
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:18,098
I hope it lasts another five years.

789
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,145
If not

790
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,314
Can we enjoy one more round of four seasons?

791
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,484
One more round, please?

792
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:34,698
I'm so scared before I leave
I couldn't fulfill any of your wishes.

793
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,035
But I saw you wrote a poem before I left

794
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,871
Makes me feel better

795
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,706
Much better

796
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,584
In the next life…

797
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,380
I will fulfill five no ten promises

798
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,634
Will you be with me in the next life?

799
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:02,684
I can…

800
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,438
Will I see you again in the next life?

801
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,106
How to say it?

802
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,026
Don't you want to see me again?

803
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,701
Such blessings will not come one after another.

804
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,748
How could I be the only one surrounded by flowers?

805
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,587
You've suffered all your life because of me.

806
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,924
Thanks to you

807
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,636
I never felt lonely for a day

808
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,680
Not a single day

809
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,852
Where can I find such a life?

810
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:48,897
Love Pure

811
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,649
Um?

812
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,193
I want to ask you for a favor

813
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,864
When I leave...

814
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,034
Don't cry too much

815
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,122
Seeing Wu Aichun cry

816
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,625
I will be heartbroken

817
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,004
Then I can't leave gently

818
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,842
My last moments...

819
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,638
Want to see...

820
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,309
It's your smile

821
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,188
Thanks to your smile

822
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,859
My life is full of joy

823
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:45,912
OMG

824
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,623
Can't you even do this?

825
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:51,877
Pat me on the back

826
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:10,187
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

827
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,941
Rocking to sleep

828
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:20,071
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

829
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,866
Rocking to sleep

830
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,703
My baby...

831
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,038
I miss her so much

832
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,999
...sleep well

833
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,962
Fall asleep quickly

834
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,381
Fall asleep quickly

835
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:45,472
A black dog walked away

836
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:52,604
A black dog is coming.

837
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:59,152
Come and coax my baby to sleep

838
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:05,742
Then I will also comfort your baby

839
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,120
My mother often says

840
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,290
There are hard days in life but you are never alone

841
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,208
(Admission Notice)

842
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,751
Looking back, her life was a paradise.

843
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,212
Oh my god

844
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,757
Dad pats us on the back all our lives

845
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:26,179
Even until the last moment
He's still giving everything for us.

846
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,681
Honey, something bad will happen to you.

847
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,225
Stop driving and park your car on the side of the road

848
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,269
- I'll be there soon
- It doesn't matter

849
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,896
There are no cars here.

850
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,857
- No cars on the road
- No car?

851
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,568
Dad, I'm not there yet, don't leave

852
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,112
Wait till I see you.

853
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,406
God gave us his last mercy

854
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,448
(2007 University Academic Ability Test)

855
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,867
Let us bid you farewell in your last moments

856
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,453
Dad, I'm here. Dad, I'm here.

857
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,081
Dad, I'll stay here.

858
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,084
Don't be afraid, Dad.

859
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,962
Dad, I'm sorry.

860
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:02,299
Dad, I love you.

861
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,967
Dad, I'm sorry.

862
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,051
dad

863
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,470
- dad
- Honey

864
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,222
Dad, I'm sorry.

865
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,518
The last thing Dad saw on our faces

866
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,521
A face full of sadness

867
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,982
That was something he had never seen before.

868
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,478
You should be nicer to yourself. You age so fast.

869
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,565
But you're still the same

870
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,612
I'm getting older too

871
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,115
No

872
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,368
You are still the same

873
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,288
You still look the same to me

874
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,749
It's been the same for 50 years

875
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,057
There was a girl in this boy's life

876
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,939
He has been protecting this girl all his life.

877
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,444
Thank you dear

878
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,989
You've had a good life.

879
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,826
I'm having a really good time.

880
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,706
Is everything okay?

881
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,296
Are our times together okay?

882
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,842
I have no other request

883
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:21,020
I have nothing else to ask for, it's really good

884
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:28,611
Staring at the one in his life
The one who left the mark...

885
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,535
dad

886
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,997
First time sleeping in

887
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,426
He left his last gift

888
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,557
Your father told me to give this to you no matter what

889
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,062
dad

890
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:08,318
Never used the little money I sent him.

891
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,069
He never touched the money.

892
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,531
But he keeps changing his passbooks
So I asked him why

893
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,785
He said you could think of sending him money
It means a lot to him.

894
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,914
Why doesn't he spend it?

895
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,082
The 100,000 won you sent

896
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,960
The happiness you brought to your father is worth a million

897
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,256
But his own life

898
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,218
Just a small part of the wardrobe

899
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,180
Dad, you're annoying.

900
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,308
Dad's Unequal Love Just Ended

901
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,894
Mine has just begun

902
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,442
Damn Mercedes

903
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,945
Your father wants to buy you one

904
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:56,407
He wants you to have a good life.

905
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,245
What's the mileage of this car?

906
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:03,873
You really are

907
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,669
Exactly like my daughter

908
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,937
You wear these hairpins every day
Throwing it everywhere every day

909
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,607
Why should I buy it for you?
You lose it every day anyway.

00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,556
Filled with 50 years of love

912
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:21,409
It's all his intention that he won't disappear

913
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,382
Dear, what should I do?

914
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,388
How am I going to survive?

915
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,080
No more omelettes

916
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,460
You stopped drinking noodle soup after Tongming left

917
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,254
When I'm gone you'll cry when you see an omelette

918
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,319
If the children let you live with them in the future

919
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,697
Just let it be, okay?

920
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,032
If you are here alone

921
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:44,867
I will cry

922
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:19,861
Oh my god

923
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,489
When did he take all this down?

924
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,674
You are so busy

925
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,343
You're so busy, husband.

926
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:48,556
As she knew
Even though the moon is still bright

927
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:49,974
Mother

928
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,852
Still with Dad

929
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:08,367
(Seeing your beloved every day
Come back through the door you left this morning)

930
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,663
(Every day is a miracle)

931
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,008
I've walked a long way

932
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,303
Really far

933
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,728
Now let's continue

934
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:41,108
(Wu Aichun)

935
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,697
Just like snow covering the whole world

936
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,493
Time covers up the noisy sadness...

937
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,373
Winter is finally here

938
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,961
I will be back

939
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:02,296
I'll be back soon

940
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,349
No

941
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,353
It's just my husband over there.

942
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,073
Look

943
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,742
I wrote the whole book.

944
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,870
I'm done

945
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,252
I share my parents' 70-year story with you

946
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:43,880
I believe this is a story that should not be forgotten.

947
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:48,217
From Liang Jinming
Eldest daughter of Liang Kuanzhi and Wu Aichun

948
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:03,608
Those words you have kept in your heart all your life

949
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,651
It is the most beautiful poem in life

950
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,712
Teacher, can you help me color?

951
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:29,634
Why do you always make me do everything for you?

952
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,511
You should get used to doing it on your own.

953
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:36,307
Take some time to draw yourself

954
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,768
Talk to yourself

955
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,645
Playing cards

956
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,439
This is how you stay healthy

957
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,442
Loneliness makes people uncomfortable

958
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,152
Oh my god

959
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,529
Why do you keep giving me stuff?

960
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:54,241
Yesterday, my daughter, son-in-law and I
Went to a restaurant

961
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,993
I ordered my own food

962
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,870
Thanks to you

963
01:05:58,537 --> 01:05:59,956
Thanks to Teacher Aichun

964
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,376
Zheng Kongli's "Illiterate"

965
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,711
I have to go into the water and can't go to school.

966
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,839
I've been ashamed my whole life

967
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,469
When they open the menu and ask:
"What would you like to order?"

968
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:15,805
My heart will sink

969
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:21,060
But yesterday I ordered what I wanted to eat

970
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,020
I ordered the special sushi set

971
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,815
Tastes like honey

972
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:27,692
teacher

973
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,820
Come and have some

974
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:33,197
Why do you keep giving me stuff?

975
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:37,618
- You are beautiful
- Because I remind you of your daughter?

976
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,247
I hope so much

977
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,542
My daughter can sit at a table like you

978
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:49,255
If only I could sit at the desk like the teacher
Just write something

979
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,764
I wish my mom was here to peel my oranges for me

980
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,226
I'll treat her to a special sushi set

981
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,147
The thing I want to say most in my life...

982
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:08,941
mom

983
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,319
mom

984
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,363
mom

985
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,451
mom!

986
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,873
Others live to 90 or even 100 years old

987
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:26,292
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

988
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:29,503
Have you been reborn in this wonderful world?

989
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:35,176
I want you to sit at your dream table
Live Like a Boss

990
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:43,100
(daughter)

991
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,980
Hello, what's wrong?

992
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:52,943
Nothing, still the same

993
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,029
What?

994
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,032
So suddenly?

995
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:03,079
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t come this month?

996
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:07,666
No, I shouldn't have given your aunt the sour cinnamon.

997
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,962
Mom, stop taking it and sit down.

998
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:17,051
You like sour ones, Yinming likes fresh ones.

999
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,512
I always have to do it separately

1000
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,472
It's so troublesome.

1001
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,058
Mom was lonely until yesterday

1002
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,977
Suddenly she became a girl again

1003
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,482
Their boat returned fully loaded

1004
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,863
Mom, look, it's Lin Yingxiong.

1005
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,493
Oh my god

1006
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,292
Why do you like Lin Yingxiong so much?

1007
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,046
Your dad likes Kim Kwang-sik

1008
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,590
He learned guitar just to play this song

1009
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,386
But he never sang to me.

1010
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,555
Afraid that I would cry

1011
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:06,642
But then I heard the hero sing this song

1012
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:10,563
I burst into tears

1013
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:15,651
Mom, how can you always be so girly?

1014
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,237
It’s still the season of flower petals…

…It’s still the season of dreams…

1018
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,417
You must let me go to the hospital with you.

1019
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,669
Don't ask the kids.

1020
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,505
If you are sick I will take care of you

1021
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,967
Can you please take care of yourself?

1022
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:42,386
Look at your belly

1023
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:48,601
Your son-in-law and daughter-in-law will say
Dye your hair, really

1024
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:51,270
You dye me

1025
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:53,731
You dye my hair

1026
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,945
Is there an age limit for first love?

1027
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,322
Shut up

1028
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,617
If we don't have...

1029
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,118
Let me off

1030
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,454
The car is still moving. Why do you want to get off?

1031
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,664
Look ahead and drive carefully

1032
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,667
Am I your driver?

1033
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,463
...still a childlike season

1034
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:22,885
Mom is standing there
It seems that my whole life has been dyed by flowers

1035
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:27,473
Will you never grow old?

1036
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:31,602
There's nothing special about getting old

1037
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:36,065
What is the age of 30 to 40 for you?
Is there a big difference?

1038
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,566
You feel no difference even when you are 70 years old?

1039
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,902
God, that sounds exhausting.

1040
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,238
It's the same

1041
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,574
Everything is the same

1042
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:48,619
You feel the same way

1043
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:52,456
But when you look in the mirror

1044
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,542
You will see an old woman

1045
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:57,962
This is aging

1046
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:00,214
Mom is here!

My sister is a big shot and I have a franchise store

1051
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,142
I thought these book sellers
Will let us at the end

What are your thoughts on this trip?

- First love is predictable.
- Then you go live with her.

01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,084
So proud

1093
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,465
(Wu Aichun)

1094
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:30,382
(directory)

1095
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,968
(Spring passes and the summer sun shines
Fruitful autumn, sparkling winter)

1096
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:34,887
How should we celebrate your debut?

1097
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:35,804
(Every day is spring)

1098
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,516
Just say don't bear it.

1099
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,226
Your daughter is a big shot now.

1100
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,854
I bought you a house.

1101
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:46,940
Come visit me often in the future

1102
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:52,279
My wish before I left was
I can see my busy daughter a hundred times

1103
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,409
Why do you say that?

1104
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:02,581
Because you are too busy I can't see you ten times a year

1105
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,044
I would be very happy if I could see you a hundred times

1106
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,884
That's why I said you should come to Seoul with me

1107
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:16,553
Why do you go to the nursing home so often?

1108
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:22,643
Even when we are old, we still want to have a place in the world.

1109
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,146
It would make me feel worse if I were considered a burden.

1110
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:29,358
If I were you I would be very happy

1111
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:33,237
You've been so busy all your life.

1112
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:37,741
To be honest I went there because I was happy

1113
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:42,955
There they all call me "Teacher"

1114
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:48,627
You could say I was promoted.

1115
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:56,218
From a female seaman who cries every day at the beach

1116
01:15:56,718 --> 01:16:01,473
To a place where everything in the world is embarrassing
Literary girl…

1117
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,977
Now we have a house and a boat

1118
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,605
...to the captain’s wife who felt extremely happy...

1119
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:12,693
To President Wu

1120
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:16,154
To the lady cutting fish in the market

1121
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:20,367
At the age of 70, he became a so-called teacher

1122
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,911
Finally, the poet Wu Aichun

1123
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:27,624
Life is not worth experiencing unless you experience it yourself.
Otherwise you never know what will happen

1124
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:32,504
It would be a shame if I gave up halfway

1125
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,508
I'm grateful I survived

1126
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:38,468
so

1127
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,638
Is it spring again for you?

1128
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:43,557
right

1129
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:46,852
Yes, it's spring again.

1130
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:49,646
I thought

1131
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:55,694
Life always goes through spring, summer, autumn and winter

1132
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,155
But I was wrong

1133
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,951
Sometimes it feels like winter

1134
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,580
Sometimes like spring

1135
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:13,795
I have a lot of spring

1136
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:20,886
70 years of stars come together to form the Milky Way

1137
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:26,475
I've had many shining moments

1138
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,185
I've been through a lot

1139
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:36,276
My 70 years of life surrounded by flowers

1140
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,986
All written in this book

1141
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:41,740
The countless memories she buried in her heart

1142
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,700
Now it's all blooming

1143
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:45,285
So

1144
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:47,913
Are you happy?

1145
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:51,833
happy

1146
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:53,919
I am happy

1147
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:58,131
I am so happy

1148
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,720
My mom shines in the most beautiful colors

1149
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,684
Dedicated to the only you

1150
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:12,187
From the age of nine to now

1151
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,815
Thanks to you

1152
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:18,568
My life is spring every day

1153
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:25,075
If it weren't for you this book wouldn't exist

1154
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,453
Until the spring when we meet again

1155
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,999
I will live every day like spring

1156
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,584
Come here

1157
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,132
If I become a poet one day

1158
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,300
I'll wear a two-piece dress like a star

1159
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,094
And if I become rich

1160
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:47,889
I will live in a two-story house
Have a cute dog

1161
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,308
I want our children to learn piano too

1162
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:53,019
I have to eat out more often

1163
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:56,148
I want to drive a jeep

1164
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,024
Wear Ray-Ban glasses

1165
01:18:58,525 --> 01:18:59,359
Do you like cars?

1166
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,278
like

1167
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,447
You actually have something you like?

1168
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,992
Then I'll take you to that car.
We go to various places together

1169
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,410
Going to the United States

1170
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,746
I like!

1171
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,292
Holding hands, wandering and chatting
Do whatever you want to do

1172
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,044
I like it I like it too

1173
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:22,549
As long as we are alive, let's try various things

1174
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,176
Do whatever you want!

1175
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:38,899
As for those times

1176
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,527
Those were such youthful and tender times

1177
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:46,281
We regret gratitude

1178
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,451
Deeply respect

1179
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,622
Respect for everything you've been through

1180
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:54,219
(“If you can’t do it, forget it
We are always behind you")

1181
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:03,853
