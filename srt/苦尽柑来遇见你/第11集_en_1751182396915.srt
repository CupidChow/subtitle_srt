00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,982
《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,150
(Emergency Room)

3
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,208
actually

4
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,461
I lived in that room for a few years.

5
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,799
The window frame was a little deformed.

6
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,259
So the ventilation is good.

7
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,806
Oh my god, what if I didn't come?

8
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,308
What if I miss my flight?

9
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,393
I don't know why I wanted to come here

10
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,812
I just wanted to come over.

11
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,524
It was you, aunt, who saved her.

12
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,525
No

13
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,528
It was Jin Ming who saved me

14
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,241
Our Jinming is much kinder than me

15
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,493
So she survived for her mother.

16
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,871
I really can't stand it

17
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,666
I really can't stand it

18
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,217
You have to take care of yourself so that you can protect Jin Ming.

19
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,761
Oh my god

20
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:18,972
That's right

21
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,392
Are you the landlord's son-in-law?

22
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,061
That actually...

23
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,652
He is...

24
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,530
- That's Park Jin-myeong's son
- Um?

25
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,868
- Do you know Park Jin-myeong's son?
- What?

26
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,122
I don't know whose son he is.

27
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:57,927
Give it to me

28
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,014
what…

29
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,735
Am I dating a noble man?

30
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,779
You I choose you

31
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,907
Hello, keep your voice down.

32
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,117
Why are you saying this here?

33
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,869
Then let’s get married, okay?

34
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,537
Let’s get it over with quickly!

35
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,581
Hey, my mom is here.

36
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,838
Hey, send them somewhere else to play house.

37
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,049
Oh my god, she has really grown up.

38
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:39,886
Excuse me

39
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,888
Have you finished filling this out?

40
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,140
right

41
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,145
If you want to live like this
Why did you accept my ring?

42
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,898
If you accept the ring, that means you agree!

43
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,694
Don't go, marry me, it's done once you put on the ring

44
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,699
Where did she find one exactly like it?

45
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,284
I told you to move.

46
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,204
- I feel so bad.
- I said I don't like that place

47
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,248
Have you ever had gas poisoning?

48
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,209
Doctors say that being talked about makes headaches worse

49
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,753
Then why did you get gas poisoning?

50
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,466
Let’s get married
Then live in an apartment with an oil boiler

51
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,971
Who would use a fuel boiler instead of a diamond ring to propose?

52
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,974
Oh my god, they keep talking.
I don't feel ashamed.

53
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,434
Am I asking too much?

54
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,895
Even the broken street lights there are not replaced.

55
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,897
I don't want you to go through this alone.

56
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,858
The bedroom is so cold that you can see your breath

57
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,944
I don't want you to live in that place.

58
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,947
I don't want you to lose sleep because of selling late show tickets.

59
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,324
I don't want to be unable to call you because of the landlord!

60
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,120
Why do you do everything yourself?
Yelin and Minsun are not like this

61
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,454
Who else...

62
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,415
Who else...

63
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,752
Didn't you watch the news?

64
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,548
In the blink of an eye, people may die in a car accident.

65
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,675
What if someone dies from gas poisoning?

66
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,429
What if you die unexpectedly?

67
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,806
But I'm not dead.

68
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,520
- Then how can I live?
- alright

69
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:17,942
How come you are still like this after serving in the military?

70
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,361
Have you really completed your service?

71
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,696
If you die

72
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,613
I will die too

73
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,367
- I kept thinking this in the taxi
- Hey

74
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,078
The living must continue to live

75
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,955
If I die, will you continue to live?

76
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,457
I mean

77
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,958
reluctantly…

78
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,502
Barely survive

79
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,383
Stop laughing

80
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,263
You are so cute

81
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,266
How annoying!

82
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,354
I just inhaled a little bit of gas.

83
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,606
You also know that I have small nostrils, right?

84
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,442
I can't inhale much with this nostril.

85
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,198
Jin Ming

86
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,492
Don't be alone anymore

87
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,035
May I?

88
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,788
Are you marrying me

89
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,624
You're not marrying my mother.

90
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,629
I will take care of things at home.

91
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,673
Aichun will live with me, not my grandma.

92
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,093
I will protect Aichun's safety

93
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,304
I will try my best to take care of my family affairs.

94
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,682
All you need to do from now on is make my mother like you

95
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,809
Why would I do that?

96
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,936
I don't like your mother yet.

97
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,399
My mother is soft-hearted

98
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,527
If she is so soft-hearted
How could you say something like that in front of me?

99
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,116
What did she say to your face?

100
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,827
Oh my god you scared me

101
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,495
Hello Auntie

102
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,289
What is it about my daughter that your mother dislikes?

103
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,876
No mom, that's not what we meant...

104
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,878
Why does she do that?

105
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,771
I can't believe what I saw.

106
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,027
- Are you really Shangji's daughter?
- right

107
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,780
So funny

108
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,616
How come it's funny that she's his daughter?

109
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,868
What a filial daughter.

110
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,953
You must be fulfilling your father's wishes.

111
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,414
Don't talk nonsense

112
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,209
Your mother and your father sat
The place where you are now

113
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,712
- Hey
- It was a coffee shop back then.

114
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,422
- There is coffee on their table.
- Hello!

115
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:48,551
They met each other and you two almost became brother and sister.

116
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,220
Aichun will kill you

117
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,098
Are you Romeo and Juliet?

118
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,350
- Who's winning?
- A little rough

119
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,603
The champion of the last week of December is…

120
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:04,650
This great first love
Will it become a sweet love song or a sad love song...

121
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,611
Last week's winner is...

122
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,530
...I didn't know that at the time

123
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,201
Just indulge in love without any scruples

124
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,370
What does she dislike about Jinming?

125
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,039
No, not that kind of aunt.

126
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,791
The guardian of Liang Jinming

127
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,463
- Me?
- You don't fill it out?

128
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,465
We want her guardian's signature.

129
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,050
Her guardian should be...

130
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,761
You just rushed in carrying her on your back.

131
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,304
Who are you?

132
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,769
- Who are you and why...
- What?

133
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,729
I have this question too

134
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,817
I don't like you either

135
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,403
Could you tell me if they dated?

136
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,823
Tell me yes or no you are kidding us?

137
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,369
Are you sure you won't tell your dad?

138
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,748
I won't fall for your trick
Didn’t you say you have a tiger at home?

139
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,376
That's fine.

140
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,462
Shut up! There are some things you can't say.

141
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,092
They didn't date

142
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,681
But they did consider marriage.

143
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,125
Is this funny?

144
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,505
Don't you think it's funny?

145
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,887
(Auntie Seafood House Haenyeo freshly caught)

146
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,035
Can't you fix your hair?
Is this look for working in the fields?

147
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,036
dad

148
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,538
Are you happy?

149
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,832
Do you think this hair is cool?

150
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,294
I'll give you 50,000 won for shaving your head

151
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,298
(December 1991)

152
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,510
(November 1993)

153
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,641
(This is not garbage)

154
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,185
(This is the pride I gave up for you)

155
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,478
(Come back to me Yinming)

156
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,398
(Hyun-sook loves you forever)

157
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,110
(I will wait for you for 26 months or 26 years)

158
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,206
Is it true that people in the army don't beat people anymore?

159
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,793
- Did Zhelong tell you?
- Why are you here crying?

160
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,586
Really

161
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,882
You should go to college.

162
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,428
This year's university academic examination
Replaced the Academic Aptitude Test

163
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,722
Many students are confused

164
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,267
New test focuses more on reasoning than memorization

165
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,562
This has resulted in more and more students falling behind in their studies.

166
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,273
How can they expect
Children who can't even walk run

167
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,944
Changing policies so casually
How can a stupid kid get into college?

168
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,072
force?

169
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,949
He left suddenly

170
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,286
Wait, he hasn't been in the military yet?

171
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,789
He looks like he fought in the Korean War, right?

172
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,417
But our Picasso is only 28 years old

173
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,920
Soju and popcorn belong to the boss

174
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,006
You can take anything else you want.

175
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,924
Popcorn too?

176
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,762
No one stopped him?
Why did you leave without saying a word?

177
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,514
I can't finish this much.

178
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,975
- Too many
- We've known each other for several years.

179
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,729
You're leaving soon, so I guess I won't see him again.

180
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,606
You might encounter...

181
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,816
You'll never see him again

182
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,485
Maybe in the next life, it's impossible in this life

183
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,740
People say that it takes countless reincarnations.
To see you once in this life

184
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:25,578
If you miss it, you really miss it.

185
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,927
But he still rushed to the hospital with me on his back

186
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,347
(Never let your guard down
Never let the other person out of sight)

187
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,558
(Never Fall in Love, The Bodyguard)

188
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,103
Seoul people are so ruthless

189
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,243
That year all my windows swayed like waves...

190
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,968
1993 KBS Korea Music Awards

191
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,763
The winner is

192
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,518
Kim Soo Hee's "Sad Love"!

193
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,897
Kim Soo Hee defeated Seo Taiji

194
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,484
...the storm of autumn overwhelms the frenzy of spring

195
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:44,907
Eventful 1993 finally came to an end

196
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,828
Who can resist the fist-sized heart?
What about the storm that was stirred up?

197
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,872
Don't you recognize me?

198
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,382
Autumn is autumn

199
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,477
Spring is Spring

200
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,399
How do I sell this?

201
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,570
So that was a season when the wind never stopped

202
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,534
At least that's what I think

203
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,495
...our hearts never stop being restless

204
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,587
Although I am poor

205
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,506
I still fell in love with the beautiful Natasha

206
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,051
So it snowed tonight.

207
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,387
You've seen that one, too.

208
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,224
Did you write this poem because you liked it?

209
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,894
No, I just...

210
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,022
You're pretty girly.

211
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,486
Did you know?

212
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,033
Poetry can even romanticize poverty

213
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,453
Actually, being down and out is not cool at all

214
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,164
But poetry makes it look kind of cool

215
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:17,958
Um

216
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,502
Like painting...

217
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,881
I want to draw but I can't

218
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,345
Make money with your talent

219
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,431
But not everyone can do it

220
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,391
so

221
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,978
Mr. Putoto, you are not pitiful.

222
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,483
More importantly, your Natasha is not pretty.

223
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,778
Don't retreat for no reason

224
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,822
I'm not sure

225
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,034
Will this help you forget her?

226
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,621
Removed makeup

227
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,415
Your Natasha is actually a donkey

228
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,170
that…

229
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,132
My mother asked

230
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,219
Are you planning to take TOEFL?

231
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,934
She has a book for you...

232
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,331
If you always feel sorry for yourself
Say your life sucks

233
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,791
Your life is going to suck.

234
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,211
If you think you are only worth 100 won

235
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,255
Who would think you are worth 1,000 won?

236
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,675
Stop feeling sorry for yourself

237
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,429
Say something nice to yourself
Make yourself feel better

238
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,473
You are hunched over like Master Kame now.

239
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,851
Have you watched Dragon Ball?

240
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,645
To be honest, it's a good thing you're not my family.

241
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:07,317
If you were my brother, God
I promise to beat you till your teeth are all over the floor

242
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,530
Will you still laugh?

243
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,825
Yeah, I don't know if I can still laugh.

244
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,839
Is this the tree?

245
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,014
The largest tree in Korea

246
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,020
I chose this place because from above

247
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,398
You can see the largest Christmas tree in Korea

248
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:47,941
Wow

249
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,572
We have really witnessed it.
Many embarrassing moments with each other

250
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,367
Ms. Liang, you seem

251
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,120
A Christmas tree

252
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,918
No matter where you put one
A tree that can do its job

253
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,921
What does it do?

254
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,883
Whether the Christmas tree is located in the basement room

255
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,011
Or a corner store with no one visiting it...

256
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,515
Always sparkling

257
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,601
Always makes your heart beat faster

258
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,398
I say this because today is a special day.

259
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,484
I just want

260
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,237
Say something to make you feel good

261
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,705
Where are you going?

262
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,057
Episode title: My Love is by my side

263
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,609
(My Love Is By My Side, Davic)

264
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,953
Student Card

265
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:28,041
Lingdong intersection

266
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:34,381
The Laotai Lingdong intersection has arrived.
You should get off at this stop!

267
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,698
Remember there was such an era
People can hold their heads high

268
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,788
There was a time when people were true to their hearts

269
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,831
(gift to Jin Mingyingfan)

270
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,999
(Kim Hyun-sik's hit song)

271
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,794
There was a moment where we looked at each other
Rather than looking down at your phone

272
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,712
(Liang Jinming)

273
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,509
Do you like it?

274
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,804
Like when did you record it?

275
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,098
You like Kim Hyun-sik more than me

276
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,850
Just kidding

277
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,112
Is the work hard?

278
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,031
Not fun, right?

279
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,202
Who works for fun?

280
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,287
Everyone works for money.

281
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,791
Are you taking the bar exam for fun?

282
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:52,876
Kind of.

283
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,921
Don't you have something you want to do?

284
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,258
Working in an office isn't your dream, right?

285
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,681
I have a dream that has existed for a long time.

286
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,601
independent

287
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,272
Independent Living

288
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,484
It's actually quite remarkable

289
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,531
We have been striving for independence

290
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,993
From university admission, graduation to meeting with parents

291
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,539
Life is nothing but being pushed by parents

292
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,710
Let's go and tell them I won't let Jinming get married

293
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,173
They were almost in Seoul and the traffic was really bad.

294
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,925
We came here by plane.

295
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,345
He should have brought his parents here earlier.

296
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,307
How bad is the traffic?

297
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,144
Jin Ming

298
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,062
What are you nervous about?

299
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,273
And told me not to do that.

300
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,816
Forget it

301
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,819
Don't act like that. Don't act like that.

302
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,903
Forget it

303
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,080
Oh my god, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting!

304
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,041
Traffic on the road is bad

305
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,000
welcome

306
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,924
Traffic is terrible, right?

307
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,594
I hope the traffic didn't make you carsick?

308
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,555
My daughter was a little unnaturally polite that day.

309
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,681
We are late

310
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,601
It's okay. It's totally okay.

311
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:37,773
My mother first said to a woman who never apologized
It's okay to speak up

312
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,568
That was the atmosphere in the room that day.

313
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,071
I think we've met before. I'm Park Jin-myung

314
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,914
That was the first time I saw my dad
How to shake hands with someone

315
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,582
I am Leung Kuan Chi

316
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,001
Jin Ming's father

317
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,966
No parent can prevail over their child, right?

318
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,635
I told her

319
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,554
If they want to get married, they should get married quickly

320
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,932
It's not a good idea to put off emotional matters.

321
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,850
That's not nice for girls, right?

322
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,061
Yingfan, aren't you in a hurry?

323
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,939
- Listen...
- Uncle

324
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:19,856
OK

325
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,361
We hope they get married
Then he can call her "wife"

326
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:29,116
I heard my son call his girlfriend "Jin Ming"
It's really awkward.

327
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,784
Because that's my name too.

328
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,954
This name sounds weird.

329
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,043
Please feel free to eat

330
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,924
I shouldn't have done that.

331
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,640
The child will repeat it.
Things I saw while growing up

332
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,482
Let’s eat

333
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,278
Why don’t you go and serve the rice crust soup?

334
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,240
I should have

335
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,201
Only let the beloved children
Get in touch with beautiful things

336
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,871
Give me some steamed fish

337
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,708
When I realized I was a mirror for my child
My heart sank

338
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,001
The ribs here are delicious

339
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,634
(Groom Park Young-beom, bride Liang Jin-myeong)

340
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,928
Well, we picked a few.
Wedding Days in Jeju Island...

341
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,096
Didn't you tell them?

342
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,601
Why watch Yingfan?

343
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,604
Mom, I already told you...

344
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:45,400
It would be awkward for us to have two weddings.

345
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,695
There's no need to go to your place and make fun of Yingfan.

346
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,616
I understand that Jeju Island may have its own customs

347
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,535
But Jinming will leave your family and marry into ours

348
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,288
Shouldn’t our own ideas be the main thing?

349
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,425
Pick a place anyway
Do you want to choose Jeju Island?

350
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,636
Then we won't do it here.

351
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,847
No, let's hold it in Seoul.

352
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,018
It seems that you finally don't have to do housework anymore

353
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,062
I don't believe it

354
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,481
Look how she serves you soup.

355
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,026
We still have a long way to go don't we?

356
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,196
She doesn't understand anything

357
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,949
I'm not sure if I can
Entrust so many household chores to her

358
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,575
that

359
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,205
About Housework as a Working Woman May…

360
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,624
That's why I asked her to resign.

361
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,876
Yes or no?

362
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,796
Mom can we talk about this...

363
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,506
Am I talking to you son?

364
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,093
Give me some rice crust soup

365
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,594
What?

366
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,054
no problem

367
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,104
No, you can't even serve soup.

368
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,692
The eldest daughter can usually do this kind of thing well.

369
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,529
But Jinming is a little different

370
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,531
As long as she can make delicious bean paste soup

371
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,046
Peas I want to eat peas

372
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,382
Pea, your pea is here.

373
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:44,603
Mom will never forget
The moment when Dad turned around that day

374
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,397
She told me a hundred times

375
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,482
He is the first husband in Dodong-ri to do this.

376
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,359
Eating at the same table with my wife

377
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,820
I will eat at this table from now on.

378
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,488
Why?

379
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,991
Dad chose his own war

380
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,117
Why? Brat!

381
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,912
He never let his mother go to the battlefield alone

382
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,832
I want to eat with you too.

383
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,627
Dogs are better than you.

384
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,255
Dad's turn was truly unprecedented.

385
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,300
I realized this when I was serving the rice crust soup

386
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,511
I'm also good at serving soup.

387
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,181
No, sit down.

388
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,682
It's okay, let me come

389
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:27,896
Give me

390
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,985
- I can do it too.
- You eat it.

391
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,746
Your mother does everything for you.

392
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,581
That's why you don't understand anything

393
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,541
Is that right?

394
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,382
I can't teach her this.

395
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,968
She is so precious to us.

396
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,513
So precious...

397
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,144
So I chose not to teach her.

398
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,995
No I don't want

399
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,834
You should send your parents home.
We prefer to take the subway

400
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,751
let's go

401
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,211
How about taking a taxi?

402
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,462
No, it's okay.

403
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,047
There are too many cars in Seoul

404
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,007
If there is a traffic jam, you will be late.

405
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,093
Let’s just take a taxi, okay?

406
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,889
Taxi

407
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,071
Today is good, see you later

408
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,031
We're off

409
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:03,992
Let's go

410
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,660
Walk

411
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,956
Uncle and aunt, safe journey

412
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,376
Goodbye Jinming, we will call you when we get home.

413
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,170
Don't worry about anything

414
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,339
I know you're fine.

415
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,674
Let's go! Hurry up!

416
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,845
Goodbye Jinming. I'll call you when I get home.

417
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,972
Safe journey, uncle

418
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,280
My mom is crying

419
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,242
Did I screw up again?

420
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,415
You are so nice

421
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,834
You are such a good boy.

422
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,641
Oh my god

423
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,936
Jinming, you are also an indoor plant

424
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,896
- Mother
- "Mom" What?

425
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,816
Every time I start talking you interrupt me

426
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,485
Why aren't you in front of them?
Speak more for her?

427
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,570
Will it kill you to be quiet for a minute?

428
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,326
What did I say to make her tremble like that?

429
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,828
Too precious to teach these?

430
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,040
She said that to piss me off.
Even if they beg me, I will still be angry.

431
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,667
- mom!
- What's wrong?

432
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,046
aunt

433
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,798
The problem is…

434
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,802
I am also an indoor plant

435
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:46,886
What's up?

436
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,513
I also grew up in

437
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,559
In an incredibly safe greenhouse

438
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,145
Considered the most precious thing

439
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,231
so…

440
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:03,444
Please stop being so harsh on me.

441
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,449
This will make my parents cry.

442
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,787
Oh my god.

443
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,799
I sent her to college.
Did you ask her to cook bean paste soup?

444
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,761
She pretends to be so awesome in front of me
Why don't you say a word there?

445
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,098
Why do you want to do that?

446
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,021
Can't you stand this?

447
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,109
Our Jinming also has parents

448
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,402
She has her family!

449
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,239
Is this what you want her to know?

450
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,408
You've been patient.

451
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,078
I thought you would make a scene and not let your daughter get married.

452
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,165
I've thought about it hundreds of times.

453
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,375
But she said she liked him

454
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,756
I endured it.
Because canceling it would make our children sad

455
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,759
It's not because she's any worse than him.

456
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,429
I would do anything for her marriage.

457
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,934
I won't let anyone say anything about my child.
Can't even bring a silver spoon

458
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,436
Jin Ming has parents

459
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,105
There is a mother and a father

460
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,029
Okay, anything is fine.

461
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,284
I am the boss of my family

462
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,787
But in his house, he is just a small fry.

463
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,622
I said we should take a taxi!

464
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,459
My mother-in-law really hates waiting for people!

465
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,128
Is she trying to piss me off on purpose?

466
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,922
Run quickly!

467
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,799
Who is she, your master?

468
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,592
We have to get through!

469
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,053
- I'm not going
- Mom, please!

470
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,055
Did I tell you my feet hurt?

471
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,099
Didn’t I already say I wanted to take a taxi?

472
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,018
Is she waiting for us with a stopwatch?

473
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,104
What if it's a little later?

474
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,565
First meeting
Didn't they also keep us waiting for an hour?

475
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,111
Please, Mom! What's wrong with you?

476
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,571
Did you do something wrong? Do you owe them money?

477
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,366
You act like a boss at home.

478
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,119
Aren’t you the eldest in our family?

479
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,370
Be a minion here

480
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,039
Then parents become the worst minions!

481
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,169
So beautiful. You look so beautiful.

482
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:29,007
You look so good in pink

483
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,341
You look like you're in your thirties.

484
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,927
I don't look thirty at all.

485
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:33,845
impossible

486
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,556
Choose pink.

487
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,435
We have another pink

488
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,023
Now that you are here, why don’t you help me choose?

489
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,067
Um…

490
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,279
What's wrong?

491
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,323
Don't you add flowers?

492
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,701
What flowers? No need

493
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,454
You have to add the pink flower embroidery

494
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,456
I'm just worried

495
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,250
I'll go a little overboard

496
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,377
Do you have other daughters?

497
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,839
This is your only time
To be able to sit there as the mother of the bride

498
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,716
Whatever you want,

499
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,217
that…

500
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,471
actually

501
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:21,517
Is that the one with rows of little flowers?

502
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:25,688
I watched it when Brother Zhelong got married

503
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,566
You just want flowers.

504
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,444
If you add flowers

505
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,238
She'll look a bit like a bride.

506
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,200
Your mother is quite young, right?

507
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,370
Choose the color of the red bean soup

508
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,331
But Mrs.

509
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,167
Pink is much better than that color

510
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,669
Is this your wedding, auntie?

511
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,754
What?

512
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,173
I chose this emerald green

513
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,550
aunt

514
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,345
My mother likes pink

515
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,763
Pink is tacky

516
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,974
The people present are not just your guests.

517
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,395
Fortunately, we came together

518
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,313
A relief

519
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,915
You keep refusing

520
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,501
So I thought…

521
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:31,838
No need

522
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,882
otherwise

523
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,928
Tell us what you want us to do...

524
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,222
Thank you for thinking so

525
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:42,849
but…

526
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,727
Why should I thank you for this idea?

527
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,771
Please don't do this...

528
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,736
Well if you can...

529
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,363
All right

530
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,281
I accepted it

531
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,796
Our Jinming may not be that gentle
Or whisper...

532
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,175
But she is kind-hearted

533
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,218
Very considerate

534
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,553
So please

535
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,847
Look at her good points

536
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:27,101
I know Yingfan is... cute

537
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,980
More importantly, my daughter likes him.

538
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:34,400
And she said he really cared about her

539
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,028
So I gradually fell in love with him

540
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,572
Jinming's mother

541
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,823
What's wrong?

542
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:44,160
If I don't say something, I might die.

543
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,461
Hey! Come here

544
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,215
Why are you so late? How embarrassing!

545
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,051
- Why are you outside?
- I'm afraid you won't find it

546
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,637
So it's just them?

547
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,264
Yeah, what's wrong?

548
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,599
Any questions?

549
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,518
Look at your messy hair.

550
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,062
Where? Which way?

551
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,897
- This side is right
- This way?

552
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,774
Any questions?

553
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,777
As a mother, what can’t you say for your child?

554
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,905
I'm worried that if I just keep silent

555
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,990
I will regret it forever

556
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:25,993
I see

557
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,079
Jinming's mother

558
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,373
Please stop this wedding.

559
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,001
I've endured this long like a saint

560
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,212
But as a mother, you must understand how I feel, right?

561
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,797
Yingfan

562
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,132
It's my fate

563
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,344
My masterpiece

564
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,766
I'm sorry to say this but I don't think Jinming is cute

565
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,643
She's hard to like.

566
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,729
Do you really want her to marry into a family like ours?

567
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,403
We each persuaded our own children

568
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,529
No matter what happens

569
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,573
Try to stop this marriage.

570
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,660
May I?

571
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,462
Where is Jinming...

572
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,718
What makes you so dissatisfied?

573
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,910
Why were you so quiet at lunch?
Do you know how uneasy Yingfan is?

574
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,120
So what?

575
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,706
Do you like him that much?

576
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,623
What?

577
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,043
What do you like about that boy?

578
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,128
Don’t you like Yingfan?

579
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,631
- No, I don't like him.
- why not?

580
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,009
He's hard to like.

581
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,678
What exactly is wrong with him?

582
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,306
He failed the bar exam.

583
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,351
I have nothing and I have made no progress, so...

584
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,268
What about me?

585
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,605
So what do I have? How am I better than him?

586
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,732
You think I'm not as good as him?

587
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,026
You don't even dare to say you like pink hanbok

588
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,320
No I never thought of it that way!

589
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,489
Then why didn't you tell her?

590
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,325
- Why do you grovel before her?
- Because she might be mean to you!

591
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,161
I hold back because I don't want her to hate you.

592
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,121
It's not because you think you're not as good as him.

593
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,208
Where are you lacking? Where?

594
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,460
This is nonsense, really.

595
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,383
What's going on?

596
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,552
Did Yingfan’s mother say anything?

597
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,270
Just thinking about the child going to kindergarten is not welcome
I feel uneasy

598
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:02,566
To marry you to her family.
How could I possibly lose my temper?

599
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,902
You are losing your temper!

600
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,242
So you'd better

601
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,577
Be tough

602
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,205
To toughen up for me

603
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:21,585
Even if you feel a little bit wronged
Your father and I will be deeply hurt.

604
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,257
I'm a bitch in my own home

605
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,302
But he's a savage in their home.

606
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,972
It's all my fault

607
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,099
Was it you who did this?

608
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,769
I said it was my decision.
Can't I have my own ideas?

609
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,647
Jin Ming, do you have a house?

610
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,773
Do you have money?

611
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:47,403
You think you can make him move out by acting cute?
Buy you a house?

612
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,947
Because you make it difficult for me

613
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,867
What kind of magic potion did you feed him?
Let him do this to me?

614
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,369
You really tied him to your belt.

615
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,745
Mom, did you hear me?

616
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,663
aunt

617
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,625
I never told Yingfan that I was moving out

618
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,586
How cunning and shameless

619
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,214
If she pokes me I won't even blink...

620
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,257
Mom, come home.

621
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,009
Who did you learn this from?

622
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,760
…she will definitely cross the line

623
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,972
I think I've made it clear to your mother.

624
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,350
Does she still insist on becoming my in-law?

625
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,769
- Mom, come home.
- Let go!

626
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,649
What did you tell my mother?

627
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,611
Didn't your mother tell you?

628
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:33,115
She must really want you to marry into our family.

629
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,241
mom!

630
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,326
What did you say?

631
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,746
I told her we should call off this marriage together

632
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,539
Can't I say what I should say?

633
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,753
The woman with the big nose

634
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,672
Age is all on the nose

635
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:52,301
She's just worried that you'll let her
Looks older and uglier

636
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,344
Isn't this obvious?

637
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,138
Why is she emerald?
Are you the color of red bean soup?

638
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,640
I would like to wear it

639
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,476
A thousand times of red bean soup colored hanbok

640
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,270
As long as she treats Jin Ming better, it's fine.

641
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,648
Who in this world would hate Jin Ming?

642
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,734
The teachers always liked her the most.
Everyone likes her

643
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,694
The elementary school teacher

644
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,322
Only let Jinming fetch the charcoal from the coal stove

645
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,448
The horse-faced one

646
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,826
Finally, she was awarded the Good Child Award

647
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,828
Actually, I gave him a red envelope.

648
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,456
30,000 won

649
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:27,962
When going on a picnic
I never let my kids bring just one kimbap

650
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,298
I always make sure to bring two copies and give one to the teacher

651
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,471
I don't want my kids to feel missing out.
Both financially and emotionally

652
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,307
So you gave her so much money as a dowry?

653
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,186
What could be worse than my child being hated?
What's even more sad?

654
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,147
Why as a mother

655
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,400
Couldn't she understand that?

656
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,444
What did the big-nosed woman say?

657
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,904
that is…

658
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,366
She's too harsh.

659
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,494
She's too hard on Jin-myung

660
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,583
Jinming does everything well
She can handle everything herself.

661
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,876
What's so good about her?

662
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,422
From my experience
Walking on thin ice will only make life more difficult

663
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,756
Jinming is different

664
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,343
We raised her like that.
Just to prevent her from suffering.

665
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:21,098
You want to come between me and my son?
Creating conflicts?

666
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,602
I didn't say anything and you're crying like this?
Did you learn this from your mom?

667
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,354
Mom, why are you doing this?

668
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,106
How far do you want to go?

669
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,066
Well-educated people tend to be more restrained in their speech.

670
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,486
- I just said a few polite words...
- Aunt

671
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,074
You've never been polite.

672
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:44,038
I can imagine how you treat my mom.

673
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:44,955
What?

674
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,374
The reason why I have endured until now

675
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,002
It's not because I'm worse than him.

676
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,922
But I know how embarrassed Yingfan is because of you

677
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,717
That's why I keep silent.

678
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,220
Did I embarrass him?

679
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:01,680
Me?

680
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:07,311
I saw your father's hand
I knew he was a worker!

681
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,897
- mom!
- I never found his hands embarrassing

682
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,358
My parents never embarrassed me.

683
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,568
Throughout the wedding preparation process

684
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,570
Our Family

685
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,365
More decent than you

686
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,787
Do you think that the matter is finalized once the invitations are sent out?

687
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,248
If I want to cancel… you know what?

688
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,417
Did you know?

689
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,092
I'm not getting married

690
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,805
I'm not getting married

691
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,937
How can I get married like this?

692
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,438
It will make my parents cry.

693
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,902
Do you want to break off the engagement?

694
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,489
You? Now?

695
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,617
Please stop! Please stop!

696
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,910
Why should I stop?

697
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,788
You probably owe me your whole life.

698
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,125
You are my pride! My life!

699
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,835
Yingfan's life is his own.

700
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,631
Auntie, the life in your mouth

701
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,010
It belongs to Yingfan

702
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,974
Where is Jinming?

703
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,602
What makes you so dissatisfied?

704
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,148
I believe she is a smart girl.

705
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,067
But that's marriage.

706
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:41,405
Marriage should be well-matched to avoid trouble

707
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,372
I never let Jinming go hungry for a day

708
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,709
What does she want me to do...

709
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:57,755
How do you feel about growing up in a struggling family?
Won't it bring shadow to her?

710
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,590
There is no such thing

711
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:03,051
In a struggling family, shadows are bound to exist

712
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,554
How could she be the same as the tree in the sunlight?

713
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,855
Sorry to be so blunt.

714
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,360
But having said this

715
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,198
I feel like a weight has been lifted off my chest

716
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,662
lady

717
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:35,125
Do you know where you put this burden?

718
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,673
Your son's heart

719
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,929
You're gonna put it there.

720
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,695
You are putting your son's life
As your own life

721
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,665
Hello, my name is Porolu.

722
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,667
Hi Porolu

723
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,961
Hello friends

724
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,129
Pororo, what are you doing?

725
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:30,097
Pope Francis arrived in South Korea for the first time this morning

726
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,558
Kim Sun-hee reports live

727
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:37,980
Pope Francis' charter flight
Arrived at Seoul Air Force Base in the south of the city

728
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:38,939
Of all the popes…

729
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,440
Extreme heat intensifies

730
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,485
Heat-related illnesses are rising sharply

731
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,573
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that since May…

732
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,550
Are you still asleep?

733
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,345
Don't drink too much, son.

734
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,557
Good night

735
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,436
Don't do this.

736
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,273
Why should I be walking on eggshells around her?

737
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,233
Why should I

738
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,944
Live like this?

739
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,239
Go to sleep

740
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,950
I worked so hard to raise you?

741
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,828
Just for now?

742
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,918
You only feel sorry for yourself, right?

743
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,670
What about me?

744
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,759
What do you have to complain about?

745
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,011
You are just too sensitive!

746
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,805
Everything I do is for you

747
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,766
I live for you

748
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,854
If you marry that girl
Will be more unhappy

749
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,568
How could you do this to me?

750
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,989
How could you humiliate me like this?

751
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,868
You are my life

752
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,955
My life!

753
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,623
This is my fate

754
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:24,169
This is my tragic fate
I never got what I really wanted.

755
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,175
But you're happy.

756
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,678
Are you happy?

757
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,137
Look

758
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,101
You were the only one smiling at my wedding

759
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,531
My first love didn't end like a fairy tale

760
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:57,953
Jin Ming

761
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:01,999
Hey, wait a minute.

762
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,878
Do you know that your mom made my mom cry?

763
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,968
I don't even want to cry for your mom right now

764
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,603
Hello everyone

765
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,607
North Korean leader Kim Il Sung passed away at 2 a.m. today

766
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,318
With the deepest regret

767
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,155
We declare to the Korean people

768
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:37,242
Our great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung

769
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:42,330
Due to sudden illness
Died at 2 a.m. on July 8, 1994

770
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,792
Our great leader of steel

771
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:50,922
A heart that can resist external attacks

772
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:56,845
Did it really stop beating?

773
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:59,598
34 hours after the news of Kim Il-sung's death

774
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,933
This afternoon, the Pyongyang Broadcasting System…

775
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,143
When we broke off our engagement...

776
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,646
The radio broadcast announced the death of Kim Il-sung

777
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,940
I cried like a North Korean spy

778
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,400
It's said to be a heart attack

779
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,904
The cause is fatigue and cardiovascular disease

780
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,405
North Korean broadcasts also…

781
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,249
Jin Ming

782
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,927
We have been together for seven years

783
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,931
It took a year to break up

784
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,767
Be your good son.

785
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,143
Good son

786
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,230
Are you the type who wants to please everyone?

787
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,107
What kind of woman will be happy with you?

788
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,110
Everyone is jealous of your fake good temper
Unhappy and depressed

789
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,112
Do you really have to say that?

790
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,197
We hurt each other

791
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,032
Throwing harsh words at each other...

792
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,828
Have you ever lived with me?
Try it before you decide

793
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,079
Why am I doing this?

794
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,414
Why should I be treated like garbage by your family?

795
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,169
Can you live without me?

796
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,340
- Can you?
- Can

797
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:18,385
I will be happy without you, and I will be perfect without you

798
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,905
Who asked you to hug me?

799
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,283
…worry about each other

800
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,703
Express your feelings without reservation

801
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:12,230
It's so cold you'll freeze to death

802
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,367
It's past midnight now

803
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,788
Can I still send you flowers?

804
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:30,498
Only flowers

805
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,547
Why did you give me flowers on my birthday?

806
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:40,675
A gift to myself

807
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,350
Aren’t you cold?

808
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,018
Frozen to death

809
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,731
Yingfan

810
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,154
Stop it

811
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,329
Really tired

812
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:11,539
Really tired

813
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:21,925
Is it really over?

814
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:24,928
Nothing more to talk about?

815
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,105
Don't you love me anymore?

816
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,649
Of course I love

817
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,360
How could I not love it?

818
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:44,114
I really love you

819
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,326
But I love myself too

820
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,038
I feel so sorry for myself...

821
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,625
I can't go on any longer.

822
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,876
I want to cut off ties with my family.

823
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,630
- Okay?
- Who wants to live like that?

824
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,174
If your heart aches, my heart will also ache

825
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,318
If we become a family

826
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,447
Will hate each other

827
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,073
I can't let you go

828
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,451
What if I just can’t do it?

829
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,041
How could you not do that?

830
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,419
I've always told you this, right?

831
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:43,298
The living must continue to live

832
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,012
sorry…

833
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,224
It's so cruel when we break up

834
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,644
I should apologize.

835
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,106
I really am...

836
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:05,612
Thank you

837
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,698
Honestly…

838
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,121
I really appreciate everything Yingfan

839
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,796
I'm really glad to have you to remember

840
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,507
My Twenties

841
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,426
Do we have to do this?

842
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,553
Do you really want to do this?

843
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,903
come over

844
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,031
No

845
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,202
But this is the last time

846
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,677
I will miss your taste

847
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,263
one way or another

848
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,766
Please remember to call me if you have any problem, okay?

849
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,103
You don’t know anyone in Seoul

850
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,188
Promise me to call me, okay?

851
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,317
I will

852
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:28,653
I promise you

853
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,824
Does this mean that...

854
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,203
We won't see each other again starting tomorrow?

855
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,081
How can we still meet?

856
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,835
Why can't we meet?

857
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:49,382
Why can't we? It's so unfair

858
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,217
In Seoul, where I am alone

859
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,095
He is my love

860
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:55,889
my family

861
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,850
and my best friend

862
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:05,732
Suddenly
My closest friends and I have become strangers

863
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:11,988
Just like the little prince left
Our little planet is inhabited by just the two of us

864
01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:03,326
(“Ready to go, give it your all
Dance with the moment")

865
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:12,752
