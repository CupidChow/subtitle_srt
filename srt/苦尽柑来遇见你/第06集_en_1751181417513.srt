00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,982
《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:12,322
Now we have a house

3
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,908
A ship

4
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,328
It's really amazing

5
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,164
Are you happy?

6
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,082
right

7
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,877
I am so happy

8
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,264
Enough

9
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,487
That was a glorious time that will never come back

10
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:59,369
Episode title: "Life Can Go On As Long As It's Alive"

11
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,979
(Vice President Wu Aichun of Hanlin Disaster Relief Fund)

12
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,321
(Infant formula)

13
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,295
I have to live up to this title, right?

14
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,678
After all, I am the vice president.

15
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,764
Add two more. I am the vice president.

16
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,534
What are you doing, you little troublemaker!

17
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,997
Didn't I say I'd give you candy after you finish the noodle soup?

18
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,459
Why didn't you listen to your mother?

19
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,421
Mommy, hug me

20
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,300
Mommy, hug me

21
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,762
Mommy, hug me

22
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,556
Aunt Wu! Jin Ming had an accident!

23
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,099
What happened to mom?

24
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,476
Mother

25
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,314
Did she bleed?

26
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,441
I don't know where it is.

27
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,405
Auntie! Can you help me look after the child?

28
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,525
Are you the daughter of the Dragon King?

29
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,737
Why are you riding a bicycle when the dolphins are making such a fuss and there is a typhoon?

30
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,366
The motorcycle hit me, not me.

31
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,203
Didn't you know that the wind in Jeju Island can overturn cars?

32
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,872
Such a small thing can be overturned a hundred times

33
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,216
Aunt!

34
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,553
Aunt!

35
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,226
Aunt!

36
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,603
Where are my children?

37
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,607
Do you let your children sleep at home?

38
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,443
What's going on? What child?

39
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,078
Silver Ming!

40
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,874
Why did you leave your brothers alone?

41
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,876
It's not a big accident at all

42
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,461
Silver and bright!

43
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,462
baby!

44
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,380
Bronze Ming! Silver Ming! Bronze Ming!

45
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,715
Tong Ming! Baby!

46
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,425
baby!

47
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,343
Silver Ming!

48
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,928
Silver Ming!

49
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,598
Silver Ming...

50
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,524
Grandma always said that as long as my brothers learn to walk

51
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,401
Will run around everywhere!

52
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,195
Remember? Their shoes

53
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,697
No more

54
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,535
I'll go to the cabbage field.

55
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,455
Aichun! You have to pay me for the green seaweed. Keep looking for me.

56
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,541
All because I want to bring your eldest son back.

57
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,878
I don't have time to harvest seaweed.

58
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,838
Are you going to let people live?

59
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,967
Didn't I tell you to stay home?

60
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,889
He is standing alone on the seawall looking for you

61
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,018
What were you thinking about going there alone?

62
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:38,481
Auntie Trucker will come to you guys why can't you just wait...

63
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,735
If you stand there the waves will swallow you up

64
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,697
Typhoons in Jeju Island can even sweep away cows, so be careful!

65
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,783
What about Tong Ming?

66
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,206
Where is Tongming? At home

67
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,126
Isn't Tongming with you?

68
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,462
at home!

69
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:08,052
What are you talking about? Don't scare me!

70
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,764
Mommy, hug me

71
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,976
Is she bleeding? Mom

72
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,344
Jin Ming

73
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,139
Call the Fisheries Association Office

74
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,903
Who can resist the unpredictability of this summer?

75
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,032
Yesterday, she was as bright as a bride.

76
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,744
Suddenly, it became like a grumpy wife throwing tantrums

77
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:19,499
You can remarry your wife but you can't avoid summer

78
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,084
Damn it.

79
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,711
Damn it!

80
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,047
God

81
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,758
He is building a retaining wall with his mouth

82
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,929
Wide planting!

83
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,771
Baby! Tongming!

84
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,314
Bronze Ming!

85
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,651
Bronze Ming!

86
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,736
Bronze Ming!

87
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,282
Liang Tongming! Tongming!

88
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,575
Bronze Ming!

89
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,538
Bronze Ming!

90
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,664
Liang Tongming!

91
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,624
Bronze Ming!

92
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,378
Bronze Ming!

93
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,925
Tongming! Tongming!

94
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,594
Tongming! Tongming!

95
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,263
Liang Tongming! Tongming!

96
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,808
Where did he go? Tong Ming!

97
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,811
Bronze Ming!

98
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,147
Tong Ming! Baby!

99
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,819
Liang Tongming! Baby!

100
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,238
Bronze Ming!

101
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,866
Liang Tongming!

102
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,912
Please have mercy on us and let the child go no matter what.

103
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,999
Please let our children go and return them to us.

104
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,668
Please give us our children back

105
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,550
Losing a child is a matter of seconds.

106
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,176
Please save my grandson.

107
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,762
You know people all over the world

108
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,223
What do you say when you lose your child?

109
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,393
Tong Ming my baby they will say the same thing

110
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,478
They will say it's just a blink of an eye.

111
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,607
They lost their baby in the blink of an eye!

112
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,698
Did you find him? Did you find him?

113
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,327
Did Aichun find him?

114
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,913
Love Pure

115
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,211
Love Pure

116
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,672
What's wrong?

117
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,674
What's wrong?

118
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,124
Hospital

119
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,461
We have to go to the hospital.

120
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,672
baby

121
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,675
My baby has a cold

122
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,847
Why didn't anyone call an ambulance?

123
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,603
Copper Ming

124
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,188
baby

125
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,648
baby

126
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,191
Copper Ming

127
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,902
Copper Ming

128
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,612
baby

129
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,406
baby

130
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,408
What's wrong with him?

131
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,202
baby

132
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,580
doctor

133
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,543
We have to call the doctor.

134
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,016
Kuan Zhi called an ambulance

135
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,146
Why didn't anyone call an ambulance?

136
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,691
No one called an ambulance.

137
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,740
The day their world fell apart...

138
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,334
first…

139
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,174
Iron Man collapsed

140
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,613
My father's cry echoed across the sea

141
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,116
I should have hugged him.

142
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,165
I should hug him.

143
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,294
She had just fed her son lunch.

144
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,631
Dinner is gone.

145
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,762
Mommy, hug me

146
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,805
Mommy, hug me

147
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,974
Mommy, hug me

148
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,393
Mommy, hug me

149
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,519
Mommy, hug me

150
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,740
I should hug him.

151
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,412
I should…

152
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,687
At the funeral, grandma didn't blame mom.

153
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,317
She said a mother who lost her child has more tears than the ocean

154
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,706
Stay alive

155
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,834
What else can I do?

156
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,130
You have two children to raise.

157
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,802
As long as you hold on, life will go on.

158
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,762
Life will go on

159
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,474
Life can go on as long as you are alive

160
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,602
There will be harder days in your life.

161
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,400
Life can be hard somedays when you feel like you're dying...

162
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,027
I told you to stop talking!

163
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,112
I don't agree

164
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,781
I don't eat abalone anymore

165
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,454
my darling

166
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,999
When will you grow up?

167
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:33,927
Love Pure

168
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,598
If one day life becomes so difficult that you feel like you can't hold on any longer

169
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,558
You have to remember that I dive every day.

170
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:48,108
People who make a living on land say they want to die when they encounter the slightest difficulty.

171
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,361
But no matter how hard or tiring life is

172
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,156
Ama-nyeo wouldn't say that.

173
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,870
In the turbulent sea, I brushed shoulders with death countless times.

174
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,207
I can find countless reasons to live.

175
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,583
Then live on.

176
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,710
You should live

177
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,546
Why die when there are so many reasons to live?

178
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,803
Being physically tired will make you forget your worries

179
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,599
One day life will be so hard that you feel like you can't hold on any longer

180
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,518
Don't lie down all the time

181
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,770
Struggling desperately

182
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,814
Use your feet to clean the quilt

183
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,192
Farming and doing odd jobs to earn some money

184
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,154
Tell yourself you must live no matter what

185
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,907
Waving arms and legs

186
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,537
You can cross the dark waters

187
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,373
See the sky

188
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,753
You can breathe again

189
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,071
Do you know how to do it?

190
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,074
It should be sweet, right?

191
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,041
Looks really good

192
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,598
Is this what you want to eat?

193
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,895
Is this what you've been longing for?

194
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,568
Why don't you talk to your mother?

195
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,905
Are you mad at your mother?

196
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,952
Liang Yinming

197
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,871
I asked you why you didn't talk to your mother.

198
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,168
Do you never talk to your mother again?

199
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,790
(Tuition and miscellaneous fees should be paid before the 20th)

200
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,766
Why didn't you let us know that you got a perfect score?

201
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,103
Why don't you show it to your dad?

202
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:00,986
Jin Ming

203
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,532
What’s wrong with you?

204
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,701
Are you mad at your mother?

205
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,329
Are you silent because you are angry with your mother?

206
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,748
Is it because...

207
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:15,792
Is it because...

208
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,340
I didn't bring my brother back?

209
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,218
Is that why you're angry and won't talk to me?

210
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,139
Because mom is angry

211
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,393
What did you say?

212
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,521
I left my brother behind.

213
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,899
That's why he died

214
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,368
because…

215
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:51,995
because…

216
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,623
I rode a bicycle

217
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,586
If I hadn't ridden the bike, Tongming would still be alive.

218
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,046
Told me all...

219
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,342
Don't ride a bicycle when a typhoon is coming

220
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,263
But I still rode it

221
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,474
That's why Tong Ming died.

222
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,897
Mom and Dad said

223
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:24,236
That's when they woke up.

224
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,450
sorry

225
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,494
sorry!

226
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:34,871
sorry

227
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,541
It's all my fault

228
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,793
Sorry Yinming

229
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,873
Three days later, the Iron Man climbed up

230
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,459
He ate the mountain of rice.

231
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,545
I went out to sea.

232
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,102
Jin Ming

233
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,354
Tell your teacher

234
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,858
Dad will pay the tuition and fees within three days

235
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,281
Okay?

236
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,037
They have three days to mourn.

237
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,165
Only three days

238
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:08,048
Dad, what are you going to catch today?

239
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,343
Yellow croaker Summer yellow croaker

240
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,970
Yellow croaker? Hmm?

241
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,557
I don't want to sell it, I want to take it home

242
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,476
Our family? Yes

243
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,022
We're eating tonight

244
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,942
Eat together as a family

245
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,997
Don't you eat?

246
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,624
She has sold out all her stuff and is closing up her stall

247
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,421
She has her back to the sea but business is good?

248
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,009
She doesn't even want to look at the sea

249
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,262
But the sea is so clear

250
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,142
It looks so clear and calm, as if nothing has happened.

251
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,144
It makes me want to vomit

252
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,277
The sea took her mother, her father and now her son

253
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,072
Imagine how she feels if she still has to make a living from the sea.

254
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,244
She is trying to survive with a heart full of scars.

255
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,498
The Dragon King is so heartless, isn't he?

256
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,251
It took away everything she held dear

257
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,965
But he kept giving her things as if to say: "I won't let you die yet"

258
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,217
I admire her so much

259
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,179
I admire her for persisting.

260
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,599
All the squid sold?

261
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,602
I caught a longtooth grouper today

262
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,981
If I sell it, I can easily earn 1,000 won.

263
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,489
After buying Yinming a new school bag, there is still a lot left

264
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,449
It's so unfair

265
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,498
It's so unfair.

266
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,300
Jin Ming Yin Ming, let's go

267
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,610
I really don't want to

268
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,781
Have nothing to do with the damn sea anymore

269
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,244
So unfair

270
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,748
Love Pure

271
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,751
Stop crying

272
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:38,258
If parents keep crying, it will cast a shadow on the children.

273
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,218
They will be anxious

274
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,180
I really hope this nasty summer will end soon

275
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,226
It's annoying to keep changing.

276
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,396
It's too bright when it's bright

277
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,940
When it rains it pours

278
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,653
Summer allows everything on land and sea to thrive

279
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,406
Then sent a storm to destroy them

280
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,283
We can't handle it.

281
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,702
Two-Sided Summer

282
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,914
Knocked my young parents to the ground

283
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,168
Why so cruel?

284
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,504
If it were me, I'd be gentler.

285
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,135
Even drivers will give way to new drivers.

286
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,055
This is the first time for me.

287
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,518
Why can't you let me feel better?

288
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,355
Like grass blown down by a typhoon...

289
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,567
How can we continue like this?

290
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,404
…they fell but got up again

291
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,533
Summer's unpredictable nature will help us keep going

292
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,831
The grass and trees will be blown down by summer typhoons

293
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,750
But it will eventually stand up again

294
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,130
The rain seems to wash away everything

295
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,343
But as long as the sun shines again

296
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,887
No matter what, life will come back.

297
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,181
This is true of everything on land and sea

298
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,812
What if I can't hold on?

299
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,776
I always feel like I can't hold on any longer.

300
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,656
There are crabs here?

301
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,241
We have children to look after.

302
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,284
You can't catch

303
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,167
Wide planting

304
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,676
It was my fault

305
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,137
It’s me…

306
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,852
Let Tongming walk to the seawall

307
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:09,033
I've been carrying him on my back to pick you up on the seawall since he was one year old

308
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,581
I lined the kids up and said:

309
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,418
"If we stand here, Dad will come back"

310
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,592
I told them rain or shine

311
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,054
As long as we stand there, Dad will come back

312
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,899
I told them

313
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,030
Our family Tongming...

314
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,411
I killed him.

315
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,170
It's all my fault

316
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,554
God and the Dragon King are both cruel. Blame them.

317
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,187
It's not your fault at all.

318
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,688
Okay?

319
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,193
Don't blame anyone in our family. Don't blame anyone.

320
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:32,033
Dad kept telling himself this, but deep down he still resented someone

321
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:40,041
Mom said it was only 30 years later that she knew who he hated

322
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,250
(Goesan General Hospital)

323
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:45,171
(August 2005)

324
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,550
Hey

325
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,010
(Endoscopy Center)

326
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,180
Do you know what your dad is mumbling?

327
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,977
Is he talking nonsense?

328
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,646
This is what happens when you have an endoscopy.

329
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,238
Why did he mention another woman?

330
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,202
Retaining wall

331
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,496
What? Retaining wall?

332
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,832
Wide planting!

333
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,500
Wide planting!

334
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,920
“I shouldn’t have built the retaining wall.”

335
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,382
“I shouldn’t have gone”

336
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,176
He said so

337
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,225
No one has a heart of steel like him.

338
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,353
Once something gets into his heart, it can never get out.

339
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,647
He kept everything in his heart

340
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,650
I don't know how he survived.

341
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,486
How did you two survive?

342
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,950
Otherwise? Give up?

343
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:01,414
We also have two children looking at us with confused eyes

344
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,252
We saved you and dad.

345
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,005
Of course it's you

346
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,841
You saved us.

347
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,140
If it weren't for you...

348
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,101
If it weren't for you...

349
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,647

(Date of Birth: September 6, 1974)

353
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:59,055
(3 years old)

354
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,539
The pain of losing a child is unspeakable

355
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,296
He can't even cry openly anywhere

356
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,134
His heart was broken

357
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,650
You can't eat sugar candy as a meal

358
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,572
I have finished my meal.

359
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,490
Okay, stop eating.

360
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,835
I don't know how we can go on.

361
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,881
What on earth did you eat?

362
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,344
I have meals every day

363
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,763
Meat is often delivered.

364
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:37,403
We can continue to live thanks to those who bring us food

365
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,283
Rapeseed flowers will not bloom alone

366
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,410
Always blooming in clusters

367
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:49,207
If I were alone, I would have collapsed countless times.

368
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,298
It is said that it takes a village to raise a child

369
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,302
It takes a village to save a life

370
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,567
They'll be fine

371
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,569
As long as there is smoke, you can survive

372
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,994
Don't be too obvious. They may not want to be pitied.

373
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,956
Shouldn't I give it to them? This is a newly laid egg.

374
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,127
Give them the eggs. Free range eggs can give them strength.

375
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,296
What are a few eggs?

376
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,341
You gave them all our rice.

377
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,802
You gave them all the octopus!

378
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,768
So I was thinking…

379
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,271
I mean...

380
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,731
Can you give me some rice...

381
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,858
I don't understand what you are saying

382
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,236
Stop being hypocritical

383
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,280
There are many people who are worse off than you.

384
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,664
Is that you?

385
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,041
Those rice

386
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,545
I don't know what you're talking about

387
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,676
Don't you know what it means?

388
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,177
I know you did it

389
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,348
If the rice jar is not empty, there will be more rice.

390
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,651
I saw the rice jar was empty before I went to bed

391
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,320
I swear I saw it

392
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,628
Every morning, a little more and more

393
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,883
I thought it was at night and I didn't see clearly

394
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,385
But it's been more than a day or two.

395
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,472
That amount is always only enough for a family of three.

396
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,223
It doesn't make sense at all

397
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,060
Just enough to confuse me

398
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,187
Just enough for three people.

399
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,649
Why should I worry?

400
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,818
Why should I worry?

401
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,576
This is not a magic jar and I'm not stupid.

402
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,578
She also has a headache

403
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,498
I'll give it to you directly, but you won't want it.

404
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:39,377
She really has a headache so she tries to give it to you bit by bit

405
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,338
If you have a headache...

406
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:46,008
Who wants to see a pregnant woman starving?

407
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,347
You go steam the octopus.

408
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,099
I picked it up on the road

409
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,269
Why do you keep helping me organize my mother's festival?

410
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,689
If your mother doesn't have an octopus on her altar she'll scold you

411
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,152
Have you ever seen a female ama diving alone?

412
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,532
When I can't breathe in the dark water

413
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:13,536
You have to stay close to other people to survive.

414
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,205
Otherwise, fear will grab your heart and you won't be able to hold on.

415
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,125
No one can live alone

416
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,127
Go with others

417
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,546
This way, a hundred miles will feel like ten miles.

418
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:29,760
(Walking with others will make a hundred miles seem like ten miles)

419
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,434
Keiko

420
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,810
That belongs to Guangli's daughter.

421
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:43,315
Aichun is about to give birth, I will give it to her

422
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:47,653
It's just that I haven't caught it for a long time, so I want to touch it.

423
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,447
Right?

424
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,041
Please write "moral scholarship"

425
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,588
She will understand if I write this way.

426
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,763
"Morality"

427
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,765
"scholarship"

428
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:21,812
Is this correct?

(Dode Scholarship 10,000 KRW)

430
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:32,907
Is that wrong? It's three months' rent for that kid's family, right?

431
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,627
Are you illiterate?

432
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,342
One Two Three Four

433
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,135
Tens, hundreds, thousands

434
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,723
Yes, no problem.

435
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,647
Oh my god

436
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:09,485
If only I wasn't hiding in the closet

437
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,862
Why are you helping them pay their rent?

438
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,784
I guess I'm destined to live with a heroine.

439
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,912
Aren't you ashamed?

440
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,541
Of course, I deserve a slap for what I did.

441
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,336
But you didn't do anything wrong. Love is not a sin, you know?

442
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,714
Don't talk nonsense

443
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,509
Just take care of yourself, okay?

444
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,220
The retribution came directly

445
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:39,890
Beasts give birth to beasts, nobles raise nobles

446
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,727
Children always inherit the traits of their parents.

447
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,687
Minyu

448
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,146
Enough

449
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,232
She must hate me.

450
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,319
I ruined Wu Aichun's adolescence

451
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,906
Now I want to secretly make it up to her with 10,000 won

452
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,449
I gave her the cabbage patch.

453
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,952
That stony ground? That shit field?

454
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:03,038
It was Aichun who cultivated the whole field with her little hands.

455
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:07,293
And that was originally her mother's land

456
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,295
Minyu

457
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,547
Why don't you keep your mouth shut?

458
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,132
Don't talk nonsense

459
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,884
Minyu, I will be angry if I tell you to stop talking

460
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,804
Since I am raising the child now

461
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:23,892
I think even an asshole like you should send Aichun to college

462
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,187
Come on, what kind of university is she going to?

463
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:32,067
Let her go. I will pay for her even if I have to borrow money.

464
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,112
How does she go to college now? How does she go?

465
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,780
Let her go!

466
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,699
I'll put the money in front of her.

467
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,201
If she fails the exam, don't say anything.

468
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,205
You don't need any education to be a captain or vice president.

469
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,876
She'll be ripped off in Seoul.

470
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,420
At most, you can only be a doctor

471
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,048
It will ruin the family.

472
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,384
Yes, the government will put up banners to congratulate her.

473
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,553

Did you pass the exam?

477
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,278
Didn't pass the exam?

You did it

486
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,392
I'm not sure if I can say this.

487
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:52,523
I thought I'd never get the chance to say this again.

488
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,233
I…

489
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,192
Are you happy?

00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,407
I said I know

555
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,702
Damn it, why don't you understand? So what?

556
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,705
What does "I can't go" mean?

557
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,542
tonight

558
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,128
It's our last night.

559
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,924
Your last night before enlistment!

560
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,385
Anyway, you have to take care of her.

561
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,554
Your daughter...

562
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,889
I really want to...

563
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,807
Do you want to die?

564
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,018
...Don't be like you Wu Aichun

565
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:58,936
(Tonight Express Hotel)

566
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,398
《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

567
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:07,903
Honey

568
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,496
Isn't it beautiful?

569
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,498
Yes

570
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,835
Is it more expensive to live on a higher floor?

571
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,172
She said there was no room.

572
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,465
Do you believe her?

573
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,719
She may be a little impatient in front of us, but she is still the eldest sister.

574
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,806
She always worries even though I tell her not to worry.

575
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,977
Why do people in Seoul build rooms in basements?

576
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:45,107
It breaks my heart to see a child living in a basement

577
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,906
Do you think the cabbage patch can be sold?

578
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,575
Stay there.

579
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:57,869
But what if someone wants to buy it?

580
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,247
Stop selling stuff.

581
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,250
Why? You don't want to?

582
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,004
If you sell them all, you'll have nothing left to your name.

583
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,923
It doesn't matter. Do you want a wife or a daughter?

584
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,470
To be honest, when I think back

585
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,764
That was great.

586
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,018
That was the summer of our lives right?

587
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,896
Everything was so fresh then.

588
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,108
So everything is so clumsy and difficult

589
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,943
But that was the first time

590
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,030
I liked everything about that time

591
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,915
First Love

592
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,376
Our first night...

593
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,671
Our first home

594
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,216
Our first ship, our first full load

595
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,343
Our first child

596
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,138
Having your first child...

597
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,391
That feeling is indescribable.

598
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,772
Let's keep the cabbage field.

599
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,327
Keep the cabbage field

600
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:25,582
That piece of land is your reward for enduring that summer

601
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,087
I'm wondering how we're going to move forward.

602
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,508
But life goes on

603
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,678
Life really goes on.

604
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,808
(Life can go on as long as you are alive)

605
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:37,232
("The same sky, the same stars, the same heart")

606
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:47,367
