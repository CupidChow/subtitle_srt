00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,871
oops

3
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,374
Writing poetry is not that difficult

4
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,795
Write whatever you want to say

5
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,129
It became a poem

6
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,300
Yuxin cooks for me

7
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,594
Listen, I want to eat.

8
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,514
Mom, I want to eat.

9
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,807
("Don't Ask Me for Food Anymore" by Jin Yuxin)

10
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,433
Stop asking me for food.

11
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,978
Yuxin has been cooking for her family all her life

12
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,650
Those words you have kept in your heart all your life

13
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,029
"Loyalty and Filial Piety" by Lee Byung-sun

14
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,991
My eyes are useless, my ears are useless

15
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,663
Listen to my children, my back hurts so much

16
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,997
("I'm Always Uncomfortable" by Che Jinwen)

17
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,792
Please come see me more often

18
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,839
Some people haven't written anything yet.

19
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,968
Write down what you want to say most

20
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,637
It is the most beautiful poem in life

21
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,201
I didn't know

22
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,454
One day I will live to be 70.

23
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,264
I didn’t know…

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,685
What I want to say most at the age of 70

25
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,564
That's the word I used to say most often.

26
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,524
mom…

27
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,771
mom

28
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,613
Mother!

29
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,199
Mother!

30
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,164
Mother!

31
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,209
Mother!

32
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,212
Mother!

33
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,589
Come ashore quickly!

34
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,592
Why are you always the last one out of the water?

35
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,680
Seriously!

36
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,224
Is Abalone your daughter?

37
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,141
(Spring Passes)

38
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,184
Why did you go to sea again?

39
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,020
Did you go into the sea again just to piss me off?

40
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:31,938
(March 1960)

41
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,399
Mother!

42
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,777
The kelp is growing really well this spring. That miser won't come out of the sea easily.

43
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,320
Love Pure

44
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,655
Stop calling your mother.

45
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,199
Let's take a look at Boss Liang's expression!

46
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,953
It's just a sunburn!

47
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:51,457
How come Aichun is the only one who can't see that the little brother is already very excited?

48
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,003
Seriously, think about it.

49
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:59,382
If the daughter of a haenyeo marries a fishmonger, the whole Jeju Island will belong to her, right?

50
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,926
You are so annoying

51
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,515
She's gone

52
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,060
Were you slapped?

53
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,645
Why is your face always red?

54
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,232
Kuanzhi was rejected again

55
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,703
Why did she give birth to me when she might as well have given birth to an abalone?

56
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,247
Boss Liang

57
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,582
(Hong Qingzi)

58
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,375
I have two conch shells for you.

59
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,128
Come give me a good price

60
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,755
OK

61
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,092
Did you go to the Dragon King's throat to shovel the red algae?

62
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,136
Greed will kill the Ama, ignorance will not

63
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,054
(Full Light Ceremony)

64
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,182
Greed will kill the Ama

65
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,310
How is the mother-in-law in Hanlin?

66
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,729
Her breathing hasn't improved.

67
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,315
When the Ama gets sick, she can only rely on the catch in our nets.

68
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,359
Everyone, give her some help.

69
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,652
Is there only seaweed here?

70
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,155
My mother asked me to buy some abalone

71
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,531
Look for it in there.

72
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,034
Abalone in spring is very small

73
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,036
Not fat yet

74
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,666
Why don't you just give them all to her? How dare you!

75
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,627
She's here again, scaring me to death

76
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,253
Hanlin's mother-in-law has three sons

77
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,506
Why should we support her?

78
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,385
I don't go down into the terrifying sea every day to support her.

79
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,554
I risk my life harvesting abalone to feed my children

80
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,723
Not for some other old woman!

81
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,184
Do you think you are awesome?

82
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,144
Who taught you to go into the sea?

83
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,605
Who is going to feed your children?

84
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,942
Every household has hungry children.

85
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,985
You want to take care of a sick old woman?

86
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,488
I can't give the abalone away

87
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,323
It hurts me just thinking about it

88
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,825
Remember it well!

89
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,202
How did she get sick?

90
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,955
We would do the same to you if you were sick.

91
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,541
I won't get sick

92
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,085
The Ama women live and die together, and one person cannot survive

93
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,046
You are so compassionate, why are you still begging for food from the Dragon King?

94
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:08,052
You remarried to live a good life, why are you still so willful?

95
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,056
Can you handle that new blood-sucking husband?

96
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,183
But you are unwilling to share something with the Ama Senior?

97
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,394
When we fled here, we were all like beggars.

98
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,979
Who taught us to go to the sea?

99
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,732
If you forget the kindness of Hanlin's mother-in-law, you are worse than rotten fish.

100
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,778
You are better than rotten fish. Then why did your man's mouth become crooked due to the freezing?

101
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,073
That's because he slept in the cold!

102
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,784
The reason your man's mouth is frozen is because he has nothing to eat

103
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,287
It's already like this, why are you still nagging?

104
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,707
You are not qualified to talk nonsense here.

105
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,376
Your children don't even have the same last name, so what right do you have to make irresponsible comments?

106
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,044
Enough! Keiko!

107
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,547
Come on! I knew it

108
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,550
I can't go home without a quarrel

109
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,268
What? Go again!

110
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,146
What the hell...you bitch!

111
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,857
Damn it!

112
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,943
What are you doing...you bitch!

113
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,612
Damn it!

114
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,990
I shouldn't have brought her here when I fled here

115
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,617
What a pity!

116
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,368
Why did you mess with that pufferfish?

117
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,580
Don't you want to mess with something poisonous?

118
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,458
What a waste!

119
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,294
Go home and kick your blood-sucking husband

120
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,463
Don't kick other people's stuff.

121
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,818
Is Abalone your biological child?

122
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,780
My daughter won a prize but you only stared at the abalone

123
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,698
Why do you write poetry?

124
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,326
Can it become an abalone or a conch?

125
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,370
You should read it!

126
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,497
I was the second place in the essay competition.

127
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,582
Show it to your grandma.

128
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,334
The old Wu family likes people who read

129
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,340
Show them and say: "Please pay for my education"

130
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,092
Grandma doesn't like me

131
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,178
She said I look more and more like you

132
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,264
So she doesn't want to see me

133
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,641
Let's go back to your house and have dinner.

134
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,810
I told you to eat here.

135
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,145
Let's go! Your stepfather will be back soon.

136
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,147
What if I come back?

137
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,859
Can't I even eat the conch and red algae that my mom picked?

138
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,320
The daughter of the Wu family should eat with the Wu family

139
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,655
Why beg for food in someone else's house?

140
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,824
My uncle won't let me eat yellow croaker.

141
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,703
He won't let?

142
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:43,207
He said that Wu Zhongjiu was always ranked last because I always got full marks and won awards.

143
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,793
He said I took away all the luck of the eldest son.

144
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,422
I don't want to eat yellow croaker.

145
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,676
But he didn't share the food fairly.

146
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,345
I don't want to eat at all

147
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,472
I eat

148
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,349
Will choke

149
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,061
Can't I live here?

150
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,605
Is it not possible?

151
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,523
Why can't I do that?

152
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,111
Absolutely not? Why are you choking?

153
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,237
You didn't do anything wrong

154
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,615
Who would like you if you can choke while eating?

155
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,951
Let's go

156
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,869
I let you go!

157
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,329
Find someone to hurt you

158
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,955
Beg for food

159
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,000
Hey, you are here again. Pure love

160
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,376
It's pure love!

161
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,794
Are you stupid?

162
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,712
Love Pure

163
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,340
Do you want to stay for dinner?

164
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,133
No, I don't eat

165
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,024
That damn girl

166
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,448
Come on dad

167
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,619
She's like a thorn in my flesh

168
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,539
I heard that smoking can kill people, and the Dragon King is no exception.

169
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,378
Ama women make a living by holding their breath; smoking is tantamount to seeking death

170
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,012
Why don't you bring your child with you?

171
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,850
I still think you should keep her with you.

172
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,105
You have nothing and yet you still meddle in other people's affairs

173
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,066
Do we have the money and house to bring her with us?

174
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,652
There is no room in the rented hut.

175
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,197
How can you stop a child from wanting to stay with his mother?

176
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,867
What would happen if I took her in? Would she be used like a cow?

177
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,286
Or taking care of your half-brother or half-sister?

178
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,455
Blood is thicker than water

179
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,502
You insist on staying here just to see your daughter, right?

180
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:55,005
The child opened his eyes and ran over here

181
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,135
She really wants to see her mother, so what's the benefit of keeping her household registration there?

182
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,637
Both of them are guilty

183
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,305
At least that family has money.

184
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,599
She can finish her studies by staying there.

185
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,476
Why do girls have to go to school?

186
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,186
That would only put more pressure on her.

187
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,900
I heard that the female divers started learning how to dive when they were teenagers.

188
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,571
Would you say that to your daughter? Would you let your daughter go to the sea?

189
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,579
Any woman on the island would get angry when hearing you say this.

190
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,998
I will never let her go into the sea

191
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,959
It is better to be a cow or a horse than to be a haenyeo

192
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,503
I was so busy all day and didn't get much.

193
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,214
It's really infuriating

194
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,842
What's so good about this day?

195
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,720
That good boy can only be a servant here.

196
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,555
Then I threw this away

197
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,726
Reading this will only make you sad

198
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,729
Why do you fold it?

199
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,273
Why did you fold the second place work?

200
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,947
You'd better not look at it

201
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,463
(Gyeonggi noodles)

202
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,223
This is spelled wrong!

203
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,368
Is he seeking death?

204
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,919
I only bought five

205
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,963
One of them was sent

206
00:13:59,046 --> 00:13:59,964
Did your mom give it to you?

207
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,094
Did she say that?

208
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,598
You have six people in your family but always buy only five

209
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,934
Can you get rich selling fish?

210
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,519
Noisy little ghost

211
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,022
That little bad guy

212
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,524
look!

213
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,281
Aichun, you have to soak the pot first

214
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,367
What? What are you doing here?

215
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,383
Next! Damn yellow croaker!

216
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,887
What are you doing! Are you crazy?

217
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,388
What do you think this place is?

218
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,598
Aren't you a provincial yellow croaker?

219
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,599
What are you talking about?

220
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,183
Do you want to make a fortune from yellow croaker?

221
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,354
The child's grandmother is also a child of Old Wu's family

222
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,690
She looks so much like her dad!

223
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,775
Don't do that to her.

224
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,235
Don't be like that

225
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,446
That's your son!

226
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,450
Your elder brother must be shedding tears of blood in his grave!

227
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,368
You killed him!

228
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,746
How dare you mention my brother's name!

229
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,169
What happened to you? Are you possessed by something?

230
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,547
Do you blame me for your brother's short life?

231
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:28,010
You should be blamed for giving birth to a short-lived son.

232
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,432
My daughter! I want to take her away

233
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,355
What broken dishes are you washing?

234
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,982
It really opened my eyes!

235
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:04,505
Thanks to him for not giving me yellow croaker to eat, I can live with you

236
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,924
do you like me?

237
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,137
Why do you like me?

238
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,472
Because you are my mother

239
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,974
Oh my god

240
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,686
Because you are my mother, I like you, isn't that normal?

241
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,106
If you like me, grow up quickly

242
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,358
Grow up quickly

243
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,444
Give me 100 won every day

244
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,904
Did you read it?

245
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,791
Stupid Abalone

246
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,168
Wu Aichun, Grade 3, Class 8

247
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,505
Abalone is the only thing I eat every day.

248
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,174
Abalone in the Storm

249
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,885
Abalone is more precious than children

250
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,472
I wish I could see you out of the water sooner

251
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,475
But why can't I see you?

252
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,854
Is it because there is no abalone?

253
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,314
Is it because I held my breath for too long while searching for abalone?

254
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,984
A worried and frightened daughter

255
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,279
I can only blame the stupid abalone for making my mother so angry

256
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,701
She can earn 100 won by selling an abalone

257
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,579
I really want to pay for her day

258
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,123
Mom with back pain

259
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,208
Coughing Mom

260
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,088
With 100 won a day I can let her rest

261
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,559
Do you have any?

262
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,603
Do you have such a good daughter?

263
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,731
Why is my life so good?

264
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,741
OMG

265
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:15,010
Give me 100 won a day and I won't have to go to the sea

266
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:21,725
I also want to spend the whole day watching my baby

267
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,521
Is this the second place level?

268
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,522
Those fools are blind.

269
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:28,941
Is it that bad?

270
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,818
Still ranked second?

271
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,986
Should be number one!

272
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,760
Treat her well. If you don't treat her well, I will drive you away. My child will not leave.

273
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,722
Husbands can't bring you luck, but your children can.

274
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,016
This little damn girl

275
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,269
She is the biggest bitch

276
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,729
How could there be such a damn girl?

277
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,440
I don't mind having such a dead girl at home

278
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,156
My parents were deeply in debt.

279
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,825
I also had to take care of my first husband

280
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,411
The new husband eats and drinks for free

281
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,663
I'm destined to be a coolie.

282
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,167
Everyone wants to ride on my neck...

283
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,006
Only this bean-like child not only doesn't want to ride on my neck

284
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,134
He also took the initiative to help me share

285
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,974
What a damn girl.

286
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,853
She is the most annoying, so she is a dead girl

287
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,479
Just wait and see

288
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,359
Even if you die, that damn girl will still worship you

289
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,822
How can a shameless mother like me dare to ask for such a thing?

290
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,495
I won't let my precious child carry a common coffin

291
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,124
I want to watch her carry the VIP coffin

292
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,464
Even Confucius's writing is not as good as hers.

293
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,299
Love Pure

294
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,261
You will definitely stand out

295
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,519
(Fifth National Assembly Election)

296
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,611
Thanks to my daughter, I have such a big title.

297
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,657
Only if you become the deputy monitor can I become the deputy monitor's mother.

298
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,325
Do you want me to distribute some rice cakes to celebrate?

299
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,911
I don't want to be the deputy monitor!

300
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,996
The same is true for the Fisheries Association

301
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,666
The vice president is as important as the president.

302
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,377
If everyone wants to be the boss, who will be the deputy?

303
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,255
Generally speaking, the deputy has more power than the boss

304
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,007
Who would want to be a deputy?

305
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,635
I can't even be a team leader.

306
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,514
I want to be included in the family tree if I can become the deputy monitor

307
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,141
Don't remember! Absolutely not!

308
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,520
In fact, Wu Aichun should be the monitor

309
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,563
I definitely think so about you.

310
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,899
You have to treat her like a monitor.

311
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,195
Oh Ai-chun received 37 votes while Lee Man-ki received only 28 votes

312
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,197
Why is Lee Man-ki the squad leader?

313
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,201
Why am I the deputy monitor? Why did they steal my position as monitor?

314
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,744
"steal"?

315
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,331
(Class monitor election: Wu Aichun and Li Wanji)

316
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,334
Are you a bit selfish?

317
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,461
But I got 37 votes

318
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,466
You are really courageous.

319
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,179
Didn't you eat the butter buns that Wan Ji's father gave you?

320
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:51,018
Didn't you use the floor wax that was given to you?

321
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,937
But I got 37 votes

322
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:01,069
Those 37 people who took the benefits but didn't vote for Wan Ji are so ungrateful.

323
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,740
But no matter where you are, you must be a leader

324
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,827
Morality and economic strength are both important, right?

325
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,079
But I got 37 votes

326
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,706
So what if I got 37 votes?

327
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,708
Who cares about your 37 votes?

328
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,128
What is 37 votes in reality?

329
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,838
Compared with Wan Ji,

330
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,676
The difference is more than just nine votes, okay?

331
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,810
It's embarrassing to be pulled off the stage, but it's not shameful to find a way out on your own

332
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,896
Sacrifice small interests for the greater good

333
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,856
You can be a winner even if you lose

334
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,195
If you lose, you lose.

335
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,822
If you lose, you lose!

336
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,699
Why am I the deputy monitor?

337
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,034
Why?

338
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,410
Hey, stop crying!

339
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,287
Why do you have to get involved in this?

340
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,748
Didn't you see the campaign posters on the wall?

341
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,167
Then those who care about titles will have nothing.

342
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,877
I should be the monitor!

343
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,338
Give me my job back!

344
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,614
You made such a scene that day that I thought I'd never see you again

345
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,573
What do you know?

346
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,409
I just told the truth

347
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,702
I think everyone should wake up.

348
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:37,374
You are someone's wife, not a slave. How can you be left alone to plough the fields?

349
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,042
I have no money

350
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,757
You should go, go quickly!

351
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,177
If my mother-in-law knew, I'd be dead.

352
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,679
You can still run away

353
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,391
But I have to stay in Old Wu's house for the rest of my life

354
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,269
I'll finish it as soon as possible and help you collect the sesame seeds

355
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,979
I told you I have no money!

356
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,356
I have nothing

357
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,859
You can search me to see what I have.

358
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,485
No, I know you have something.

359
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,070
I know you have

360
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,615
Right? Why don't you take me?

361
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,868
I'm a pauper with nothing

362
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,786
No, I'm not talking about money.

363
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,330
You know

364
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,374
What I want is...

365
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,419
That thing

366
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,007
No, absolutely not.

367
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,217
Will that break it?

368
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,138
I'll help you harvest sesame seeds.

369
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,348
I work like a servant, can't you lend it to me?

370
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,351
Absolutely not! I can't bear to wear it myself.

371
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,315
I swear to plow this land for you in two days.

372
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,152
Just think of it as borrowing a cow to plow the fields for a few days.

373
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:55,118
Who would lend their wedding jewelry to someone else? Why didn't you buy one when you remarried?

374
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,621
Come on, don't you know me yet?

375
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,414
I plow the land better than a cow

376
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,109
(Stupid Abalone)

377
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,529
("The Loyal Lee Family" by Lee Man-ki, Class 8, Grade 3)

378
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,197
(My father was an army general and was loyal to his country)

379
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,324
Loyalty is a joke!

380
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,076
What kid would write like that?

381
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,870
This assignment is for the children, not their parents.

382
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,540
Hey

383
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,502
Should this be the first one?

384
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,880
What about in a gold frame?

385
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,675
The stuff inside is not at the same level at all.

386
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,636
I understand

387
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,180
The General's Son Wins First Place

388
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,849
The general's son is the squad leader

389
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,977
It's disgusting

390
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,479
How embarrassing!

391
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,232
You won't be

392
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,192
Aichun's aunt?

393
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,446
Please take a seat

394
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,364
Thanks

395
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,000
(315 election fraud case mastermind)

396
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,300
actually

397
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,094
I am the mother of Aichun

398
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,804
Not her aunt

399
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,557
I see

400
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,810
Aichun also has a mother

401
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,395
That's right

402
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,566
I have been busy making a living and have not come to see you.

403
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,529
I brought some rice cakes and asked you to share them with the whole class.

404
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,033
That's not necessary.

405
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,702
There is a reason for everything

406
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,080
(Class monitor: Li Wanji, deputy class monitor: Wu Aichun)

407
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,458
To congratulate my child who was supposed to be the class monitor

408
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,672
The second place that should have been the first place

409
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,011
What did he say?

410
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,055
Can I be the monitor?

411
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,264
Can I be the monitor again?

412
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,018
Are you angry again?

413
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,562
Are you making a scene again like you did at grandma's?

414
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,147
Of course I made a scene

415
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,900
I'll make him shut up forever.

416
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,694
OK

417
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,571
I will share rice cakes with the children

418
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,615
I leave my child in your care

419
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,951
And I am busy making a living...

420
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,286
But you know

421
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,080
There are 70 students in our class.

422
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,541
Everyone eats like a pig

423
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,169
I'm not sure if this is enough to eat.

424
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,799
Parents have the same idea when they hand their children over to others.

425
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,053
Please take good care of my daughter.

426
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,973
There's nothing I can do. It's all up to her.

427
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,935
The rice cake may be a little less

428
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:11,648
But all parents want their children to get more love

429
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,026
If you can

430
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,570
I'd like to bring a whole cow.

431
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,322
These are just for...

432
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,118
Warm your feet

433
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,120
You don't have to do this

434
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,872
Just to warm your feet

435
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,085
These are nylon.

436
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,027
At least she's polite.

437
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,363
(Thank you forever from Wu Aichun's mother)

438
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,369
It's really unpleasant.

439
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,330
Did she just go to the bank?

440
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,166
Brand new banknotes

441
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,794
Why are you dressed like this?

442
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,463
I don't want to smell like the sea

443
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,132
Everyone says you have to be polite when meeting a teacher.

444
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,093
I can't let the rice cakes smell like the sea

445
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,139
You must listen to your teacher to succeed.

446
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,477
It would be nice if I could sit at the desk and write like the teacher.

447
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,396
He won't let me be the monitor, will he?

448
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,941
Did he ask you to buy anything? Like a broom?

449
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,487
Morality and economic strength?

450
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,574
I tried being the deputy monitor for a few days and it was better

451
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,660
The only difference is the word "副" in front.

452
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,454
It's actually the same thing

453
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:53,041
I just can't lead everyone to say hello to the teacher, but I feel that's okay.

454
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,293
When Li Wanji led everyone to do so

455
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,670
I imagine myself doing that.

456
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,090
It's better to be the deputy monitor

457
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,512
Love Pure

458
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,766
Unfortunately, I'm not you.

459
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,309
Don't hold back

460
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,562
Enjoy life to the fullest

461
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,399
You shouldn't back down either.

462
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,820
The first thing I want to do when I grow up...

463
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,162
What’s wrong with you?

464
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,831
I want to live a hundred years

465
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,209
Our oldest daughter said the first thing she wanted to do when she grew up

466
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,711
Just buy me a pearl necklace

467
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,421
I want to try it on.

468
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,756
Oh my god

469
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,174
How long do we have to wait?

470
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,510
The kids grew up in no time.

471
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,847
I can wear a pearl necklace right away

472
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:53,393
It's not just the kids who grow up fast, we age fast too.

473
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,436
I just watched the news

474
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,022
It is said that the average life expectancy in South Korea is only 52 years old

475
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,774
I will live longer

476
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,694
I will enjoy my life until I am sixty or seventy

477
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:07,574
By then, these sufferings will be nothing.

478
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,909
I will die smiling

479
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,963
I don't think I've quit smoking.

480
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,256
Quit smoking today

481
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,554
Hey please

482
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,974
Wow damn.

483
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,363
Spring is too short

484
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:52,660
Just when I thought it was coming, the flower withered in the blink of an eye

485
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,751
So cruel

486
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,023
You are so stubborn!

487
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,984
Why are you still going into the sea when you can't even breathe?

488
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,779
Stop talking useless nonsense

489
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,073
Just pray that I live a hundred years.

490
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,284
How can you go into the sea when your breath smells of blood?

491
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,203
Isn't this like carrying a coffin into the sea?

492
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,664
It makes no difference whether you die here or in the sea

493
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:41,709
Hey! Didn't you see Hei Wuchang standing outside the wall waiting for you?

494
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,171
I'll be waiting for you there in black clothes

495
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,089
Down to the sea

496
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,341
The Death God there

497
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,803
Watching you in the sea

498
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,973
If I were afraid of it, I wouldn't go to the sea to make a living.

499
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,933
The life of a female divers depends on luck

500
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,686
How many times have I escaped death from the sea?

501
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,732
Are you doing this because you're afraid your child will starve to death?

502
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,152
Guangli! Ama women live and die together

503
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,279
We won't let you starve...

504
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,449
I would rather die making money than begging.

505
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,245
I won't die if I don't leave more money for my children.

506
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,163
No, I won't die.

507
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,332
There is a fine line between life and death

508
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,169
You are afraid of regrets so you are too obsessed. Obsession will turn you into a ghost!

509
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,256
Ghosts don't scare me, but my children do.

510
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,342
I want to make money until I die

511
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,386
Feeding the Children

512
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,475
There is a solution! You can’t go into the sea without a diving suit!

513
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,687
That damn girl shouldn't have been brought back

514
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,197
(Wu Aichun is Liang Kuanzhi's wife Aichun is getting married)

515
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,287
Am I a beggar?

516
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,414
Yeah?

517
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,806
Let my mother go!

518
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,309
At least don't mess with my mom!

519
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,978
Lord Dragon, why are you like this?

520
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,190
Why do you always take away good people?

521
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,820
Please let her go!

522
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,364
Please let her go!

523
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,950
Please let my mother go!

524
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,412
She worked hard all her life

525
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,540
Never been on a plane

526
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,251
I still want to give her

527
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,754
Buy a pearl necklace

528
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,882
Take her on a plane

529
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,176
Why?

530
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,930
Why?

531
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,184
Why?

532
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,732
Why don't you speak?

533
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,528
Why don't you say anything?

534
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,655
What did you bring this time?

535
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,532
What?

536
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,200
let me see!

537
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,245
Can I come closer? Come here!

538
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:31,087
Do you think I can't eat yellow croaker or mackerel without you?

539
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,633
This is meat, not fish.

540
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,719
Such precious meat will not even be shared with family members.

541
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,681
Are you stupid?

542
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,267
Is there something wrong with you?

543
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,269
If you cry you will be hungry.

544
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,937
Are you sympathizing with me?

545
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,606
Is that why you keep feeding me?

546
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,276
If it was out of sympathy, I would go feed the beggars.

547
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,696
You little bad guy

548
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,740
I

549
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,160
Bigger than you

550
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,756
Don't send chickens, even if you send cows every day

551
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,758
I still won't marry you

552
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,343
I didn't ask you to marry

553
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,906
God, let her live.

554
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,409
How could she abandon her child?

555
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:48,998
Mother

556
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,044
Mother

557
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,888
Can you come with me?

558
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,932
I don't dare go alone

559
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,699
what?

560
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,038
Is that you, mom?

561
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,273
I feel like I picked up a golden axe that doesn't belong to me

562
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,442
Am I an iron axe?

563
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,697
where are you going?

564
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,783
You can give it to me tomorrow.

565
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,327
By tomorrow your brothers and sisters will have snatched them all up.

566
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,163
Selling one is worth 100 won

567
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,419
You eat worth 1000 won

568
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,346
Love Pure

569
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,890
If I die...

570
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,561
You just leave here

571
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,023
Go to your uncle and ask him to take you in.

572
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,318
Don't stay here and be a servant of the Lian family

573
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,739
Get out of here no matter what

574
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,324
Promise me

575
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,367
I don't agree

576
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,328
Stop talking

577
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,917
Live with your uncle and ask him to give you a wedding gift

578
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,880
I will cry if you get married without elders to see you off.

579
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,424
I told you I don't agree, why are you still saying this?

580
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,762
Only if you promise me can I rest in peace

581
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,222
Dad is dead

582
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,224
You're dying too.

583
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,769
Why is everyone dying?

584
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,689
Then why did you give birth to me?

585
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,609
Love Pure

586
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,696
In the end we will all be orphans

587
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,282
Even if the parents die first

588
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,534
The children have to continue living

589
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,869
Life can go on as long as you are alive

590
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,122
There are harder days in life

591
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,959
One day life might be hard.

592
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,879
When you think you're dying...

593
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,547
I told you to stop talking!

594
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,091
I don't guarantee

595
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,885
I don't eat abalone anymore

596
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,434
my darling

597
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,771
When will you grow up?

598
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,777
When I heard my mother's last words

599
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,612
The eldest daughter is only ten years old

600
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,658
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

601
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,285
Rocking to sleep

602
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:18,374
Go to sleep, go to sleep, rock yourself to sleep sweetly

603
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:23,796
My baby sleeps well

604
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,091
Fall asleep quickly

605
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,301
Fall asleep quickly

606
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:35,641
A black dog walked away

607
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,729
A black dog is coming.

608
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:47,445
Come and coax my baby to sleep

609
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:52,324
Then I will also comfort your baby

610
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,704
Go to sleep...

611
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,165
She left behind three children when she died…

612
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,920
Only 29 years old

613
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,749
If you cry you will be hungry.

614
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,083
Eat and cry

615
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,258
What should I do now?

616
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,928
what do I do?

617
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,764
This morning

618
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,600
My mom

619
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,644
Died

620
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,188
but…

621
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:06,774
but…

622
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,823
I'm starting to miss her

623
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,203
I miss my mom.

624
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,165
I…

625
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,459
I miss her so much

626
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,549
mom

627
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,095
mom

628
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,397
Love pure, obedient, submissive

629
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,483
You both have the same syllables in your names

630
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,402
You are connected by blood

631
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,905
Look at you like this

632
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,699
Stray dogs want to recognize you as their own

633
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,327
I can't help it. It's tuna season now.

634
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,706
I have to go out to sea to support your brothers and sisters

635
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,421
You go to your uncle's house and end up being a maid

636
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:15,175
To put it bluntly, take care of your younger brothers and sisters

637
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,677
It's much more fulfilling than taking care of others.

638
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,928
I don't want to be a maid

639
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,765
My mother told me not to live that kind of life

640
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,601
Hey Love Pure

641
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,271
If your brothers and sisters live like beggars, your mother will not rest in peace.

642
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,692
Let's finish this tuna season first

643
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,111
Okay?

644
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,072
Do you want to leave this land barren?

645
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,991
Why waste such good land?

646
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,672
Wait until Soon Bong doesn't have to wear diapers anymore?

647
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,225
Let's go

648
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,232
Wait until Shunnan goes to primary school?

649
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,862
Just wait and see

650
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,657
As the color of the flowers on my fingers fades

651
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,867
The living will also forget and the days go on

652
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,749
Life can go on as long as you are alive

653
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,043
Just like nails grow out

654
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,295
A new day has arrived

655
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,547
How can I not forget it?

656
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,305
Is your family broke? Why do you always have leftover fish?

657
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,749
I'm leaving home

658
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:11,917
(Qing Ma Poetry Collection)

659
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,464
Can you wait until I finish this sea voyage?

660
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,010
If I go to sea a few more times, my family will have a guaranteed living.

661
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,808
While other children were taking extra classes, I was farming and cooking.

662
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,601
I also want to take first place

663
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,603
I think…

664
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,983
Let's just forget it.

665
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,363
What is Korean literature?

666
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,615
Is this what you want to study? Korean literature?

667
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,993
The poet is right

668
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,412
You mean you want to be a poet?

669
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,789
Great poet...

670
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:58,338
Lee Sang, Kim So-wol, and Yun Dong-ju are all majoring in Korean literature?

671
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,300
"If you hate me so much

672
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,051
Leave me

673
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,554
Please step lightly"

674
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,724
Who provides you with reading?

675
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,352
So that you can study Korean literature

676
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,270
Um?

677
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,861
Who pays your school fees every month?

678
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,571
I'm not some passerby, am I?

679
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,241
Am I also a father to you?

680
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,620
I told you I would make money to support your college education

681
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,291
Your uncle won't send you to college.

682
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,795
If they wanted to take care of you, they would have...

683
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,631
Can you send me to my home country?

684
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,634
Locals go to local universities

685
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,344
You swear by Shunnan and Shunfeng?

686
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,972
I swear on the All-Light Rite!

687
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,601
If I forget what you've done for us, your mother will kill me.

688
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,481
There is an active movement to promote a simple and practical lifestyle

689
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,067
Encourage the public to dress modestly

690
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,611
At the busiest time

691
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:06,490
Wearing traditional long skirts is troublesome and uncomfortable

692
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:12,079
This movement is about improving impractical lifestyles

693
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,084
(Espionage and reconnaissance activity period)

694
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,012

(Leung Kuan Chi)

696
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:58,959
Do you want to?

697
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,752
No, I want cabbage.

698
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,630
That's right. Do you want cabbage?

699
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,549
(Youth Central)

700
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,842
Do you sell cabbage too?

701
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,427
Very sweet to them

702
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,263
Her cabbage

703
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,723
They are sweet

704
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,311
Please stop and take a look!

705
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,563
Fresh seafood is available here!

706
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:23,233
Freshly caught by the Ama!

707
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,902
Fresh from the sea!

708
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,153
Come check it out!

709
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,615
Fresh sea squirts, abalone and conch! Prices that will satisfy you!

710
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,408
What does Guangli's daughter have to worry about?

711
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,993
She has a flower protector around her

712
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,277
Would you like something sweet?

713
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:08,820
Want some?

714
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,573
Kuanzhi sold all of Aichun's cabbages

715
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,869
The bold shortening of long skirts has now become a decadent trend

716
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,080
Are these cabbages sweet?

717
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:21,208
Women can be seen waltzing in Myeongdong, Seoul

718
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,335
Fully exposed thighs

719
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:28,799
Now it can be said that Kuanzhi is raising Aichun

720

(Shockingly, Yoon Bok-hee's skirt is 10cm above her knees)

00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:36,139
Some are calling for strict measures to combat the trend of depravity.

722
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:40,435
"First they said they wanted shorter clothes and now they're complaining!"

723
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:41,979
(Sambo Fish Shop)

724
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,397
Arguing only makes life more difficult

725
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,356
(Creation and Criticism)

726
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,440
Would you like some?

727
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,736
The cabbage is very sweet, especially the ones over there

728
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,030
Everything is sweet to you

729
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:56,118
This means you have to take care of both the old and the young.

730
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,536
I'm just unlucky.

731
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,163
How much is cabbage?

732
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,707
One tree 50, three trees 150

733
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,333
What kind of ridiculous price is this?

734
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,086
One tree is 50, three trees is 150

735
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,464
(Wu Aichun)

736
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,590
That's fair

737
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,927
Hey, who's talking about fairness when buying cabbage?

738
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,013
Did I ask how much three trees cost?

739
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,057
Selling cabbage is only a small profit.

740
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,643
Everyone wants it cheaper.

741
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,228
I'm here to raise awareness...

742
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,605
Who needs to be more aware when buying cabbage?

743
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,525
Well...he's out!

744
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,570
Do you want it? He won't let this go on.

745
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,946
I really gave birth to a fool

746
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,033
Give me one.

747
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,038
Does Aichun have no hands?

748
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,664
I didn't force him

749
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,833
He does it because he likes it

750
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,043
She didn't force me

751
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,131
I should get a stray dog instead

752
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:55,260
If the old lady sees you, you're dead.

753
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,679
Young people are fearless

754
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,431
Can you still be afraid of the old lady?

755
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,936
not good

756
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,861
Get out of the way, grandma!

757
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:20,494
Didn't I tell you not to let her set up a stall next to him?

758
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,662
Why do you always come here?

759
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,665
Haven't you heard that a daughter takes after her mother?

760
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,710
Her mother's soul is still following her

761
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:32,047
Why did you let her stay around my grandson?

762
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,507
The old lady needs to be baptized.

763
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,383
Barnacles are not that different from conchs!

764
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,804
Love pure dead girl!

765
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:39,805
Damn girl!

766
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,766
I don't care about Liang Kuanzhi? No thanks!

767
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,601
No thanks!

768
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,936
It's crazy

769
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,395
Aichun, that damn girl!

770
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,481
Aichun, that damn girl!

771
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,664
In the era of "not wanting to look back"

772
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,042
Some people never look back

773
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:59,337
("The same sky, the same group of stars, the same memory")
