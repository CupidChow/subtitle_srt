00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>No, we're not having the baby.</i>

3
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,240
<i>Tell them to stop the delivery!</i>
<i>What if Ae-sun dies in childbirth?</i>

4
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,327
<i>Goodness, he will only get worse</i>
<i>once his baby is born.</i>

5
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,162
<i>How can I stand to see that?</i>

6
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,289
A SPRING EVERY DAY

7
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,294
{\an8}You're supposed to support her neck
like this when you hold her.

8
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,048
{\an8}No, I don't want to do it.

9
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,177
No, I can't. I'll probably hurt her.

10
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,429
Then just make sure you don't hurt her.

11
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,183
You know,

12
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,770
the baby is a bit…

13
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,776
A bit strange, you mean?
She's all wrinkly, isn't she?

14
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,864
Look at her nostril.
It's the size of a cotton swab.

15
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,867
She's so tiny.

16
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,285
Too tiny.

17
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,288
How will she survive in the world?

18
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,415
A dog could grab her and run away.

19
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:10,046
What's there to worry about?
She has her Steelheart daddy.

20
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,343
We'll be there to protect her.

21
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,473
We'll give her everything.

22
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,394
Look! She smiled.

23
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,020
<i>They had no idea back then</i>

24
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,647
<i>that I'd be…</i>

25
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,276
<i>What?</i>

26
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,987
<i>…in their debt for so long.</i>

27
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,912
What's gotten into you?

28
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,456
You've always hated
me packing things for you.

29
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,669
So now it's a problem to take them?
What, are they too precious?

30
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,676
Was your husband fired from the academy?

31
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,596
Why would he be fired?

32
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,683
You know, when money is tight,
fruit's the first thing you stop buying.

33
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,310
Fine, I won't eat it. I won't.

34
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,191
Why won't you let us visit you
at your new place?

35
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,610
Fine, come over.

36
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,489
Then let's go together tomorrow.
You have a lot to take anyway.

37
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,868
Why would you come tomorrow? I'm busy.

38
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,120
I'm coming with you, no matter what.

39
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,997
Why all of a sudden?

40
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,874
What now?

41
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,254
You can't fool me.

42
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,216
You're acting just like Eun-myeong did

43
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,427
when he told me not to visit his school.

44
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,265
I have to go see it for myself so that--

45
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,350
Well, we have no room.

46
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,437
Even if you come, there's no room for you.

47
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:52,815
Why not?

48
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,027
We live in a studio.

49
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,490
I quit my job.

50
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,705
I'm starting a business. I'm going all in.

51
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,084
So I'm all out.

52
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,629
Mother, it seems even Geum-myeong
can mess things up.

53
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,423
I guess she decided
to take the baton from Eun-myeong.

54
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,008
Wait, what…

55
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,345
Why would you quit your…

56
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,187
What's up with you?

57
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,648
What now?

58
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,526
Everyone out!

59
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,988
If you're gonna treat my words
like crap, then just leave.

60
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,864
But I'm injured.

61
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,367
I've told you countless times

62
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,829
about how Uncle Hallim got frostbite
and lost his finger.

63
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,915
I told you over and over
to wear gloves when handling ice!

64
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,793
I was just talking to a wall, wasn't I?

65
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,130
Your uncle Jong-gu
kept harping on about business,

66
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,091
and now he's getting by
borrowing 100,000 won from me.

67
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,219
Mom, don't you want to know
what kind of business it is?

68
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,682
I've never caused trouble before.
I haven't.

69
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,599
Was that for me--

70
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,685
It's the first time in my life to…

71
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,646
What about kids?
Aren't you going to have any?

72
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,482
So that's what you wanted to say.

73
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,318
You're fine now since you're young.

74
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,487
If you get older and become sick,
without kids, who's gonna--

75
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,990
Is raising kids just for when you're sick?

76
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,993
-Hyeon-suk already has two!
-Giving birth isn't the end of it!

77
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,119
Was that for me--

78
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,538
You think kids just grow up on their own?

79
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,498
Do you know how much raising a kid costs?

80
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,167
Who says only the rich have kids?

81
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,254
I want to raise my child
in a family with means.

82
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,008
I want to buy them clothes every season
and fancy shoes that fit.

83
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,428
I want to provide my kids with everything.
If I can't, I won't have any!

84
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,096
I'm not rich, but I still had--

85
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,682
I heard Hyeon-suk's family
bought all of these too.

86
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,143
At least Che-il has a rich grandfather!

87
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,954
Did you pick today to fight?

88
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,709
I'm struggling too. I really am.

89
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,087
Starting from scratch is wearing me down.

90
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,466
<i>Their son got frostbite,</i>
<i>and their daughter moved to a studio.</i>

91
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,594
<i>Ultimately…</i>

92
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,097
Why are we stuck with this?

93
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,556
Seriously,

94
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,142
there's no end to our trouble.

95
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,435
It never ends!

96
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,188
<i>…that one comment</i>
<i>from my ever-understanding mom</i>

97
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,483
<i>made Dad take a bold risk.</i>

98
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,610
Seriously…

99
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,738
This is really pissing me off.

100
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,325
<i>So the first bold risk Dad ever took</i>

101
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,786
<i>was firing a bazooka.</i>

102
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,622
I heard your daughter
started a business too.

103
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,666
She must have some backup, right?

104
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,793
It takes one lucky strike
to be a good father.

105
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,804
You've lost your mind.

106
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,640
Why did you do
something so out of character?

107
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,310
Anyone could tell something's off, right?

108
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:20,148
How did you even get anyone to buy
that cabbage field in the first place?

109
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,567
I hear a chairman is building
a vacation home there.

110
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,071
Easy money just rolled
right into your lap, didn't it?

111
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,531
What the hell is out here?

112
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,742
Who the hell would open a shop
in the middle of nowhere?

113
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,704
Are you planning to sell raw fish
to wild dogs or deer?

114
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,416
They're going to build a golf course.

115
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,587
What a coincidence,
a golf course is being built here!

116
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,922
Haven't you watched that show <i>Police?</i>

117
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:49,927
When you're being scammed,
everything they say just falls into place.

118
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,055
Gonna live without a house
in your old age?

119
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,601
Who uses their house as collateral
to buy a shop in their fifties?!

120
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,437
If he can't do it at 50,
he'll never be able to.

121
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,356
Then when can he take a bold risk?

122
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,484
I'm proud of you.

123
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,069
Even if there's a haunted house
around that corner,

124
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,697
no, even if there's no building,

125
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,992
I'll never abandon you.

126
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:17,788
Their loyalty is impressive,
day and night.

127
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,750
My God.

128
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,419
Tell him to let me out of this car.

129
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,602
I can see some banners.

What's something like this doing here?

135
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,074
Oh dear. A "hospital"?

00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,537

00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,426
If they build a golf course here,

140
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,762
even the golfer Park Se-ri will visit us.

141
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:20,560
Thanks to your good son,
you could get to meet Park Se-ri.

142
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,437
This shop belongs
to the Yang family as well, right?

143
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,649
It also belongs
to Kwon Gye-ok's son, right?

144
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,694
How do you still remember that?

145
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,656
Is this about me saying the boat belonged
to the Ohs and not the Yangs?

146
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:39,370
It was wonderful to see him set sail
on the boat your grandmother bought you.

147
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,123
When I heard Gwan-sik went

148
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,376
from being a boat captain
to working manual labor at 50…

149
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,711
Goodness me.

150
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,591
He has been your husband all your life,
but to me, he's my only son.

151
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,428
Seeing him suffer
makes thunder rumble in my heart.

152
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:57,888
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,933
I took your precious son

154
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,644
and only made him suffer.

155
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,980
No need to apologize.

156
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,151
Well, you know,

157
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,696
do you remember everything from the past?

158
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,281
I know very well

159
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,659
that Gwan-sik has only ever taken my side.

160
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,912
No, I mean, you know, that one time

161
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,417
I accidentally slapped you long ago.

162
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,503
You hold onto things like that, don't you?

163
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,173
How can I forget?

164
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,510
It was the first time in my life
I had ever been slapped.

165
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,971
But

166
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,515
you've made it even.

167
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,726
How?

168
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,228
I haven't done anything for you.

169
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,650
When we lost Dong-myeong…

170
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,696
you didn't say a single thing to me.

171
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,783
You've never once blamed me
this entire time.

172
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,370
You don't make a cow plow
after it loses its calf.

173
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:07,083
I was worried you couldn't go on,
so I checked on you early every morning.

174
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,385
I still have the gold frog with me.
The one you stole and ran away with.

175
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,429
I'll give that to you,
not to my bratty daughter.

176
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,600
Sorry I gave you a hard time,
and thank you for living on.

177
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,935
So I'm giving it to you.

178
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,107
My mother-in-law is a cut above yours.

179
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,192
A cut above yours.

180
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,403
Whatever!

181
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,786
COMMERCIAL LEASE AGREEMENT

182
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,668
LESSEE NAME: PARK YEONG-RAN

183
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,927
<i>It was the season</i>
<i>when everyone had a bazooka of their own.</i>

184
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,762
DECLARATION OF DIVORCE (CUSTODY REQUEST)

185
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,026
Seriously,

186
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,487
is there too much delicious food
in this world?

187
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,990
What will you do about that gut?

188
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,785
People go to pretty realtors.
Being a piggy is bad for business.

189
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,000
These bicycles will help you
crush that gut.

190
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,335
Also, if a couple shares a hobby,

191
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,505
their bond gets stronger, right?

192
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,258
Did you play mixed doubles
to strengthen your bond with someone else?

193
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,260
Why would you bring that up now?

194
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,304
Mixed doubles is a sport too!

195
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,890
Is that why you went to see Mi-suk
for real estate?

196
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,475
Forget it, then! Damn it!

197
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,852
Even if I try to do something for you…

198
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,272
Fine.

199
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,025
Let's go for a ride, then.

200
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,195
We'll go around the block.

201
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,876
Wait. Watch this.

202
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,628
See?

203
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:37,191
Of course, you don't know how
to go together. You never have.

204
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,028
Hurry up! This is the riders' course.

205
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,280
You do know what riding means?

206
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,032
It's English.

207
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:50,663
Just up ahead,
there's an amazing view of the bank!

208
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,130
-Where do you think you're going?
-Go away!

209
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,259
-Come on, this way!
-Go away!

210
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,427
Where do you think you're going?

211
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,389
How could a cat pass by a fish market?

212
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,932
Damn it!

213
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,518
She sure rushed out to see you in a hurry.

214
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,270
Huh? Who's that?

215
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,482
Even cycling is co-ed for you now?

216
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,526
Lady.

217
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,696
Go back in and keep on cooking, okay?

218
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,660
Hey, why did you even go on a bike ride?

219
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,954
Was that a farewell parade or something?

220
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,623
We've lived together for 30 years,
after all.

221
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,293
We've never gone around the town together.

222
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:41,505
Is it because of my mom's tangerine field?
Selling it for your real estate office?

223
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,842
Yeah, I don't need to eat
any more of the white rice you pay for.

224
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,137
See? You always ruin everything.

225
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,973
I make the effort to make it work,
and you--

226
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:51,891
What am I, a dog?

227
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,603
You left me tied up
and enjoyed yourself all these years.

228
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,438
Did you think I'd wag my tail in joy

229
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,065
just because you took me
for a ride around the block?

230
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,484
Goddamn it!

231
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,699
Tell the kids

232
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:14,580
to come and get their shoes
or throw them out themselves.

233
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,791
Why leave their shoes when moving out?

234
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,266
All right. Okay.

235
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,227
I get the point, all right?

236
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,147
Stop putting on a show.

237
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,733
This isn't for show.

238
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,778
You know it too.

239
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,998
What do you do at home
other than eat rice all day?

240
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,084
Huh? Why is she always like this?

241
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,088
Should I, a busy man, have to go
chasing around after my runaway daughter?

242
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,257
Did you put my door back on?
Don't violate human rights!

243
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,930
Good God. I'm really screwed.

244
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,517
Where did that come from?
Never had anyone like her in our family.

245
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,937
See what happens
if you thugs touch my man again.

246
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,522
I'm going to sue you, Oh-seong.

247
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,359
-Seriously?!
-Goddamn it!

248
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,611
What a great family we are!

249
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,451
SANG-GIL LOVES OK

250
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,834
Do you like him that much?

251
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,965
Hyeon-suk, is this your first love?

252
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,551
So what if it is? Are you encouraging her?

253
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,636
You call yourself her mother?

254
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,390
At least you're experiencing something
that I never did.

255
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,242
{\an8}Was there really

256
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,745
not a single moment you liked me?

257
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:22,332
If I liked you,
I would've lost it a long time ago.

258
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,338
When I was carrying Hyeon-suk,
and you were seeing that bathhouse woman--

259
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,758
She was a classmate of mine at school.

260
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,718
You went to school in Seoul.

261
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,969
Goddamn it.

262
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,930
Back then, I cursed and put up a fight.

263
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,391
You even threw a coat hanger at me.

264
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,227
Hey, did I throw it at you?
You ran into it.

265
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,064
You know, you totally crushed me.

266
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,401
Even a person's heart can die
from being worn down endlessly.

267
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,489
Everyone calls me a saint, but I'm not.

268
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,408
I could only go on
because I didn't love you.

269
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,288
-Honey.
-Don't.

270
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,625
-Honey.
-Don't waste your breath.

271
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,922
I believe Hyeon-suk has asthma
because of your smoking.

272
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,968
Hyeon-suk pleaded with you for money
to save her husband,

273
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,096
and you flat-out refused.

274
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,141
-I lost all feelings for you then.
-Goddamn it.

275
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,230
Do I really have to do
something so embarrassing at my age?

276
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,899
You've been living it up
on your own all this time.

277
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,863
For the rest of my life,
I'm going to live it up too.

278
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,077
Please let me resign.

279
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,998
I've raised all four kids well.

280
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:53,382
JEJU DISTRICT COURT

281
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:56,927
Damn it.

282
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,313
We don't have to change cars now.

283
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,327
Why didn't you tell me you knew?
Was it like Cinderella's shoe or what?

284
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,331
Does it even matter now, ma'am?

285
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,303
That woman is even carrying her child.

286
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,181
She must be fleeing from the war.

287
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,516
Take pictures of women like her!

288
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,851
Go get her.

289
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,116
Goddamn it!

290
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,453
She's going around dancing?

291
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,711
If I had grilled you back then,
would you have stayed with me?

292
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,675
You would've flipped the table
and walked out on me.

293
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:37,402
You were a frigid ice queen.
I thought I'd freeze to death next to you.

294
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,971
What do you want, punk?
I don't have any money.

295
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,056
Oh man.

296
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,934
My wife asked me to bring this.

297
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,315
Goddamn it.

298
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,442
INSTANT RICE

299
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,568
She was right.

300
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,446
I was the real dog crap.

301
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,782
You little…

302
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,367
You damned…

303
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,285
You!

304
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,413
How about you come to your senses first?

305
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,000
Then we'll see who's really dog crap!

306
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,126
Goddamn it!

307
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,213
<i>They had no idea back then</i>

308
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:43,593
<i>that the season would come</i>
<i>when we'd mercilessly reap what we sowed.</i>

309
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,596
GEUMEUNDONG'S

310
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,307
If this goes south,

311
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,934
we'll lose our apartment too.

312
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:57,190
I never expected you
to throw a curveball like this at 50.

313
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,322
So why did you go along with it?

314
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,783
Well,

315
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,245
when you said
that you wanted to buy this store,

316
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,709
<i>I think it had been 30 years</i>
<i>since I last saw that look on your face.</i>

317
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,544
So if you're scared, walk away now.

318
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,421
Just go back home!

319
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,383
In all the 19 years of my life…

320
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,597
I've never felt more excited.

321
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,394
It's been 30 years
since I saw you this excited.

322
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,854
How could I ruin that?

323
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,400
Why did you suddenly do
something you'd never do?

324
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,905
Is it because of Geum-myeong's business?
Because of Eun-myeong's hand?

325
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,200
Because of getting a losing roll.

326
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,953
I was afraid I was stuck
in a game I couldn't win.

327
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,749
Being with you would be like
always getting a losing roll.

328
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:05,092
I wanted you to roll at least a three,
but this game is going like crap.

329
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,637
Since I always get a losing roll,
I worry that my kids will too.

330
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,597
And it just pisses me off.

331
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,436
Old sayings are all lies.

332
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,939
They say money isn't everything.

333
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,607
Of course it is.

334
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,444
Even if I wanted to give them something,
I couldn't without money.

335
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,488
The underwear Sang-gil buys for Che-il

336
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,242
is always better quality
than the ones I buy for him.

337
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,788
Even if I went back 30 years,

338
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,376
I wouldn't hesitate to run away with you.

339
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:43,839
It's because I ran away with you back then
that I'm now a restaurant owner.

340
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,344
Can you believe it?
This is our restaurant.

341
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,806
Are you happy again?

342
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,352
Stop holding hands and get in here.

343
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,312
Why is she coming every day?

344
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,232
She said she'll work the register.

345
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,150
Mom will?

346
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,112
Call and ask
when they'll install the toilet here.

347
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,947
Well, the construction isn't done yet.

348
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,409
Why did they just stop?
When are the other stores moving in?

349
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,626
<i>They didn't know back then</i>

350
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,671
<i>that life could knock your dice</i>
<i>off the table.</i>

351
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,473
Mr. Han the realtor ran off ages ago.

352
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:38,018
God, why did you do something
you'd never do?

353
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,644
You hated lucky strikes!

354
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,690
<i>Even Steelheart had entered a season</i>
<i>when his child was telling him off.</i>

355
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,317
Why didn't you just sit still?

356
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,361
How can you give away a land of gold
for a crappy field?

357
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,490
You said you'd never sell
the cabbage field, so why?

358
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,116
What about the cabbage field?

359
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,161
A chairman's vacation home, my ass.
They're building a hotel.

360
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,831
But he said they're building
a golf course here. And a hospital.

361
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,708
That's all bullshit.

362
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,543
My father fell for a realtor scam!

363
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,339
Father.

364
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,426
From what I can see,
you have no luck with money.

365
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,677
You know that, right?

366
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,014
So what do we do now?
Will we end up on the streets?

367
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,390
Will we lose our home?

368
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,977
What if we pay the interest
and put this place up for sale?

369
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,938
Who'd buy this?
Can we afford the interest?

370
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,439
You wanna turn to loan sharks?

371
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:29,778
Well, I'll go to the bank on Monday
and talk about what happened--

372
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,696
Why do you keep spouting nonsense?

373
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,282
The bank will auction it off for sure.

374
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,202
If you're unsure,
ask your kids from now on.

375
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:41,081
If you'd kept that cabbage field,
you could've sent Che-il to study abroad.

376
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,500
It's your father's money!

377
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,043
It's your father's, not yours!

378
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,088
Who are you to make a fuss about
whether he wastes it or sells it?

379
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,883
You know why he did this?
You always go on and on about money.

380
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,845
Even if he wants to give, he has nothing.
He did it so he could give you something.

381
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,140
Did you ever talk to us
before doing business or making a mess?

382
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,811
"If you're unsure, ask your kids"?
"Why didn't you just sit still"?

383
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,146
How dare you!

384
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,439
How dare you!

385
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:13,863
Don't disrespect your father's life.
He never lived a single day for himself.

386
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,996
Let's go home.

387
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,665
I got you money.

388
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,297
<i>g.o.d.'s </i>Babysitting Diaries.

389
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:36,094
<i>To raise Jae-min to be a healthier</i>
<i>and smarter child,</i>

390
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,930
<i>the g.o.d. members came</i>
<i>to a playroom with him.</i>

391
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,766
<i>He finds new and diverse play equipment.</i>

392
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,020
<i>Let's find out</i>
<i>how much smarter Jae-min has become.</i>

393
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,117
Who asked you to get us money?

394
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,249
-Where did you get it?
-Got another way without me?

395
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,628
-Where did you get it?
-I borrowed it.

396
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,672
I broke my hard-earned, modest savings.

397
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,885
I swallowed my pride
and went around borrowing money.

398
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,971
<i>Why bring your pride</i>
<i>when you're here to borrow money?</i>

399
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,807
If you can't say a word,
why did you bother showing up?

400
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,476
<i>Who told you to ask for money?</i>

401
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,646
Why did you? Why?

402
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,064
How could I not?

403
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,358
I'm the older sister, the eldest child…

404
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,070
the damn pillar of the family.

405
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,658
-You raised me for that, didn't you?
-When…

406
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,201
When did I ever--

407
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,621
Maybe that's not how you raised me,
but that's just how I grew up.

408
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,504
Ever since my first part-time job,

409
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,215
I've sent you
at least 100,000 won every month.

410
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,841
I needed that money too.

411
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,302
At times, I didn't wanna send
a third of my earnings.

412
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,887
Who asked you to?

413
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,640
I always told you not to send it.

414
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,558
To be honest, the reason I sent it

415
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,229
wasn't because
I was overwhelmed with gratitude…

416
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,191
but because I felt guilty.

417
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,652
I'd feel guilty if I didn't.

418
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,863
It was because I felt uncomfortable.

419
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,909
That's what family is like to me.

420
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,247
You don't know how it feels
to bear nagging guilt, do you?

421
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,958
Quiet. Your father can hear you.

422
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,794
Why sacrifice so much
to send me abroad to study?

423
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,505
Why do everything for me
and bury me in guilt?

424
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,928
Parents who live every day
without catching a break,

425
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,181
constantly struggling
and putting all their hopes on me.

426
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,100
Do you know how heavy that feels?

427
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,311
A dragon from a stream?
I'm sick of being the poster child.

428
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,898
The pillar, the older sister,
the eldest child. I'm sick of it all!

429
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,692
Yang Geum-myeong!

430
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,697
<i>My dad raised his voice at me</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

431
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,824
<i>"Yang Geum-myeong."</i>

432
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,160
<i>That was the only word he said…</i>

433
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,747
<i>but it cut me to the core.</i>

434
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,876
<i>It felt like someone on my side</i>
<i>was calling me trash.</i>

435
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:19,966
That damn brat.

436
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,137
She thinks she's above everyone.

437
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,432
All she does is throw a tantrum
and just leave.

438
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,268
Then what about me?

439
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,315
I put up with all her tantrums
during her teenage years.

440
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,861
She doesn't even realize
I'm going through menopause.

441
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,205
But I feel guilty too.

442
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,374
Being the eldest child
was a big burden for me.

443
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,169
I'm putting her through the same.

444
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,837
You had her when you were 18.

445
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,799
You were raising two kids at her age.

446
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,093
You buried a child in your heart
and still went to sell on the streets.

447
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,554
No one can do it like you.

448
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,181
No one.

449
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,649
That cold-hearted brat.
She should've taken these anyway.

450
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,445
She's not cold-hearted.

451
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,072
Don't you know that?

452
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,742
She is crying her eyes out now too.

453
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,760
<i>I had no idea back then</i>

454
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:52,976
<i>that this day would be the first thing</i>
<i>I'd remember on the day of Mom's funeral.</i>

455
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,234
Don't bother peeling quail eggs.

456
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,236
She doesn't even want them.

457
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,281
Let's stop and rest.
You said you're having hot flashes.

458
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,992
Goodness, why am I getting so mad?

459
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,370
I don't care if it's hormones or whatever.
I just want to smash them.

460
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,635
Oh no.

461
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,387
My goodness.

462
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,930
What? What is it now?

463
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,348
My goodness!

464
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,934
Oh no!

465
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,064
MY HORMONES ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE TOO
SORRY, GOMEN, MIAN…

466
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,275
<i>It was hormones against hormones.</i>

467
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,152
<i>And Mom lost yet again.</i>

468
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,323
She should've taken the food.
Why didn't she take them?

469
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:54,579
She must've been asking around for money
while pregnant, just like me.

470
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,125
She must be helpless too.

471
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,711
Oh my goodness.

472
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,282
<i>Dad's universe,</i>
<i>which once weighed 3.1 kilograms,</i>

473
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,369
<i>was carrying a universe of her own.</i>

474
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,498
<i>Honey, I can't do this.</i>

475
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,500
Tell them I can't do it anymore.

476
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,380
Honey.

477
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,301
Is it too painful? Are you okay?
Should I ask your mother to come?

478
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,806
Go ask them again.

479
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,392
Please go ask for an epidural for me.

480
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,518
Epidural? Okay.

481
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:00,853
The nurse is here.

482
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,067
-Is she getting the epidural?
-We can't give it to her now.

483
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,486
Why not?

484
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,572
The dilation was too slow,
so we decided to stop the epidural.

485
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,283
This doesn't seem to make sense right now.

486
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,994
She's been going on for 12 hours.

487
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,871
My wife is physically weak.

488
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,917
The real problem now
is that the baby isn't moving.

489
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,879
Mr. Park, you need to sign a consent form

490
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,256
in case one of them--

491
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,173
I choose

492
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,633
my wife.

493
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,594
I choose my wife.

494
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,182
Why isn't the baby moving?

495
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,196
Hello, Mother.

496
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,325
Well, I'm not sure
what's going on right now.

497
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:01,748
She's fully dilated,
but the baby doesn't want to come out.

498
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,420
It's an obstructed labor,
and neither of them…

499
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,631
is doing well.

500
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,301
What? What do you mean by that?

501
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,429
<i>What is it? Is she in danger?</i>

502
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,680
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

503
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,642
Mother, I'm really sorry to ask,
but could you come over?

504
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,561
Geum-myeong

505
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,481
keeps asking for you.

506
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,110
Honey, what is it? What's wrong?

507
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,946
<i>When the young branch</i>
<i>sprouted a new shoot,</i>

508
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,284
<i>the entire tree trembled in silence.</i>

509
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,828
One, two, three.

510
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,371
No, not yet.

511
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,333
Push more.

512
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,128
One, two, three, four.

513
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,299
No, you can't let up now.
That would be very bad.

514
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,009
It hurts so much.

515
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,304
Now, breathe. Push.

516
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:02,058
One, two, three, four.

517
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,518
Come on, push.

518
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,353
I think I'm about to pass out.

519
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,065
Again. One, two, three.

520
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,150
Hold your breath.

521
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,611
You need to push a bit more. Push.

522
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:17,073
One, two. Don't stop now. Come on!

523
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,909
No, wake up!

524
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,036
No. You can't let up now.

525
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,747
Mom, don't stop now.
The baby is in danger!

526
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,250
The baby's stuck at the shoulders.
You need to push!

527
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:31,462
Mom, don't you want
to see your little one?

528
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,677
Geum-myeong, go with your grandmother.

529
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,430
You go eat first, okay?
I'll bring your little brother soon.

530
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,475
It's okay. Nothing to be scared of. Okay?

531
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,363
The baby's alive. Pat the baby, quick!

532
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,044
<i>Two thoughts crossed our minds.</i>

533
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,672
<i>Let's be good to our mothers,</i>

534
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,840
<i>and…</i>

535
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,466
There won't be a second.

536
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,303
There won't be a second.

537
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,680
Don't make me laugh.

538
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:26,267
{\an8}<i>The government has paid off</i>
<i>the emergency funds borrowed from the IMF,</i>

539
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,811
{\an8}<i>and Korea has regained</i>
<i>control of its economy.</i>

540
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,396
<i>The risk of national bankruptcy…</i>

541
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,900
Bom is truly an IMF baby, right?

542
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,695
We met again at the theater
on the day the IMF crisis began.

543
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,239
She was born
on the day the IMF crisis ended.

544
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,909
The timing is unbelievable, isn't it?

545
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,627
What is it? Should I call the doctor?

546
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,087
Are you still in pain?

547
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,884
I just can't believe it.

548
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,719
How did…

549
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,307
Exactly, it's unbelievable.
Doing that for 28 hours?

550
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,184
That could kill a cow!

551
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:12,104
How did she have a baby at 18?

552
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,107
How, at 18…

553
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,736
<i>I left my mom’s home, got married,</i>
<i>and became a mom myself.</i>

554
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:22,031
<i>The farther she was,</i>
<i>the brighter she glowed in my heart.</i>

555
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,783
<i>Only a mother could do that.</i>

556
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,453
I mean, she didn't even have
her mom by her side.

557
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,331
And they didn't have epidurals then.

558
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,167
At 18, how did she…

559
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,752
How did she…

560
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,798
She even rode a handcart
when she gave birth to Eun-myeong.

561
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,596
Baby!

562
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,723
Mom.

563
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,891
Mommy's here.

564
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,018
Mom!

565
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,565
-You did well. I'm proud.
<i>-Their baby gave birth to a baby.</i>

566
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,483
Oh my.

567
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,319
<i>Wherever they were, it became a fortress,</i>

568
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,240
<i>and I became a baby all over again.</i>

569
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,124
Father, let me…

570
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,379
Father, sometimes,

571
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:22,967
it feels like I married
the Princess of Tangerine Land.

572
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,884
Got a problem?

573
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,845
So, Bom is--

574
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:29,682
This is seaweed soup with sea urchins.
Real sea urchins.

575
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,767
The aunties picked them themselves.

576
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,103
Who do you think Bom looks like?

577
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:38,441
My mom and my aunts think
she has Geum-myeong's nose.

578
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,442
She has her nose?

579
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,401
Her nose?

580
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,821
-Have you seen her yet? I'm sure you can.
-We'll go see her now.

581
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,244
Do you really think
your daughter comes first?

582
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,954
You better treat me well.

583
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,790
I'm a precious baby to them, got it?

584
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,876
What did the doctor say?

585
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,003
She's okay now, right?

586
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:03,341
She's healthy, weighing 3.6 kilograms.
Her shoulder X-rays came back fine.

587
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,968
No, Geum-myeong's diabetes.

588
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,763
Is her gestational diabetes gone
now that she's given birth?

589
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,558
Yes. Your daughter is also healthy.

590
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,146
Why does it feel
like you're forgetting your place?

591
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,191
<i>Every time I went home,</i>
<i>the drumsticks were always for me.</i>

592
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,777
<i>I was always their number one.</i>

593
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,363
Oh, you already bought baby clothes?

594
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,990
They're all expensive.

595
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,327
Dad didn't even look at the price
and asked for the most expensive ones.

596
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,288
Why did you buy expensive clothes
for a baby?

597
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,125
Dad has a new dream now.

598
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,211
A rich grandfather.

599
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:46,008
Dad, I didn't mean that.
Why would you take it to heart?

600
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,427
Hey, let's go.

601
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,805
Let's go see Sae-bom.

602
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,598
<i>Bom had arrived,</i>

603
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,517
<i>and spring had truly arrived.</i>

604
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,647
REALTOR HAN MAN-CHEOL!
YOUR FAMILY WILL BE CURSED!

605
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,274
WHY ABANDON THESE BUILDINGS?
OWN UP TO PEOPLE'S MONEY!

606
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,909
JEJU'S JANUARY DAYTIME TEMPERATURE
REACHES 21.4 DEGREES CELSIUS

607
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,578
<i>Like they always did,</i>

608
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,206
<i>they eventually</i>

609
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,708
<i>pushed winter out of their way.</i>

610
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,935
You'll really run the restaurant?

611
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,271
You think people will come?

612
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,940
They just need to take
a five-minute detour.

613
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,734
They can just drop by, eat, and then go.

614
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,611
We'll give them more for their time.

615
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,072
Will they detour?

616
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,617
Hell, if they don't come,
I'll take it to them.

617
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,079
Are you really going to do deliveries?

618
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,833
People only get food
like <i>jjajangmyeon </i>delivered.

619
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,170
I caught squid for 30 years.

620
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,464
There's nothing you can't do with squid.

621
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,508
What do they know about squid?

622
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,510
They'll overpay for dead ones elsewhere.

623
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,847
We'll have the freshest,
tastiest, cheapest squid in Jeju

624
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,267
and deliver it right to their door
faster than anyone else.

625
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,560
How can they resist?

626
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,817
But, honey,

627
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,530
there isn't really anything else to try.

628
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,575
Honey.

629
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,911
You know what?

630
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,626
I'm confident about being diligent.

631
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,464
Same here.

632
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,928
I don't have any other talents at all.

633
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,481
<i>They decided to pursue</i>
<i>what they had been most confident in.</i>

634
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:09,652
<i>because plowing rocky fields</i>
<i>and catching all the fish in the waters</i>

635
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,820
<i>reflected Ae-sun and Gwan-sik's attitude.</i>

636
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,939
Hello.

637
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,326
GEUMEUNDONG'S
WE AIM TO GET IT DONE IN TEN MINUTES!

638
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,083
<i>Even the heavens must've felt bad</i>

639
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,752
<i>as they kept sending</i>
<i>corner kicks their way.</i>

640
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,380
<i>Soccer games meant food deliveries.</i>

641
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,715
<i>And at last,</i>

642
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,759
<i>it was the year 2002.</i>

643
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,471
<i>-Park Ji-sung!</i>
<i>-Park Ji-sung! It's a goal!</i>

644
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,974
{\an8}<i>South Korea leads Portugal, one to zero!</i>

645
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,642
Did we score?

646
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,773
Hey, Gwan-sik!

647
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,317
Go, Korea!

648
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,820
I told you Park Ji-sung would score.

649
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,865
I've been playing soccer for 20 years.

650
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,366
Hey, Gwan-sik!

651
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,493
Bring me a whole box of raw squid!

652
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,829
Go, Korea!

653
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,582
Go, Korea!

654
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,500
<i>In our business tactics,</i>

655
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,838
<i>Dad has always been Park Ji-sung,</i>
<i>and Mom has always been Guus Hiddink.</i>

656
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,506
Just tell me directly.

657
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,343
Who's the top squid specialist
in the Jeju Sea?

658
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,428
Those mainland amateurs
don't know a thing!

659
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,514
They try running seafood places,
but they fail.

660
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:06,185
To them, squid is just a side dish.

661
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,813
They can go without it,
but to us, squid is the star player.

662
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,441
Squid is our striker, our Ahn Jung-hwan.

663
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,570
-That's Gwan-sik's wife?
-Yep.

664
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,114
So, Captain, give us exclusive rights

665
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,075
to your squid.

666
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:25,120
So just tell me
how much you're going to pay.

667
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,914
We can't offer you much for now.

668
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,415
For crying out loud.

669
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,127
But later on, we won't take your squid
even if you want us to.

670
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,587
It will be too late then!

671
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,007
Wow, she's tough and picky.

672
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,967
Gwan-sik loses to her, doesn't he?

673
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,095
Isn't it obvious?
He loses every single time.

674
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,056
Why are you here instead of Gwan-sik
when we have these talks?

675
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,643
The women from that family
usually go around running the show.

676
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,854
GEUMEUNDONG'S
CEO, OH AE-SUN

677
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,481
Don't give me a maybe.

678
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,650
I need a yes or no.

679
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,402
{\an8}EVER CORP.
CEO, YANG GEUM-MYEONG

680
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:00,322
Whether you buy Samsung Electronics
at 300,000 or 3,000,000 won…

681
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,368
is up to your own judgment now.

682
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,456
Actually, sir,

683
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,043
I'm meeting with two more people
after you.

684
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,213
If you choose not to come aboard with me,

685
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,632
I'll find another hidden gem

686
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,844
and make them the best in the industry.

687
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,972
I'll surpass you, sir.

688
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,515
Oh man.

689
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,643
I believe this is going to work.

690
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,105
This isn't just about remodeling.
It's about changing the game.

691
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,524
But why is the name of your company…

692
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,986
Well, it's because of my mom.

693
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,283
My mom is the inspiration for this.

694
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,336
{\an8}"Jeju duty-free stores
will open to domestic customers."

695
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,549
So even Koreans can buy cigarettes
in Jeju duty-free stores now?

696
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,885
You'd ask your father-in-law that?

697
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,429
No, every time I go to Seoul,

698
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,432
they ask me to bring back cigarettes
from the duty-free shop.

699
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,977
Gu Mahjong and Lee Sucker think
you can buy anything there.

700
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,188
Gu Mi-jeong and Lee Sun-mi.

701
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,650
I never thought I'd benefit
from anything the government did.

702
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:23,405
More tourists will lead to
more food orders from the resorts.

703
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,033
Hasn't the film crew called
from the motel today?

704
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,619
Could they be ordering from elsewhere?

705
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:31,246
What exactly are they filming in Jeju?

706
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,374
They say that guy is going to be in it.

707
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,127
The one with nice teeth.

708
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,216
That's right! Lee Byung-hun.

709
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,593
Right. Lee Byung-hun.

710
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:48,347
UNLIMITED REFILLS OF SQUID SOUP
FOR DINE-IN CUSTOMERS

711
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,349
{\an8}<i>They kept getting free kicks.</i>

712
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,143
{\an8}Yes, if you don't order delivery

713
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:57,064
and come to the store to eat,
you'll get a 10% discount.

714
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,359
That's right. It's a 10% discount.

715
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,902
Please come in!

716
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,364
This must be Byung-hun's favorite spot.
His autograph is here.

717
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,907
{\an8}His picture is here too.

718
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,617
{\an8}What, <i>arigatou </i>again?

719
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,118
Well, <i>chotto matte.</i>

720
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,870
<i>Chotto matte.</i>

721
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,956
I wonder where he sat.

722
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,040
Here.

723
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,124
Here?

724
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:19,503
Mother, someone is selling
restaurant chairs on Joonggonara.

725
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,671
Should we get more?

726
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,799
Do we really need them?

727
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,677
<i>It was in the early days of Joonggonara.</i>

728
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,594
Hey!

729
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,181
Hey, in-laws!

730
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,392
Seriously? "Hey, in-laws"?

731
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,602
Why wander around
instead of watching the kids?

732
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,730
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>Joonggonara would bring up that name?</i>

733
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,648
Cheol-yong.

734
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,277
Cheol-yong!

735
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,405
Park Cheol-yong has been caught!

736
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,031
Oh my!

737
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,367
They found the <i>buncheong </i>stoneware!

738
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,998
Hey, who'd buy something
worth 70 million won?

739
00:47:56,081 --> 00:48:00,836
He couldn't get rid of it,
so the fool listed it on Joonggonara.

740
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,257
So is the <i>buncheong </i>stoneware mine?

741
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,552
Hot damn!

742
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,511
Yes.

743
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:10,971
Yes.

744
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,514
Who's speaking again?

745
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,142
<i>It was inevitable.</i>

746
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,435
Who?

747
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,777
<i>It was a season</i>

748
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,197
<i>when a grateful bird brought her flock</i>
<i>to repay a debt.</i>

749
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,744
She's like a white dove.

750
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,883
I only come to Jeju to eat this, you know.

751
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,762
The squid soup here is my comfort food.

752
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,349
It's as if this bowl
brings me back to life.

753
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,522
Is she a regular?

754
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,941
I've never seen her.

755
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:07,694
Ma'am, if you could perhaps do
that catchphrase just once…

756
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,864
Director, we agreed
that she wouldn't do that.

757
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,532
I want a shot of it just in case.

758
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,327
Let's do it.

759
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,703
I'll do it.

760
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,751
Soup for sale, soup!

761
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,252
Just like that?

762
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,550
She's still got it.

763
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,184
{\an8}SOUP FOR SALE, SOUP!
GEUMEUNDONG'S SQUID SOUP

764
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,978
{\an8}I CAN VOUCH FOR THIS PLACE
JEONG MI-IN

765
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,533
You must really love squid.
I've never seen you eat like that.

766
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,619
-I don't eat seafood.
-What?

767
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,998
Go outside for a smoke
and get the directions to the next place.

768
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:02,874
Yes, sir.

769
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,383
Mi-in, all I want
is for you to be honest with me.

770
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,761
I don't care if you went to Macau
or got your face done.

771
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,346
Just don't lie to me.

772
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,185
There was nothing
between you and that man, was there?

773
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,147
Nothing that might cause trouble later?

774
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,065
-Hey.
-No, right?

775
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,401
Why would I be here if there was nothing?

776
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,319
Don't you care about me?

777
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,697
I have to send child support in dollars.

778
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,201
That man is the one who's been paying you.

779
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,705
That man is the reason
you're wearing that Rolex right now.

780
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,504
{\an8}<i>When my scandal blew up, I wanted to die.</i>

781
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,927
<i>I thought there'd be photos of my remains</i>
<i>if I died from carbon monoxide,</i>

782
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,431
<i>and people would gawk at me</i>
<i>if I fell from a high place.</i>

783
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:08,065
<i>So I got on a fishing boat.</i>

784
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,318
Here.

785
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,751
<i>Woo-ryeong once said</i>
<i>she wanted to hang herself</i>

786
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,545
<i>but decided to shave her legs first.</i>

787
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,298
<i>While shaving,</i>
<i>she found it absurd and stopped.</i>

788
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,217
<i>She wasn't lying.</i>

789
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:41,807
<i>I had no regrets about my life,</i>
<i>a life even a dog wouldn't want to live.</i>

790
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,685
But that man saved me.

791
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,189
I must've been out of my mind.

792
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,651
I could hear people
and an ambulance approaching,

793
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,696
but even in that moment,
I just wanted to cover my face.

794
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,826
But then, that man

795
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,080
took off his jacket and covered my face.

796
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,334
It was the first time in my life.

797
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:10,836
Jeong Mi-in.

798
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,548
Everyone wants to expose me.
Who wants to cover me?

799
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:19,344
Hey, man. This banana milk is nothing.

800
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,640
<i>I couldn't forget what he did for me,</i>
<i>so I went to see him.</i>

801
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,225
Oh my.

802
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,852
He can buy all the pork he wants.

803
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,687
It's a secret ballot anyway.

804
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,648
They'll just eat
and won't vote for him anyway.

805
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,441
They'll all vote for Ae-sun.

806
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,612
<i>He lived like a person.</i>

807
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,512
Don't you recognize me?

808
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:07,475
I won Best Supporting Actress yesterday
for playing a fisherman's wife.

809
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,980
I'm doing quite well right now.

810
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,442
Is there still nothing I can do
to repay you?

811
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,195
Nothing at all. Don't worry about it.

812
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,740
I already told you a long time ago.

813
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,452
Turns out life's not actually so bad.

814
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,120
It's worth living.

815
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:31,291
So I really must repay you
for saving my life.

816
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,252
Just give me one chance to do so.

817
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,759
I'm doing well right now.

818
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,013
<i>The reward wasn't luck.</i>

819
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,557
<i>It was earned by his warm heart.</i>

820
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,352
What if that man ends up
arguing with his wife?

821
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,187
Who wouldn't find this strange?

822
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,439
Why would Jeong Mi-in show up
out of nowhere?

823
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,359
-His wife might know about it.
-I don't think so.

824
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:02,364
Men tend not to tell their partners
when they think they're in with a chance.

825
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,281
Exactly.

826
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,577
Those things end up determining
how a man's later years turn out.

827
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,331
Why are you glancing at me
while saying that?

828
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,214
See? I was right.

829
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,883
I told you she came a few years ago
to say thank you.

830
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,970
You've said that countless times already.

831
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,972
You must be so proud, aren't you?

832
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,016
You know, I got to save a celebrity.

833
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,686
It really is something.
Who wouldn't think so?

834
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,278
Look at Sang-gil getting so messy.

835
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,989
Just look at how dirty his collar is.

836
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:47,200
You reap what you sow in life.

837
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,578
One has never budged
through all kinds of storms,

838
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:54,541
and the other fluttered
like that air dancer in the wind.

839
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,876
How can their later years be the same?

840
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:05,051
THE SHARE OF SO-CALLED "GRAY DIVORCES"
INCREASED BY 18%

841
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,140
Those shoes look nice.

842
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,436
They're light.
Apparently, the Maasai wear them.

843
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,577
Where did you get them?

844
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,830
I don't know.
I just wear what they give me.

845
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,791
They buy you shoes?

846
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,710
My wife and kids do sometimes.

847
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,852
You should eat before you go.

848
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,021
Well, I could just go eat at home.

849
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,357
No one's home anyway. Just eat here.

850
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,527
That <i>ramyeon </i>you eat all the time
is what's making your belly so…

851
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,032
Come on, get a haircut already.

852
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,951
Not having much hair
is no excuse for skipping the salon!

853
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,541
Well, all right. <i>Arigatou </i>for inviting me.

854
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,543
Just say "thank you" properly!

855
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,546
Then weren't you going to fulfill
a father's role for this?

856
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,469
Eat before you go.

857
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,354
{\an8}BRIDE BU JEONG-SUK
DAUGHTER OF BU SANG-GIL AND PARK YEONG-RAN

858
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:44,776
Don't be like that to him.
He did fulfill some duties as a father.

859
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,654
Yes, he fed us white rice.
I'll give him that.

860
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,447
No, about Cheol-yong.

861
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,951
I think Dad was the one who caught him.

862
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,955
No money can pull out

863
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,165
the peg you drive into your child's heart.

864
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,584
You think you're the only one who thinks?

865
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:06,714
I think too. I think way ahead of you!

866
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,844
I know you work tirelessly
around the clock,

867
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,431
but you can still pick priorities
in the middle of all that.

868
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,600
The chief detective can't even do that?

869
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,770
Just pay to get him out, okay?
Settling is the best option.

870
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,940
Isn't that just admitting guilt?

871
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:27,777
The guilty one should be punished.
Why should the victim pay the price?

872
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:31,072
Even if he pays to settle,
people will still talk about him

873
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,283
as if he's a thief with a criminal record.

874
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,871
I guess he is your son-in-law, after all,
even though you never see him.

875
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,622
I know the boy, that's why.

876
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:44,085
Eun-myeong doesn't have the guts
to do something like that.

877
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,589
After getting beaten up
by my sons a few times,

878
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,925
he couldn't even take the bus
passing our house.

879
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,143
Hello, sir.

880
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:03,771
Oh-seong, don't go to that gambling den.
I won't turn a blind eye anymore.

881
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,691
Bow and show some respect, you idiot.

882
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:07,942
He's your big uncle!

883
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,320
No, it's fine. No need to bow.

884
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,738
Hey, give it here.

885
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,744
Oh my. This thing…

886
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,248
You know, this is…

887
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:26,503
Deer antlers.

888
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,963
Seriously, it's fine. Take it back.

889
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,131
Just take it.

890
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,674
-Hang on.
-Seriously!

891
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,092
Just stay put.

892
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:37,222
I gotta look after my big bro's health.
Otherwise, who will?

893
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,476
Here we go.

894
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:50,985
You know,

895
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,489
the actor I respect the most
is Choi Bool-am,

896
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:57,575
a chief inspector
who tirelessly serves the nation.

897
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,161
Catching a petty thief
would be a piece of cake, right?

898
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,378
I'm Bu Sang-gil of Dodong-ri.

899
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,965
There’s no problem
if you swallow this in one gulp, okay?

900
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:15,843
Well…

901
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,096
Good grief.

902
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:21,891
I guess you're really a father, after all.

903
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,062
Where in the world is there
a father who just goofs off?

904
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,566
I've been a boat captain,
a co-op chief, and a father.

905
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:34,153
But being a father
has the crappiest return.

906
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,490
-Now, open up.
-It's fine.

907
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,326
Just open up.
I put effort into making this wrap.

908
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,037
-All right.
-Don't eat my hand now!

909
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:47,542
Hyeon-suk pleaded with you for money
to save her husband,

910
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,460
and you flat-out refused.

911
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,630
<i>I lost all feelings for you then.</i>

912
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,841
So you bought a Grandeur with my money?

913
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,050
Hey, little brother.

914
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,885
Move your car, and then we'll talk.

915
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:01,889
You said you never give up.
Why did you give up on Park Cheol-yong?

916
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:06,227
Who on earth parks a car like this
in front of the police station?

917
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,396
I see what this is!

918
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:13,735
You already got paid!
So you flushed our deal down the toilet?!

919
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,528
I did my best in the investigation--

920
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,781
-Is he the jailbreak king or Jean Valjean?
-Why bring up Jean Valjean?

921
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,326
Why can't you catch him?
It's because you won't dig!

922
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,202
It's the global era.

923
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,247
You can't even catch him
in the age of the Internet?

924
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,290
Are you drunk?

925
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,667
Nobody feels good
after losing money and a wife.

926
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,461
I've got nothing to lose now.

927
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,463
If you don't want your name in the papers,

928
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:38,676
give me my money back with interest
or hand over Park Cheol-yong!

929
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,303
Choose one or the other.

930
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,554
"Interest"?

931
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:46,601
Wow, looks like Dodong-ri's Bu Sang-gil
is all washed up now, huh?

932
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:51,981
To hell with Dodong-ri's Bu Sang-gil!

933
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:58,488
How do you think Cheol-yong
was found through Joonggonara?

934
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,615
How ridiculous.

935
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,825
Is it Sang-gil's little secret
or something?

936
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,328
-He keeps some things to himself.
-Like what?

937
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,413
About you going around dancing?

938
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,462
When I used to go to nightclubs
just like you did--

939
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:16,673
I danced so I could live.

940
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,384
Every time I came home late,

941
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,554
I'd peek through the door to check
if Dad was sleeping in the living room.

942
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:27,684
Whether his daughter came back or not,
he fell asleep as soon as he lay down.

943
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,018
No, he didn't.

944
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,229
One time, I saw him.

945
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,147
As soon as he heard the door open,

946
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,776
he quickly turned off the TV
and pretended to be sleeping.

947
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,404
Now that I think about it…

948
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,493
it was probably because Dad was a chicken.

949
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,831
That's why he just yells a lot
but won't pick a fight he'd lose.

950
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,668
I think Dad was just a little scared

951
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:57,547
that we might all actually leave one day.

952
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,635
Goddamn it. Seriously.

953
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,889
Whether I see him or not,
he's always a nuisance.

954
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:18,192
<i>Time turned all things in our sight</i>
<i>into a watercolor.</i>

955
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,154
<i>It blurred spite</i>

956
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,282
<i>and softened people's hearts.</i>

957
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,743
Those damn imbeciles.

958
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:30,246
They grew up on white rice
but never bought me these things.

959
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,582
These days,

960
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,418
instant rice is taking care of me.

961
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,170
Come by again tomorrow.

962
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,172
Think I have nothing to do?

963
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,049
I have plenty of places to eat.

964
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:45,136
No, just help out your in-laws.

965
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,556
Once we're on TV,
we might become filthy rich.

966
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,433
I could become a millionaire overnight.

967
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,770
Hey, they'll only flock in at first.

968
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,980
If the food is bad, it's all for nothing.

969
01:02:56,063 --> 01:03:00,985
Dreaming about getting rich overnight?
With that kinda mentality, you're doomed.

970
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,321
-Can you use nicer words?
-Why should I?

971
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,655
So are you coming or not?

972
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,451
Well, are you saying

973
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,703
you need me?

974
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,582
Come on. Don't you know what's going on
with our family these days?

975
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,344
<i>Eight dwarfs began gathering</i>

976
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,932
<i>in an abandoned building in the forest.</i>

977
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,450
Drink this first.

978
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,285
All right!

979
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,538
Eun-myeong, hold this.

980
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,085
<i>And at last…</i>

981
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,924
<i>the bells began to dance</i>
<i>in the heart of the forest.</i>

982
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:56,887
"IF YOU CAN'T, JUST BACK DOWN.
WE'RE ALWAYS HERE FOR YOU."
