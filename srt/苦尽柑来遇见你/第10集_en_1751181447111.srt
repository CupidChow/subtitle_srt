《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,319
I hope you guys listen to me and I'll say it again

3
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,700
I did not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky

4
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,744
I never let anyone...

5
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,496
The strongest wind

6
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,499
Start from the fist

7
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,958
Episode title: "The Wind Has Passed, My Heart Is In Trouble, My Emotions Are Agitated and I Can't Calm My Heart"

8
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,960
Nothing can resist the wind

9
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,254
I'm so innocent.

10
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,382
Looking up at the sky I...

11
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,886
Have a clear conscience

12
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,472
why is that?

13
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,560
Why am I no longer the president and am I forced to abdicate?

14
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,982
Hello Park Young-ran

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,401
Come here

16
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,453
Are you ignoring me too?

17
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,122
I called you over here

18
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,666
What do you do at home all day?

19
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,379
Spending my money on white rice
But you can't even control your children?

20
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,714
That damn girl is just following you

21
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,133
I know everything!

22
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,759
Go to sleep when you are drunk!

23
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,096
What the hell are you doing, little brat?
Whose child are you?

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,182
- Whose side are you on?
- Dad, do you know how old I am?

25
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,276
Hello!

26
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,485
You little bastard!

27
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,239
You never came to my sports meet.
Maybe it's because you never thought of me as your child

28
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,784
While you are wandering around in the world of romance...

29
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,369
“Wandering around”?

30
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,580
Mom never forgets a day
Pack us a hot lunch

31
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,998
Hello!

32
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,668
Who brought this stepmother home?

33
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,880
The stepmother can be replaced at any time

34
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,340
But you and I are blood relatives!

35
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,760
- If you two separate me and my mother
- What are you talking about, little brat?

36
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,682
I just live with your mom because of you
I treat you as my father

37
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,144
Bring the broom

38
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,230
Where is the broom?

39
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,734
Wu Cheng, go back to your room.

40
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,403
You shouldn't talk like that.

41
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,448
Break up with him! What are you lingering on about?

42
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,659
Mommy wants to be with Daddy

43
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,953
I want to be with him

44
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,126
hateful!

45
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,719
you do not say!

46
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,056
You can't live without me

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,476
You guys eat so well at my expense.

48
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,645
Isn’t it?

49
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,397
You can even have white rice!

50
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,025
Life must go on

51
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,072
I have to go on with him.

52
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,740
hateful!

53
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,368
I want to spend the rest of my life with him

54
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,456
See the end of everything

55
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,175
(Knock on the door)

56
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,369
go out

57
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,540
You little...

58
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,086
I really want to kick you away

59
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,671
I told you to get out!

60
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,588
Seriously

61
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,215
Oh my god

62
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,053
mom!

63
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,849
If you were a Korean, I would have beaten you up a long time ago.
You know, right?

64
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,311
You look like an army sergeant.
Are you dating?

65
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,397
Why do you still have photos of Huang Xinhui?

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,649
You have to be born again to be like her.

67
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,568
Get out of my room!

68
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,195
How did you get involved with that family's son?

69
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,614
You idiot, her mother and we...

70
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,577
- Damn it
- What happened to his mother?

71
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,330
You can't be together anyway.

72
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,749
You'll be embarrassed to death later.

73
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,376
Stop messing around while I'm still polite.

74
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,297
Why can't we be together?

75
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,677
Go tell him...

76
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,266
If I see him again I will kill him

77
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,232
Let's break up

78
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,694
No I don't want it! Why?

79
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,655
Is it because of those two bastards Wu Cheng and Han Yin?

80
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,366
Or is it because of my dad?

81
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,202
My dad is my dad but I am me

82
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,245
I never listen to him.

83
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,708
Listen, stop telling people you're my girlfriend.

84
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,295
Don't cut in line in the cafeteria and think I'll protect you

85
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,132
If you go ice skating, just go to the rink at Twin Peaks

86
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,426
No, I will

87
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,137
You can't date anyone but me.

88
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,681
If you date someone else I'll beat them up

89
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,183
Do you think I won't?

90
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,935
Do you think I won't?

91
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,895
I know you will

92
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,731
No, I can't break up with you.

93
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,316
I don't want

94
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,195
- The last thing is that my husband is virtuous
- What?

95
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,245
Take care

96
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:00,837
They cried

97
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,675
You fucking bastard!

98
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,721
Don't let me see you again

99
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,265
I'm going to kill you!

100
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,686
You're breaking up with me just because I got beaten up

101
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,272
I'll tell them to keep beating you!

102
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,898
I’ll beat you every time I see you!

103
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,984
You have no idea how much it hurts!

104
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,988
We can avoid them

105
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,198
Don't let them catch you

106
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,869
Amusement park ice skating rink urban area
I can't go anywhere

107
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,539
Your brother's friends keep showing up

108
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,708
I got on the bus yesterday

109
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,169
The driver is also their friend.

110
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,840
He forced me to sit until the terminal!

111
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,136
Damn it! How am I going to survive?

112
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,221
I have my own life too

113
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,432
Then run away

114
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,517
Let's escape

115
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,021
- What?
- I can't stand it anymore

116
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,857
My dad even took down my bedroom door

117
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,360
Do you want to escape?

118
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,905
My dad said if I see you again

119
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,616
He shaved my hair and sent me to the temple

120
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,658
Do you believe him?

121
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,078
Then all your friends are nuns now

122
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,081
So should we escape?

123
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,379
Do you want to escape or not?

124
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,466
I don't know a damn thing!

125
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,560
Keep honking the horn

126
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,604
Keep honking the horn

127
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,231
Keep honking the horn

128
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,444
Oh my god they look
Like the middle part of the Korean flag

129
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,239
Come on, everyone is like this when they are young!

130
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,908
Apparently this is the spring of their lives

131
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,787
Is it because spring has arrived or is it genetics?

132
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,163
I love you

133
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,790
I love you too

134
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,334
Looking back, spring is like a feast

135
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,380
Welcome home son

136
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,840
But for Sprout it's a battle

137
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,758
Hello

138
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,928
Do you come here often?

139
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,182
The new sprouts are experiencing the test of breaking through the soil

140
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,528
You can't even serve soup.

141
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,615
Didn't your mother teach you?

142
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,660
It's just the kelp tangled together.

143
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,537
Don't use your hands!

144
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,747
Our family wouldn't be like this.

145
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,007
You are all here

146
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,134
Happy birthday indeed.

147
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,685
There is only one happy person in that family

148
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,993
All kinds of cinnamon are delicious

149
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,579
It's hard to find good cinchi in Seoul

150
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,248
I'm not saying that all the Xinqi in Seoul are bad.

151
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,166
This is bought

152
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,342
I haven't had home-cooked food for a long time.
I feel like I can eat two bowls

153
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,593
We eat less at home.

154
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,684
Do your parents know that you often go to men's apartments?

155
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:48,439
She doesn't come here often.
I asked her to come today because it's my birthday.

156
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,067
I didn't ask you

157
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,322
Jin Ming

158
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,992
This is not Yingfan's apartment. It's mine.

159
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,453
I bought him the apartment.

160
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,166
I don't want you to come to my apartment too often.

161
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,710
- Mother
- This is my apartment.

162
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,879
I don't want you here

163
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,010
Of course you guys keep dating.
Taste the ups and downs of love

164
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,013
I told you I was planning to marry Jinming...

165
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:21,931
Quiet

166
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,853
You want a place near the school?
The result is this...

167
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,525
this

168
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,570
You are my pride

169
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,572
Now my pride is damaged

170
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,203
Everyone's heart is shaken by love

171
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,123
A storm swept through their hearts

172
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,668
Is your family a big chaebol?
Samsung or Hyundai?

173
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,962
How much richer is your family than mine?

174
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,552
We went to the same school.
I am just as precious to my parents.

175
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,512
Why should I be ashamed of not being able to serve soup?

176
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,557
Are you good at serving soup? Did your mother teach you?

177
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,976
I'm not good at serving soup either.

178
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,019
It's so unfair

179
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,524
I hate all of this

180
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,819
I feel like a cheap clown.

181
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,697
I can't stand being in front of people who look askance at me.

182
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,616
No matter what I do, I can't please you

183
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,201
I hate this so much!

184
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,878
(Stomachic and digestive beverage)

185
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,967
How do you eat so much?

186
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,387
Of course I want to please her.

187
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,222
Of course I did!

188
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,101
Who doesn’t want to please their boyfriend’s mom?

189
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,772
Who would want to marry a mama's boy?

190
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,778
You choose

191
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,989
Being a good son or a good husband?

192
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,407
You can only choose one

193
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,453
I don't want a man who has to please everyone.

194
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,748
Forget about the proposal.
Decide this first, then talk about the rest

195
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,085
Who in the world can choose one and give up the other?

196
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,420
No one will...

197
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,588
My dad

198
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,173
What?

199
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,133
That's what my dad did.

200
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,802
I see

201
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,055
Let me make it clear first

202
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,809
I won't marry a mama's boy

203
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,563
It all felt so genuine.

204
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,318
Like a little owl
Cried all night in the breeze

205
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,240
I am Kim Ki-duk from "Two O'Clock Date"

206
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:50,621
I believe the 90s were a pop culture renaissance

207
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,998
The wind of change is coming

208
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,835
I like this picture

209
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,753
I don't think he's Picasso anymore.

210
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,838
Did you see it?

211
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,464
You can do a good job

212
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,884
The theme of the movie is clear

213
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,638
Just seeing this makes me want to dance the lambada

214
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,391
here you go!

215
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,187
That old lady is here again

216
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,690
She always knows when a movie is coming out

217
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,776
Where did she get the resale tickets?

218
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,321
I never sold her a ticket.

219
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,698
Maybe a fake ticket?

220
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,892
We don't buy

221
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,144
No that...

222
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,187
- We don't want to resell tickets
- no…

223
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,442
Does that look like Choi Jin-sil?

224
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,113
Does that look like Choi Jin-sil?

225
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,700
- I think she looks like me.
- The painting is really good.

226
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,286
- Feel sorry?
- Is it bad?

227
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,330
No, I don't think so.

228
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,083
I heard that it was painted by a college student majoring in fine arts.

229
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,710
So that's it

230
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,380
Why don't people watch it?
Is everyone busy?

231
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,593
Everyone went in without even looking at the paintings.
It really makes me a little sad.

232
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,637
It's really sad.

233
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,015
Picasso lived in the basement of the Cannes Theater

234
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,060
For some people
This theater is their Louvre

235
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,437
Stop scalping tickets! Stop it!

236
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,482
Scalpers are a social nuisance!

237
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,275
Ticket scalping is prohibited!

238
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,653
I told you not to sell it!

239
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,364
Does he really think I'm a scalper?

240
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,759
Since you're here, it'd be nice to watch a movie.

241
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,720
I heard that the movie that will be released in two days is good.

242
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,638
(Promotional ticket)

243
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,598
It was rerun because it was popular.

244
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,395
You shouldn't give your ticket to anyone else.

245
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,064
But you are not ordinary people

246
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,943
This is an employee benefit given by the boss himself!

247
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,906
Come on Monday afternoon at 2pm and there's usually no one there.

248
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,950
It feels like a packed house.

249
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,455
I hope you don't tell my son.
I came here to see his paintings.

250
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,375
Chung-seop doesn't know I'm here

251
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,129
He went out with his lunch box and came home covered in paint

252
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,340
Never say what you painted or where you painted it
Because he was embarrassed

253
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,010
Not everyone can draw such a big picture

254
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,137
- Anyone who can draw is a painter
- Yes.

255
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,889
He draws really well. I really want to see what he draws.

256
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,188
I have seen everything Chung Seob has drawn since elementary school.

257
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,523
That is my happiness

258
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,860
Now the movie release day is my happiness

259
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,487
(Promotional ticket)

260
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,449
Without Painter Park, our theater would be finished.

261
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,332
Boss, you are not from Seoul, right?

262
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,251
Really

263
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,881
- Wow
- Wow!

264
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,518
What happened this time?

265
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,354
Yinming is selling things at school again?

266
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,274
Yinming's mother

267
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,985
Don't call me that anymore.

268
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,696
Then call you Jinming Mom?

269
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,532
Didn't Seoul call?

270
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,326
I said Jinming has a boyfriend.

271
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,411
She has forgotten her parents

272
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,830
Oh my god, this is annoying.

273
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,042
Let her call us first.
Just like giving us more face

274
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,253
Children are only children when they are in the nest

275
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,465
Once I leave the nest, I am busier than the president

276
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,134
My kids are the busiest people in the world

277
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,596
Why are you having a nightmare again?

278
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,944
Why did the school call you this time?
He's at the bottom again?

279
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,862
He was never the last one.

280
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,614
There is Zhelong in that class

281
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,701
Cigarette related

282
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,538
You said you wouldn't tell anyone.

283
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,915
Does that bastard smoke?

284
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,083
He doesn't smoke

285
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,876
He sells cigarettes

286
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,171
- He sells cigarettes
- Wow

287
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,340
(Auntie Seafood House)

288
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,925
He's really good at it.

289
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:58,303
In my opinion, selling cigarettes is better than smoking.

290
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:03,225
He cheated the old man in the grocery store
Said the cigarettes were bought for us

291
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,311
I bought cigarettes and delivered them.

292
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,022
They say he'll put a markup on the price when he resells it.

293
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:13,944
I really want to know more than Jin Ming
What will Yinming become in the future?

294
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,824
Have you asked him why he did that?

295
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,450
what why?

296
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,996
Adolescent anxiety is lawless

297
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,709
I mean, have you asked him?
Why do you want to make money so much?

298
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,005
I don't know why he is so obsessed with money!

299
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,757
That's why you ask.

300
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,343
You gave him life but his mind is not yours

301
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,055
You know you can't help Jin Ming

302
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,808
So he was very strict with Yinming.

303
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:49,771
Jin Ming is a tough guy
You always treat her like soft tofu

304
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,233
Yinming is easy to get along with but you treat him like a carrot

305
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,445
Jinming is a bit sensitive like me.

306
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,573
Yinming, you know...

307
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,616
Easy to talk to?

308
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,700
I don’t think so!

309
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,538
A carrot may seem to be fine no matter how many times it falls.

310
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,750
But no matter how strong the carrot is
It may be hollow inside.

311
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,921
Don't treat children differently

312
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,797
Children

313
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,258
Remember everything

314
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,969
Because I'm sad too

315
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,265
I can't help but get even more angry at my weakness

316
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,060
So this matter

317
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,104
And Jinming makes you proud
Is it okay if Yinming embarrasses you?

318
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,233
So what? Am I a saint?

319
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,527
What can I do?

320
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,367
...maybe a rising star

321
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,078
Advanced Selection

322
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,413
High-performance Elantra

323
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,553
so…

324
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,517
I owe you a favor again.
I don't know how to repay you

325
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,353
It's fine

326
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,731
But I still want to...

327
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,949
When you are free
Can you draw something for me?

328
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,118
This way I can sell it for a good price later

329
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,705
Heard about Picasso's works
It became more valuable after his death.

330
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,710
But who can guarantee that I will die first?

331
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,467
- Are you kidding?
- Yes

332
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,141
- I should go back to the ticket office.
- good…

333
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,060
What's wrong?

334
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,063
Thank you so much

335
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,858
It's okay. I didn't pay for it myself.

336
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,277
No, I mean my mom...

337
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,947
(Cinema Paradiso)

338
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,994
This is her first time watching a movie in a cinema

339
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,296
Uncle! You have to run!

340
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,590
No, you have to run!

341
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,603
Although she watches "Weekend Classic Movies" every week

342
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,063
I guess

343
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,899
I've been too focused on my own life.

344
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,369
Everyone is shaken by the love in their heart

345
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,912
Did you know?

346
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,749
I cried when the projectionist came in wearing sunglasses

347
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,084
Alfredo?

348
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,796
Why isn't there a fire extinguisher in the screening room?

349
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,298
Why put out the fire? He should save his own

350
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,133
He should jump out of the window.

351
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,469
That would only break your legs.

352
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,932
I wonder what he will do if he loses his job as a projectionist.

353
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,684
Maybe Toto will send him money because he is so kind.

354
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,063
You cried because you thought
Could Alfredo be broke?

355
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,190
You know Toto

356
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,068
Reminds me of you

357
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,656
Toto is like my son

358
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,952
What did you want to give Miss Liang?

359
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,662
I'll bring it back to her

360
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,706
You said you were an English major?

361
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,625
Yes

362
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,877
(copy printing and binding)

363
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,005
You can count on me until graduation.

364
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,968
These are all in English and people just don't buy them

365
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:48,969
(1984 Gyeonggi Province High School Painting Competition
Park Chung-seop)

366
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,096
It would cost a fortune to buy them all.

367
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,348
English is more expensive

368
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,684
There are some study notes in it

369
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:59,688
I'm not sure I can take all of this.

370
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,149
No wonder parents like their daughters.

371
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:06,069
I've been here forever and every day feels the same

372
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:09,322
The only special thing is to see new paintings on the premiere day

373
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,367
But thanks to you, Ms. Liang
I am really happy today

374
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:17,038
I think I will remember this day until I die.

375
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,461
Listen to you say

376
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,962
Makes me feel

377
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,341
I did an amazing thing

378
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,760
Mom, that's enough.

379
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,138
How could she lift it?

380
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,223
She can't carry it alone.

381
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,643
She can't hold it

382
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,088
How about a drink?

383
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,383
Have a drink…

384
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,677
- Shall we have a drink?
- For you

385
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,013
It’s a bit…

386
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,307
Oh well

387
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,272
You know...

388
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,359
What's wrong?

389
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,443
If you really appreciate me

390
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,154
Maybe you should clarify this for me.
Instead of treating me to noodles?

391
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:38,245
My landlord's daughter
Always kicking the shoes I left outside

392
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,791
She knows there's nothing between us.

393
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,876
I think

394
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,255
She wants to get married with peace of mind.

395
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,885
So you want your girlfriend to marry someone else?

396
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,764
You must be a

397
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,516
saint

398
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,603
She's going to marry the noodle shop owner's son

399
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,647
Can you make a fortune by selling noodles?

400
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,649
Bidong Noodle Chain

401
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,531
Who wouldn't want to marry into a good family like that?

402
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,366
But she

403
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,369
Can't make up my mind

404
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,955
Then keep her.

405
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,376
If she dumped Picasso
It's her fate to marry the guy from the noodle shop

406
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,086
You need to tell her in person.

407
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,631
"You can leave if you want.
This is your loss, not mine!"

408
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:37,512
You should bring a gift set and say:
"Please let me marry your daughter"

409
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,931
At least you won't regret it.

410
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,101
How do you know I'm better than the guy in the noodle shop?

411
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,021
You don't understand me

412
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,939
You are your mother's precious son.

413
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,196
So you can draw whatever you want.

414
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,867
That's the feeling in my bones, you know?

415
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,371
I am also my parents' baby

416
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,665
I just want

417
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,043
Live with your head held high

418
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,004
Let our family live with dignity

419
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,299
At least that's what I think

420
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:23,141
You know
You don't have to stand up for someone you barely know.

421
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,851
How come I don't know

422
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,187
After all, people are the same

423
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,647
No, everyone is different

424
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,525
After all, everyone has a bad side.

425
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,616
In that era, stranger danger

426
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,701
The kindness of strangers is also dangerous

427
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:46,331
13-year-old child killed in Hwaseong serial murders
Less than three months later...

428
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,501
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

429
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,211
(Apgujeong kidnapping case becomes an open investigation)

430
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,463
Please tell me. Sorry for the trouble.

431
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,049
Those bastards deserve to be cut into pieces!

432
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,718
The phrase "a thousand cuts" is so true.

433
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,136
How could someone be so bad?

434
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,181
Really? OK, I understand.

435
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,767
Wait for Jinming to come back

436
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,978
Can you ask her to call me back...

437
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,899
OK, thanks

438
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,485
Kidnapping a child

439
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,780
That's equivalent to taking three lives instead of one.

440
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,282
What should parents who lost their children do?

441
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,459
I mean, losing a child is devastating in itself.

442
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,545
But losing a child like that...

443
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,879
Oh my god

444
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,051
What happened? Jinming is late again?

445
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,138
I don't understand why she's out so late

446
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,306
I told her to stay home tonight.

447
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,101
What's wrong? Do you always have nightmares?

448
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,686
About what?

449
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,110
You may feel this way because it is almost time to pay homage to your ancestors.

450
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,697
When you were a child, something strange happened during ancestor worship.

451
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,614
The Ekishan incident?

452
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,492
We were all there, right?

453
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,746
Oh my god, I shudder just thinking about it

454
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:13,752
I still remember the taste of that day

455
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,912
hurry up!

456
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,914
They would put the meat on the sacrificial table.

457
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,124
Dad will leave it all to my brother

458
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,753
Only humans can see black dragonflies

459
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,088
They say other dragonflies can't see them

460
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,006
Why?

461
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,425
Because this is the Death Dragonfly

462
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:08,515
We humans can't see the god of death, right?

463
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,980
What? You wanna catch it?

464
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,732
You go first

465
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,151
let's go!

466
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,278
Wait till I catch it

467
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,906
It can't kill other dragonflies.

468
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,868
The little dragonflies also want to live with their parents

469
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,996
Dad is going to scold you again

470
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,375
Is this what is called upper body?

471
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,418
I don't know why I chase it.

472
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,778
(Ekishan Bus Station)

473
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,045
I want to take the bus but my legs hurt

474
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,674
Can you go to that store?

475
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,468
Would you like to change this into a ten-won coin?

476
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,610
What does the owner say?

477
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,154
They said they would not change coins.

478
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,240
- Did he scold you?
- No

479
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,784
But he did glance at me.

480
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,495
Sorry for bothering you

481
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,503
You are really kind and gentle.

482
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,548
Are you very obedient?

483
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:06,883
But

484
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,969
You don't have to give me this

485
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,930
Could you give me some more change?

486
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,349
I have to take two buses.

487
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,149
Since the store owner is unwilling to change the coins

488
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,655
Then you go to the alley behind the telephone pole.
Find the cabbage vendor driving a truck

489
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,866
Can you get some change from that man?

490
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,994
Then I'll give you another

491
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,499
My legs really hurt.

492
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,367
What are you doing?

493
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,577
- Mother
- what are you doing here?

494
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,664
- What's wrong with you, mom?
- What is this money?

495
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,837
- Uncle!
- What's wrong? Do you know that guy?

496
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,433
There was an auntie here just now

497
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,020
Guangli said her heartbeat accelerated

498
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,023
But she didn't say anything for fear of scaring you.

499
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,775
But why are you here, mom?

500
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,654
What a strange coincidence.

501
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,742
I'm in a neighborhood I've never been to before.

502
00:33:55,825 --> 00:34:00,204
Met a mom who wouldn't be there

503
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,373
You don’t know yet?

504
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,543
Your mother went out to look for you that day

505
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,635
Thanks to your sister-in-law, I don't have to collect firewood.

506
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,054
Stop calling her sister-in-law.

507
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,681
We still have the firewood you brought earlier.

508
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,142
She can do these things.

509
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:26,147
Her children have been living and eating here for free for several years

510
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,274
You should pay some child support.

511
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,903
Don't let Aichun carry firewood

512
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,822
Replace sake with makgeolli

513
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,033
Han Kyu prefers Makgeolli

514
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,203
What about Aichunren?

515
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:44,832
Today is her father's memorial day, but she just wants to go out

516
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,503
Where is Aichun? There is broth here. Where is she?

517
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,465
She went after the Death Dragonfly

518
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,217
What?

519
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,512
My mother's intuition is terrible.

520
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,431
It is said that she climbed over a mountain in one go.

521
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,688
You should drink the broth made for your dad

522
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,191
Why run around?

523
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,241
For Mom

524
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,285
Why? This is mine.

525
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,662
This is unlucky

526
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,096
How did you know I was here?

527
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:44,183
I have eyes on the back of my head. All mothers are like this.

528
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,564
Do you think the aunt will come back to ask for money?

529
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,943
- Love Pure
- What?

530
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,653
Did that lady see your face?

531
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,446
I see

532
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,825
What does she look like?

533
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:06,622
She looked pale and had a strange...

534
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,917
Do you think your mother will let you go?
Someone who bullied her child?

535
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,301
Come and see!

536
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,218
(Fresh Caught)

537
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,971
Come and have a look! We have preferential prices and all are fresh goods

538
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,390
3 50 won for you

539
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,892
I don't care

540
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,268
Give me another one.

541
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,479
Please, we worked so hard to get these.

542
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,190
That's fine.

543
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,107
Oh my god!

544
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,484
Oh My God!

545
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,699
Hello! The wrists of every woman in Jeju Island
Do you want to check them all?

546
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,617
Oh my god!

547
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,499
You scared the customers away by pulling their wrists.

548
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,044
Are you selling conches to catch criminals?

549
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,838
That bitch saw Aichun's face

550
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,716
I want to buy some conch

551
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,927
These are free!

552
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,054
What's your asking price?

553
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,641
What is your bid?

554
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,394
Hey, I sent the boat back.

555
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,564
Why do you always look for children?

556
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,650
Is there an age limit for begging?

557
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,737
If you touch it, you have to buy it, okay?

558
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:26,035
The older you get, the less obedient you become.
Kind and gentle children are the best

559
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,788
That girl is perfect.

560
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:30,873
what the hell?

561
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,458
- What's wrong?
- Please!

562
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,877
Before you pull her wrist
Let me do my business first!

563
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,254
Auntie, you must be crazy.

564
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,923
Are you crazy? Let her go!

565
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,552
What the hell? Why are you so energetic?

566
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,346
I'll beat you to death, you bitch!

567
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,933
You want my daughter to beg, don't you?

568
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,233
These bastards! Catch that bastard!
They must be killed!

569
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,740
Come here, bastard!

570
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,826
Bitch!

571
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,956
what happens?

572
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,210
Fairy tales back then didn’t have open endings

573
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,462
What else could she do when she was about to beat her to death?

574
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,257
She beat her to death?

575
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,635
Those bastards deserved to be beaten to death, right?

576
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,929
Don't come back here asshole!

577
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,472
Go to hell you bitch!

578
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:47,241
The country had no legal system at that time.

579
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:52,705
So if you hit someone who deserves it
The police won't say anything.

580
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,791
Even if you beat a person half to death

581
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,587
The police will also clean up the mess and take the person away.

582
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,881
The police used to beat people themselves.

583
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,427
It just so happened that day was Han Kyu's memorial day.

584
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,223
Your mother said it was your father who saved you

585
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,433
But I don't think so

586
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,519
Your mother saved her child.

587
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,521
There's nothing like a mother's intuition.

588
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,149
Oh my god

589
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,526
Grandma is still awake so late

590
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,862
She can forget everything

591
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,656
I just can't forget the day when my eldest son came back.

592
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,951
There's nothing like a mother's intuition.

593
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,955
My mother said to me at that time

594
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,876
The back of the mother's head

595
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,795
You need to have two eyes

596
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,641
Hello, there is a phone call for you

597
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:54,975
good

598
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,189
Oh my god

599
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:03,275
Don't people in Jeju Island watch "Eyes of Dawn"?

600
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,653
She always calls when this is on TV

601
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,739
Yeah, everything is fine.

602
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,201
What can happen in a day?

603
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,162
(Eye of Dawn)

604
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,083
Do you have to call me every time you dream?

605
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:23,129
Why do you always come home late?
Where do you hang out every night?

606
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,463
I didn't hang out

607
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,882
Have the lights in your alley been repaired?

608
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,886
The world outside is dangerous, go home early

609
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,555
You must sleep at home

610
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,224
Don't spend the night outside
I'll know if you do that.

611
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,726
You call every night
Is it to see if I'm playing?

612
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,771
You don’t have a partner, right?

613
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,774
I can't bear it if you disappoint me too

614
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,694
You are the pride of your parents.

615
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,822
All my hopes are placed on you
If there is a problem with the support...

616
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,157
Damn pillars...

617
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,578
Is I the only one in your life?

618
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,955
Don’t you have your own life?

619
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:02,251
Even if I stay out all night
You can't do anything there.

620
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,504
If I want to deceive you, I can deceive you a thousand times

621
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,589
You are awesome

622
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:10,634
So don't worry about it, please.

623
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,012
You have to live your own life

624
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,805
Wait until you have a child

625
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,225
Wait until you have a daughter like you before you say that!

626
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,897
You wear these hairpins every day
Throwing it everywhere every day

627
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,192
Why should I buy it for you?
You lose it every day anyway.

628
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,361
She thinks she is amazing

629
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,992
I saw this at the hardware store and bought one

630
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,080
You go to Seoul and see her install it.

631
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:44,084
Since she is so good, she can definitely install it herself.

632
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,837
I'm the only one worrying stupidly

633
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,174
A child is only a child when he is in your arms

634
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,470
She feels she has grown up, but I don't.

635
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,805
She's still a child to me.

636
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,808
Is it because of that dream?

637
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,271
What do you always dream about?

638
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,110
Why don't you say anything?
Are the nightmares this period that bad?

639
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,238
Not a nightmare

640
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,114
nothing

641
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:45,688
mom!

642
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,408
mom!

643
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,414
mom

644
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:25,728
Didn't I say I'd give you candy after you finish the noodle soup?

645
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,646
Why don't you listen to your mother?

646
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,897
Mommy, hug me

647
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,320
Aunt Wu! Jin Ming had an accident!

648
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,280
Is she bleeding?

649
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,926
Didn't I say I'd give you candy after you finish the noodle soup?

650
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,803
Why don't you listen to your mother?

651
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,437
Another nightmare?

652
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,148
Oh my god

653
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,279
What dreams did you have recently?

654
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,285
...I'll give you candy after you finish the noodle soup

655
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,329
Aunt Wu! Jin Ming had an accident!

656
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,372
Is she bleeding?

657
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,412
baby

658
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,458
Mother…

659
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,920
I'm going to pick up your sister and will be back in a while.

660
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,298
Okay?

661
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:04,928
I'll be right back

662
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,686
Wait till I come back

663
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,689
I give you candy every day

664
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,483
Okay?

665
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,363
Mom is unlucky

666
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,533
I've suffered a lot

667
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,584
So she is more worried.

668
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:40,756
She believes that if she keeps worrying
It can even prevent those unfortunate

669
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,008
Jin Ming

670
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,473
baby

671
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,266
baby

672
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,101
baby

673
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,729
baby!

674
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,532
No God

675
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,744
My baby, oh my god

676
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:14,748
Help!

677
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,417
Help!

678
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,837
baby

679
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,547
What's wrong with him?

680
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,049
baby

681
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,176
doctor

682
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,346
Call a doctor

683
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,102
ambulance

684
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,604
The ambulance called...

685
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,568
Kuan Zhi called an ambulance

686
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,070
Why didn't anyone call an ambulance?

687
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,784
Jin Ming

688
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,286
Jin Ming

689
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,343
Help!

690
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,847
Help! Ambulance!

691
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,308
Someone call an ambulance!

692
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,351
ambulance!

693
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,896
baby!

694
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,467
Look, you can't just walk over here...

695
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,384
What's wrong?

696
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,679
She inhaled gas

697
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,681
What? No!

698
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,645
No. 108, Bongcheon 5th-dong

699
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,938
No. 108!

700
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,357
Number 108! Yes!

701
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,735
No, there are no steps!

702
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,195
The car can't drive up

703
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,112
right

704
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,121
That’s when true kindness was frozen…

705
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,623
Oh no

706
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,668
Baby mommy is here

707
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,835
Mom is here

708
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,590
...the year when Korea's three major unsolved crimes occurred

709
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,594
Mommy would be on the 9 o'clock news every night.
Call me

710
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,346
Here we are!

711
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,848
Her endless worrying is annoying.

712
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,309
Doctor! Please help us!

713
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,310
but

714
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,814
It is this annoying worry
Saved my life again

715
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,239
Why is it so quiet?

716
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,790
baby

717
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:03,583
No baby!

718
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,585
Baby oh my god

719
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,631
Are you okay? Oh my god.

720
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,342
Just like that she saved me time and time again

721
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,193
No!

722
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:35,949
No dear!

723
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,625
- Are you okay?
- When you grow up, you must be kind to your parents.

724
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,171
You're so likely to get into trouble
Do you want to be some great person?

725
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,506
Will it leave scars?

726
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,177
Are you worried about her getting a scar?
I'm lucky it's not worse.

727
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,306
Who would believe you caught it?
A child jumping from the roof

728
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,392
Mom and Dad

729
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,310
Oh my god

730
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,314
How did she get on the roof this time?

731
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,358
She always said she was a magpie

732
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,118
My baby got stitches
I can't imagine how painful it is.

733
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,954
Until much later

734
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,999
When I no longer receive her calls

735
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,836
I deeply miss her endless worry

736
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,547
sorry

737
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,592
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

738
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:39,763
It doesn't matter

739
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,767
Her delicate heart sank countless times

740
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,312
I wish I had
I can express my gratitude to her more.

741
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,024
Regret comes too late

742
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:50,578
(“Ready to go, give it your all
Dance with the moment")

743
00:54:55,208 --> 00:55:00,213
