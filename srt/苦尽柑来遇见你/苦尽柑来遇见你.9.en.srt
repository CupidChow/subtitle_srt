[man 2] Careful. Careful.

-One, two.

Oh! No, I told you to be careful!

00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,331
If this breaks, I'm going to kill myself.

[man 2] Sir? Can you help lift?

13
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,630
One, two, three.

14
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,050
Hey, Mom?
Did we really have to bring that thing?

15
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,511
It's huge! There's nowhere to put it.

16
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,597
Where is this supposed to fit
in that tiny apartment?

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,892
[sighs, groans] This was my dowry.

18
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,019
The first nice thing I ever had.

19
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,523
If you're really downsizing,
you shouldn't have brought so much stuff.

20
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,443
Who on earth brings a mother-of-pearl
wardrobe when they move? Seriously.

00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,406
[man 2] All right. Let's go. Let's go.
Let's take it up.

-Okay. Come on.
-Okay.

-That brat gets whatever she wants.
-Who are you calling a brat, huh?

32
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,257
You know Cheol-yong's sister actually
gives him some of her pay as an usher.

33
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:14,926
What about her?

34
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,803
Is she leading this family
or tearing it apart?

35
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,513
You…

36
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,600
You're always giving me a hard time, Dad.

They couldn't wait to come by
for my circumcision. Where are they now?

50
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,238
[middle-aged Ae-sun] The aunties are busy
because of the Olympics.

51
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,116
Wait, I don't get it.

52
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,077
I thought they hated the Olympics.

53

-They're Jeju's representatives.
-Ah!

54
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,916
The government decided
to give the <i>haenyeo </i>a role,

55
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,168
so the aunties made amends.

56
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,837
[Eun-myeong] Well,
isn't that convenient for them.

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,593
Where do you think you're going?
You promised me you'd study.

58
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,221
[grunts] So I can go to
a pricey school too?

59
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,307
Then what? Are you gonna move into a hut?

60
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,312
What happens to your precious dowry, then?
Your mother-of-pearl wardrobe?

61
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,649
Oh my God.
I feed you well enough, don't I?

62
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,693
Why is it always about money?
Is that all that you--

63
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,819
Don't waste power.

64
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,447

I'll do the living room next.
All with your favorite flower.

74
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,104
Oh, it's already peeling.

75
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,191
You chose a good place for the wardrobe.

76
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,069
When you get home,
you can hang your clothes right away.

77
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,321
It works perfectly.

78
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,489
You're just a bit smarter
with these kinds of things.

79
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,866
You make good choices.

80
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,076
Why are you so talkative all of a sudden?

81
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,122
You think florals would work
for the curtains?

82
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,042
Let's do it. I have the store's number.

00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,669
-I'll… I'll call--
-It's all right.

84
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,715
I like this place already.

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,222
It was just bringing up the wardrobe.

87
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,892
You know how important it is to me.

88
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,478
That's why I lost my temper earlier.

91
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,444
Have you ever even lived in an apartment?

92
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,364
You're used to the house.
It's gonna get stuffy in here.

93
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,617
Where do we hang laundry?
Where do we put the fermenting jars?

94
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,203
I didn't live in houses
because I preferred to.

95
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,332
I don't mind if it's a stuffy apartment
or your parents' spare room.

96

You love reading books.

101
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,554
You were born to be a rich man's wife.

What are you saying?

00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,893
All the wives of Dodong-ri
will be jealous.

You're as stubborn as Gwang-rye.

has pride ever put food on the table?

122

-Yes.

00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,214
Hey, man.

678
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,549
Why did you turn that on?

679
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,386
[Geum-myeong] I got this place
because of the hilltop view.

680
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,889
If we go all the way up,

681
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,225
we'll see the biggest Christmas tree
in Korea.

682
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,727
You won't see one that big
even in America.

683
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,815
If I lived too close to the school,
friends would come over too often.

684
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,735
Rooms near the school
are always in demand,

685
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,779
so, of course,
all the landlords are jerks.

686
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,030
PISS HERE, AND I'LL CUT IT OFF

687
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,865
It's a relief these people don't feed me.

688
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,325
Not that I eat much anyway.

Huh?

692
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,415
What is it?

693
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:33,918
You can't live here.

694
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,671
Look at this place.
It's worse than Harlem.

695
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,758
The people who spray-paint that stuff,

696
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,886
they gotta be sick in the head. Honestly.

697
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,806
Why live in such a dangerous area?

698
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,101
I can't sleep
knowing you live somewhere like this.

699
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,021
Why are they fighting
in someone else's neighborhood?

700
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,864
That man's an artist.

701
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,201
He's the artist who works at our theater.

702
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,078
Stop overreacting.

703
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,039
[Yeong-beom] No one wants his girlfriend
to live in a place like this.

704
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,249
I'm worried sick.

705
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:17,086
What do you mean "place like this"?
I'm doing just fine here.

706
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,087
[Yeong-beom sighs]

707
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,381
Pack your things tonight.

708
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,760
-Move to our neighborhood.
-[Geum-myeong] Where in your neighborhood?

709
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,429
To your apartment?

710
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,805
You really don't know Seoul.

711
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,849
You're the one who doesn't know Seoul.

712
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,059
Not me.

[Yeong-beom sighs]

714
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,232
I'm just saying this
because I'm worried about you.

715
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,445
Just leave, okay?
I don't want you in my room.

716
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,906
You're living in a Korean slum,
a place where serial murders happen.

717
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,285
Then go back to America
if you're American now.

718

He keeps his mouth closed all the time.

723
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,725
I couldn't even strike up
a conversation with him if I wanted to.

724
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,561
Hey, can't you just eat from
the already open ones?

725
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,772
Who do you think
he bought the dumplings for?

726
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,273
So the kid could have some.

727
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,819
Then stop yelling at him
and scaring him off.

728
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,279
It's a waste of good money.

729
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,323
Give them to him yourself.

[Bu-seon] Because you're not
interested in money?

745
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,795
Oh, I forgot!
You're a noble artist, aren't you?

746
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,466
You're always saying
that I always talk about money,

747
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,676
but, hey, I'm not the one who's poor.

748
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,678
You feel noble
because you don't care about it,

749
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,055
but every time we're together,
no matter what we do,

all the time.

"Oh, he doesn't have money.
We can't do it."

754

We dated for three years,

755
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,276

Tell me. Is that what art stands for?

760
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,079
How much longer can this go on?

761
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,042
How long until you've finished rebelling
and marry the man your father wants?

Just leave. Don't worry about saving face.
Just get out of here.
