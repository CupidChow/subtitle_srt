《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,741
Episode title: "Summer Sun"

3
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,870
It's so hot.

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,540
What a good weather to torture my wife

5
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,795
108 bows are enough

6
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,884
If I had prayed enough, I would have it now instead of wasting five years of hard work.

7
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,261
Even Buddha can't stand 3,000 prostrations.

8
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,724
Suffering can show piety

9
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,184
You are so cruel

10
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,772
The mother-in-law is so cruel and still wants to have more grandchildren?

11
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,233
To put it bluntly, she won't survive even if she's born.

12
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,568
Eight are born and two can die

13
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,612
Marry into a family that values male offspring

14
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,322
She should do her part

15
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,908
Is there any good thing that can be eaten for free?

16
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,453
She didn't bring any dowry when she got married

17
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,621
What about you?

18
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,458
Did you bring a dowry? Is that why you only have two children?

19
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,797
You can't stand me so you favor her, right?

20
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,925
Aichun, let's go.

21
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,901
You asked her to worship 3000 times

22
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,696
How can I serve my husband when my legs are too weak?

23
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,447
She is really amazing, isn't she?

24
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,409
Remember to give him some pillow talk

25
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,995
Tell your husband that I made you bow 3000 times

26
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,455
Kuanzhi is now towards you

27
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,917
But no man likes his wife to speak ill of his mother.

28
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,170
Even if he is the most unfilial son in the world

29
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,507
I also hope that my wife is the most filial daughter-in-law.

30
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,342
Keep your mouth shut

31
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,845
Did you tell me that?

32
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,430
I won't tell him

33
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,890
you do not say

34
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,226
He groans in pain every night

35
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,729
How can I make things difficult for him?

36
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,315
Tsk! Do you think you are so virtuous?

37
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,652
It is said that as long as a man truly loves his wife

38
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,738
Even if I hate her family, I won't leave.

39
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,907
Same here

40
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,949
You damn...

41
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:22,869
You deserve it.

42
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,373
Your daughter-in-law is better than my daughter-in-law

43
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,336
She is really annoying. Should I teach her a lesson?

44
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,923
Hey! Why did you hit Grandpa Shi's nose?

45
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,633
Why? Hey!

46
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,260
Why did you hit it on the nose?

47
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:41,888
sorry

48
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,473
Stop right there!

49
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,437
(Yeon Soon Nam Yeon Soon Bong)

50
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,232
Even the government says having only one child is patriotic

51
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,359
They keep talking about wanting a son.

52
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,819
What's the point of raising it?

53
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,906
What did they gain after raising Kuanzhi?

54
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,242
Cooking porridge for dogs is a thankless task

55
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,453
Why does she keep throwing red beans at me?

56
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,290
So what if my mother's spirit possesses me?

57
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,336
My mom wanted me to see what was wrong with me?

58
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,026
I can't come to your house anymore.

59
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,530
It's so unfair

60
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,701
Now that I'm a mother, I miss you even more

61
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,580
I miss you more

62
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,593
I guess it'll be sad for you not to be here anymore.

63
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,073
You can bring her here any way you want, but we won't allow it.

64
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,991
We don't accept new people.

65
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,744
Why do you keep bringing her here? She's so young.

66
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,789
Ama women start diving when they are six or seven years old.

67
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,999
Who on earth starts diving at the age of six or seven?

68
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,668
They were just playing in the shallow water picking up seaweed

69
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,670
Yes, that's what I mean.

70
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,799
I heard that that side is reserved for beginners

71
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,176
She has to play with water first before she can be afraid of it

72
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,594
Is she your girl?

73
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,473
I really don't want to talk to her at all

74
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,851
Does Aichun know? Did she agree?

75
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,563
Why do I need her approval? She's my boss or something!

76
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,650
Whether it is a man or a horse, they have to rely on their own skills to survive.

77
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,570
So we want her to learn a skill, why are you stopping us?

78
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,863
Listen to Muchuan

79
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:51,119
Every day before we go into the water we pray to come out alive

80
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,414
Guangli used to say to Aichun every day:

81
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,165
"Don't go in the water"

82
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,792
“Don’t even learn how to dive”

83
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,711
Guangli doesn't want her to do this job.

84
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,880
Why would you want your granddaughter to do this?

85
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,715
Is Jinming going to support your family?

86
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,551
That's enough! Just let her get in the water!

87
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,220
You haenyeo just love to meddle in other people's business!

88
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,181
Oh my god!

89
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,145
Give it to me! Oh my god!

90
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,606
Let’s go!

91
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,275
Let's go

92
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,526
Really!

93
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,905
Whatever you like!

94
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,037
Who can I blame for being born to be a nanny?

95
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,206
We still have two weeks until we move out.

96
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,542
Why are you helping the kids clean up?

97
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,169
Don't they have hands?

98
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,047
How can you handle this without the help of these brats?

99
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,091
They're not brats.

100
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,719
I have a temper too.

101
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,513
And my in-laws... isn't it?

102
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,267
I know they have a relative who is a high-ranking official in Jeju Provincial Office.

103
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,521
How many times have you told me that my husband's family has connections?

104
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,650
But can their influence extend all the way to the peninsula?

105
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,528
I'll take care of those kids.

106
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,991
Don't be too harsh on Soonnam and Soonbong and let them eat their fill

107
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,495
What if I'm going to be violent towards them?

108
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,208
I also want to be tough with them occasionally, but it's really not easy

109
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,961
They call me "Mom" and hug me, how can I be fierce?

110
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,672
The children who have been raised at home for ten years

111
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,634
Whether they are my biological children or not, they are all my children.

112
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,596
How can blood relationship be as important as feelings?

113
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,850
Are you kidding me? How come you can't do anything right?

114
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,604
Give me

115
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,160
You must have a lot to vent about.

116
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,539
But no one can tell

117
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,165
Call me

118
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,086
You can complain to me about the old lady throwing beans

119
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,754
I am a good listener

120
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,425
Our relationship is ridiculous, isn't it?

121
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,445
To put it bluntly, I'm not a lover or an affair.

122
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,991
Your mother died ten years ago before I was with him

123
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,742
We don't need to be hostile to each other.

124
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,245
But we are so different

125
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,832
So you stole my yellow skirt and ran away in the middle of the night?

126
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,418
So different

127
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,048
I admire you

128
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,514
Because I became a member of this family

129
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,600
So I really admire you

130
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,893
You weren't born to be a babysitter.

131
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,104
You have a heart to care for others.

132
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,523
so

133
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,734
Just let it be

134
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,529
People say good things are rewarded.

135
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,831
Then I'll leave it to you...

136
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,251
What?

137
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,170
Please…

138
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,547
Please…

139
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:33,883
What?

140
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,428
Please take care of them.

141
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,139
My brother and sister

142
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,685
Let them finish the book

143
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,647
Don't worry about my kids.

144
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,362
I'm not like someone who only buys four popsicles

145
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,031
When I bring corn, I always bring five

146
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,120
I give you this tricycle as a popsicle

147
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,247
Just take this tricycle

148
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,542
As a moral scholarship

149
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,421
I'll give it to Jin Ming.

150
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,467
Who would use an old tricycle as a scholarship?

151
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,892
You've done so much for this family and you just steal a tricycle and go away?

152
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,770
What does "steal" mean?

153
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,230
You told me to take it!

154
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,487
One well-educated daughter is worth ten sons

155
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,202
Korean Family Planning Association

156
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,123
Oh my god!

157
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,961
She sent them corn again today.

158
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,880
Today I counted how many roots there are.

159
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:59,677
We don't have enough food at home, but a thief still appeared.

160
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,263
If her family is respectable, they should send us something.

161
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,932
Instead of taking everything from us

162
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,560
To those who are not relatives

163
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,894
There's a tilefish in there.

164
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,272
Any tilefish?

165
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,608
Think of it as me trading tilefish for corn

166
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,611
You only care about your wife, right?

167
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:22,450
My only son is on his side with his wife, who will stand by me?

168
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,285
Dad should be towards you

169
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,455
What?

170
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,041
Can't I even look at my husband?

171
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,919
I might as well get a dog.

172
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,340
Hey you stole the corn from the pot again!

173
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,509
Aichun, are you a refugee?

174
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,138
I gave them five ears of corn and got back so much.

175
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,725
Look

176
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,820
Is it true?

177
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,292
Why did you bring this tattered dress back? Do you want to wear it back to Busan?

178
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,711
Throw some red beans on it

179
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,382
Some of their old clothes are almost new

180
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,845
To be honest, she could have left the tricycle to her children.

181
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,765
But she chose to give it to Jin Ming

182
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,103
Throw away the tricycle. Girls shouldn't ride tricycles.

183
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,941
If my husband were still alive he'd hit you over the head with his pipe

184
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,902
We traded it with the rag collector for candy

185
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,200
Jinming, did you go to the beach again today?

186
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,701
Jinming, let's go to bed.

187
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,704
You guys went to bed so early?

188
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,334
Go to bed early

189
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,090
Good night

190
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,385
Good night and have a good sleep

191
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,512
That way it won't be so annoying.

(GED Certificate Name: Wu Aichun)

195
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,905
Where have you been?

196
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,078
I just like red beans too much

197
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,591
Do you find it hard?

198
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,927
Should I just shut up?

199
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,970
If you, young master, say something

200
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,889
They don't just hate me.

201
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,807
I'll still want to kill me

202
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,643
So what should I do?

203
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,029
Let me do something. You can do whatever you want.

204
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,952
Three-wheeler

205
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,622
Let Jinming ride a tricycle

206
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,458
I want her to ride anyway.

207
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,003
anyway?

208
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,463
If you can't even ride this

209
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,674
She'll be confined to the kitchen for the rest of her life.

210
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,053
I want her to have it all

211
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,639
I want her to do whatever she wants.

212
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,849
Having everything she wants

213
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,812
I don't want her to be the one clearing the table.

214
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,272
But to be the one who can flip the table

215
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,819
You also flip it

216
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,239
You overturned the rest and I'll clean up the rest

217
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,869
Don't make me cry anymore

218
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,834
You can flip over or smash the table before you say "Ready to go"

219
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,003
Then I'll support you.

220
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,213
I know what to do in my position

221
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,048
Didn't I steal their fish for you?

222
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,299
I am an unfilial son...

223
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,177
What? Get ready

224
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,182
I said: "Do it"

Please bless her with a son.

226
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,629
Please pray that she will give birth to a boy.

227
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,718
Please give her a son, please.

228
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,261
Please

229
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:35,763
Get down

230
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,640
You'd better not tell Kuanzhi

231
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,727
The first thing I do every morning is throw red beans at you

232
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,521
A woman who talks too much is good for nothing

233
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,237
A lazy and talkative woman will have bad luck.

234
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,994
Be careful!

235
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,581
How many times have I told you not to mix beans in there!

236
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,083
I can't believe it

237
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,125

I bought a new one for 2,000 won

243

If you want to exchange it for 2000 won of candy, it's up to you.

244
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,532
Are you laughing?

245
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,743
Peas I want peas

246
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,246
Peas, peas are coming

247
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,707
Peas I want peas

248
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,461
Where are the peas? Where did they go?

249
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,148
Why do I have to eat at this table from today?

250
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,776
Why? You bastard!

251
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,237
I also

252
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,573
I want to have dinner with you, mom.

253
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,911
Dogs are better than you.

254
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,247
Peas I want to eat peas

If you can't even ride this

262
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,217
She'll be confined to the kitchen for the rest of her life.

I want her to do whatever she wants.

265

Having everything she wants

266
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,244
Oh my god

267
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,915
Are you a centipede?

268
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,048
Oh my god, these shoes are endless.

269
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,970
When will she finish wearing all of this?

270
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,683
Are you going to open a shoe store?

271
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,769
Then live with your mother.

272
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,022
Live with your mother and the plants at home

273
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,329
Your parents must have worked very hard to send you to school

274
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,707
That's just a little money

275
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,337
They must be very happy that you are dating Yingfan

276
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,463
That's right

277
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,925
They are very happy, aren't they?

278
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,095
How can I not be happy?

279
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,890
So you just found a job?

280
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,600
Yes

281
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:56,481
In fact, I often hear good news at work.

282
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,109
I'm said to be getting a promotion soon.

283
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,736
Do you want to continue working?

284
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,070
What?

285
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,905
Should you continue working after getting married?

286
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,574
Well…

287
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,451
us…

288
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,747
I mean Yingfan and I discussed this.

289
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,748
Don't you think

290
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,461
Could excessive greed be caused by some kind of inner emptiness?

291
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,714
That feeling of emptiness will lead to vanity

292
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,467
Nouveau riche always like to show off to others

293
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:24,968
See those poor girls

294
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,347
Marrying into a wealthy family and starting to wear luxury goods always makes people want to laugh

295
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,727
What? Did I offend you again?

296
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,106
Then I'll just say it straight

297
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,610
You would rather be the deputy minister's daughter-in-law

298
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,362
Or promoted to manager?

299
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,366
Yingfan is our eldest son and he is very talented.

300
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,159
That his wife

301
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:53,080
Why should I go out to work instead of being a good wife and supporting him?

302
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,664
Think about it from my perspective.

303
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,625
Won't you be angry?

304
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,379
The problem is…

305
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,174
I never want Jinming to feel inferior to others anywhere.

306
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,306
I am as capable as Yingfan.

307
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,684
I am also the eldest in the family.

308
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,729
I want to support my family with my own money.

309
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,773
besides…

310
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,984
I feel very empty

311
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,696
So just finding a job is not enough for me

312
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,992
I have many plans to become a manager, supervisor or even CEO

313
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,622
There's nothing to be ashamed of, right?

314
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,917
you're right

315
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,211
They say

316
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:47,968
The appearance is determined by the heart, so the plants you raise at home will not grow crooked

317
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,392
You are not...

318
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,396
Houseplants?

319
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,616
What can I do?

320
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,120
I'm not pretty and I'm a twisted eldest daughter

321
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,748
I've had enough, okay?

322
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,752
It's not that I have to be with you, nor do I have to get married.

323
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:42,898
What a shame

324
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,819
There are more shoes here than I have ever worn in my life.

325
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,656
Is this how you spend your salary?

326
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,160
I didn't ask you to clean the room. Why do you always have to do it in such a cold day...

327
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,870
All cheap stuff

328
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,956
Even decent shoes are not even good enough.

329
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,005
Why are you so obsessed with shoes?

330
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:12,886
It's all vanity and a waste of money

331
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,058
I heard that vanity comes from emptiness

332
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,227
What did you say?

333
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,811
Maybe that's why I bought so much

334
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,023
Because I have been poor since childhood.

335
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,323
Maybe I'm greedy.

336
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,743
When going on a spring outing

337
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,956
I begged you for three days before you bought me new clothes

338
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,334
I want a lot of things but I don't have the money

339
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,088
Something I've longed for since I was a kid.

340
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,132
So now I won't hold back.

341
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,177
Even if it's just some cheap shoes

342
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,304
But I'm gonna buy it

343
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,436
I didn't buy myself what I wanted.

344
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,648
Don't buy you what you want

345
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,485
What we have been buying for you within our ability is

346
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,903
The best food and clothes

347
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,073
Is poverty something to be proud of? Is being pitiful something to be praised?

348
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,874
Is there something wrong?

349
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,501
Is it about work?

350
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,169
Damn

351
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,380
Has anyone bullied you?

352
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,340
What's the point of telling you?

353
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,510
If you are tired, take a break

354
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,095
If possible, please take a leave.

355
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:40,390
Try going to work in a company and see that no matter how difficult the situation is, people cannot rest.

356
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,642
If it's so difficult, just quit your job and get married.

357
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,311
What?

358
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,895
Do you want me to live like you?

359
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,356
Marry into another poor family to barely make ends meet

360
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,566
A lifetime...

361
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,779
Broke my mother's heart

362
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,658
It also breaks my heart

363
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,202
you're right

364
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,539
You're right, don't live my life.

365
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,084
But did you know…

366
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,840
I found my happiness

367
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,428
There is sunshine in my life

368
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,515
I've had many perfect moments.

369
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:33,068
I just want you to admit that my life has value.

370
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,076
That's weird.

371
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,621
I bought the whole box.

372
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,705
good

373
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,501
Parents always think about what they can't give

374
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,380
Children always think about what they didn't get.

375
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,301
Aichun, come out and worship

376
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,178
Who? Me?

377
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,014
So I never knew

378
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,226
My poor childhood

379
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,480
I may be a shaman, but a mother's blessing is unmatched

380
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,109
Nothing can surpass the love a mother has for her child.

381
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,653
...even that humble childhood

382
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,865
Just because they built a strong fortress

383
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:25,495
There is no better livelihood than the Haenyeo in Jeju Island

384
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,874
If there is such a person in the family, he is the pillar of the family.

385
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:34,045
She can earn enough money on her own without asking for help from others

386
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:38,216
As the eldest daughter, she can fulfill her responsibility to support the family.

387
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,356
You can't expect a girl to be president

388
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,400
Not to mention judges or lawyers.

389
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,987
There is no better job than being a female ama

390
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,075
you!

391
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,035
What are you doing?

392
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,495
Oh my god, this girl...

393
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,122
How... How dare you do this?

394
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,707
She is my daughter!

395
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,335
She is my daughter not the breadwinner!

396
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,297
My daughter won't be a haenyeo

397
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,466
I won't agree to that!

398
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,718
you…

399
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,138
Are you crazy? Where are you taking her?

400
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,768
My mom died young from breathing problems caused by diving

401
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:34,230
Before she died she told me not to scuba dive or babysit

402
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:39,736
But even if I live like a nanny, it doesn't represent my daughter...

403
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,987
What? "Babysitter"?

404
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,990
Is this how you describe caring for your parents-in-law and ancestors?

405
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,411
I won't let her live like me and my mother.

406
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,830
My daughter won't.

407
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,876
You can go if you want, but don't take the girl from the Liang family with you!

408
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,419
She's my daughter! Mine!

409
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,798
If you want a haenyeo so badly, let your daughter go instead of mine!

410
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,969
Hey she's crazy

411
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,680
How dare you glare at me and yell at me!

412
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,641
"Just let your daughter go"?

413
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,726
Holy King Dragon King

414
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,687
Please bless us

415
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,317
"Just let your daughter go"?

416
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,695
How dare you talk nonsense like that!

417
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,783
I'll tell you! Her mother's spirit is in her.

418
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,995
She'll go crazy if her spirit possesses her!

419
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,706
It's so obvious! How could it not be?

420
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,417
It's obvious she didn't have any good role models growing up!

421
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,755
Growing up in a messed up family and being raised by low-class people

422
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,924
How dare you be so bold in such a good family!

423
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,926
Please bless us

424
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,010
Feed Kuanzhi

425
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,557
Did you see what she did? She said Jinming is not my granddaughter

426
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,976
She disrespects her ancestors.

427
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,479
She glared at me and kept yelling at me!

428
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,731
Stop talking, send her away

429
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:03,486
Driving her away is the only way to make the ancestors accept it!

430
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,697
Grandma, are you sprinkling red beans on her?

431
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,534
Get her out of here!

432
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,161
I've never hit her before.

433
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,206
Oh my god this is unbelievable

434
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,418
I feel like I can't breathe

435
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,338
Oh my god, you're going to piss her off!

436
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,298
Oh my god

437
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,674
Mom and grandma

438
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,344
Aichun is here to live with me, not to be your daughter-in-law.

439
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,096
What?

440
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,055
you

441
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,516
I will never see Aichun again.

442
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,644
I won't let her live here.

443
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,443
How could he do this?

444
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,571
Get her out of here!

445
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,455
So why don't you wear it?

446
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,124
They seem to be tailor-made for you.

447
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,879
It really fits

448
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,675
You should marry a rich man.

449
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,387
This way you can always wear your favorite floral fabric

450
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,515
Honestly, you regret it a bit, right?

451
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,019
If I could go back in time

452
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,855
Marry your dad again...

453
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,440
Of course you won't

454
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,108
I will

455
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:27,820
I would marry him again

456
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,490
Jin Ming

457
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:32,951
What's this?

458
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,744
Oh my god

459
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,414
Didn't I tell you not to buy two bags?

460
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,000
It's not like she can't buy her own peas

461
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,586
How much? They ripped you off again, didn't they?

462
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,296
I also brought a whistle.

463
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,341
No! The world outside is dangerous

464
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,426
Look at these pretty ones, right?

465
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,386
Looks good

466
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,681
Fits well and looks good

467
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,226
(Dodongli Grocery Store)

468
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,812
(One room and one kitchen monthly rent without deposit)

469
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,127
(Korean alphabet)

470
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,967
Jinming, do you want to eat peas?

471
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,093
I want to eat peas

472
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,098
Once again, it's a pea! It's a pea!

473
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,058
For good children

474
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,227
One more time

475
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,396
Do you want to eat peas? I want to eat peas

476
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,313
well done!

477
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,859
Squid Squid?

478
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,610
Do you want to eat squid?

479
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,778
squid!

480
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,075
squid

481
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,286
Is Good Boy delicious?

482
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,749
landlord!

483
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,261
It's okay, those abalones were given to me by the aunts.

484
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,389
Do you think he's asking why we're eating abalone when we can't pay the rent?

485
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,312
Here we come!

486
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,942
that

487
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,653
I'm looking for a new fishing job

488
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:38,242
Can I pay the rent at the end of the month?

489
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,244
How about paying in the fall?

490
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,790
No, we don't want to default on our debt.

491
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,502
I'll show you around the store...

492
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:52,256
Didn't you know that someone came during the day and paid three months' rent?

493
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,051
Excuse me? Who?

494
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,345
Has anyone paid three months' rent?

495
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,807
Is there anyone with the last name Dao in your family?

496
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,851
Do we have any relatives with the last name Dao?

497
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,395
The man surnamed Dao paid the rent

498
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,856
If you can pay the rent on time

499
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,234
I will also give you pork

(Dode Scholarship Amount: 10,000 KRW)

501
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,255
Why are you staring at me?

502
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:33,965
who is she?

503
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,843
What? Who is Daode?

504
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,929
I've been with you since you were ten years old

505
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,472
Please, Isode?

506
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,561
You're right. No one has ever had a crush on you.

507
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,146
How can you be so sure?

508
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,857
I don't know anyone with the last name Dao

509
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,774
(Island Germany)

510
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,278
Isn't that your grandma?

511
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,447
My grandmother's name is Jin Chunyu

512
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,199
My aunt's name is Hyun Yi-suk

513
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,368
Besides, my grandma has no money.

514
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,124
My grandmother's name is Park Muchuan and my mother is Quan Guiyu

515
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,418
Maybe my mom

516
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:16,090
Maybe my mother is possessed by a rich woman

517
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,301
I stole her bankbook and then...

518
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,291
how…

519
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,584
That’s too much!

520
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,631
Are they really going too far?

521
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:01,510
The landlord said loudly: "They get busy at nine o'clock"

522
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,806
It seems like the kids are working hard, right?

523
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,644
I'm working hard even when I turn off the lights at night.

524
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,813
How can the Three Gods not bless you?

525
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,816
Look, after I left my husband's house, the child came.

526
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,153
Relax your body and mind to get pregnant

527
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,281
It is said that her mother-in-law tortured her all day long and her husband came home

528
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:26,410
She doesn't want to talk to her mother-in-law's son, let alone do that.

529
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,206
Who wants to do that with my mother-in-law's son? It's immoral.

530
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,294
Working hard is one thing, but being awesome is...

531
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,839
Anyway, Jinming is a good daughter

532
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,967
Look at this little room.

533
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,678
Oh my god

534
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,472
If you make up your mind

535
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,308
Six children can live in one room

536
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,935
Oh my god

537
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,730
She looks exactly like Guangli now, right?

538
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,608
The literary girl has become bolder

539
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,320
If you lived close we could see you more often like a meeting

540
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,740
The rent is cheap but why move so far?

541
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,783
Let her be

542
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,911
If we lived nearby, my mother-in-law would come often.

543
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,872
But it's easier to make a living if you know more people

544
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,958
The islanders are not very friendly to outsiders.

545
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,214
How is the fishing life of Wei Kuan Zhi going?

546
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,508
You know he's very hardworking.

547
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,554
Didn't he tell you exactly what he did?

548
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,222
You big mouth!

549
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,099
She has a right to know

550
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,643
What's wrong? What are you doing?

551
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,023
Do you know who Kuan Shik works for?

552
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,694
Oh my god, what happened to his hand?

553
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,073
No!

554
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,663
What's going on?

555
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,666
What happened to your hand? It's okay.

556
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,503
If you are injured, you should come here immediately.

557
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,423
If you delay it for too long, your fingers will grow crooked.

558
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,219
Are you a fool? Can't you speak?

559
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,222
If they are injured, you should let them return to shore.

560
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,849
What's the big deal about fishing?

561
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,060
Do you have to pull the net until your fingers are broken?

562
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,648
You said nothing!

563
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,946
Life itself is not evil, it is money that is evil

564
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:30,242
If you don't rent the land from the landlord, you won't have anything to grow.

565
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:34,413
You can't fish in Dodong without his boat.

566
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,416
But how could he get on that ship?

567
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,335
Don't act like you know everything.

568
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,963
He is young but he is trying to be the head of the family

569
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,215
Honey!

570
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:31,679
Honey

571
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,475
Can't you hear me?

572
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,561
Help me move the table

573
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,775
You fell asleep again and didn't eat.

574
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,622
Dad is a baby who sleeps all day

575
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,624
Honey

576
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:03,919
Oh my god

577
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,464
Very hot

578
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,049
You should change your clothes, okay?

579
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,099
You always sleep in long sleeves

580
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,186
Anchovies

581
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,523
Fresh anchovies for sale

582
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,027
Anchovies

583
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,946
Fresh anchovies for sale

584
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,699
Anchovies

585
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,995
Anchovies for sale

586
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,096
Are you going to work on that squid boat?

587
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,516
People need to sleep well before they can work.

588
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,268
Daddy brought us a hundred squids

589
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,396
Dad doesn't need to bring back the squid.

590
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,485
I'll bring you lots of squid.

591
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:08,919
Honey!

592
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,468
Catch lots of fish!

593
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,929
Catch lots of squid!

594
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,444
Go ahead.

595
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,264
Looks delicious

596
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,685
(Creamer instant coffee)

597
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:07,853
(sugar)

598
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,736
You can only get four for free

599
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,202
I'll just buy another can of candy.

600
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,455
hateful!

601
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,041
Death! How could I die?

602
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,752
hateful!

603
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,879
How dare you mess with my brother?

604
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,964
hateful!

605
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,217
Do you really want to fight me?

606
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,264
I couldn't come to help you move or pickle your hinch

607
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,767
I didn't have time to say hello so...

608
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,771
Is his finger okay?

609
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,314
Is it growing well?

610
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,650
OK

611
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,985
He is undergoing acupuncture treatment.

612
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,322
I scolded my husband.

613
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,283
If anyone is injured, we should turn back to shore.

614
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,411
It's like squids are more important than people.

615
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,540
Master Jin and Master Park also asked him to turn back.

616
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,667
Their network was full that day.

617
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,087
So my husband is probably a little greedy.

618
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,592
But Master Liang is really different

619
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,637
How can you stay on the boat all night with your fingers like that?

620
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,683
If it were me, I would have rolled on the ground in pain

621
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,601
captain

622
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,187
Didn't they turn the ship around?

623
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,689
What?

624
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,650
He didn't turn the boat around?

625
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,614
My husband still can't open his hands completely

626
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,162
He groans in pain every night

627
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,372
Please don't worry

628
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:54,543
I told my husband many times not to hit Master Liang.

629
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,129
He said he really didn't beat him anymore.

630
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,550
I don't understand why he is so mean only to Master Liang

631
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,930
My husband is a bit irritable.

632
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,557
But he's not a bad guy.

633
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,641
hateful!

634
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,938
You dare to go against me? I'll teach you a lesson!

635
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:18,650
hateful!

636
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,738
hateful!

637
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,532
hateful!

638
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,243
Dare to go against me?

639
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,581
Why do you always leave so early? Who do you think you are?

640
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,459
He has a baby at home.

641
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,130
You always bring a lunch box with you. What's in it?

642
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,758
Going away, you bastard!

643
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:49,973
You drive today.

644
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,393
Come on, Captain, are you secretly in love with Guan Zhi?

645
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,979
Why do you always stop him every time he wants to leave?

646
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,398
I want a case of wine.

647
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,359
You're on standby to drive me home

648
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:03,070
But Captain, you live nearby.

649
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:03,987
Listen carefully!

650
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:09,326
No one is allowed to disembark until the captain does!

651
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,621
Catering to the Captain's needs is part of the job!

652
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:13,622
Do you understand?

653
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,415
Did you know?

654
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,003
Okay, let's get to work.

655
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,465
Let's start working

656
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,136
Wouldn't you like to?

657
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,142
Dare to go against me? If you don't want to do it, just say so.

658
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,937
You can buy yourself a boat.

659
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,397
What?

660
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,150
Why don't you say "Shut up, uncle" anymore?

661
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,662
But it's not right, ma'am.

662
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,583
Life is cruel

663
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,418
But I believe

664
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,170
Wrong is wrong

665
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,841
Come on, if you don't want to do it, just say so.

666
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,801
You can't tell?

667
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,138
Because you don't have a boat?

668
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,557
All right

669
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,773
You're right, I don't want to do it anymore

670
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,027
I can't lie

671
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,573
Hello!

672
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:37,789
but…

673
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,344
Is there a baby at home?

674
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,261
Answer me!

675
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,725
Why did you take my squid?

676
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,895
You can't take anything without my permission.

677
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,438
Do you have a boat?

678
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,192
You can only take it if I let you take it, and you can only stay if I let you stay.

679
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,693
Why do you keep running away?

680
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,820
Do you like your wife so much?

681
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,739
What's so great about her?

682
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,075
Come on, tell me

683
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,952
Do you like her very much?

684
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,871
Do you do that every night?

685
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,540
Do you love her that much?

686
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,292
Yes!

687
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,086
I love her so much

688
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:26,713
What?

689
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,885
You two are trash.

690
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,972
What the hell do you know, little bastard?

691
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,182
Damn it! I should...

692
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,227
Captain, why don't you want to go home?

693
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,354
What are you talking about asshole? Why?

694
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,606
Is it lonely at home?

695
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,567
No one respects you there?

696
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,821
hateful!

697
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,036
Damn

698
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,125
Son of a bitch

699
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,510
You bastards need to be beaten to learn your lesson.

700
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,761
How do you talk to me?

701
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:19,975
You son of a bitch!

702
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,101
Son of a bitch!

703
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,777
Son of a bitch!

704
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:40,704
Hey, son of a bitch!

705
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,456
Son of a bitch!

706
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,668
Dad often says

707
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,423
More like a whistle than a Cosmos mother

708
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,101
My husband

709
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,188
I won't work for you anymore.

710
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,107
He won't work for you anymore!

711
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,363
Okay, stop doing it. Then stop doing it.

712
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,116
You know my brother is the president of the fishery cooperative, right?

713
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,786
Don't even think about getting on any boat in Dodong-ri!

714
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,955
I almost stepped in shit "son of a bitch"?

715
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,292
Damn it! You stinky boy!

716
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,420
Isn't it true that people from the same family don't enter the same door?

717
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,140
“Only when you are beaten can you learn a lesson”?

718
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,142
You little...

719
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,644
You fucking...

720
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:46,561
you!

721
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,606
Could you please sober up first?

722
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,443
See who's the real shit!

723
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,569
hateful!

724
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,073
you!

725
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,618
hateful!

726
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:07,082
We should change the name of the bastard to "Dodongri son of a bitch"

727
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,001
"Son of a bitch!"

728
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,630
Oh my god

729
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,674
it hurts

730
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,973
You're such a whistle

731
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,183
Human Whistle

732
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,565
You kicked him, why are you crying?

733
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,375
Selling rice cakes!

734
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,919
Selling buckwheat jelly!

735
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,797
It's good that her family has a boiler that doesn't burn coal.

736
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,842
Are there any vents?

737
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,345
I heard you said to Jin Ming

738
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,515
If you could do it again, would you still marry me?

739
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,643
Mom always says...

740
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,604
Still getting married?

741
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,105
Why would I do this?

742
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:13,899
I'm so tired.

743
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,944
...of all people she pitied most was her father

744
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,447
Steel also wears out, right?

745
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,616
How did your body break down so quickly?

746
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,700
I'm so scared

747
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,328
Oh my god

748
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,835
You've been carrying the burden since you were ten years old

749
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,754
No wonder I'm so tired.

750
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:39,341
Don't worry I will outlive you

751
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,178
Why? Do you want to marry a new wife after I die?

752
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,021
Do you want to marry a new wife?

753
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,607
How could I leave you behind?

754
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,984
I think

755
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,196
It's better to send you away first

756
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,823
Then I'll follow you.

757
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:59,791
("The same sky, the same stars, the same heart")

758
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:09,300
