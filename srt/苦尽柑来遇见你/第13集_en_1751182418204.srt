《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,789
Hello

3
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,334
Wow you are beautiful

4
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,919
Can you help me? Oh my god.

5
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,128
Really good

6
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,797
- Help me
- good

7
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,431
Here it comes

00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,516
(Yalashan Film Club)

9
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,476
one two three

10
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,231
I'll take another photo

11
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,108
Smile

12
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,610
one two three!

13
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,657
What does I can't go mean?

14
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,534
tonight

15
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,160
It's our last night.

16
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,789
Your last night before enlistment!

17
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,585
I really want to...

18
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,045
Do you want to die?

19
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,157
Hey who knows what will happen?

20
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,618
People say you don’t know until you walk on the red carpet

21
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,831
Wait till you see me in a wedding dress

22
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,791
Here we come!

23
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,042
So beautiful

24
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,218
I should cover this up.

25
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,806
I did what I said

26
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,434
Oh? Hey over here.

27
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,351
Hey!

28
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,939
We don’t know who we will meet again or for the first time.

29
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:10,940
Rapid heartbeat

30
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,986
Oh my god!

31
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,948
I didn't break it on purpose.

32
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,536
…my feet feel like they are floating

33
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,001
Episode title: Such Unequal Love

34
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,218
Another life entered my mother's world

35
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,430
A chubby little guy

36
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,517
(Happy 10th birthday
(Presented by Lian Bingzhe and Luo Minyu)

37
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,912
Even though two generations

38
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,206
He is a strange being

39
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,085
But inexplicably lovable

40
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,588
No matter how cute your grandchildren are, don't take care of them.

41
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,800
I only feel cute when I see you once in a while

42
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,512
Don't be a parent to others until Jin Ming gets married.

43
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,305
Carefree and soaring into the sky

44
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,019
Everyone says the child's eyes look like mine
But the mouth is like fuck...

45
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,479
The chin

46
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,778
Where are your family members? Aren't they coming?

47
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,489
That you know...

48
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,616
I wouldn't want an unemployed son-in-law.

49
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,329
What about your brothers?

50
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,915
They just said

51
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,209
Roll as far as you can

52
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,796
- Walk
- What?

53
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,507
How far to go

54
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,054
- How far?
- How far to go!

55
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,057
How far to go

56
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
This one has 19 grams.

57
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,568
Oh my god, they're on the phone.
I mentioned "19 grams" dozens of times.

58
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,486
They said before that I could use this to go to college

59
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:25,283
Oh my god, that stingy old man
Hasn't he heard of inflation?

60
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,619
He should pay the market price for college tuition
They have money anyway, don't they?

61
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,206
He makes money by selling rice cakes.
Did you buy this for us?

62
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,249
right

63
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,126
The one he showed off was a Mercedes, right?

64
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,087
Of course, everyone eats rice cakes.

65
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,511
- But this job isn't cool enough
- "cool"?

66
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,974
Let's go

67
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,021
(Liang Jae-il’s first birthday)

68
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,607
Is this appropriate for you now?

69
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,278
I'd do anything for him.

70
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,655
You always mess around on my birthday

71
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,075
- At that time, we could only...
- I understand

72
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,451
Only my birthday was miserable

73
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,538
How are you going to support your family now?
Do you plan to live with us forever?

74
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,957
- I'm working on a business plan.
- Business?

75
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,459
With Zhelong?

76
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,294
I told you not to open a pawn shop

77
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,129
Life is just waiting for an opportunity...

78
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,632
I should beat the shit out of you.

79
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,760
Others become mature when they have a family.
Why are you still chasing after nothingness...

80
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,011
I don't need your help

81
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,138
Do I expect too much from you?

82
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,391
Let’s get up early first!

83
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,434
Go find some work at the docks or something.

84
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,561
- Go get a job!
- Seriously

85
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,564
Do you want me to live like you?

86
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,358
Do you really want that?

87
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,276
dad!

88
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,488
You have to turn the tap on completely.
To fill the bucket

89
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,450
Patching up life will never achieve anything great

90
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,368
You also understand this principle

91
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,579
Don't just count on Jin Ming.
Just wait and see what I can do!

92
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,750
I'm not the type to go out to eat.
The dad who only ordered three servings of meat

93
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,920
I want to be the dad who orders five or six servings of meat.

94
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,069
Why did you do this to your dad?

95
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,365
As people get older, their hearts become softer.
Even a heart of steel will bear scars

96
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,704
Na Jinming's mother
Can comfort Jinming's father

97
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,621
Oh my god

98
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,916
Why are you becoming more and more difficult?

99
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,003
To be honest, you should be grateful that I have become more mature.

100
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,713
How sensible a child is depends on how much you trust him

101
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,466
Jinming is sensible because you trust her completely

102
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,968
You always doubt me, so I'm only this tall.

103
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,595
You little bastard!

104
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,806
Can you hug him? My arms hurt.

105
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,516
Oh my god

106
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,521
Give me Zaiyi and you two go in.
Give him to me quickly.

107
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,692
Honey, come here.

108
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,235
Oh my god

109
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,672
I never thought my daughter would be like this.

110
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,552
I feel betrayed
It feels like the whole world is falling apart

111
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,262
I really can't tell

112
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,141
How sorry I am and...

113
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,602
Oh my god, if you get pregnant first and then get married

114
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,189
Not even a brass ring
Not to mention gold.

115
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,484
I didn't even have a wedding.

116
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,029
She will never wear a wedding dress.

117
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:55,660
Yinming may still be trying to figure it out

118
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,537
But as a human being...

119
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,665
I have no problem with Yinming

120
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,084
How to say it?

121
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,379
They say sons resemble their fathers.

122
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,300
I have always envied your life more than anyone else.

123
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,471
You are the wife of a rich man.

124
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,307
At the children's sports meeting

125
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,562
I was alone with three children in the hot sun

126
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:27,483
Then I saw your husband
Fan you to cool you down

127
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,780
You are always good at observing these things.

128
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:34,949
I cried.

129
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,745
I want to know how you are so lucky.
Being treated so kindly

130
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,084
What did I do to step on such a pile of shit?

131
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,130
that

132
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,882
Is Xianshu okay?

133
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,052
She can't do anything

134
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,972
If she doesn't, you scold her.

135
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,349
Scold her till she cries

136
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,810
I won't scold her.

137
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,812
I won't scold her until she cries.

138
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,524
I won't give Hyun-suk a brass ring

139
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,234
Okay?

140
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,615
If you want to see your eldest grandson or Xianshu

141
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,952
You can come visit them anytime.

142
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,329
Or call me out

143
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,791
The children are ours
So let's face it together, okay?

144
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,048
Oh my god, how does he look?
Exactly like my daughter?

145
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,427
Oh my god

146
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,057
It seems that you can't beat your daughter.

147
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,270
My mother once wrote a poem...

148
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,565
It's called My Damn Child.

149
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,483
(My damn child)

150
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,651
What's the big deal?

151
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,027
Oh my god!

152
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,780
You little bastard!

153
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,909
Is she going to defend her country or to explore the business world?

154
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,079
Pull it down and give it to me

155
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,581
Why would anyone buy a bottle of Chivas?
A first birthday gift for your child?

156
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,375
Zhelong must be crazy

157
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,960
Because you and dad look down on me

158
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,546
Jin Ming celebrated her only nephew's first birthday like this

159
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:18,052
Your sister isn't having a good time either.
Her company is in bad shape.

160
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,139
She works in a big company and acts superior.

161
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,601
But who is taking care of you and dad?
Who takes care of you when you are sick?

162
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,396
You talk as if you can take care of people!

163
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,108
Take care of yourself first

164
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,404
Don't be too hard on him. Even if a tree grows crooked, it can still provide shade.

165
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,782
Rumors are even more shocking when they come true

166
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,866
(Kia Corporation is in substantial bankruptcy)

167
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,411
This could have far-reaching consequences for our economy

168
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,745
By Kwon Jae-hong

169
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,373
Kia's main banking partners this afternoon
Korea First Bank

170
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,708
(18 Kia subsidiaries initiate bankruptcy protection)

171
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,920
Announced at a press conference
18 of Kia Group’s 28 subsidiaries…

172
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,880
This is a harvest season

173
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,632
Whether it is the Golden Toad...

174
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,845
Post-dated cheque

175
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,145
- Stop layoffs immediately!
- Stop layoffs!

176
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:55,107
- We're not leaving like this!
- We won't!

177
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,568
- Stop layoffs immediately!
- Stop layoffs!

178
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,819
(Stop layoffs!)

179
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,696
- We're not leaving like this!
- We won't!

180
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,655
(We can't stand it any longer)

181
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,117
The Asian financial crisis is destroying businesses

182
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,745
Causing widespread unemployment

183
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,996
(Assistant Manager of Overseas Business Department)

184
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,334
A particularly unforgettable winter is coming

185
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,419
34th largest company: Danong Group

186
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,589
In addition to Meduba
They have essentially dissolved

187
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,635
Among the four subsidiaries protected
Only Meduba is resurrected

188
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,887
Danong Limited goes into receivership

189
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,889
Danong Heavy Industry and Metro Products...

190
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,600
Everyone can get approved! 100% approval for credit cards!

191
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,311
Shuanglong Development Company applied for settlement yesterday

192
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,354
(Use credit cards to get through this difficult time!)

193
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,688
Declared bankrupt

194
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,565
Thai-Japanese Group in financial trouble

195
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,027
Designated for bankruptcy protection today

196
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,156
Debts of Tairi and its subsidiaries
Total 970 billion won

197
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,992
Chohung Bank and other bond holders
The meeting will be held on the 24th...

198
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,245
Stocks plunge again, KOSPI index falls…

199
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,705
First of all, thank you for giving me a chance during this difficult time.

200
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,208
Difficult situation...

201
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,336
first

202
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:03,592
Thank you for giving me a chance during these difficult times.

203
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,135
I do…

204
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,180
Experiencing severe financial difficulties
After barely holding on for a while

205
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,683
Hitech Group officially filed for bankruptcy today

206
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,729
This toothpaste is exported to Northeast Asia

207
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,316
Often in short supply

208
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,234
(Recruitment Position)

209
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,404
But due to the bankruptcy of the manufacturer...

210
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,323
This toothpaste alone can treat

211
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,700
Common tooth decay

212
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,869
and gum disease

213
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,829
Whitens teeth

214
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:37,918
This product is a collaboration with American Toothpaste Company
Results of technical cooperation

215
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,631
Recognized by the World Health Organization

216
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,135
The new core group of the 25th largest company filed for settlement

217
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,220
Declared bankrupt today

218
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,305
Dear Audience,

219
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,225
The government has decided
Apply for assistance from the International Monetary Fund

220
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,310
(Interview cancelled at 9 am on the 21st)

221
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,646
Although South Korea was once known for its economic boom

222
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,149
Now forced to admit national bankruptcy

223
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:05,070
and seek assistance from international organizations for recovery

224
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,073
The government's goal is to minimize
IMF policy intervention

225
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,200
Even if South Korea receives aid

226
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,118
(Permanently closed)

227
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:15,623
The next stop is Xinlin Market, formerly known as Cannes Theater

228
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:21,420
The next stop is Xinlin Market, formerly known as Cannes Theater

229
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,547
(Cannes theater closed in December
The last screening is free and first come first served)

230
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,610
(Cannes theaters will be closed on December 1
Cannes has been in Xinlin, thank you all)

231
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,070
When a door closes...

232
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,699
Another door will open

233
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,784
(Cinema Paradiso)

234
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,708
(Ticket A 17)

235
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,138
Hey can't you just sit anywhere?

236
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,688
(A-17)

237
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,110
This is not a leg rest, it's an armrest

238
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,778
Here is the handrail

239
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,784
People need countless reincarnations of fate
To meet once in a lifetime

240
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,787
It is rare to encounter it three times.

241
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,669
Hey, did you see her?

242
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,838
Did you see her?

243
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,882
- What?
- Didn't you see her?

244
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,801
Who asked you to clean these up?

245
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,555
I have already paved the way for you.
You still missed the target

246
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,768
If you fail the third time...

247
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,730
You have to wait until next life.

248
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,814
Jin Ming!

249
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,496
Last time it was Seo Taiji

250
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,499
This time it's HOT

251
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,833
Jin Ming!

252
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,446
Jin Ming!

253
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,520
Only then did he understand

254
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,733
You only have three chances

255
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,069
If no one scores in extra time

256
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,489
It will go into a penalty shootout

257
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,804
Stop!

258
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,099
master!

259
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,059
When a door closes

260
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,021
Another door will open

261
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,439
How about taking the next one?

262
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,274
Really

263
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,859
thank you

264
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,130
If the IMF crisis had not occurred…

265
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,011
If I hadn't lost my job...

266
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,936
If the theater hadn't closed down...

267
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:39,154
If anything goes wrong...

268
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,705
Everyone got off and arrived at the terminal.

269
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,876
...maybe this moment will never happen

270
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,093
Is this a dream?

271
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,096
Is it a dream?

272
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,974
Yes

273
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,151
I started chasing you from the cinema

274
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,487
Run as fast as you can

275
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,825
I can't let you slip away
Even if I run until I can't breathe,

276
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,037
Are you

277
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,415
Going to the theater alone?

278
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,709
- Yes
- I see

279
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,299
- Are you also...
- Yes

280
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,306
finally

281
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,850
We can use

282
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,644
The word "finally"?

283
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,471
Why do you keep laughing?

284
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,642
You look totally different now.

285
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,604
It seems that you are no longer Picasso

286
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,688
I haven't changed

287
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,192
I am Picasso from the Picasso Institute of Art

288
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,906
Without me, our college will close down.
They pay me a lot.

289
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,408
Really great

290
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:49,993
real

291
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,372
Me too

292
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,999
Really great

293
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,174
Why are we all at the theater today?

294
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,176
In fact, I go there every day

295
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,303
in case

296
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,890
I really miss you

297
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,896
I miss you so much

298
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,113
So now we can...

299
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,073
Now?

300
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,991
Isn't it possible?

301
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,412
Give me a drink

302
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,455
Or is it not possible?

303
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,543
We can order drinks now.

304
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,586
Let's have some beer

305
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,673
Just beer?

306
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,758
（Jinro Soju）

307
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,889
etc.

308
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,352
Why are you staring at me?

309
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,938
It drives me crazy.

310
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,356
Right?

311
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,275
I also

312
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,193
I'm going crazy

313
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,237
- Oh my god
- Oh no

314
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,531
I don't usually get drunk easily.

315
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,533
You will hurt yourself

316
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,035
Lift your feet higher.

317
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,372
Your voice sounds like my dad's.

318
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,458
What sound did you just make?

319
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:20,959
Are you bleeding?

320
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,712
I think I got it cut.

321
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,840
I think I need to stop the bleeding.

322
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,551
But no bleeding

323
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,389
Precautions

324
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,984
how so?

325
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,697
I thought I was going to die suddenly...

326
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,704
"sudden death"?

327
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,096
When I helped you get those books

328
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,807
I just kept thinking

329
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,603
“I want to hold her hand”

330
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,106
But we were...

331
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,691
Right?

332
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,194
That's why I said

333
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,489
“Everyone has a dark side”

334
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,658
...is no longer innocent

335
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,452
I think I've become darker.

336
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,630
We dated like adults...

337
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,719
Not the cheap IKEA feel
But the kind of expensive home

338
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,830
Are you crazy?

339
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,500
What's wrong with your expression? And your hands?

340
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,547
Come on, don't make that face.

341
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,718
Come on, you're like Titanic
Are you drawing me?

342
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,556
Come on, how can I
Paint you like Titanic?

343
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,017
Different models, different situations

344
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,685
"Condition"?

345
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,772
Okay, so what kind of situation would be appropriate?

346
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,065
Wow

347
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,692
- Please Putoto
- "Pu To To"?

348
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,777
What should the situation be like then?

349
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,781
Toto is being naughty again, isn't he?

350
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,288
Oh my god, really

351
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,791
Please how could you spit in my face?

352
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,586
Don't call me Pu To To!

353
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:14,215
Why do you like Park Toto so much?
I thought you never laughed

354
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,259
Toto and I have the same sense of humor

355
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,429
You influenced me
I started talking like you too

356
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,641
In this adult world where we learn to fake smiles

357
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,517
That's an incredible energy.

358
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,312
Don't make me laugh when we kiss

359
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,688
I can't concentrate

360
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,609
Baby, laugh together every day

361
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,612
Harder than kissing every day

362
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,489
So we are a good match

363
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,407
- Don't add the garlic now.
- good

364
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,829
Do you really like eating raw fish?

365
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,039
You always eat

366
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,707
Yeah, I like it.

367
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,713
Hey, do you want to eat?

368
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,549
Real amberjack?

369
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,260
- Real amberjack?
- right

370
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,262
Real amberjack

371
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,184
finally…

372
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,401

Amberjack shit!
Where did this damn saury come from?

375
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,628
Hey Dad

376
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:39,008
Why are you looking at him like that?
This will make him uncomfortable.

377
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,054
Finally one day
I stand with other men instead of my dad

378
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,350
That's how I look at people

379
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,104
Could you be nicer to him?

People living on the peninsula are not used to taking a boat

381
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,692
Did you adapt right away from the start?

382
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,068
- right
- That's right.

383
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,490
Did you let them go because they were too young?

384
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,242
You are such a kind fisherman.

Really kind

387
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,750
These are baits and we are leaving them to die.

388
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,378
Now that's not kind, is it?

389
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:20,550
Okay stop staring at him and catch me an amberjack

390
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,553
I brought him here
Just to eat real amberjack

391
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,321
Why do you keep following her?

392
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,072
She just went to the toilet

393
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,535
Just sit down and eat the amberjack and remember to pay

Why do you keep following her to the bathroom?

Notice!

00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,952

If I make a big deal out of it...

457
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,597
Did you just call your brother-in-law a brat?

458
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,599
"Brother-in-law"? So you recognize him?

459
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,185
You selfish child, don't just eat the shrimp by yourself

460
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,645
Peel some for him!

00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,106
Wait, why? What's so good about him?

462
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,649
Seriously why?

463
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,276
Oh My God

464
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,579
Why do you keep following her?
She just went to the toilet

465
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,750
Just sit down and eat the amberjack and remember to pay

466
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,919
Oh my god, why do you keep...

467
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,839
I'm afraid she'll fall.

468
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,592
Afraid that Jinming would fall

469
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,095
You think I would let my daughter fall into the water?

470
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,390
You should worry about yourself.

471
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,601
Notice!

472
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,730
But I still have to protect her so...

473
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,400
I'm worried so...

474
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,414
I don't stand a chance.

475
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,626
How can I impress him?

476
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,358
Do you know, baby?

477
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,903
You were a little dull just now

478
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,030
that

479
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,075
I want to impress him.

480
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,996
But that's how I am so...

481
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,333
So this is your nature

482
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,419
I don't know what to do

483
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,714
It's hard to do something I don't do often so...

484
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,718
So you think
I am the kind of person who likes to please others.

485
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,430
The one who changes his voice in front of your mom?

486
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,727
Let me be frank. I am...

487
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,062
- Are you listening?
- exist

488
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,815
I am my father's daughter

489
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,110
If you can't get past my dad, then you can't get past me.

490
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,780
- Can't get married
- baby

491
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,866
baby

492
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,372
Wait, why do you approve of him?

493
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,710
Then why didn’t you recognize my wife at the beginning?

494
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,921
I will never allow anyone to treat my virtue differently

495
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,840
Go away, go away

00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:19,510

Shit in your pants?

497
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,388

498
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,225
- Let me go
- Uncle!

499
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,108
Oh my god

500
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,736
uncle

501
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,696
uncle!

502
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,783
I can

503
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,785
Can I peel shrimp for you?

504
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,913
You peel it yourself

505
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,373
He got drunk and acted weird.

506
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,757
Look at him.

507
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,384
He really likes Jinming

508
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:05,806
But you know what, his mother also likes Jinming

509
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,935
She said she really likes Jinming

510
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,478
Interesting, right?

511
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,064
Yeah, it's very interesting.

512
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,690
You must have cried, right?

513
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,067
How is that possible?

514
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,195
Who in this world doesn’t like Jin Ming?

515
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:20,947
You cried

516
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,699
Is this real wild honey from Hallasan?

517
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,911
Are you going to give this to his mother?

518
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,579
You know

519
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:33,542
Chung-seop's mother gave me a gift first

520
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,879
She was literally bribing me.

521
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,382
Not everyone does this.

522
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,552
Do you know what I received yesterday?

523
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,931
What treasure?

524
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:47,974
What is it

525
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,768
Let her wrap it so tightly?

526
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,520
Why let him sleep here?

527
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,522
We should book him a hotel room.

528
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,817
How can we let him stay in a hotel?

529
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,736
I already feel guilty about him sleeping in the living room

530
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,990
How could I sleep under the same roof with Park Jong-seob?

531
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,574
Why can’t I sleep?

532
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,159
Just can't

533
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,539
Seriously, don't go out to see him.

534
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,458
He won't sneak into Jinming's room.

535
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,044
How dare he if you stare at him like that?

536
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,546
Don't go!

537
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,588
Let me go hey

538
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,551
Sit down! Oh my god!

539
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,579
Uncle, why don't you go to bed?
Instead, it keeps coming out?

540
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,497
What about you? Why aren't you asleep yet?

541
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,000
Why aren't you sleeping? What are you doing?

542
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,585
What are you going to do?

543
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,422
What? What's wrong? Is there a problem?

544
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,563
I picked the best persimmons when I went home in the fall

545
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:22,276
Thinking of you preparing for the whole season

546
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,820
I put my heart and soul into it

547
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,115
Every day I look at it and think of the lovely Jinming

548
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:32,536
I like Jinming very much

549
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,788
(From Chung-seop's mother)

550
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,247
Maybe mom

551
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,248
(I like Jinming very much)

552
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,710
Been waiting to hear these words.

553
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,881
Are you going to stay up all night?

554
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,510
If he went to Jinming's room
What are you going to do?

555
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,930
Then he's dead.

556
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,559
What can you do?

557
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,604
You never beat Jinming, right?

558
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,735
Let her be

559
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,822
Your partial love

560
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,244
Mom knows...

561
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,292
This day will come sooner or later

562
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,130
Laugh Show! I am the host, Kang Seok

563
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,633
The crisis of the International Monetary Fund has led to
Lots of sad words, right?

564
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,593
The "early lost" refers to
Most of the unemployed people are in their twenties.

565
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,511
(Closing Sale)

566
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,721
"38th parallel" means you have to quit your job at 38

567
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,850
"Winning the lottery" means retiring at 45 like everyone else

568
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,811
"Job thief" means working until age 56
Equivalent to a thief

569
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,522
No one can laugh these days.

570
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,900
Listen to an inspiring song

571
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,617
I flew away from the nest.

572
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,672
Like a blue bird flying over the bare hills

573
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,299
Flapping wings with excitement

574
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,343
Full of confidence

575
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,762
Don't laugh too much today.

576
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:15,973
It will make your dad angry.

577
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,768
Mom, don't be like this today.

578
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,604
Please don't cry like that, okay?

579
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:24,899
alright

580
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,901
You're going to ignore me once I get married?

581
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,486
You're not my mother anymore?

582
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,279
Listen carefully

583
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,657
I am still Liang Jinming, not Park Jinming

584
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,994
What are the last few digits of my pager?
Isn't that his home number?

585
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,913
Or is it our 3312?

586
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,832
Then whose family am I?

587
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,044
I know I won't give my daughter away.

588
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,546
So don't cry

589
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,507
If you cry I will cry too

590
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,550
The wedding photos will be ruined

591
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,223
Let's keep calm

592
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,058
Okay?

593
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:47,273
Oh my God! Why are you two here?

594
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,400
How could I miss your family's happy event?

595
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,068
The girl who is getting married...

596
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,278
Can you hold this open?

597
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,697
…The one who loves caramel, right?

598
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,284
Yes, Jinming, you always give her free caramel

599
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,912
OK, please go forward.

600
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,001
You are so beautiful today

601
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,381
- Hey, where's Joo Kyung?
- Juqing?

602
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,509
- How could the photographer be late?
- She's here

603
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,303
- Hey!
- Hey!

604
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,525
I shouldn't have come.

605
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,028
- Juqing!
- Hey!

606
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,654
- Hey!
- hurry up!

607
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,072
Please hurry up

608
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,824
Hey, hurry up.

609
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,412
What's going on?

610
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,915
She looks so beautiful

611
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,210
Hey, photographer, don't be late.

612
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,296
You should start filming when I get off the car

613
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,049
Are you happy? What a confident bride.

614
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,929
- bring it on
- Start shooting from here

615
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:01,847
good

616
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,559
So beautiful

617
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,727
Let's go over there

618
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,728
Go to the stairs

619
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,771
The stairs there

620
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,566
Does everyone marry their most passionate lover?

621
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,529
The scale of love is the same but the temperature is different

622
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,199
You gave us so many oranges.

623
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,618
You don't have to buy oranges anymore.

624
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,287
It's that kind of temperature that allows me to be myself

625
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,123
Did you say hello?

626
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,294
I found my prince

627
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,857
A match made in heaven

628
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,110
You taught him to be so cheesy.
Or is he just like that?

629
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,653
He is my favorite student

630
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,239
So cute

631
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,371
Next the groom enters

632
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,376
The groom enters confidently

633
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,920
Please welcome him with applause.

634
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,476
I didn't say
Do I hate it when brides cry at their weddings?

635
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,979
Don't cry for me, Dad.

636
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,022
I'll be very angry if you cry

637
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,941
Forget it, what?

638
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,402
Don't look into my eyes, okay?

639
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,449
Jin Ming

640
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,952
You're going to be fine, right?

641
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:51,081
If something is wrong, forget it.
Come back to me directly

642
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,082
Okay?

643
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,383
Can you really eat this?

644
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,344
If you don't like it, forget it

645
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,221
Can you spit it out?

646
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,686
Oh my god

647
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,147
(Liang Jinming)

648
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,691
Is it suitable?

649
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,701
Say "Hello, teacher"

650
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,828
Hello, teacher

651
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,164
Oh my god

652
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,418
I said I can't send her to school yet.

653
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,462
Let's send her there next year.

654
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,840
Do you want her to stay home forever?

655
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,092
How are you going to marry her off in the future?

656
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,178
You are so stupid. Is he really stupid?

657
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,722
Jinming, do you think you can go to school?

658
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,309
I can go there too.

659
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,186
What does it matter if he goes?

660
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,563
I don't want you anywhere near Kim Jong-gun.

661
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,023
I want to go to school

662
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,905
Then go now. If you don't like it, forget it.

663
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,450
Can you please run home? I'll be waiting for you here.

664
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,868
- Okay?
- good

665
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,168
Jinming, I'm sure you'll be able to run well tomorrow, right?

666
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,128
I think I can get first place

667
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,213
First place?

668
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,382
- Ready... No.
- run!

669
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,633
Can you run when you hear the word “run”?

670
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,804
But you don't have to be first.

671
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:32,474
If you fall, come to me.
I'll be behind you tomorrow.

672
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,392
Okay?

673
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,393
good

674
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,019
- Prepare...
- run!

675
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,897
Oh my god

676
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,941
(Aim for high scores!)

677
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,196
(University Entrance Examination Admission Ticket)

678
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,574
come on!

679
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,783
You can do it!

680
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,327
Come on Wuyi High School!

681
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,289
We're too early again.

682
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,374
Seriously

683
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,918
Why is our family so hardworking?

684
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:03,380
What kind of life do you live that causes you to be like this?

685
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,464
Jin Ming

686
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,092
- Can you guess it?
- Please

687
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:11,763
Why should I guess the answer?
Dad, I am Liang Jinming

688
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,807
you're right

689
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,602
I know you've been here for these years.
You do everything well

690
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,812
Your dad, who is good at everything, now knows

691
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:23,734
So you're saying I'm good at everything?
Just let me forget it without saying anything?

692
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:28,280
But if you have a headache and really can't do it
That's fine.

693
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,074
Then run out and I'll wait here for you, okay?

694
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,036
You always have my back, right?

695
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:39,333
Are you sure you don't need some herbal remedies to calm you down?

696
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,464
(Liang Jinming)

697
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,674
(The pride of Dodong-ri!
My daughter will definitely pass the imperial examination! )

698
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,052
Every time I walk on the tightrope

699
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:54,598
Dad is standing there holding the net

700
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,726
"Even if you fall, I will be there"

701
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,563
I really wish I had told him

702
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,983
How comforting his words are.

703
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,443
Even once

704
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,489
He stood there

705
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,576
The snow seems to fall only on my dad

706
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,832
The bride is about to enter the red carpet

707
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,167
Jin Ming

708
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,086
What's wrong?

709
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,504
Dad is still here

710
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:29,800
Just do whatever you want to do.

711
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,095
In my dad's winter

712
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,763
I grew into a lush green

713
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,140
Feeding on their youth

714
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,977
Grows into a tree

715
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,736
If Chung-seop makes you angry, forget it.
Is it okay for Dad to be here all the time?

716
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:55,450
No, don't say that now.

717
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,328
You're annoying, dad.

718
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,124
Welcome the bride

719
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,256
Please welcome her with applause

720
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,491
Guangli must be grinning from ear to ear

721
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,786
She is finally happy.

722
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:47,085
Uncle Aichun was at the wedding
When I walked down the red carpet holding Aichun's hand

723
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,296
I thought I would die of heartache

724
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:53,341
Daughter's decent life
Like a medal for a mother

725
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,761
So she kept laughing

726
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,016
To prevent the bride from crying
Can't get to the front

727
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,060
The groom ran to greet her.

728
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,605
Please give them a big round of applause again

729
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,698
We agreed to keep calm
Why are you crying like this?

730
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,210
Aren't we going to get married? Should we cancel it?

731
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,130
No, I want to continue

732
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,676
Let's go

733
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,034
The day before my dad left me

734
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,162
I apologized hastily

735
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,874
"Dad, I'm so sorry."

736
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,211
My father told me at that time

737
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,131
Since the day I was born

738
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,926
He's been living in heaven.

739
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:30,939
I'll just say it

740
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,441
Your dad cries harder than your mom

741
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,571
My dad is crying?

742
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,880
I didn't expect your dad to be like that.

743
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,967
Why do men say that in front of their son-in-law?
Always want to act so tough?

744
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,927
Why drink too much?

745
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,138
Dad wanted to see if he would behave strangely when he was drunk.

746
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,099
Who is weird now?

747
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,811
- Hey Dad
- careful!

748
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,110
What did your mother say?

749
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,029
What?

750
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,906
Does she like Jin Ming?

751
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:26,661
My mother keeps nagging me for a daughter.

752
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,789
So she likes Jinming more than me

753
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:30,832
No

754
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,878
- What?
- She's my daughter, not yours.

755
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,422
She will always be my daughter

756
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,634
Yes, of course.

757
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,261
- Park Chung-seop!
- At Uncle

758
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,640
Do you know what you took from me?

759
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,058
What?

760
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,186
I give you...

761
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,149
My Paradise

762
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,695
You didn't do anything for her.

763
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,698
30 years passed like this

764
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,618
All right

765
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,205
I heard that my aunt is the one with literary talent.

766
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,795
Hey Beam Heaven

767
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,588
Get Your Own Honey

768
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,845
Dad's partial love

769
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:30,767
We now invite the bride and groom
For the bride's parents

770
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:42,195
Bride and groom please bow to the bride's parents

771
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:58,169
Oh my god, the bride's father is crying oh my god!

772
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,379
Be quiet

773
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,549
The father of the bride must love his daughter very much

774
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,468
Kuanzhi's most precious thing was stolen

775
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,429
He was robbed!

776
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:10,515
Even if his mother remarried, he wouldn't cry like this.

777
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,813
I wish you happiness.

778
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,651
Next the bride and groom will bow to the groom's mother

779
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,696
That's enough, okay?

780
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,451
It's really embarrassing.

781
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:33,538
Bride and groom please bow to the groom's mother

782
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:48,720
Who is it?

783
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,889
Who is looking for you?

784
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,932
Who is this?

785
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,768
I don't know either

786
00:55:56,394 --> 00:56:00,315
Didn't I tell you
Did you dye your gray hair before going?

787
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,735
Jinming is nagging me again

788
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:09,783
Obviously compared to her
Or am I better able to take care of my husband?

789
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,453
She now has her own husband to take care of.

790
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,628
Life never allows us
Really enjoy these moments

791
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:24,964
Liang Yinming

792
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,389
I?

793
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:37,018
Happiness is coming
But trouble always sneaks up from behind

794
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,853
Where is Park Cheol-yong?

795
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:40,522
You know, right?

796
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,483
I?

797
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,447
When mom tells me not to hang out with a certain friend

798
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,951
There is always a reason for everything

799
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:43,329
(“If you can’t do it, forget it
We are always behind you")

800
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:53,089
