00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,736
(Daechi-dong Police Station)

3
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,539
Are you a high official?

4
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,832
Are you a judge?

5
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,461
Do we have to endure it if you do it? If you say you will send us to Nanshan, will we go to Nanshan?

6
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:30,173
If you say I am a thief, am I one? If you say you want me to go to jail, am I going to go?

7
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,967
The diamond ring next to the porcelain jar

8
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,846
I never saw any diamond rings!

9
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,057
There is no

10
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,644
Is there a female officer here? Is Yeon-sun here?

11
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,687
Tell her to come over and search this girl.

12
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,605
Good Sir

13
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,609
Why do you want me to be searched? I'm not a thief.

14
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,820
See? You must be hiding something from us.

15
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,990
The woman who called the police said she had been pretending not to know the girl was taking money from the jar

16
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,785
No, I earned it... How did you earn it?

17
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,787
Are you tutoring illegally?

18
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:06,126
The person who called the police said that she asked the girl to keep accounts and knew she stole money but did nothing about it.

19
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,044
Because she is a working student

20
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,131
Do poor people always steal?

21
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,425
Some people would not steal even if they were beaten

22
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,177
Then let us search you.

23
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,388
Why search me?

24
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,640
I'm not a thief! Why should I...

25
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,016
There's something wrong with you

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,145
What's your home phone number? I need to see your father.

27
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:29,023
Why do you want to see my father? I'm not a thief!

28
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,735
If you have nothing to hide, calling him is suspicious!

29
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,530
If I told my father that I was suspected of being a thief

30
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,158
He will be heartbroken!

31
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,258
All buses to the dormitory will stop here... I understand, let's go.

32
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,595
I'm waiting for the bus to go home... Not going to the army?

33
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,265
I'm on vacation until Friday, so I'll go back early.

34
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,391
What's wrong?

35
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,852
You can't even think about dating Jinming, do you hear me?

36
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,689
Why don't you answer?

37
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,572
You two...

38
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,742
Are you dating?

39
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,536
Are you testing me?

40
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,000
I was dumped. Dumped? You?

41
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,543
I always get dumped

42
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:39,177
You didn't study hard and just chased girls, that's why you got dumped

43
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,847
Did your dad make you date more girls in college?

44
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,807
It's not like that

45
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,061
I was dumped eight times by Jinming alone

46
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,362
Would you like a bottle?

47
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,280
No need, uncle, you drink it.

48
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,077
No, it's Mr. Liang.

49
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,704
Have a safe journey back home

50
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,331
but why?

51
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,251
Why doesn't she like you?

52
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,965
I think...

53
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,801
It's because you're too... you're too... you know?

54
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,221
You are dead, aren't you...

55
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,932
She grew up around me so her standards are very high

56
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,560
Before she was five, she always said she would marry me when she grew up.

57
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,312
So you are not qualified

58
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,022
Just live your life well.

59
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,357
Everyone has their own destiny

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,568
The reason we broke up and got together was...

61
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,820
What does "divide and merge" mean?

62
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,281
Ok… what is it?

63
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,161
She said I didn't say anything and asked why I didn't say anything...

64
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,418
Why don't you say anything?

65
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,419
Be prepared

66
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,338
You put on the ring and you're ready to go

67
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:06,889
Um

68
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,976
Since you're giving me...

69
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,647
No

70
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,318
Walk Away

71
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,417
Did you lie about the ring?

72
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,338
Wasn't she the one who took it?

73
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,554
Oh my god

74
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:50,433
Why did you call the police on her? Don't you usually fire her?

75
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,561
Who would believe a thief?

76
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,271
We want others to think

77
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,649
She's talking nonsense because she was accused of being a thief.

78
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,318
To avoid trouble in the future

79
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,445
If she starts spreading rumors

80
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,032
It is said that Wu Zhenni from Dazhidong is looking for someone to take the exam for her.

81
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,825
You and I will both be finished.

82
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,371
My ring was stolen and that girl is the thief

83
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,629
Didn't I keep telling you?

84
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,090
Life is only about winning and losing

85
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,760
Either be stepped on or step on others

86
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,096
It's all in one thought

87
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,517
There is no need to sympathize with those who are no longer useful

88
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,687
Don't be swayed by small emotions. You must be cold and ruthless.

89
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,023
That's how I make money

90
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,737
Then you continue to make a lot of money. If you become useless, you will be in trouble.

91
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,572
What?

92
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,324
I learned from you

93
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:55,873
You said she stole the flower-shaped ring

94
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,626
It's the one that's always been here, right?

95
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,128
right

96
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,338
She's so bold

97
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,092
That's diamond on diamond

98
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,095
How many carats?

99
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,389
About half a carat?

100
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,933
Is it half a carat?

101
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,476
Very expensive

102
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,437
Flower shape

103
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,689
Really like the flower shape!

104
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,524
What do you know?

105
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,985
Oh my god, here

106
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,945
The ring is there

107
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,905
here

108
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,368
It just fell down by itself.

109
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,125
Should you call the police?

110
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,501
Auntie, what are you doing?

111
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,546
Call the police and tell them you found the ring.

112
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,548
Apologize for the misunderstanding

113
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,633
I asked you what you want to do

114
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,761
Don't you call them?

115
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:54,891
Auntie!

116
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,689
If you don't call I'll throw it away

117
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,650
You are crazy!

118
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,986
Do you know how expensive this thing is?

119
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,072
Come on! I'm serious! It's already lost, right?

120
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,284
You said it was stolen and that girl is the thief

121
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,412
Now you're reporting me for throwing it away?

122
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,539
Damn it!

123
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,540
lay down!

124
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,418
Don't you know me yet? I'm gonna throw this out there

125
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,837
And it will be very far

126
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,255
I will... Hey!

127
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,594
That ring is worth more than you!

128
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,179
Call them

129
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,433
Stay out of my business

130
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,519
Apologize

131
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,604
Who do you think you are? Mind your own business!

132
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,855
Do you know her?

133
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,943
Really! You're driving me crazy

134
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,819
Call now!

135
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,457
Hello?

136
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,878
What's wrong? You want money again? We have no money.

137
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,549
Hey Jinming's mom!

138
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,676
Your daughter called! OK

139
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,512
My baby! Oh my god!

140
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,680
"Baby"? Seriously?

141
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,518
Baby! Where are you? Baby is spending money somewhere!

142
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,105
I want to cry like a baby

143
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,440
Tell her how bad people in Seoul are

144
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,109
Baby, have you eaten?

145
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,072
But I couldn't say that worried word.

146
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,907
Who hasn't eaten yet at this hour?

147
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,784
My heart softened

148
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,704
I just want to make a phone call.

149
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,082
Can't I just make a phone call?

150
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,043
I have

151
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,547
I have money

152
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,386
How about you? Are you okay?

153
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,601
Didn't I tell you not to set up a stall on the street?

154
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,479
I told you I hate you eating on the street every day!

155
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,066
Those damn abalones! Are you serious!

156
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,693
Is the abalone season that important?

157
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,612
You always complain about back pain

158
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,531
Go open a store or something!

159
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,159
It takes money to open a shop

160
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,827
Mother

161
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,415
Why do you always have no money?

162
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,128
Right?

163
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,631
Why am I always out of money?

164
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,924
It's all because of you!

165
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,303
I hate my mother's poverty.

166
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,723
I hate it because I know it's all because of me

167
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,186
Baby daddy hasn't arrived yet, right?

168
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,396
You're not calling me because you saw him, are you?

169
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,314
dad?

170
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,233
Dad won a prize for saving the drowning man

171
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,444
I said this was today's thing

172
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:58,658
The governor sent a group of association members to visit the peninsula

173
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:03,371
Because a new museum opened, he gave everyone tickets.

174
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,122
Where in the peninsula? Which museum?

175
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,084
He said he wanted to visit you if he had time.

176
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,377
Where is the Peninsula?

177
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,131
The newly opened museum in the Peninsula

178
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,760
You always just say "the peninsula" How do I know where it is?

179
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,721
Which museum is he going to?

180
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,307
Will he come to see me when he has time? I'm busy too!

181
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,061
Is Dad coming or not?

182
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,729
Jin Ming

183
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,356
He will go

184
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,400
Dad will go

185
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,699
Kim Young-sam! Kim Dae-jung!

186
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,747
Oh my god, the road is so congested

187
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,750
She is really crazy

188
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,002
How can I accuse you of stealing?

189
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,047
So the police called your house?

190
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,465
No

191
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,802
I refused to give them my home phone number.

192
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,727
You didn't tell your family? How could I tell?

193
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:17,153
I don't care who in the world knows about me except my parents.

194
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,324
Parents don't know

195
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,704
At what moment did the child's heart become knotted?

196
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,208
If they knew, they would protect the child.

197
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,964
So the gods didn't let them know

198
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,306
A tree grows only when it bears fruit

199
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,311
But if the father knew that his child had a problem, he would be heartbroken.

200
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,521
So the gods hid the knot

201
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,862
Oh my god

202
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,073
You're scaring me to death.

203
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,242
I might be back late!

204
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,578
It's cold outside. It will be even colder at night.

205
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,122
How long have you been waiting for me?

206
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,166
College students all hold their books like this

207
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,168
When did you come?

208
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,088
Come on

209
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,594
Is it uncomfortable that your bag strap is always out of place?

210
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,667
You came to Seoul just to eat jajangmyeon?

211
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,627
Shall we not chat?

212
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,089
Do you drink alcohol too?

213
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,050
I can drink quite well.

214
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,977
You didn't join the protest?

215
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,937
Which museum has just opened?

216
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,106
Where do you live?

217
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,566
I was just passing by

218
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,069
Tear gas hurts so much I can't stop crying

219
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,531
Which subway line? Can you go by yourself?

220
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,657
That's right

221
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,994
You didn't date that soldier, did you?

222
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,829
You shouldn't date someone like this.

223
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,917
What's the point of eating like this? It's better to talk to yourself

224
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,261
I quit my part-time job

225
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,306
The dormitory asked me to move out

226
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,933
I didn't get a scholarship

227
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,688
It's okay

228
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,987
This university is full of top students

229
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,741
It's like all the dragons in the stream gather in one puddle.

230
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,869
You can't always be the best, no one can be perfect

231
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,123
I've never even had lunch with this kind of person at school before.

232
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,547
"A Dragon from the Stream"

233
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,675
I really hate this term.

234
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,307
Who benefits from the dragon rising from the stream?

235
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,226
What are the benefits to the stream?

236
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,647
What's good for dragons?

237
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,277
I was selected to study abroad

238
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,614
But I won't go

239
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:56,538
I really hate being replaced by Oh Ye-rin

240
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,917
But I won't go

241
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,802
I also want to study abroad

242
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,304
I don't want to do a damn part-time job

243
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,556
I want to try everything

244
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,893
But I won't do that

245
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,815
I'm just greedy

246
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,902
I'm just selfish

247
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,033
I want to fly higher

248
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,206
But there's always something pulling me

249
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,084
Mom and me?

250
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:43,752
no

251
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,880
It's guilt

252
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,592
The higher I want to fly...

253
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,806
The more I will be dragged back by guilt...

254
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,019
Why do I feel guilty for wanting more?

255
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,566
It's so annoying. I can't stand it.

256
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,446
I just want to say sorry

257
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,034
But the words I said always turned into thorns

258
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,663
Jin Ming

259
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,832
What's wrong?

260
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,460
Go ahead

261
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,795
Just go

262
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,924
Dad will always be here

263
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:44,938
Jin Ming

264
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,940
Tell your teacher

265
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,195
Dad will pay the tuition and fees within three days

266
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,452
Dad will always be here

267
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:06,835
Am I a child?

268
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,713
Why do you always pick squid for me?

269
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,219
This is the first time citizens have voted in 16 years

270
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,137
The voter turnout was 89.2%…

271
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,597
Find a safe place to live

272
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,392
Don't worry about the rent.

273
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,061
As for the money…

274
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,357
There are fish everywhere in the water and Dad can catch them all

275
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,196
Don't date a soldier and don't drink strong alcohol

276
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,990
Don't join the protests

277
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,868
Tear gas hurts and makes you cry

278
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,413
Kim Young-sam of the Unified Democratic Party

279
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,833
Voting with his wife Sun Mingshun

280
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,460
The news scares me the most

281
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,295
To be honest

282
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,464
Dad doesn't know what happened.

283
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,383
Dad knows nothing

284
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,720
But I can't sleep when I see soldiers with batons on the news

285
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,015
I heard that college students would be taken away and beaten...

286
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,852
Oh my god

287
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,439
Sends chills down my spine

288
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,693
So Jinming

289
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,820
If possible…

290
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,576
Democratic Justice Party candidate Roh Tae-woo leads

291
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,661
Shouting "The Great Era of Ordinary People..."

292
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,331
So annoying

293
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,208
What's wrong?

294
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,044
Did you vote for someone else?

295
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,714
Dad is so annoying

296
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,093
You really hate dad.

297
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,391
Do you call this passing by?

298
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,434
(Cheonan Independence Hall, South Korea)

299
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,436
Do you think this is the only place in the entire peninsula?

300
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,612
Roh Tae-woo of the Democratic Justice Party…

301
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,030
Because you can't go home often

302
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,240
We are so far away

303
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,703
Which museum is he going to?

304
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,539
He comes to visit whenever he is free? I am busy too!

305
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,876
Is Dad coming or not?

306
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,797
Jinming will go. Dad will go.

307
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,840
(Last bus from Yongsan to Cheonan)

308
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,594
When have you ever seen your father go sightseeing?

309
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,973
Even during the New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival, he would be eager to sail out to sea.

310
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,642
He just took advantage of this opportunity

311
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,852
Find an excuse to see you

312
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,273
But I have my own things, you know?

313
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,903
He really wanted to see his eldest daughter.

314
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,365
So Jinming, when you saw your father...

315
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,117
(Longshan Long-distance Bus Station)

316
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,392
Why did he come all the way from Cheonan to Seoul?

317
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,769
So annoying

318
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,480
So Jinming

319
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,817
Don't be mad at your dad when you see him

320
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,819
Can you be gentle with daddy?

321
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,613
He has loved you unilaterally for 20 years

322
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,301
Catch lots of fish!

323
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,469
Catch lots of squid!

324
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,418
Oh my god, I'm gonna leave that little thing behind.

325
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,881
In his eyes, his daughter will never grow up.

326
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,593
He thought he might feel sad again...

327
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,974
...feeling sad for his eternal little girl Ai Chun

328
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,146
(From Liang Yinming, Class 7, Grade 2)

329
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,231
How should I say it?

330
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,526
I'm not good at this kind of thing!

331
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,656
Ask the kids who took the car logo to return the letters they scratched off

332
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,409
Give them the money and get their stuff back!

333
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,703
They kept saying they were gone!

334
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,580
Do you know how much this bottle of whiskey costs?

335
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,791
Do you know how long it takes to make that much money?

336
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,919
Their autumn...

337
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,837
It's harvest season, okay?

338
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,007
...not harvest time but picked clean

339
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,677
The older I get, the more ignorant I become! All my fruits have been taken away!

340
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,727
Sonata, the head teacher, and Stella, the Chinese teacher's little carriage, right?

341
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,770
Right? Yes

342
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,564
Hello teacher

343
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,108
Hello

344
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,985
Hello

345
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,363
Hello

346
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,782
Everything that is sown is harvested, this is autumn

347
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,998
Is that your wine?

348
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,836
Is that girl your daughter or a relative?

349
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,754
You don't even know her.

350
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,466
I know her

351
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,051
Okay, isn't it?

352
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,431
I don't need more free stuff. Free stuff...

353
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,891
If you're drunk they'll rob you

354
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,935
She said you'd melt like butter, right?

355
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,687
What do you mean?

356
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,064
Don't turn off the lights at all costs

357
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,983
That woman is a real thief

358
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,985
She will steal your bag when you fall asleep

359
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,988
Why are you telling me this?

360
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,740
What? Why are you telling me?

361
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,294
Why are you helping me?

362
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,379
Why do you bother about this?

363
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,256
Do you know me?

364
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,008
Who am I to you?

365
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,427
Why?

366
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,262
Why?

367
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,515
It will be very sad

368
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,894
You will be sad if your bag is stolen too

369
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,022
Is that it?

370
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,567
It's best if we don't feel sad.

371
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,075
you're right

372
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,496
It's best if we don't feel sad.

373
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,343
It's best if we don't feel sad.

374
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,596
It would be sad if that girl was wrongly accused of theft.

375
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,807
You're like Mother Teresa.

376
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,310
You don't know that girl

377
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,811
Do you know what Seoul National University is?

378
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,732
You've always been nosy.

379
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,360
I know her

380
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,655
Before I got married, she helped me keep my mother's inheritance.

381
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,157
The girl wasn't even born yet!

382
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,827
She's exactly like that girl. OMG.

383
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,622
If you weren't my boss, I would have...

384
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,540
What?

385
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,459
You want to frame me as a thief and then fire me?

386
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:49,798

387

Miss Kim

389
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,431
Don't call me "Miss Kim" in front of my daughter

390
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,227
Why do you live this awful life if you care so much about your daughter's opinion?

391
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,772
Your daughter sees everything.

392
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,442
Damn it! I told you to throw away all the ones without oil!

393
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,655
I told you to cultivate your moral character

394
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,574
Parents’ Virtues and Karma

395
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,909
It's passed directly to the child.

396
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,661
Look at her

397
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,496
You can see

398
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,915
She's gone the wrong way.

399
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,001
I know

400
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,764
My mom made me do this.

401

403
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,784
How can I leave when you look like this?

404
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,287
Then don't go!

405
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,584
So are we back together?

406
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,588
I don't know, don't move.

407
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,841
Don't break my heart again, I might just run away.

408
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,594
How many days left?

409
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,929
797 days

410
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,353
I hate North Korea!

411
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,147
I feel powerless about our on-and-off relationship

412
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,733
But you'll marry me in the end, right?

413
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,401
It depends on the situation

414
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,445
It depends on your performance

415
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,155
You said you wanted to marry me last time

416
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,241
Hey who knows what will happen?

417
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,495
People say you don’t know until you walk on the red carpet

418
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,331
Wait and see

419
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,708
I want to see you in a wedding dress

420
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,169
I really thought I was different from my mother.

421
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,213
Hey, aren't you getting in the car yet?

422
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,800
In the end, like mother, like daughter

423
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,052
Although not exactly the same

424
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,101

Just do what you want to do

428
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,461
Mom's love is a fairy tale

429
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,505
Welcome the bride

430
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,972

443
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,557
I told you not to sit next to me

444

Go back to your side!

Why would an athlete enter a writing contest? Who sent you?

446
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,567
I raised my hand and said I wanted to participate

447
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,612
You know what the people in town say?

448
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:26,908

I think you will win this time.

450

00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,342
I have no idea

455
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,177
I can't write

456
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,191
I should write to the Ministry of Education

457
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,694
They have to let athletes learn

458
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,612
Will they take responsibility for this child's life?

(Presented by Wu Yilin)

514
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,651
Look at those old country ladies who are doing well even after losing their children.

515
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,488
They will say: "I gave birth to eight children and two died"

516
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,158
"You once had a brother" as if nothing happened

517
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,161
How is it possible? How can I survive after losing my child?

518
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,205
But they are doing well.

519
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,249
What can they do? Cry every day? Starve to death?

520
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,376
This is not the point we are making.

521
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,880
To demonstrate the correlation between empathy and civility

522
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,381
Right?

523
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,177
Are they inferior to you?

524
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,098
What?

525
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,434
Do you think they are inferior to you and that's why they act like that?

526
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,022
Keep wiping your stuff.

527
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,484
It's not because they are not as good as you.

528
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,321
It's not because they are not evolved enough that they act as if nothing happened.

529
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,740
They just have to keep living.

530
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,037
Jinming, I'm sorry for saying this.

531
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,998
Do you think you are inferior to me?

532
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,417
Why do I feel that way?

533
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,089
There are several reasons why you don't even have the opportunity to study abroad

534
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,008
Don't I have it? I asked you to go.

535
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,135
Let me go?

536
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,974
Then you go.

537
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,184
You can go

538
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,738
You keep pretending that you gave me the chance

539
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,117
But you can't get in just by having a high GPA

540
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,119
Context and conditions are also important

541
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,537
Who said this?

542
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,372
Your dad again?

543
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,709
Life ultimately depends on the total score

544
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,051
But I got 37 votes

545
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,555
So what if you got 37 votes? Who cares about your 37 votes?

546
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:26,058
What is 37 votes in reality?

547
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,977
Compared with Wan Ji,

548
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:32,440
The difference is more than just nine votes, okay?

549
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,482
(Class motto: Honesty)

550
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,861
Take it

551
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,113
Okay, take it here.

552
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,200
Put it here and take one

553
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,454
Wan Ji's dad brought these to celebrate his becoming the class monitor.

554
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,206
He was the one who treated us to the meal last time, right?

555
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,165
(Lee Man-ki stayed in class to study)

556
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:52,877
You should feel guilty if you took the bread but didn't vote for him.

557
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,814
Those who are detained can only get one after completing the homework.

558
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,362
Yes, take one

559
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,031
Take one

560
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,081
(Diary of Wu Aichun)

561
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,478
Wanji! Are you studying well?

562
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,690
You're not going to just stay at home and eat butter buns, are you?

563
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,817
Our monitor is a fake monitor.

564
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,277
He's a cream-filled squad leader.

565
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,281
Even if there are 100 cream buns, Lee Man-ki can't get 100 points

566
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,032
But I got 100 points

567
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,630
Mom is like a wild flower that found its way to the sunshine

568
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,675
Even in the dark brick wall

569
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,884
Hurry up

570
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,971
She will eventually find the light.

571
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,180
Be careful

572
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:33,102
This is where I met my husband Shangji.

573
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,146
(Freshly picked by the Ama aunties)

574
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:39,525
I really felt like my life was over.

575
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,991
I heard that you really want to marry a man from Seoul

576
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,329
I am also from Seoul

577
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:56,250
I came from a well-off family and was sent to Seoul to study after liberation.

578
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,920
If I hadn't gotten married and moved here

579
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,340
I will become a powerful person

580
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,096
When I first got married...

581
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,016
Can I still have tea today?

582
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,983
Don't care about my opinion

583
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,194
Love is not...

584
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,278
Oh my god

585
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,157
Who would have thought I could take this place?

586
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,536
Like I said, you never know what will happen in life unless you experience it yourself.

587
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,372
Come on!

588
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:38,042
I even thought of a name for this place.

589
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,461
All right

590
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,214
Store names should be chosen by educated people

591
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,967
"Pure and three aunts"

592
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,845
Why choose a complicated name?

593
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,890
A collection of poetry sells better if it has a simple title

594
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,810
There are thousands of people with the word "pure" in their names.

595
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,020
It's enough to attract them, right?

596
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,188
Yes, that's it.

597
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,816
Your name is first, let her go.

598
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,113
Let's stop eating lunch on the street

599
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,825
From now on I will only eat at the table

600
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,827
You eat at the table

601
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,870
Each person gets a quarter, right?

602
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,874
Aichun, you only need to pay this much, and we will pay the rest

603
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,626
Low water pressure

604
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,544
What?

605
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,462
Water pressure…

606
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,925
This is enough to wash sea cucumbers and sea squirts.

607
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,468
Let me wash them all.

608
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:35,099
But the tap keeps ticking steadily

609
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,562
The leaking hole is still gushing out

610
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,107
(Eligibility for studying abroad at public expense)

611
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:47,903
I think it's funny that English majors go to Japan

612
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:52,366
I'll have to delay my graduation so I shouldn't...

613
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,744
I don't think I should...

614
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,715
I hope you go

615
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,469
Yelin is a little...

616
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,430
snobbish

617
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,273
Since you are not eligible for the national scholarship

618
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,901
As I mentioned before…

619
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,528
No, please don't do this.

620
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,324
I'm leaving. If you call me again, I won't come back.

621
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,202
Come on, I still have some money, you know?

622
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,996
You can pay me back later

623
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,584
You said your car was the cheapest in the employee parking lot.

624
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,546
Now is not the time to worry about me, be bold!

625
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,256
Otherwise you'll be like me

626
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,718
But you're really great, professor.

627
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:56,847
I think you're the only professor who feeds apples to sparrows

628
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,645
I really appreciate you taking care of me

629
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,774
I feel like I've been to Japan

630
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,193
You really know how to talk

631
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,324
Talking to someone is like writing a love letter

632
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,036
I will choose my words carefully and check them one by one

633
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,123
She's very nice. A really great person.

634
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:27,711
When someone is nice to you just once, they are your savior.

635
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,796
(Sales and Purchase Agreement)

636
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,674
Yes, I must send the best tangerines.

637
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,634
She is very nice to me

638
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,594
What did she do for you?

639
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,680
Say she likes you or you're doing great?

640
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,850
I want to hear what she said and feel the joy!

641
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:45,688
She wants to lend me money for studying abroad

642
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,815
It's rare to treat others like this

643
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:51,360
She took me to the faculty cafeteria alone and treated me to lunch

644
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,362
But you said

645
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,907
You don't want to study abroad

646
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,035
Just send a box of tangerines

647
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:04,081
Do you want to study abroad? Do you want to go?

648
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,500
What if I want to go?

649
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,086
Can I go?

650
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,212
How much does it cost?

651
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,339
Tell me, how much does it cost?

652
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,550
You don't need to know

653
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:18,053
I'm not saying just tell me how much you want to pay

654
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,555
Mom, don't you watch TV?

655
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,432
The yen is now ridiculously high

656
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,268
Can you tell me approximately how much?

657
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,145
You're really pissing me off.

658
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,230
Are you a beggar? Have you no parents?

659
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,441
Why would someone lend you money?

660
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,900
What on earth are you doing?

661
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,153
Do you think I look rich?

662
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,448
I don't go to Japan so everyone knows that our family is in trouble.

663
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,659
How much is it? Just tell me how much!

664
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,746
Even if I tell you, what's the use? Are you going to give me the money for the stall?

665
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,706
If you have money, don't set up a stall!

666
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,167
Really, I want to stop.

667
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,209
But how can I stop?

668
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,801
Forget it. Don't send tangerines anymore.

669
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,262
I get angry when I talk to you

670
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,975
I should be extremely grateful to my savior

671
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,935
Treat like waste paper

672
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,066
What to say now?

673
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,113
I am not careful with my words or expressions

674
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,665
(Eligibility for studying abroad at public expense)

675
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,166
I'm not qualified at all

676
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,847
How much?

677
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,434
300 won Give me 300 won

678
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,451
What about all?

679
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,368
ah?

680
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,495
I like beans

681
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,000
A kind mother gave birth to a kind daughter

682
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,419
They love each other forever

683
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,630
Break each other's hearts again

684
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,430
I don't want to sell things on the street anymore

685
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,600
Who would want to make a living on the streets?

686
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,313
I used to be shy too.

687
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,690
I used to be called a literary girl

688
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,821
I met a high school classmate while eating on newspaper at the market.

689
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,616
I just want to stop eating

690
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,993
I have lost my appetite all day.

691
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,921
Is she the only one with dignity? Don't I have any dignity?

692
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,715
But what can I do?

693
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,092
She has so many things she wants to do.

694
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,887
I am also in pain because I can't help her

695
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:57,523
It's strange that after seeing your beloved daughter you only drink

696
00:46:59,024 --> 00:46:59,858
You know

697
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:04,488
I owe you and her so much.

698
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,829
My mother knew that I was limited by my energy and finances.

699
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:17,668
I cried so many times because I failed to become the monitor.

700
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,547
I understand now

701
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,596
What did she say?

702
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:34,059
Did she cry and say she wanted to study abroad? Did she cry in frustration?

703
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,147
For my daughter who will never grow up

704
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,609
They eventually sold the house.

705
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,449
Is this the last persimmon?

706
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,787
Eat it all and don't give it to others

707
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,206
Not even our children?

708
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,334
Even the children can't eat it. Only you can eat it.

709
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:07,092
As kids get older they demand more from us, right?

710
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,386
Don't you know this is a losing business?

711
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,307
She abandoned the house.

712
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,102
In it is her mother Xiao Aichun…

713
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,440
And the one whose name she dared not mention

714
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,944
Tong Ming will be missed

715
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,281
Mom, I didn't know you were so young.

716
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,411
Throw away the broken bowl!

717
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,541
You appeared in my dreams when we moved here. Is it because we are leaving now that you are in my dreams again?

718
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,293
You are so stingy

719
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,005
You should come to my dreams more often.

720
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,341
Mom, I'm sad.

721
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,928
I have a lot to say to my mother.

722
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:19,641
What's the point of writing this? He doesn't even know the words.

723
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,478
How could he understand it if he had never learned to read?

724
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,106
(Genari Apartment 2402, Dodong-ri Goseon-yi)

725
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:30,193
In case he comes over during the holidays and is surprised to see his mother not at home

726
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,573
I don't want to scare the baby.

727
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,833
You and Kuan Shik still don't mention him?

728
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,714
Don't you talk to him about Tong Ming?

729
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,012
What's there to talk about?

730
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,974
We already know each other's feelings

731
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,729
Any sadness will become numb with time

732
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,065
But when the sadness is too deep...

733
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,816
When it's too deep

734
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,277
I can only bury

735
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,988
I just can't say it

736
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,328
Love Pure

737
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,206
You need to talk to him about this.

738
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,291
Tell it all

739
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,418
Even the deep sea

740
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:30,504
Also use the wave

741
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,381
Keep talking

742
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,307
I'm sorry to tell you this.

743
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:48,105
I know it's not fair but I can't help but think of you

744
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,691
But my child is not like that.

745
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,569
Children are impossible

746
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,125
I just hope you're doing well.

747
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,586
How will my child survive?

748
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,798
How did my child suffer?

749
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:22,514
I sometimes forget briefly

750
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,308
Only occasionally

751
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,523
Life must go on

752
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,594
(Monthly gains and losses)

753
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,806
tomorrow…

754
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,474
Hurry over here.

755
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,272
…life will continue under tomorrow’s scorching sun

756
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,190
careful

757
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:20,614
Why are there so many damn planes?

758
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,459
ladies and gentlemen

759
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,295
We have arrived at New Tokyo International Airport

760
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,089
Hey can you empty this ashtray? Yes sir

761
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,800
ladies and gentlemen

762
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,720
We have arrived at New Tokyo International Airport

763
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,263
(Open study abroad policy increases the number of students studying abroad)

764
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:49,142
It is 11:50 a.m. local time

765
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,899
Why did she wrap it layer after layer?

766
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,486
Why does she wrap it like this?

767
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,321
Really

768
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,523
Feed you crybaby

769
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,196
Thanks

770
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,114
You're welcome

771
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,301
I swallowed their dreams and spread my wings

772
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:08,847
Planted a seed in my heart and embraced my mother's dream

773
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,574
Is it funny? Do you think it's funny?

774
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,910
Study...

775
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:37,834
I wanted to go to school so badly.

776
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:44,507
But my daughter is going to study abroad now.

777
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,552
So exciting, right?

778
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,845
Isn’t it wonderful?

779
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,263
So you are happy?

780
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,480
mom!

781
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,691
mom!

782
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,403
My mother's dream was passed on to me

783
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,537
My mother's dream was passed on to me

784
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,756
A dream so heavy and dazzling

785
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:29,010
When you take off

786
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:33,014
I swear I felt like I was flying too

787
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,684
Finally the wings flew up

(Doto-ri Girls' High School)

790
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,077
Did you get Aichun's consent?

791
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,414
Why are writing competitions limited to children?

792
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:01,709
The sauce tastes better after fermentation. Only those who have experienced it will understand life better.

793
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,421
Children do not know the thorns and burdens of life

794
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,714
Please allow me to announce again

795
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,051
If there is a student named Wu Aichun

796
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,304
Please come to the teacher's office immediately

797
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,264
Wu Aichun

798
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,141
When students take exams

799
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:20,979
There are always some people who never write their grades and classes

800
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,481
No matter how many times you remind them

801
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:27,485
Did I ever tell you that you have to keep reminding them?

802
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,822
Did I say that?

803
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,159
Am I talking to a wall?

804
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,704
The champion is from our school but we can't find this student

805
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,248
How should I tell the principal?

806
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,833
(The sound of the wind whimpering in the spring breeze still echoes in the sky)

807
