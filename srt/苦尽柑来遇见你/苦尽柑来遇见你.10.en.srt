1
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,900
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,400
<i>The strongest wind is one</i>

3
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,900
<i>that blows within one's fist-sized heart.</i>

4
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Nothing could withstand such wind.</i>

5
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm completely innocent.

6
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,300
Looking up at the sky, I have…

7
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,800
no shame, you know.

8
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
So why?

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Why am I no longer chief
and just put out to pasture?

10
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,100
Hey, Park Yeong-ran.

11
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Get over here.

12
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,400
Are you ignoring me as well?

13
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,100
I said get over here.

14
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,600
What the heck do you do at home?

15
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,700
You eat white rice with my money,
and you can't even handle one kid?

16
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,700
That brat definitely takes after you.

17
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,100
I know everything!

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,700
Just sleep if you're drunk!

19
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,000
What was that, punk?
Whose kid are you anyway?

20
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,100
-Whose side are you on?
-Father, do you even know how old I am?

21
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,200
Hey!

22
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,400
You punk!

23
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,200
You never once came to my sports days.
Maybe you never saw me as your kid.

24
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,700
When you're fooling around enjoying
spring flowers and snowy mountains…

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,300
"Fooling around"?

26
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,500
Mom never missed a day
packing us a hot lunch.

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,900
Hey!

28
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,600
Who brought your new mother
into this house, huh?

29
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,800
Your stepmom can be replaced anytime,

30
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,300
but you and I are family by blood!

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,500
-If you two split up, I'm going with Mom.
-What was that, punk?

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,600
I'm only treating you like a father
because Mom lives with you.

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,100
Fetch the broom.

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,200
Where's the broom, huh?

35
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,700
Oh-seong, go to your room.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
You shouldn't talk like that.

37
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Split up with him!
What are you holding onto?

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm going to stay with your father.

39
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,900
I'm staying with him.

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,100
Darn it!

41
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,700
That's right!

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,000
You'd never survive without me.

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,400
You all eat well, thanks to my money.

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Don't you?

45
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,300
You even eat white rice!

46
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,100
I have to stay.

47
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,000
I have to live with him.

48
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,700
Goddamn it!

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,300
I'll spend the rest of my life with him

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,400
and see how it all ends.

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,100
KNOCK
YOU BETTER KNOCK

52
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,300
Get out.

53
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,500
You little…

54
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,000
I wish I could knock you out
with a flying kick.

55
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,600
I said get out!

56
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,500
Seriously.

57
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Oh man.

58
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,000
Mom!

59
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,800
I'd have given you a beating
if you were Han-eum. You know that?

60
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,300
You look like an army sergeant,
and you're dating?

61
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,300
Why do you even have
this actress's picture?

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,600
You'd need to be born again
to look like her.

63
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,500
Get out of my room!

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,100
How are you involved
with that family's son?

65
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,600
You fool. You know, his mother and our…

66
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,700
-Damn it.
-What about his mom?

67
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,200
You guys won't work out anyway.

68
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,700
You'll be mortified later.

69
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,500
Stop this bullshit
while I'm still being nice.

70
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,200
Why won't we work out anyway?

71
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,600
Go tell him…

72
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,200
<i>I will kill him if I ever see him.</i>

73
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,200
Let's just break up.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,600
No, I don't want to! Why?

75
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,600
Because of those bastards
Oh-seong and Han-eum?

76
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,300
Or because of my father?

77
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,200
My father is my father, but I'm me.

78
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
I never listen to him anyway.

79
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,700
Listen, don't go around
saying you're my girlfriend anymore.

80
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Don't cut in line at the cafeteria
thinking I've got your back.

81
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,100
Only go to the roller rink in Ssangbong.

82
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,400
No, I'm still gonna do it.

83
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,100
You can't date anyone but me anyway.

84
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
If you do, I'll beat them up.

85
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,100
You think I won't?

86
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,900
You think I won't?

87
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I think you will.

88
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,700
No, I can't break up with you.

89
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,300
I won't.

90
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,100
-One last thing, Bu Hyeon-suk.
-What?

91
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,300
Stay healthy.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,800
They're crying.

93
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,600
You son of a bitch!

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,700
Don't ever let me see you again.

95
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,200
I will kill you!

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,600
You're breaking up with me
just because you got beat up?

97
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,200
I'll tell them to keep beating you up!

98
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,800
Every single time they see you!

99
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,000
You don't know how much it hurts!

100
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,900
We can just run away from them.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,100
Make sure they don't catch you.

102
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,800
The arcade, the roller rink, downtown.
I can't go anywhere.

103
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,500
Your brothers' friends keep showing up.

104
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,700
I got on the bus yesterday,

105
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,100
and the driver was one of their friends.

106
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,800
He told me not to get off the bus
until the last stop!

107
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,100
Damn it! How can I keep living like this?

108
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
I have my own life too.

109
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Then run away.

110
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,500
Let's run away.

111
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,000
-What?
-I can't live like this either.

112
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,800
My father even removed my bedroom door.

113
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,300
You want to run away?

114
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,900
My dad said if I see you again,

115
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,600
he'll shave my head
and send me to a Buddhist temple.

116
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,700
You believe him?

117
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,000
Then all your friends
would be Buddhist nuns by now.

118
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,000
Do we run away or not?

119
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,300
Are you going to run away or not?

120
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I don't know. Damn it!

121
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,500
Keep honking.

122
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
Keep honking the horn.

123
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,600
Keep honking.

124
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,400
Man, they look like
the center of the Korean flag.

125
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,200
Come on. Those were the days!

126
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,900
Apparently,
this is the spring of their lives.

127
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,700
Is it because it's their spring,
or is it in their blood?

128
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,100
I love you.

129
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,700
I love you too.

130
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,300
<i>Looking back, spring was like a feast.</i>

131
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,300
Welcome home, son.

132
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,800
<i>But for the budding sprouts, it's a war.</i>

133
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,700
Hello.

134
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,900
Do you frequent this place too?

135
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,100
<i>A trial for the new buds that push</i>
<i>their heads through the concrete.</i>

136
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,500
You can't even use the ladle properly.

137
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Your mom didn't teach you?

138
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
It's just that the seaweed is all tangled.

139
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,500
Don't use your hands!

140
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
We don't do that in our family.

141
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,000
You're really both here.

142
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,100
This really is a happy birthday.

143
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,600
<i>Only one person was happy in that house.</i>

144
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,900
The kimchi tastes so good.

145
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Good kimchi is hard to find in Seoul.

146
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,200
I mean, I'm not saying
all kimchi in Seoul is bad.

147
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,300
I bought it.

148
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,300
I haven't had a homemade meal in a while.
I feel like I can eat two bowls.

149
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,500
We're light eaters.

150
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,600
Do your parents know
you frequent a guy's apartment like this?

151
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,400
She doesn't come over often.
It's my birthday, so I asked her to come.

152
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,200
Did I ask you?

153
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,300
Geum-myeong.

154
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,100
This isn't Yeong-beom's apartment.
It's mine.

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,400
An apartment I got for him.

156
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,100
I don't want you frequenting my apartment.

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,700
-Mother.
-It's my apartment.

158
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,800
And I don't want you here.

159
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,000
Sure, keep dating.
Learn how relationships work.

160
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,000
I told you. I plan to marry Geum-myeong--

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Quiet.

162
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,900
You wanted a place near your school,
and it was just for this…

163
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,500
Just for this.

164
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
You are my pride.

165
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,500
Now my pride is bruised.

166
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
<i>Each had their heart rocked by love,</i>

167
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,000
<i>and a storm swept through their heart.</i>

168
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,600
Does your family own a conglomerate?
Like Samsung or Hyundai?

169
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,000
How much richer
could your family be than mine?

170
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,500
We go to the same school,
and I'm just as precious to my parents.

171
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,500
Why should I be ashamed
that I can't ladle soup?

172
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Are you better at it?
Did your mother teach you?

173
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,900
I'm not good at ladling either.

174
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,000
So unfair.

175
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,500
I hate everything about this.

176
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
I feel like I've become a cheap clown.

177
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,600
I can't stand groveling
in front of a person

178
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,600
who won't like me anyway,
no matter what I do.

179
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,200
I hate it so much!

180
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,800
DIGESTIVE DRINK

181
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,900
Why did you eat so much?

182
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,300
I wanted to impress her.

183
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,300
Of course I did!

184
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,100
Who wouldn't want to impress
her boyfriend's mother?

185
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,700
Who would want to marry
the pride of his mother?

186
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,700
Just choose one.

187
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,900
Be a good son or a good husband.

188
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
You can only be one.

189
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,400
I don't want a man
who's just a little nice to everyone.

190
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,700
Forget the proposal.
Choose one first before anything else.

191
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,000
Well, who in the world
would choose one over the other?

192
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,400
No man would--

193
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
My dad.

194
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,100
What?

195
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,100
My dad did.

196
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,800
I see.

197
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,100
Let me make myself clear.

198
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,800
I won't marry your mother's son.

199
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,500
<i>It was a time</i>
<i>when everything felt so sincere,</i>

200
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,300
<i>like a little owl crying all night</i>
<i>at the slightest breeze.</i>

201
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,200
<i>This is Kim Gi-deok on Two O'clock Date.</i>

202
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,600
<i>I believe the '90s are truly</i>
<i>the renaissance of pop culture.</i>

203
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,100
<i>The winds of change are here.</i>

204
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,800
I love this painting.

205
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,700
I guess he won't be Picasso anymore.

206
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
See?

207
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,500
You can do your job properly.

208
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,800
It's so obvious what the movie is about.

209
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,600
Just looking at this
makes me want to do the Lambada.

210
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Great job!

211
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,100
That lady's back again.

212
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,600
She somehow always knows the release day.

213
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,700
Where does she get the resale tickets?

214
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,300
I've never sold her any tickets before.

215
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,600
Maybe they're counterfeit?

216
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,800
We don't want any.

217
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,100
No, that's…

218
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
-We don't want resale tickets.
-That's not…

219
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,400
Does that look like Choi Jin-sil?

220
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,100
Does it look like Choi Jin-sil?

221
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,700
-I think it looks like her.
-It's a job well done, then.

222
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
-Sorry?
-Or is it bad?

223
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,300
No, I guess not.

224
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,000
Apparently, it was painted
by a college art major.

225
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,700
Right.

226
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,300
Why do people go in without looking?
Is everyone busy or something?

227
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,500
It makes me a little sad that people
don't even glance at the painting.

228
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,600
It really does.

229
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,300
<i>A Picasso lived in the basement</i>
<i>of the Cannes Theater,</i>

230
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,000
<i>and for someone,</i>
<i>this theater was their Louvre.</i>

231
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,900
Stop selling resale tickets!
I said stop it!

232
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,400
Scalping is a nuisance to society!

233
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,200
No resale tickets!

234
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,500
I said no!

235
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,300
Does he really think I'm a scalper?

236
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,700
Since you're here,
it would be nice to watch a movie.

237
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,600
I hear this movie
coming out in two days is great.

238
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,500
It's being rereleased
due to its popularity.

239
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,300
You shouldn't give out tickets to anyone.

240
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,000
But you're not just anyone.

241
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,900
This is an employee benefit
offered by the owner himself!

242
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,900
Come at 2:00 p.m. on Monday.
It's normally empty then.

243
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
It'll feel like you rented the theater.

244
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,400
I'd prefer it if you didn't tell my son
I came here to see his paintings.

245
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,300
Chung-seop doesn't know I come here.

246
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,100
He leaves with his packed lunch
and comes home covered in paint.

247
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,300
He never tells me what he paints or where.
He says he's embarrassed.

248
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,000
Does just anyone get to paint
such big pictures?

249
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
-If they paint, they're painters.
-Of course.

250
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,800
He painted that so well.
I'm just dying to see what he does.

251
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,100
I've seen everything Chung-seop
has painted since elementary school.

252
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,500
That's been my joy.

253
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,000
These days, movie release days are my joy.

254
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,400
PROMOTIONAL TICKET

255
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,400
Our theater would be ruined
without Artist Park.

256
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,300
Sir, you're not from Seoul, are you?

257
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,200
Honestly.

258
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,800
-Wow.
-Wow!

259
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,400
What is it this time?

260
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,400
Did Eun-myeong sell something
at school again?

261
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Eun-myeong's mom.

262
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,900
Don't call me that from now on.

263
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,600
Should we just call you Geum-myeong's mom?

264
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,500
No calls from Seoul?

265
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,300
Geum-myeong has a boyfriend, I swear.

266
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
She's forgotten Mom and Dad already.

267
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,800
Goodness me. It's so unfair.

268
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,000
It's as if she's doing us a favor
by calling us first.

269
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,200
They are only children
when they're in your arms.

270
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,400
Once they leave,
they're busier than the president.

271
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,300
My children are
the busiest people in the world.

272
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,500
What, did you have another bad dream?

273
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,900
Why did the school call you this time?
Is he bottom of his class again?

274
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,800
He's never bottom of his class.

275
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,600
Cheol-yong is in that class.

276
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,800
It's about cigarettes.

277
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,500
You said you wouldn't tell.

278
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,900
Does that little punk smoke?

279
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,000
He doesn't smoke!

280
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,800
He sold them.

281
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,600
-He sold cigarettes.
-Wow.

282
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,300
AUNTIES' SEAFOOD HOUSE

283
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,900
He really is something.

284
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,300
Isn't the seller more impressive
than the smoker?

285
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,200
He lied to the old man at the variety shop
about the cigarettes being for us,

286
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,700
then bought them
and basically made a delivery.

287
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,000
They say he sold them at a markup.

288
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Personally, I'm more curious
about what Eun-myeong will become

289
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,900
than Geum-myeong.

290
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,800
Have you asked why he does it?

291
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,400
What do you mean "why"?

292
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,900
He's just an angsty teenager
acting entitled.

293
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,700
I mean, have you ever asked
why he desperately needs money?

294
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't know why he's obsessed with money!

295
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,700
That's why you should ask.

296
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,300
You gave birth to his body, not his mind.

297
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,000
You know,
you're helpless with Geum-myeong,

298
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,800
but a boss to Eun-myeong.

299
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,700
You handle picky Geum-myeong
like soft tofu,

300
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,100
and easygoing Eun-myeong
like a radish being tossed around.

301
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,800
Geum-myeong takes after me
and is a bit emotionally sensitive,

302
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,500
and Eun-myeong is, you know--

303
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
A pushover?

304
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,700
I don't think that!

305
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,500
A radish may look fine
no matter how many times it falls,

306
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,700
but even the sturdiest radish
can crack inside.

307
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,900
Don't treat your children differently.

308
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,200
Children… remember everything.

309
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,900
It's because I'm upset too.

310
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,200
I can't help but get more mad
about the one I worry about the most.

311
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,000
So it has nothing to do

312
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,100
with Geum-myeong making you proud
and Eun-myeong embarrassing you?

313
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,200
So what if it does? Am I a saint?

314
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,500
What could I possibly do?

315
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,300
<i>…may be the star of tomorrow.</i>

316
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,000
<i>A choice ahead of its time.</i>

317
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,400
<i>High-performance Elantra.</i>

318
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,500
So…

319
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm in your debt once again.
I don't know how I'll repay you.

320
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,400
There's no need.

321
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,800
But I'd still like to…

322
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,900
Then could you paint something for me
when you have time?

323
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,100
So I can sell it for a high price someday.

324
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,700
I heard Picasso's work
became more valuable after he died.

325
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,700
But there's no guarantee I'll die first…

326
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
-Was that a joke?
-Yeah.

327
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,100
-I should go back to the box office.
-Well…

328
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,000
What is it?

329
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,000
Thank you, really.

330
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,800
There's no need.
I didn't spend my own money or anything.

331
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,400
No, I mean, my mother…

332
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,900
It's her first time
seeing a movie in a theater.

333
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,100
Mister! You have to run.

334
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,500
Oh no, you have to run!

335
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Even though she watches
<i>The Weekend Classic Movie every week.</i>

336
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
I guess

337
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,100
I'd been so focused on my own life.

338
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,300
<i>Each person was swayed</i>
<i>by the love in their heart.</i>

339
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,900
You know what?

340
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,700
I started crying when the projectionist
walked in with shades on.

341
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,000
Alfredo?

342
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,900
Why wasn't there a fire extinguisher
in the projection room?

343
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,200
Why put out the fire?
He should've saved himself.

344
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,100
He should've jumped out the window.

345
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Then he would've only broken his legs.

346
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,900
I wonder what he did
after losing his projectionist job.

347
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,400
Maybe Toto sent him money
because he's kind.

348
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,000
Did you cry because
you thought Alfredo might be broke?

349
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,100
You know, Toto

350
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,000
reminds me of you.

351
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
Toto is like my son.

352
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
What did you want to give to Ms. Yang?

353
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
I'll give it to her.

354
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,700
Did you say you're an English major?

355
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,600
Yes.

356
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,800
PHOTOCOPY, PRINTING, BINDING

357
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,000
You can rely on me until you graduate.

358
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,800
These are all in English.
People just won't pick them up.

359
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,500
It'd cost a fortune to buy them all.

360
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,600
English ones are even more expensive.

361
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,600
There are some study notes in here too.

362
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,600
I'm not sure if I can accept all of these.

363
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,100
So this is why parents love daughters.

364
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm here all the time,
so every day feels the same.

365
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,300
The only special thing I did
was to see new paintings on premiere days.

366
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,300
But I was truly happy today,
thanks to you, Ms. Yang.

367
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,000
I think I'll remember this day
until I draw my last breath.

368
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,400
Hearing you say that

369
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,900
makes me feel like

370
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,300
I've done something extraordinary.

371
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,700
Mother, that's enough.

372
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,200
How can she carry them all?

373
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,200
She can't carry them alone.

374
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
She can't.

375
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,000
How about a drink?

376
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,300
Well, a drink…

377
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,600
-Maybe we shouldn't?
-Here you are.

378
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah, that's a bit…

379
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
All right, then.

380
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
You know…

381
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,300
Yes?

382
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
If you're grateful,

383
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,100
maybe clear my name
instead of buying noodles?

384
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,200
The landlord's daughter
keeps kicking my shoes outside my door.

385
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,700
She knows that there's nothing between us.

386
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,900
I guess

387
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,200
she wants to get married
without feeling guilty.

388
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,800
So you're sending off your girlfriend
to marry someone else?

389
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,700
You must have

390
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,500
a really big heart.

391
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,600
She's marrying
the son of a noodle shop owner.

392
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Do they make a fortune selling noodles?

393
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,700
The Pildong Noodles chain.

394
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,500
It's a perfect family to marry into,

395
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
but she can't

396
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,300
bring herself to do it.

397
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,900
Then just hold onto her.

398
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,300
It's her fate if she dumps Picasso
and goes to the noodle guy.

399
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,000
Tell her to her face,

400
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,600
"Leave if you want.
It's your loss, not mine."

401
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,500
You should bring a gift and say,
"Please let me marry your daughter."

402
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,300
That way,
at least you won't have any regrets.

403
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,100
How would you know
if I'm better than the noodle guy?

404
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,000
You don't know me very well.

405
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,900
You're really precious to your mom.

406
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,100
That's why you paint everything
however you please.

407
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,900
That's just deeply rooted guts, you know?

408
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,300
I'm precious to my parents too.

409
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,600
I'd just like to think

410
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,000
that holding my head high
and living my life

411
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,000
is what keeps my folks' pride intact.

412
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,400
At least I'd like to think so.

413
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,100
You know, you don't need to take sides
with someone you barely know.

414
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,800
It's not like I don't know.

415
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,100
People are the same, after all.

416
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
No, they are different.

417
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,500
Everyone has a dark side, after all.

418
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,600
<i>It was a time</i>
<i>when strangers were dangerous,</i>

419
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,700
<i>and kindness from a stranger</i>
<i>was dangerous.</i>

420
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,300
<i>Less than three months after a 13-year-old</i>
<i>was killed in the Hwaseong serial murders…</i>

421
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,500
Oh my. I'm so sorry again.

422
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,400
Yes, please let me know. Please.

423
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,000
Those bastards should be beaten to death!

424
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,700
The phrase "beaten to death"
exists for a reason.

425
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,100
How bad must they be?

426
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,100
Is that right? Okay, I see.

427
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,700
When Geum-myeoung gets back,

428
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,900
could you please ask her to call--

429
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,800
Yes, okay. Thank you.

430
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,400
When you kidnap a child,

431
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,700
you're taking three lives, not just one.

432
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,400
How can parents cope with losing a child?

433
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,400
I mean, losing a child
is devastating in itself,

434
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
but to lose your child like that…

435
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,800
Goodness me.

436
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,000
Why? Is Geum-myeong out late again?

437
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,100
I don't understand
why she's out so late at night.

438
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,300
I told her to stay home at night.

439
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,100
What's wrong?
Do you keep having bad dreams?

440
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,600
About what?

441
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,100
Maybe you feel that way
because the ancestral rite has come up.

442
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Something odd happened to you
at an ancestral rite as a child.

443
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,600
On Aegi Hill?

444
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,400
We were there together, right?

445
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,900
Goodness, just thinking about it
gives me the chills.

446
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,900
I can still remember the smells
from that day.

447
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,900
Hurry! They put meat
on the ancestral rite table.

448
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,500
My father will give it all to my brother.

449
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,700
Only people can see that black dragonfly.

450
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,000
They say other dragonflies can't see it.

451
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,000
Why not?

452
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,400
Because it's the Grim Reaper
of dragonflies.

453
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,500
We humans can't see
the Grim Reaper either, you know.

454
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,900
What is it? Are you going to catch it?

455
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,800
You go ahead.

456
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,100
Let's just go!

457
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,200
If I catch it,

458
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,200
it won't be able to take
the other dragonflies.

459
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,700
Baby dragonflies would want to live
with their mom and dad too.

460
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,900
Father is going to scold you again.

461
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,300
<i>Is that what people call being possessed?</i>

462
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,400
<i>I don't know why I chased it.</i>

463
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,700
AEGI HILL
BUS STOP

464
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,000
I need to take the bus, but my legs hurt.

465
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,600
Could you go to the store

466
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,500
to exchange this for ten-hwan coins?

467
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,600
What did the store owner say?

468
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,100
That it's not his job to change coins.

469
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,300
-Did he scold you?
-No.

470
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,700
But he did give me a side-eye.

471
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
For your trouble.

472
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,500
You're really kind and so gentle.

473
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,900
You listen well, don't you?

474
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,800
But

475
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,900
you don't have to give me this.

476
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,900
Then, can you do it once more?

477
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,400
I need to take two buses.

478
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,100
Since the store owner
didn't like giving change,

479
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,600
you can find the cabbage truck vendor
in the alley behind the telephone pole.

480
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,800
Could you get some change from that man?

481
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,900
Then I'll give you another one.

482
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
It's just that my legs hurt.

483
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,300
What are you doing here?

484
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,500
-Mom.
-What are you doing?

485
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,600
-What about you, Mom?
-What's this money?

486
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,900
-Mister!
-What? You know that man?

487
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,500
That lady was just here.

488
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,000
<i>Gwang-rye said her heart was pounding,</i>

489
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,000
<i>but she said nothing</i>
<i>so she wouldn't scare you.</i>

490
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,700
But, Mom, what are you doing here?

491
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,900
<i>It was such an odd coincidence.</i>

492
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,700
<i>I was in a neighborhood I'd never been to,</i>

493
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,200
<i>and I ran into my mom,</i>
<i>who would never go there.</i>

494
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,300
<i>You still don't know, do you?</i>

495
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,500
<i>Your mother went out</i>
<i>to look for you that day.</i>

496
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,600
I don't need to get firewood,
thanks to you, Sister.

497
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,000
Don't call her sister anymore.

498
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,600
We still have the firewood
you brought before.

499
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,100
It's the least she can do.

500
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,100
Her child has been living and eating here
for free for years now.

501
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,400
She should at least do that
for child support.

502
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,900
Don't make Ae-sun carry wood.

503
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,800
Replace the jeongjong with makgeolli.

504
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,000
Han-gyu likes makgeolli better.

505
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Where's Ae-sun?

506
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:45,200
It's her father's ancestral rite,
but all she cares about is going out.

507
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,500
Where's Ae-sun?
There's meat soup. Where is she?

508
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,400
She went after a Grim Reaper dragonfly.

509
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
What?

510
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,500
<i>A mother's instinct is a scary thing.</i>

511
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,400
<i>Apparently, she ran over a mountain</i>
<i>in no time.</i>

512
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
You should be the one
eating Dad's meat soup.

513
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
Why wander around instead?

514
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Give it to me.

515
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,200
Why? This one is mine.

516
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,600
It's bad luck.

517
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,000
How did you know I was here?

518
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,100
I have eyes in the back of my head.
That's what it takes to be a mom.

519
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,500
Do you think she'll come to get her money?

520
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,900
-Ae-sun.
-Yes?

521
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,600
Did she see your face?

522
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,400
Yes.

523
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,800
What did she look like?

524
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,600
She had a pale face,
and on her wrist, something strange…

525
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,900
<i>You think your mom would let someone off</i>
<i>for messing with her child?</i>

526
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,700
Here, check it out!

527
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,900
Come see! We'll give you the best.
Fresh from the haenyeo!

528
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,300
Three for 50 hwan. Here you go.

529
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,800
I don't care.

530
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,200
Just give me one more.

531
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,400
Come on,
we put our lives on the line for these.

532
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,100
Forget it, then.

533
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,100
Goodness me!

534
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,400
My goodness!

535
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,600
Hey! Are you going to check the wrist
of every woman in Jeju?

536
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,700
Seriously!

537
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,400
You're driving all our customers away
by yanking their wrists.

538
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,000
Are you selling conches
to catch the culprit?

539
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,800
That bitch saw Ae-sun's face.

540
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,800
I'm going to buy some conches.

541
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,900
They're practically free!

542
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,000
What's your price?

543
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,600
What's your offer?

544
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,300
Hey, I sent the boat back.

545
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,500
Why do you always go after the young ones?

546
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Is there an age limit for begging?

547
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,900
You touch it, you buy it. Okay?

548
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,000
They don't listen as they get older.
Kind kids who are so gentle are the best.

549
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,100
That girl was just perfect.

550
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,800
What the hell?

551
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,400
-What is it?
-Come on!

552
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,800
Let's make a sale
before you yank her wrist!

553
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,200
You must've lost your mind.

554
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,900
Are you out of your mind? Let her go!

555
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
What the hell? How are you so strong?

556
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,300
You should be beaten to death, bitch!

557
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,200
You were going to make my daughter
beg for money?

558
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,400
These scumbags! Get that bastard!
They need to be beaten to death!

559
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,700
You bastard, get over here!

560
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
You bitch!

561
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,900
<i>So what happened?</i>

562
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,200
<i>There were no open endings</i>
<i>in fairy tales back then.</i>

563
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,400
<i>She beat her to death. Obviously.</i>

564
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,200
<i>She beat her to death?</i>

565
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,600
<i>Those scumbags deserved</i>
<i>to be beaten to death, didn't they?</i>

566
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,000
Don't ever come back here, you bastard!

567
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,400
Die, you bitch!

568
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,200
At the time, the country didn't have
much of a legal system,

569
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,700
so the police didn't say much
if you beat up those who deserved it.

570
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,700
Even if you left someone half-dead,

571
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,500
the cops would clean up the mess
and take them away.

572
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,900
The cops themselves
used to beat people up.

573
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,500
It happened to be the day
of Han-gyu's ancestral rite.

574
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,200
Your mom said that your father saved you.

575
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,500
But I don't think so.

576
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,500
It was your mom who saved her child.

577
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Nothing beats a mother's instinct.

578
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,100
Oh dear.

579
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,400
Mother wakes up this late.

580
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,800
She may forget everything else,

581
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,500
but she never forgets
the day her eldest son visits.

582
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Nothing beats a mother's instinct.

583
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,900
My mom told me back then

584
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,800
<i>that you need eyes</i>
<i>in the back of your head</i>

585
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,800
to be a mother.

586
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,600
<i>Hey, you have a call.</i>

587
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,900
Okay.

588
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,100
For goodness' sake.

589
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Do people in Jeju not watch Eyes of Dawn?

590
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,600
She always calls when this show is on.

591
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,700
Yeah, everything's fine.

592
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,200
What could possibly happen
in just one day?

593
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,100
EYES OF DAWN

594
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,000
Are you going to call me
every time you have a dream?

595
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,100
Why are you always home late these days?
Where do you go wandering every night?

596
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,400
I don't go wandering.

597
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,700
<i>Did they fix the light in your alley?</i>

598
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,800
<i>It's a scary world out there.</i>
<i>Be home early.</i>

599
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,500
<i>Make sure you sleep at home.</i>

600
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,200
No staying out overnight.
I'll know if you do.

601
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,700
Do you call every night
to see if I'm only having fun?

602
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,700
<i>You're not seeing anyone, are you?</i>

603
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,700
I won't be able to handle it
if you upset me too.

604
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,600
<i>You are your mom and dad's pride.</i>

605
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,800
<i>All my hope is in you,</i>
<i>so if the pillar starts acting up--</i>

606
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,100
That damn pillar…

607
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,500
Am I everything in your life?

608
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,000
<i>Don't you have a life of your own?</i>
<i>Think about it.</i>

609
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,200
Even if I stay out all night,
you can't do anything from there.

610
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,500
<i>If I wanted to fool you,</i>
<i>I could do it 100 or 1,000 times.</i>

611
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
Good for you.

612
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,600
<i>So stop fussing over it, please.</i>

613
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,000
<i>You need to live your own life.</i>

614
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,800
Wait until you have a kid.

615
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,200
Wait until you have a daughter
just like you!

616
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,800
You wear these hairpins every day
and lose them every day.

617
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,100
Why do I bother buying them for you?
You lose them every day.

618
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,300
She thinks she's the only great one.

619
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,900
I saw this at the hardware store,
so I bought one.

620
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Visit her in Seoul
and install it yourself.

621
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm sure she can do it herself
since she's so great.

622
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,800
I'm the only fool for making a fuss.

623
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,100
They are only children
when they're in your arms.

624
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,400
She's the one growing up, not me.

625
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,800
My heart is still the same.

626
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,800
Is this about that dream?

627
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,200
What is this dream you keep having?

628
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,000
Why won't you say anything?
Is the dream that bad these days?

629
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,200
It's not a bad dream.

630
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,100
It's nothing much.

631
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,600
Mom!

632
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,400
Mom!

633
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,400
Mom.

634
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,700
I told you I'd give you candy
after you finish your sujebi, didn't I?

635
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,600
Why don't you ever listen to Mommy?

636
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,800
Mommy, give me a hug.

637
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,300
Ms. Oh! Geum-myeong was in an accident!

638
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,200
Is she bleeding?

639
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,900
I told you I'd give you candy
after you finish your sujebi, didn't I?

640
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,800
Why don't you ever listen to Mommy?

641
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,400
Another bad dream?

642
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,100
Oh dear.

643
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,200
What dreams have you been having lately?

644
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,200
…I'd give you candy
after you finish your sujebi.

645
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,300
Ms. Oh! Geum-myeong was in an accident!

646
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,300
Is she bleeding?

647
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,400
Baby.

648
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,400
Mommy…

649
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,900
is going to get your sister
and come right back.

650
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,200
Okay?

651
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,000
I'll go get her.

652
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,600
When I get back,

653
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,600
I'll give you candy every day.

654
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,400
Okay?

655
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,300
<i>Mom, by mere coincidence,</i>

656
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,700
<i>has lost immeasurable things.</i>

657
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,500
<i>That's why she fussed even more,</i>

658
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,700
<i>believing that restless worry</i>
<i>could prevent even coincidences.</i>

659
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,000
Geum-myeong.

660
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,400
Baby.

661
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,200
Baby.

662
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,100
Baby.

663
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,800
Baby!

664
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,500
Oh no. Good heavens.

665
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,700
My baby. Oh my God.

666
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,700
Help!

667
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,400
Help!

668
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,800
Baby.

669
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,500
What's wrong with him?

670
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Baby.

671
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,300
The doctor.

672
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,300
We need to call the doctor.

673
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,100
An ambulance.

674
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,600
An ambulance. Call an…

675
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Gwan-sik, call an ambulance.

676
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,000
Why won't anyone call the ambulance?

677
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,200
Geum-myeong.

678
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,300
Help!

679
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,800
Help! Ambulance!

680
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,300
Someone, call an ambulance!

681
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,300
Ambulance!

682
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,800
Baby!

683
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,400
Look, you can't just be walking
through there like this…

684
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,300
What?

685
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,600
She's inhaled coal gas!

686
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,600
What? Oh no!

687
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,600
San-108, Bongcheon 5-dong.

688
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,900
108!

689
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,300
108! Yes!

690
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,700
No, there are stairs here!

691
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,100
You can't drive up here.

692
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,100
Yes.

693
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,100
<i>It was a time</i>
<i>when genuine kindness froze over…</i>

694
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,600
Oh no.

695
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,600
Baby, Mom's here.

696
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,800
Mom's right here.

697
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,500
<i>…the year Korea's three major</i>
<i>unsolved cases occurred,</i>

698
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,500
<i>Mom called me every night</i>
<i>after the nine o'clock news.</i>

699
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,300
Here, we're over here!

700
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,800
<i>Her relentless worry was tiresome.</i>

701
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,300
Sir! Please help us!

702
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,800
<i>But… it was the same relentless worry</i>
<i>that saved me again.</i>

703
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,200
Why is it so quiet?

704
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,700
Baby.

705
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,500
Oh no, baby!

706
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,500
Baby. Oh dear.

707
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,600
Are you okay? My goodness.

708
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,300
<i>Just like that,</i>
<i>she's saved me time and again.</i>

709
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,100
Oh no!

710
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,900
Oh no. Honey!

711
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,600
-Are you okay?
<i>-You better be a good daughter.</i>

712
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,700
What great person are you trying to be,
causing trouble so well?

713
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,500
Will it leave a scar?

714
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,100
You're worried about her scar?
She's lucky it wasn't worse.

715
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,600
No one would believe it if you said
you caught a kid jumping off the roof.

716
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,300
Mom, Dad.

717
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,300
Oh dear.

718
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,400
Why was she on the roof this time?

719
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,300
She kept insisting she was a magpie.

720
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,200
My little baby got stitches.
I can't even imagine how much it hurts.

721
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,900
<i>It was only much later,</i>

722
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,000
<i>when I could no longer answer her calls,</i>

723
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,900
<i>that I deeply missed her relentless worry.</i>

724
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,300
I'm so sorry.

725
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,200
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

726
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,700
It's okay.

727
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,700
<i>Her delicate heart sank countless times.</i>

728
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,300
<i>I wish I'd shown her</i>
<i>a bit more appreciation.</i>

729
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,100
<i>Regret arrived too late once again.</i>

730
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,400
"JUST GET READY AND GO,
RIDE THE MOMENT WITH ALL YOU HAVE."
