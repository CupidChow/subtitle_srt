So that's why you have brought me here.

You couldn't leave that child on her own.

She'll become an orphan,

252

and she's only ten years old.

253
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,132

then you give it to her

as you would have given it to Han-gyu.

That's all I ask. Just one time.

00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,727
-Yes!
-That's right, yes!

700
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,896
What have I got to lose? All right.

701
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,773
May the best candidate win.

702
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:47,695
The girl challenging the village chief
is Gwang-rye's daughter!

703
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,656
You're joking. A woman as village chief?

704
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,659
What? Are you afraid?

705
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,079
[scoffs] Afraid?

706
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,456
Goodness.

707
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,583
How dare you!

708
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,543
If you're not afraid of it, let's vote.

709
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,336
You? You'll run against me?

710
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,422
Ooh.

711
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,175
You wanna run against me, yup?

712
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:10,968
You?

713
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,219
W… w… what?

714
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,055
I'd let her be deputy chief if I were you.

715
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,266
Don't embarrass yourself
by losing the vote.

716
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,226
[all laughing]

717
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,104
[laughs unconvincingly]

718
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,191
I never knew Ae-sun was such a comedian!

719
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,276

723
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:43,083

<i>its first female deputy chief.</i>

724
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,545
[photographer] Hey, come on.
Stop talking and look straight ahead.

725
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,714
Look this way.

726
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,008
Tall people move to the back of the line.

727
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,219
If you're shorter, come up front. Okay?

728
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,138
Hey, come on. Squeeze in. Squeeze in.

729
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,307
-[photographer] One, two.
-[camera shutter clicks]

730
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,018
Hey! Count to three
and then take the picture.

731
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:01,977
Are you stupid?

732
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,272
[photographer] All right.
Everyone, look here.

733
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,191
One, two, three.

734
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,442

737
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,740
[Gyeong-ja] Shut up. You're coming with me
straight out the front door!

738
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,992
Stop talking and move it! Move!

739
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,625
-I got 'em. Hurry up and take the picture!
-[Sang-gil] Here come the delinquents now.

740
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,126
Look at 'em. Look at 'em!

741
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,753
Take the picture. Stop talking!

742
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,838
[Sang-gil] All right,
bring 'em here, right here.

743
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,258
Shut your mouth and sit down.

744
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,343
-Hurry!
-Gather them all like a pile of crap.

745
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,762
-A runner!
-That's enough! You can settle down now.

746
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,515
There's more down there.
We should check. Out of my way.

747
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,849
[Gyeong-ja] Check inside.

748
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,143
There has to be a few more.

749
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,231
Hey, is someone in there? Move aside.

750
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,233
Wait, hey!

751
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,193
That's the ladies' room, you weirdo.

752
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,989
You little brat.
How dare you call me a weirdo!

753
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,907
The ladies' room is my jurisdiction.

754
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,117
[sighs]

755
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,703
You have a crush on me or what?

756
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,788
Why do you always show up everywhere I go?

757
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,498
Just go away.

758
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,584
Go live somewhere else on the island.

759
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,171
What? You still think of me?

760
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,012
Second thoughts?

761
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,190
Hey, why'd you pinch your nose?

762
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,359
Why'd you pinch your nose?

763
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,737
I was talking to you, you brat!

764
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,870
-[knocking on door]
-Come on out.

765
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,747
It's all over now.

766
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,249
You have been surrounded already.

767
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,212
Is someone in there or not?

768
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:01,764
Huh?

769
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,142
Those feet…

770
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,186
[child coughs]

771
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,147
[Sang-gil] The hell with ballroom dancing.

772
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,150
We never needed dancing
to mingle back in my day.

773
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,985
Ever since the New Community Movement,

774
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,655
you people have gotten
way too comfortable.

775
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,865
You think life is one big party every day?

776
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,785
No one would've done this in the war.

777
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,120
Send these go-go dancers
to the Northern border.

778
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,330
[camera shutter clicks]

779
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,291
You're supposed to count to three.
I already told you so!

780
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:36,882
[gasps]

781
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,011
[groans] I don't believe it.

00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,099
[groans, sighs]

783
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,517
You're kidding!

784
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,520
What are you doing here?
What are we supposed to do?

785
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,105
-[tense music playing]
-[Ae-sun groans]

786
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,774
What are we supposed to do now?

787
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,527
[Ae-sun sighs]

788
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,029
Fine. This is crazy.

789
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:01,824
[door lock clicks]

790
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,660
[sighs]

791
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,538
Oh, how do we get you out of here?

792
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,665
Okay, out the window.

793
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,841
Hey, at least cover your faces.

794
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,801
Quick, cover up your daughter's face.

795
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,847
Good idea.

796
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,974
[Sang-gil] Look at these well-fed women.

797
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,518
They have nothing to do,
so they just go out dancing.

798
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:30,978
[Ae-sun] I can't believe this.

799
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,231
[Sang-gil] You will never face reality
until you're forced to struggle.

800
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,525
You have it too easy. Yeah.

801
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,277
Your lives are just too good.

802
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,279
Dancing will be a real sport someday.

803
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,613
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[gasps]

804
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,991
Nice. Real sport, my foot.

805
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,786
If it's a real sport,
why are you covering your faces?

806
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,248
Why don't you show your face
and go to the Olympics? Dancing will be…

807
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,374
Hyeon-suk, wait.

808
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,335
[photographer] One, two, three!

809
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,130
-One, two, three.
-Dancing will never be a sport.

810
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,299
[Gyeong-ja] All right, enough pictures.

[whistle blowing]

814
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,350
-[Gyeong-ja] Oh no.
-That woman is fleeing with her child! Ha!

815
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,977
They're like refugees from the war.

816
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,189
Get a picture of her.
Get a picture of that woman!

817
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,357
-Get a picture of her!
-[whistle blowing]

818
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,360
Don't worry! I'll go get them!

819
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,988
[whistle blowing]

820
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,407
[grunts]

821
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,326
[Ae-sun] Stop right there!

822
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,660
[whistle blowing]

823
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,206
What the hell?
This was supposed to be my thing.

824
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,208
[whistle blowing]

825
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,168
At least Ae-sun is doing something.

826
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,172
You just tell the photographer
to take a picture,

827
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,673
say cheese, and that's it.

828
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,342
[whistle blowing]

829
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,183
[Ae-sun sighs]

830
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,811
They're going to put you
on the news tonight

831
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,104
for going dancing
with your child for sure.

832
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,148
Are you doing this because you're bored?

833
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,651
-[Hyeon-suk coughs]
-Do you have too much money to spend?

834
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:04,696
If I didn't get to dance
the jitterbug sometimes, I'd go crazy.

835
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,825
I would've killed myself or someone else.

836
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,789
At home, I feel a rage
from deep within myself, Ae-sun.

837
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,084
But when I start dancing,

838
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,585
it all goes away.

839
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,838
So I can't help it.

840
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,130
I keep on dancing.

841
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,758
[Ae-sun sighs]

842
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,971
So your husband, does he still--

843
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,014
He's the same asshole he's always been.

844
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,809
He practically nicknamed me
"How dare you!"

845
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,269
How dare you!

846
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:39,231
Every day, it's,
"How dare you! How dare you!"

847
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:42,109
Hyeon-suk learned to say
"How dare you" before "Da-da."

848
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,695
Hey, Mommy, you are Cinderella.

849
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,322
[Ae-sun] Huh?

850
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:48,991
You're right.

851
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:53,328
Well, Cinderella's slipper fell off
because she danced before she ran away.

852
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,122
[quirky music playing]

853
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,504
<i>That makes your dad a prince.</i>

854
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,846
These might work better.

855
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,765
You have to wear something similar
if you don't want them to suspect you.

856
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,226
[sighs] And who knows?

857
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,146
One of these days, the prince of Dodong-ri

858
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,690
will return your glass slipper.

859
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,192
Tell me. That hairpin.

860
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,486
Did your husband really buy it for you?

861
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,405
That's what everyone says.

862
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,576
They say your husband
spends his money buying you hairpins.

863
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,619
[gasps]

864
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,537
Oh, really?

865
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,917
Uh, this village worries
far too much about my hairpins.

866
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,084
[chuckles]

867
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,087
But you have changed, Ae-sun.

868
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,881
They all see it.

869
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,759
You dress better than you did before.

870
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,136
Like you're high-class.

871
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,349
How people dress tends to

872
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,602
reflect how they live.

873
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,611
How dare…

874
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,321
[sighs]

875
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,824
Well, if you're so unhappy,
you should leave him.

876
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,743
It's not like he's some great man.

877
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,620
You shouldn't let him crush you.

878
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,123
Is that why you turned him down?

879
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,583
Huh?

880
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,168
You really don't

881
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,504
have second thoughts?

882
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:31,593
[Sang-gil] You have a crush on me or what?
Why do you always show up everywhere I go?

883
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,553
Just go away.

884
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,847
Go live somewhere else on the island.

885
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,226
What?

886
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,353
You still think of me?

887
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,022
Second thoughts?

888
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,110
-[saleswoman] Goodbye.
-[Ae-sun] Thank you.

889
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,072
[woman 9] I have ears, you know.
I heard about everything.

890
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:56,243
I found out you and my husband
were involved in the past.

891
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,078
[Ae-sun gasps]

892
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,039
What? Is that… is that what they said?

893
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,000
Nothing happened. I swear.

894
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,044
We just… We went on one blind date.

895
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,088
Just once when I was younger back then.

896
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,425
Why did you leave it there?

897
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,927
You should've taken him for yourself.

898
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:14,886
[Ae-sun sighs]

899
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,848
Then you would've landed
in this pile of crap instead.

900
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,185
[wistful music playing]

901
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,189
Hyeon-suk, never step on a pile of poop.

902
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:30,694
Instead, you should marry a man
like this lady's husband, okay?

903
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,699
[wistful music continues]

904
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,833
[boy 1] Airplane!

905
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,527
[music fades]

906
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,533
[Gwan-sik] Your handwriting
is much better than mine.

907
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,621
Shouldn't the bookworm do the writing?

908
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,663
[sighs]

909
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,009
Should I get on the boat?

910
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,053
The paint will dry fast.

911
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,054
[sighs]

912
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,057
It's bad luck for women
to get on the boat.

913
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,310
They say the Dragon King will sink it,
and you won't be able to return again.

914
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,395
-I don't believe in that.
-[Ae-sun grunts]

915
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,022
Stop it, Gwan-sik.

916
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,942
The Dragon King is vengeful.
All the gods are.

917
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,485
Well, I don't believe in any of them.

918
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,572
You, Geum-myeong, Eun-myeong,
Dong-myeong are my gods.

919
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,908
Even in a typhoon,
I'll make it back because of you.

920
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,368
I'll never die.

921
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,370
I'll always come back.

922
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,249
I'll always come back home.

923
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:10,085
[playful noises]

924
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,257
I know you will.
You're my Steelheart after all.

925
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,426
[Gwan-sik] So get in.

926
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,679
You're my blessing, right?

927
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:24,099
So I need you to write it
to keep our fortunes strong.

928
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,227
[sighs]

929
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,237
[Ae-sun gasps]

930
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,697
[Geum-myeong] <i>Mom always said,</i>

931
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,991
<i>"It's bad luck</i>
<i>if a girl gets on the boat."</i>

932
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,370
<i>But in that moment,</i>
<i>she didn't have the heart to tell me.</i>

933
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:52,586
<i>She didn't want her daughter</i>
<i>to inherit that kind of world,</i>

934
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,921
<i>so Mom did what she had to.</i>

935
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,923
<i>She challenged the superstition.</i>

936
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,758
[tender music playing]

937
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,415
[mystical twinkling]

938
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,500
[boat engine chugging]

939
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:41,843
[boat engine slows]

940
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,971
I never really believed
in the Dragon King anyway

941
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,556
'cause I believe in myself!

942
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:50,018
Why should it be bad luck for me
or Geum-myeong to get on the boat?

943
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:55,148
What? Haven't you heard what's been
going on up here, you stupid old man?

944
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,191
[music fades]

945
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,818
You ever heard about
the New Community Movement?

946
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,738
I thought you said
all the gods were vengeful.

947
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,241
[young Geum-myeong]
Eun-myeong, Dong-myeong, come here.

948
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,909
Well, I'm vengeful too.

949
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,663
What about the Anti-shamanism Movement?
Heard of that one, have you?

950
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:14,209
These days, the president himself
arrests people who do rituals for you.

951
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,795
So be nice to me, or else…

952
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:20,423
or else I won't serve you a bowl
of dried rice during the festivals.

953
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,802
You just eat whatever I cook,
and you're gonna like it.

954
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,054
As if I can't stand in my own boat?

955
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:28,515
[grunts] Take that, you weird old man!

956
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,558
Spit at him.

957
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,814
[gentle music playing]

958
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,483
[Geum-myeong] <i>It was</i>
<i>the nurturing season of summer,</i>

959
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,860

[sighs]

964
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:21,985
Well,

965
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,529
we have a house

966
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,823
and even a boat.

967
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,492
This is insane.

968
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,329
You happy?

969
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,080
Mm-hmm.

970
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,416
Yeah.

971
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,170
I am, Gwan-sik.

972
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,931
-<i>With the world in their hands…</i>
-Stop.

973
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,352
<i>…the only thing they wanted now</i>

974
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,021
<i>was for their summer to last.</i>

975
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,941
<i>They had no idea</i>

976
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,611
<i>what else summer could bring.</i>

977
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,406
[mystical twinkling]

00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,866
