How can he even think of
putting all the blame on you and bail?

4
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,291
He only opened that pawn shop

5
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,169
to take all the money
and run in the first place.

6
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,464
Did you think I didn't like Cheol-yong
because he was last in your class?

7
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:33,802
When he was ten, he came over
and robbed your dad of his washer fluid.

8
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,304
My washer fluid? Why the washer fluid?

9
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,932
I don't know.
He just stole whatever he could.

10
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,267
He would always come with nothing.

11
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,520
And when he said goodbye and walked away,

12
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,730
his pockets were always
full of a bunch of stuff.

13
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,357
What does telling me this change?

14
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,026
We should really be worried about
the <i>buncheong </i>stoneware.

15
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,904
That woman is such a liar.
Real <i>buncheong, </i>come on.

16
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,157
She said it was appraised at 70 million
on <i>Authentic Masterpieces.</i>

17
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,075
Se…

18
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,452
Seventy million?

19
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,247
Why'd she leave her <i>buncheong </i>stoneware
at a tiny pawn shop?

20
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,082
-Why?
-Oh, sweet Jesus.

21
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,752
So why… why

22
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,548
open a tiny pawn shop
with a partner like Cheol-yong?

23
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,383
Why blame the pawn shop?

24
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,884
It's the financial crisis.

25
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,470
People were giving out credit cards
with cash advances.

26
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,556
Who the hell would come into
a damn pawn shop, Mom?

27
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,226
You know what's worse? Gold stockpiling!
Stockpiling! That damn gold hoarding.

28
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,854
I couldn't collect gold
'cause the state made us get rid of it.

29
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,982
The government shouldn't have supported
gold collection because of you?

30
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,986
You wanted to sit in that pawn shop
and get your hands on that pile of gold,

31
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,112
didn't you?

32
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,280
None of this is your fault?

33
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,283
Instead of living within your means,
you got a loan for the pawn shop.

34
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,578
-That damn stupid get-rich-quick scheme!
-Because I didn't wanna live like you.

35
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,248
I absolutely couldn't stand
to live like that! I hated it, you know?

You smelled like cooling patches
every day. What have you done for me?

Honestly, you and Dad never said,
"Our son's the greatest."

40
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:01,514
But you always told Geum-myeong,
"You're good at it all. At everything."

41
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,602
Ever say that to me, huh?
Know why I need to make money like this?

42
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,479

43
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,356

00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,576
Dad!

175
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,661
Kick her out of here.

176
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,748
Kick her out right now!

177
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,833
Give me the money, Dad.

178
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,585
Give me my share, please!

179
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,003
Implying I owe you money now, huh?

180
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,963
That money is already mine.

181
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,174
I'm saying you can
pull it out of my inheritance.

182
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,508
You think I'm already dead?

183
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,678
[sighs] What am I supposed to do?

184
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,264
Should I be a prisoner's wife?

185
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,767
You want Che-il
to be a criminal's son too?

186
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,602
So have them find the real crook, then.

187
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,812
If your husband's innocent,
why should anyone pay?

188
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,276
Eun-myeong is an innocent man. Seriously!

189
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,361
[sobs]

190
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,572
He only did it to look after my family.

191
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,240
If he's innocent, he'll be out soon.

192
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,331
Do I matter less to you than money?

193
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,583
A hundred times over.
A hundred times, yes!

194
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,545
What exactly have you done
to deserve anything?

195
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,801
Did you help me become a ship captain
or a… or a village chief?

196
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,135
Did you make me that?

197
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,180
All those things are made possible
with money. Money brings honor.

198
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,768
You think you have the right to ask me
because you're my child. No way.

199
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,730
I don't need a daughter
who disrespects me like that.

200
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,821
Dad, you know what I envy the most
about my sister-in-law?

201
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,365
Her relationship with her dad.

202
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,161
Knowing my luck, even if I were reborn,
I won't have a dad like hers.

203
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,957
He treats Geum-myeong
like she's a luxury car.

204
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,252
And I'm not even a cattle wagon to you.

Yeah, speak for yourself!

208
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,392
It's just 70 million won.

209
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,271
"Just 70 million won"?

210
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,233
You. Have you ever even earned
a hundred won yourself?

211
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,611
Warmth of a child towards a parent,

212
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,823
respect, gratitude.

213
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,077
Those things,
money can't ever buy, you see.

214
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,203
[scoffs]

215
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,831
You pierce your child's heart
with a dagger.

216
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,042
No amount of money can pull it out.

217
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,463
You think you're the only one who cares?
I care a lot too.

218
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,466
I care a lot more than you do.

219
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,093
You love your boat more than your kids.

220
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,014
Anyone can buy a boat at any time
with a price tag on it,

221
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,517
but a man's value is known once he's dead.

222
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,773
You should really start thinking hard
about how you'll be remembered

223
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,818
and what your life's worth
every single sleepless night.

224
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,655

[woman] Do what you want with me.

229
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,043
I couldn't tell you where he is
even if you beat me to death.

230
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,504
You could cut me open
and not find any money.

231
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,298
That <i>buncheong </i>stoneware
was 70 million won,

232
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,550
and it's your son that ran off with it.

233
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,594
So why should her son repay that woman?

234
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,805
My son Cheol-yong was a victim here too.

235
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,516
Can you believe the damn words
this lady's saying?

236
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,893
My son was a very good boy

237
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,896
until he made the wrong friend.

238
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,315
Remember all the things
that Eun-myeong used to do.

239
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,776
Didn't you do that boy's hair
for all those years?

240
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,737
Eun-myeong was such a bad influence
on that boy.

241
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,614
He messed up my son's life.

242
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,243
[scoffs] Ae-sun, go.
Say something, will you?

243
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,787
We can't fight for you forever!

244
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,251
You are talking to your son, right?

245
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,296
[chuckles] If you know where he is,
let me know.

246
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,257
Because of your wonderful son,

247
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,051
I need to take my kid's name
off the shop signage here.

248
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,016
Did Cheol-yong sell
that <i>buncheong </i>stoneware

249
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,186
and buy you… that television?

250
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,272
Did he buy you that gold ring too?

251
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,816
[scoffs] You have evidence?

252
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,568
Show me where is it?

253
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,737
Now I finally get
why Cheol-yong is the way he is.

254
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,947
He takes after you.

255
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:30,160
So is Eun-myeong in prison
due to his high school dropout mother?

256
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,163
[scoffs] He's becoming
what he was always meant to be.

257
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,623
[chuckles]

258
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,709
Ow!

259
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,838
What the hell?

260
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,508
Ow! Bitch!
You and your small head and your tiny IQ!

261
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:48,137
It's three of us against you!
Damn you! Damn you!

-Ow, let go! Let go!

Pay up now!

268

If you make someone

00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,362

270

Ae-sun, um, just, let… let go for now.

271
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,243
See how you feel
if your son gets arrested!

272
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,079
Nothing matters to me! Nothing!

273
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,789
I don't care what happens to me!

274
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,249
I don't care anymore!

She used a special fight technique.

282
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,696
Like, she, um, grabbed her hair
and twisted her body,

283
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,073
like some pro wrestler.

Captain Yang,
you're not as young as you were.

You can't even
reel in the nets with those knees.

How many fish do you think you'll catch?

305
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,348
Mr. Byeon, you know
I'm a highly skilled fisherman. Also…

306
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,268
The world has moved on, Captain Yang.

307
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,981
They have machinery capable of raking in
a full net as big as a house, you know?

308
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,026
But you're so old-fashioned,
you still throw young fish

309
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,193
back into the water.

310
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,613
You're the only one in Jeju

311
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,367
That's no way to turn a profit.
Did you make a lot of money? No.

Sir.

313
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,621
I'll reimburse you.

I'll pay you back with fish
or work for you for free.

Come on. Geum-myeong wasn't even saying,
"I love you," right?

511
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,012
You're the only one saying it? [laughs]

512
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,600
[Geum-myeong] <i>The more they lost,</i>
<i>the more Mom boasted about her family.</i>

513
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,937
[Mi-suk] Hey, there's your boat husband.

514
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,398
There he is. [laughs]

515
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,318
[Geum-myeong] <i>But that's how Mom</i>
<i>protected her own heart.</i>

516
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,905
None of them get phone calls, babe.

517
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:47,744
Only our children call every day
to ask if I ate and what I ate.

518
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,996
They're jealous of what we have.

519
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,999
When the fire dies down,
you have to change the candle.

520
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,001
You'll be cold.

521
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,840
Oh my. They don't even know the law.

522
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:04,719
They can't tell the difference
between a holding cell and a prison cell.

523
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,348
Mi-suk knows enough. She keeps asking,
"Why don't you talk about your son?"

524
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,976
"Where's your son work these days?"
Just talks shit. Bitch.

525
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,649
Things get desperate, but I don't care.

526
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,901
I'd never go as low
as messing with a married man.

527
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,444
Have things gotten desperate?

528
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,741
No. [chuckles] But I didn't…

529
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,993
I didn't intend that.

530
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,871
No. They're all envious of me here.

531
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,042
A new face cream sound good, hon?
A fancy one.

532
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,627
Why?

533
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,089
Isn't it cute?
It looks like blush. [laughs]

534
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,424
They call me the pretty one here.

535
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,510
[giggles]

536
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,638
[middle-aged Gwan-sik sighs]

537
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,431
Oh man.

538
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,560
How did we get here?

539
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,395
How did this happen?

540
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,149
[sighs, groans]

541
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,153
What's going on?

542
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,406
Getting old, huh?

543
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,951
Jeez, you've been crying more lately.

544
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,539
I'm the one who forced you to sit here.

545
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,457
[sighs]

546
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,627
I couldn't do anything I promised you.

547
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,797
I robbed you of your potential.

548
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:30,054
[sobs] So what if you know
what "nostalgia" means?

549
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,848
What about college?

550
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,225
Being a poet?

551
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,936
What about the mainland?

552
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,605
I can't give you everything.

553
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,567
But I'll do one thing,
even if my life depends on it.

554
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,029
Hey, can't you at least say
you'll give me everything?

555
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,240
Tell me you'll give me
the moon and the stars!

556
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,076
How can I live with a boy like you?

557
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,413
[sobbing continues]

558
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,047
You should've turned me down back then.

559
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,133
You shouldn't have ended up with me.

560
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,553
I was all by myself.

561
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,389
I was an orphan,
and you were there for me.

562
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,142
With Yang Gwan-sik by my side,

563
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,937
I didn't have to hide
and pretend to be shy.

564
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,148
Should I scare that lady, Mi-suk?

565
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,233
[middle-aged Ae-sun laughing]

566
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,738
[middle-aged Gwan-sik sighs]

567
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,910
Why are you aging on the outside
but not on the inside?

568
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,329
How is it you never change?

569
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,705
It's annoying.

570
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,966
[middle-aged Ae-sun] Lucky you, Hyeon-suk.

571
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,177
Your father-in-law
never got me face cream.

572
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,433
Hyeon-suk, I noticed
you're not wearing much makeup now,

573
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,061
and your hair isn't curly anymore.

574
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,938
You should find time
to perm it if you like.

575
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,773
Getting a perm costs a lot.

576
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,320
[Che-il] Open this for me.

577
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,697
-This?
-[Che-il] Like that.

578
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,241
[middle-aged Gwan-sik]
Okay. Let's see. Bless you.

579
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,082
Are you the only people eating?
Are these just for your husband?

580
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,500
-[Che-il] Hmm… Da!
-Hey.

581
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,877
His father loves rolled omelet, right?

582
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,797
How can you hide two-thirds of it?

583
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,465
Silly girl. [chuckles]

584
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,469
Tell Eun-myeong to come home
when we're having dinner.

585
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,763
He makes you set the table twice.
Tell him that.

586
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,390
How much is he drinking?

587
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,934
Why does he always sleep in
until 10:00 a.m.?

588
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,439
But, Mother, that's unfair.

589
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,026
I'm not going to eat.

590
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,952
[door slams]

591
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,537
Look at that.

592
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,123
Our daughter-in-law
is just like our little girl.

593
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,385
Why aren't you asleep?
We can get Che-il to bed tonight.

594
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,683
-[Hyeon-suk sighs]
-You guys can have it.

595
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,728
You're joining me?

596
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,313
Really?

597
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,858
I know you already know
how much I love to drink.

598
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,944
[laughs] Oh, yeah.

599
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:18,032
I needed a hammer, and I found your stash
while I was looking for it.

600
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,620
I don't know anyone that buys
their daughter-in-law a box of beer.

601
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,958
Can't be easy living with your in-laws

602
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,836
after you've been eating your mom's food
for 20 years, can it?

603
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:35,299
To be honest,
bunking with my in-laws hasn't been hard.

604
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,717
No?

605
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,512
Oh, good.

606
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,556
Actually…

607
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,770
Eun-myeong is what's making it hard.

608
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,193
What about my son?
Is that punk of a man making trouble?

609
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,282
Dad, you've got no idea
what your son's been up to, do you?

610
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,498
[indistinct chattering]

611
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,336
[middle-aged Gwan-sik]
Stop going to the ping-pong bar.

612
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,754
You're not the boss of me.

613
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,299
Well, folks have been saying
only Bu Sang-gil

614
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,176
asks for a mixed doubles team.

615
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:22,221
Having mixed doubles happens.
Hyun Jung-hwa, Yoo Nam-kyu!

616
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,681
What, are you lonely?

617
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,602
Lonely, my ass. Damn it.

618
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,646
-[Che-il] Yummy.
-I'm the boss of my house!

619
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,981
[Che-il] This is good.

620
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,525
Hey, you don't have to be
everybody's boss, you know.

621
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,694
They're avoiding me anyway.

622
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,487
[Che-il] Yeah.

623
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,907
Yummy!

624
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,451
You can approach him, you know.

625
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,330
[feel-good music playing]

626
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,706
[laughs]

627
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,168
Maybe because it's our first grandson.

628
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,963
But I think he's
a spitting image of his father.

629
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,215
Of his mother.

630
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,802
Don't you think?

631
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,848
Fine, tell me
if you ever want to see your grandson.

632
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,266
I'll bring him out to you.

633
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,229
Is there something I can do for you, sir?

634
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,147
Oh, "sir"?

635
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,607
[laughs]

636
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,943
It's crazy how gracious you are.

637
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,445
So you do care
about your daughter, after all.

638
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,572
I know how that is.

639
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,159
Do you believe your son-in-law's
a thief too?

640
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,871
Having that Community Chest of Korea badge
won't make you great.

641
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,206
Show affection at home.

642
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,583
Then forget going to the bar
on Lunar New Year.

643
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,504
[music fades]

644
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,554
The tangerine field is yours.

645
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,142
My payment for you
placing the bedpan under me.

646
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,606
While your father-in-law was alive,

647
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,444
he never went to visit
the camellias in the cold winter.

648
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,991
If the canola flowers
bloomed west of Jeju,

649
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,951
he would travel to the east.

650
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,831
If the camellias blossomed in the east,
then west he'd go.

651
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,042
That's what an affair does to a guy.

652
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,463
He knew what he was doing was wrong
in the eyes of others.

653
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:24,468
He looked for other women
until his last day,

654
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,263
but I went along with it
because I wasn't sure

655
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,557
how I'd survive alone.

656
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,437
One day, because of the distress,
my body gave out.

657
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,230
Mother,

658
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,858
why are you saying this?

659
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,068
What am I supposed to do though?

660
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,321
The tangerine field is yours.

661
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,614
Do whatever you like.

662
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,208
[middle-aged Ae-sun] You're looking for
another get-rich-quick scheme.

663
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,169
They're nothing but trouble.

664
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,346
Uh, Dong-jin's brother, Dong-won,
just got out of the military.

665
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,348
We wanna hang out. I'll be home early.

666
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,395
You know I don't drink milk, Dad.
I'll get diarrhea.

667
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,032
[middle-aged Ae-sun]
<i>We have to stop him now!</i>

668
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,661
If he gets in trouble again,
we won't have anything to sell!

669
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,164
Your child will be
a thorn in your side eventually.

670
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,667
A thorn conch is more expensive
than a regular conch.

671
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,009
Okay, there, there, there, there,
there, there you are. That's good.

672
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,136
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

673
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:54,809
So,

674
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,479
Hong-nam's brother, Hong-sik,
started a business.

675
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,316
But why do you care about
Hong-nam's big brother? Why?

676
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,443
You'll drink all night again?

677
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:07,947
I don't want it.

678
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,242
[middle-aged Gwan-sik] They're hot.

693

No. It's because
Eun-myeong is doing that now.

694
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,654
No one would hire him
just because he's been in jail.

695
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,490
They all keep their distance from him

696
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,367
because they think
that he stole someone's money.

697
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:39,955
He goes out in this cold weather
and walks around for six or seven hours.

698

I hate it.

Dad, for the time being,
would you be able to provide for us?

You know Che-il doesn't eat much anyway.

00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,393
The other day,

from the fifth floor

then asked him to take out their trash.

707

He's got to do something. He has to.

708
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,989

your little floral lunch box onto my boat.

I didn't wanna be on that boat either.

824

Let's be blunt. Life is a matter of luck.

825
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,594
You're just lucky
the odds are in your favor,

826

and things fall into place for you.

827
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,848
Seeing as you ended up with
a smart, frugal wife,

828
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,267
you reaped the benefits of who she is.

829
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,437
It made me pretty jealous of both of you.
I hated it.

830

And you know, I, uh,
had a blind date with Ae-sun just once.

Hey, let's stop before we say something
we'll both regret.

it wasn't just because of your wife.

to provide for the future myself?
