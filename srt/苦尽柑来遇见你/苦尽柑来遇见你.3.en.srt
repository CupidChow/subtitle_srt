00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,028
[reporter] Are they spies?
They're not, are they?

5
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,031
Because I heard one of them
is from Busan, right?

6
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,574
[officer 2] Look, Mr. Kim,

7
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,118
these kids don't get to decide
what they are.

8
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,703
Namsan decides.

9
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,541
You ate everything.

10
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,709
Were you hungry?

11
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,090
[officer 1] Look down, you.
You think this is funny?

12
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,343
We keep feeding them.
That's why kids keep running away.

13
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,638
These hooligans will have to return
to Namsan and come back to their senses.

14
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,973
Couple of life sentences.
That would be patriotic.

15
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,021
Look at that.

16
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:45,980
They're in love.

Are you out of your mind, punk?

[scoffs] You're in the big city now,
Jeju boy.

20
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,491
Roll your sleeve down again.

21
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:00,328
So you think you can block a hit
from a big-city police officer, do ya?

22
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,622

[breathing nervously]

24
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,672
Are you who decides what happens to us?
Or do you answer to someone else?

25
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,299
Oh, how sweet. Double trouble.

26
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,801
[officer 1] Why you little…

27
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,970
You hear this chick talk back to me?
How dare you?

28
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,180
Is that against the law?
Am I going to jail now?

29
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,974
Will I be serving a life sentence?

30
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,059
You're one of those girls, right?

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,937
A girl who smokes and wears miniskirts!

32
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,564
Am I going to Namsan for wearing skirts?

33
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,608
That lady reported us as runaways, right?

34
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,069
There's certainly nothing more
she could have accused us of.

35
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,195
[officer 1] More than what?

36
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,364
Did you steal something too?
What did you steal?

37
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,659
This boy and I are not sitting here in
this police station because we're thieves.

38
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,578
We're… We are just sitting here

39
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,121
because we are just minors,

40
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,456
and we're in need of
Busan police protection.

41
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,419
All we need is to sit quietly
and wait for our guardians to pick us up.

42
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,046

So why aren't you calling
your mothers, then, huh?

47
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,604
There's no need for that.

Tall and handsome.

51
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,237
And the naughty look.

52
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:18,907
There she is now.

53
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,826

Damn it.

That husband of mine.

00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,209
I swear, he does this
for every anniversary.

70
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,544
He just can't wait
to buy me something nice.

72
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,880
[store owner] Is that right?

Look, it's just,

74
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,052
our cabinet is practically
filled with jewelry.

75
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,972
I wanna get rid of what's out of fashion.

76
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,057
But they're still worth a lot.

77
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,975
Are they?

78
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,103
You gave me a good price the last time.

79
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,356
That was summer, and you said
it was your anniversary then.

80
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,402
So? Is your anniversary
in the summer or not?

81
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,196
At the time, you said
your husband got you a gold bracelet.

82
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,908
No, it's…

83
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,660
it's in the spring.

00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,371
Mm, I see.

00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,873
Besides,

86
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,126
does it matter?

00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,212

-Hey!

I'm the owner here!
What would he pay you for? It's my motel.

95
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,232
It's her motel and my money.
I had a suitcase, and this woman stole it.

96
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,276
So I'm collecting the money
until her debt is paid.

97
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,402
She's lying. Give it here.

98

You gonna spend the night?

105
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,086
You know why
we don't have thieves on Jeju Island?

106
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,088
Because Jeju hospitality is top-notch?

107
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,423
We wear them down.

108
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,508
We don't give in until they're broken.

109
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:46,429
We keep the pressure on until the victim
has driven the robber completely insane.

110
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,388
That's why we don't.

Do you hear me? You're the crazy one.

116
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,943
Just leave me alone! Damn you!

117
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,946
I'm taking back what I'm owed,
and that's all there is.

118
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,074
So I'll be here all day and night

119
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,951
until I've recovered
the full cost of my golden toad.

120
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,911
What?

121
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,537
Did you say your "toad"?

122
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,581
The cost of my golden toad, yeah.

123
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,458
Really? Ah!

124
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,961
So the gold frog is a gold toad now?
Not when I saw it!

125
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,048
You really stepped in it now.

126
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,884
She's got you there, Mom.
Better give her the frog back.

I'll take your word for it.
Toads are bigger anyway.

Oh, I see. You think you can rob me, eh?

130
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,395

don't you?

-Hey, ladies!

-Do you?
-Call them!

You do realize this makes ten offenses?

Come on, think of your child for once.

00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,752
Let's go.

143
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,130
Don't take anyone from Jeju
while I'm gone.

-Take her away.

She's committed ten offenses?

You hear me? You're gonna pay.

Did you have a circus in there or what?

How'd you even break it
in the first place?

I didn't buy the tofu.

Did you not take them when you left?

00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,975
YESTERDAY WAS YOUR SPRING

177
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,520
You will never hear the end of this one.

<i>the poet of class eight?</i>

184
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,253
[teacher 1] <i>Poet, my foot.</i>

185
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,047
<i>Did she run away</i>
<i>with her boyfriend for poetry?</i>

186

EXPULSION NOTICE
OH AE-SUN

190
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:40,371
DUE TO AN UNAUTHORIZED RUNAWAY
AND DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR

191
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,709
[man] You've completely
ruined your life with this.

192
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,337
Everyone on this island knows
everything about everybody.

193
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,673
I can't even show my face at the factory.

194
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,968
Now you've gone and dragged
this family's name through the mud.

195
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,886
Like your son painted it gold.

196
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,472
You can't compare him with her.

197
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,516
No, when a man is
financially unsuccessful,

198
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,144
he may lose a house, but that's different.

199
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,979
Why do you insist on bringing him up?

200
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,024
Did he run a business,
or did he gamble it away?

201
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,942
And now what? Huh?

202
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,360
What are you gonna do now?

203
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,863
You won't work at a factory.
You can't get married.

204
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,740
Will you live here as a spinster?

205
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,409
[sighs]

206
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,747
What about him?

207
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,498
What did that awful boy say?

208
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,917
[melodic piano music playing]

209
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,836
[grunts, pants]

210
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,795
Look there.

211
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,298
See the grandmother who raised you
since you were a baby?

212
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,884
Look what you've done to her!
Is it just you that matters?

213
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,510
What would the ancestors think?

214
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,845
I'm the one marrying her.

215
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,639
Not the ancestors.

216
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,561
[man] What would they think about it?

217
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,981
That Gwan-sik brought home an orphan wife
with only a middle-school degree?

218
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,235
Who brings a daughter-in-law like that
into a high-class family?

219
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,404
Only a middle-school degree?

220
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,074
That's right. You think
they'd give her a high school diploma

221
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,742
after that stunt you pulled?

222
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,204
Go on! Live there if you want.

223
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,165
Let your dreams die.
Live there as his fiancée.

224
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,542
There are all kinds of rumors
spreading about you two.

225
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,544
Good luck now marrying anybody else!

226
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,213
[Yi-suk] She can't go over there.

227
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,840
Their grandmother…
She was so upset, she fainted.

228
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,802
Congratulations,
that's the best thing yet.

229
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,595
You nearly killed a grandmother too.

230
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,765
On top of sneaking out at night
and completely wrecking your life.

231
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,558
[scoffs]

232
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,435
It was only a suspension.

233
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,437
Oh yeah? That's good for you.

234
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,855
But why is she… Why did they…

235
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,401
Why is she expelled from school?

236
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,654
You can't even do soldering
without a high school diploma, damn it.

237
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,532
-But why is she the only one?
-[woman] Is it possible you don't know?

238
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,952
You both ran away,
but it's brave when a boy does it.

239
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,204
When a girl acts out of love,
it's frivolous.

240
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,332
Did you ruin her life
because you didn't know any better?

241
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,876
It was my idea.

242
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,170
This idiot just followed along.

243
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,922
You deserve him.

244
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,926
[man] Take him off the family registry.
Take him off.

245
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,512
No one's punishing my baby.

246
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,264
Ae-sun should get punished.

247
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,308
You don't tear down the house
because you find a maggot.

248
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,353
What can we do about someone else's kid?
It's our boy who's head over heels.

249
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,522
[spits] Mark my words.

250
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,650
When I get my hands on her,
I'll beat that girl real good.

251
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,403
No, you won't. What would that accomplish?

252
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,114
You never got anywhere with me
by pulling my hair.

253
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,658
So what? I lost you.
I won't lose my grandson.

254
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,829
If you wanna coax a chicken
out of its coop,

255
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,457
you don't go in and beat it with a stick.

256
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,919
You have to lure it out with some worms.
If you chase after it, it's gone for good.

257
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,716
They really locked you up with a spoon.
Good Lord.

258
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,217
[tuts]

259
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,844
Oh well.

260
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,389
Oh. Oh my.

261
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,642
Do they at least give you things to eat?

262
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,643
Yes.

263
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,397
They do. I'm not skipping any meals.

264
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,274
[Gye-ok scoffs]

265
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,151
Oh. [chuckles]

266
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,819
Well, that's good to hear.

267
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,405
My Gwan-sik, he hasn't eaten a thing.

268
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,033
Why? Is he on a hunger strike?

269
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,910
Oh, he would never.

270
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,038
His father told me
not to feed him a grain of rice.

271
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,669
Ae-sun, you know
I'd love to do something about this.

272
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,963
But you know his grandma.

273
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,674
She's always laying down the law.

274
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,261
I married into the headstrong Yang family,

275
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,639
and to this day,
I'm still paying the price.

276
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,266
You know how stubborn the Yangs can be.

277
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,479
Remember how Gwan-sik gave your family
a fish every day for ten years?

278
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,605
Goodness.

279
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,900
I gave your family cabbages sometimes.

280
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,030
Where do you think Gwan-sik
gets that stubbornness?

281
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,367
From his father, of course,
and now his father

282
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,662
is trying to get him
entirely cut out of the family.

283
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,705
Goodness.

284
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,792
You know, he's really quite
a tiny man on the inside.

285
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,213
But once I was so crazy about him,
we ran away together.

286
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,130
[sighs]

287
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,800
See, things don't stay
so lovey-dovey for long.

288
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,010
Right until the wedding day,

289
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,264
I believed him when he said
I was the only one for him.

290
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,349
But as soon as we were married,

291
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,269
he became a mama's boy
like you wouldn't believe.

292
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,396
So think about it.

293
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,609
You would feel so lonely in our household.

294
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,738
Mrs. Yang?

295
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,574
Yes, my dear?

296
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,704
I wanted to ask you something,

297
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,746
if I could?

298
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,293
[sentimental music playing]

299
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,470
[sighs]

300
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,602
We can't afford to marry her off.
No one's happy about it.

301
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,147
But we can't. Not one silver spoon.

302
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,024
I'd still love her, with or without.

303
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,611
Your family? Do they approve of her?

304
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,946
Your grandmother's a shaman.

305
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,407
You've heard what she says about the girl.

306
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,951
She says she carries
her mother's ghost around with her.

307
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,164
On this island, we don't believe
in God or Buddha but the Dragon King.

308
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,750
Ignore his shamans at your own risk.

309
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,667
[sighs]

310
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,171
Ae-sun will live with me.
She won't live with my grandmother.

311
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,006
I can guarantee she'll never hurt her.

312
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,801
How you gonna do that? You moving out?
You got a house I don't know about?

313
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,473
What are you doing?
Who said you had to take care of me?

314
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,600
I'm not a rotten fish to get cheap.

315
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,895
You keep her in there
with the fermenting jars?

316
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,440
Just forget it already.
The least I can do is to save my pride.

317
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,691
I want to marry you.

318
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,236
Why? Because you think
it'll never happen for me if you don't?

319
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,322
I'm going to marry a man
who's richer than you and…

320
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,699
and a lot hotter,
and he'll have a nicer family than you.

321
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,576
He's mad enough to take you.

322
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,578
-Don't turn him down.
-Just watch me.

323
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,996
I'll never marry him.

324
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,248
I'll turn him down a million times.
You just watch!

325
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,964
[lively upbeat music playing]

326
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,215
[groans]

327
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,637
[man] Hey, waitress. Bring us some tea.

328
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,223
Ko-hyang, give them some tea.

329
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,516
Yes, ma'am.

330
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,017
Oh, welcome back, sir.

331
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,354
So you raised two siblings
practically all by yourself?

332
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,567
Based on that experience alone,
I already approve of you.

333
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,403
Okay.

334
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,038
[slurping loudly]

335
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,130
So I heard you were
after a man from Seoul.

336
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,967
You know… [sniffles]

337
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,469
…I'm practically from Seoul myself.

338
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,471
After Korea's independence,

339
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,474
I got an education on the mainland
as good as any in Seoul.

340
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,061
Had I not moved here after I got married,

341
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,689
I could've been another Kim Du-han.

342
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,736
My first marriage

343
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,070
at the start.

344
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,115
Are we getting that tea today?

345
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,419
Don't worry too much about what I think.

346
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,756
I mean, who says that it's wrong to love?

347
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,340
[crunching]

348
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:34,595
And, sure, I heard a few things
about your past through the grapevine,

349
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:35,929
but still,

350
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,475
I'm quite determined to seal the deal.

351
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,060
[wistful music playing]

352
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,645
I've crossed the Pacific many times,
so your little jaunt

353
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,439
isn't such a big deal to me.

354
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,026
As a man practically from Seoul,
I don't care what you did in the past.

355
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,154
I heard second marriages work out better.

356
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,740
The parties have an understanding.

357
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:58,243
Honestly, the idea of getting married
to another virgin would be just

358
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,996
such an inconvenience.

359
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,297
You're not going to drink it?
It cost 50 won, Ae-sun.

360
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,344
[rain pattering]

361
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,014
Sure, he's been married before,
but he owns boats.

362
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,558
And not just one boat either.

363
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,937
Why, you can't look in the harbor
without seeing one of them.

364
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,482
And on… and on top of everything,

365
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,194
he'll pay for you to go to school.
Within ten years, at least.

366
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,322
And if you really please them,

367
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,992
they might even give you funds
to publish your own book of poetry.

368
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,538
It's only two kids.

369
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,250
At least it's not three.

370
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,627
[Ae-sun sighs]

371
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,923
I guess I'm born
to merely be a housekeeper.

372
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,467
Oh gosh.

373
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,763
The spring rain sure is lasting a while.

374
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,561
It must be the tears of my mother.

375
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,234
Maybe she's crying because this is
how I'm gonna get married.

376
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,706
[music fades]

377
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,417
Gwang-rye is spinning in her grave!

378
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,501
[grunts]

379
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:34,882
You've completely ruined the girl's life,
but apparently, you still like your rice!

380
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,718
If you're so upset for her,
then you can marry your son to Ae-sun.

381
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,677
How about that?

382
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,971
But why are you making her a second wife?

383
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,766
It's obvious that both of your families
are desperate to get rid of her.

384
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,684
[frustrated sigh]

385
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,312
Mak-cheon, you may be a shaman,

386
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,814
but you have no right
to punish another family's girl.

387
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,275
If you force Ae-sun to marry that man,

388
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,444
I'll never believe another word you say.

389
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,280
We need goodness of the heart, I tell you.

390
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,781
Goodness of the heart!

391
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,617
Will you shut up?!

392
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,452
Ae-sun's getting married?

393
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,828
[disgusted groan]

394
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,666
MADAM BAEK GI-NAM'S 60TH BIRTHDAY

395
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,798
Is that really
what you're giving my family?

396
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,634
A used gift set?

397
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,385
[man] This is American-made.

398
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,348
Well, made in Korea, but close enough.

399
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,434
Besides, it's all the same
once they eat it, right?

400
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,771
I can't stand
all these meaningless formalities.

401
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,943
The whole wedding business is just
one useless formal gesture after another.

402
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,904
Just a way of robbing people
of their money. Huh?

403
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,035
Honestly, the white dress
doesn't really matter to me.

404
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,453
That's for first weddings.

405
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,623
We can just look nice
and take a few pictures.

406
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:53,335
Seeing as, technically,
it's not the first time for either of us.

407
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,336
[clears throat]

408
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,171
So, speaking of,

409
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,633
I was actually curious about something.

410
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,011
So, uh…

411
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,471
Mm.

412
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,764
About Busan.

413
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,145
Does your mother know about this?

414
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,232
[Yi-suk] Oh my.

415
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,693
You must've cleared out your entire store.

416
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,654
-Good Lord.
-[Yi-suk] This isn't a gift. It's robbery.

417
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,031
[Gwan-sik] I'll make sure
Ae-sun never goes hungry.

418
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,742
I can give her a mackerel
at least once a day.

419
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,121
It isn't wartime anymore.
No one's worried about starving.

420
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,499
Aren't you her grandmother?

421
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,501
Aren't you her uncle?

422
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,296
I knew something was up
when you refused to give her any croaker.

423
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,131
What do croakers have to do with anything?

424
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,716
She'd be his second wife!

425
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,176
-He's 30 years old!
-[sighs]

426
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,721
[Gwan-sik] Why would you give Ae-sun
to a man like him?

427
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,765
Even if Shin Seong-il himself proposed,
he wouldn't be good enough!

428
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,059
Shin Seong-il would never take her,
that's why.

429
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,603
How come everyone is trying
to throw her out…

430
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,480
[Gwan-sik sobbing]

431
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,607
[whimpers, sobs]

432
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,444
…when she's so smart, speaks so well,

433
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,112
looks so beautiful?

434
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,072
Why?

435
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,657
Why? Why?

436
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,951
Yell a bit louder.

437
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,120
[frustrated groan]

438
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,667
Let us stay together.

439
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,921
I've been giving her fish for years
and selling her cabbages all this time.

440
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,799
You know I love Ae-sun
more than anyone else in the world.

441
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,802
So much more than you,
so why can't I have her?

442
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,846
[Ae-sun's uncle]
What am I supposed to do about it?

443
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,766
You want me to tie her up or what?
Should I put a yolk on her?

444
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,310
Should I force her
to marry you, Yang Gwan-sik?

445
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,479
She says she doesn't want you.
Her mind's made up!

446
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:39,775
When a cow decides to rebel,
no matter what you try to do to force it,

447
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,444
you can never make it plow again.

448
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,988
What's wrong… what's wrong with her?

449
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,656
Ask your mother about that.

450
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,743
She convinced her not to marry you.

451
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,498
So, in Busan, were you

452
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,708
caught the day you arrived?

453
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,627
Or did you spend the night together?

454
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,755
These days,
couples do all kinds of things,

455
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,715
even if they don't
spend the night together.

456
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,592
What about you, Captain?

457
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,679
With your first wife,
was it you who left her,

458
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,015
or did you… or did you
get tired of each other?

459
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,643
[scoffs]

460
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,272
-You've got some attitude, huh?
-Yes.

461
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,774
Yes, I do.

462
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,902
And I don't appreciate
being addressed that way.

463
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,654
Does that boy know this side of you?

464
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,240
-Would he still like you?
-That's why he likes me.

465
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,741
-[scoffs]
-[footsteps approaching]

466
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,118
[Ae-sun's uncle] Hey, kid!

467
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,495
Get back here before you ruin someone's--

468
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,579
Too late.

469
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,747
It's a party now.

470
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,752
-Uh…
-Hold on. Stop right there.

471
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,295
What do you want?

472
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,839
-What now?
-Let's go.

473
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,050
I said let's go.

474
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,679
Where? Where are we going?

475
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,222
Where could we go?

476
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,600
Listen here, you little punk!

477
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,646
This is no way to behave in front
of adults, you snot-nosed, rude--

478
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,314
Nobody asked you, okay?

479
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,450
Don't go. Marry me.
Take this ring, and it's a done deal.

480
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,536
What deal? Can we live off this ring?

481
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,872
Are we running away again?
Becoming thieves?

482
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,957
Are you really gonna marry this guy?

483
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,752
Why would you? I don't get it.

484
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,337
It's a second marriage.

485
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,797
He has two kids.

486
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,301
I don't get why. Tell me why.

487
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,970
You're right. Why's it me?
Why always Ae-sun?

488
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,639
Why do I get the blame?
Why was I expelled?

489
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,516
Why does everybody think I'm the worst?

490
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,684
[tender piano music playing]

491
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,352
It's gone to crap. Poetry?

492
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,770
College?

493
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,815
Right. Now, that's all over.

494
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,902
I can't make a living
with no high school degree.

495
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,320
I said I'll take care of you.

496
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,405
-No matter what, I'll find a way.
-How exactly?

497
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,492
What have you done for me
except follow me around everywhere

498
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,911
and toss me an old fish
every now and then?

499
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,913
-I'm not a beggar!
-You were just ten years old.

500
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,706
We were just little kids.

501
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,957
We were children.

502
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,294
He can provide,
and he can send me to college.

503
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,213
-He'll let me be a poet.
-I can do that!

504
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,381
I'll work on boats. I'll lay down bricks.

505
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,967
-I'll do anything!
-No, I don't want you! I don't!

506
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,386
[grunts]

507
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,014
[breathing shakily]

508
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,852
If we get married,

509
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,688
the last chance I have will be over.

510
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,567
What?

511
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,195
I'm tired of having to fight
every single day,

512
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,281
of sticking up for myself,
living with a family that doesn't want me.

513
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,908
I want to be rich.

514
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,369
I want to be comfortable.

515
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,372
And if I marry you,
I… I'll just face more abuse.

516
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,790
They all know what I've been.

517
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,709
But if I marry him, I'll finally be free.

518
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,338
Free from you, Gwan-sik,
'cause you know… know me and everything.

519
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,381
I feel so…

520
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,676
[sobs]

521
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,680
…so ashamed.

522
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,892
I've been living in shame my whole life.

523
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,311
[young Gwan-sik]
There's an extra one for free.

524
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,231
[man] Did your mom say that?
Well, did she?

525
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,983
You have six people in your family,

526
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,818
but for some reason, you only buy five.

527
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,237
[man] Think you're rich enough
to give them away, is that it?

528
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,280
Mind your own business.

529
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,658

Oh, Mom.

Oh, Mom, I miss you so much.

533
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,087
[Ae-sun] Go to Busan, he said.

534
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,048
He told me to go work at a factory.

535
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,759
I don't have a home anymore.

[Ae-sun] <i>You know everything about me.</i>
<i>Do you want me trapped in it forever?</i>

538
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,561
If you stay here…

539
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,024
I'll never be happy, married or not.

540
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,527

542
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,950
Let me live without you.

Are you saying

544
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,583
that I'm in your way, Ae-sun?

545
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,674
Gwan-sik.

546
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,304
Gwan-sik, this is what needs to happen.

547
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,349
If you want me to live my life…

548
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,685

They say that working a field
is more rewarding than parenting a child.

You sure never tried it with me, Ae-sun.

563
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,667
Nothing special
for your little sister-in-law.

564

When she splits the eggs,
she always gives you the bigger one.

Like, every single time.

566
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,465
There you go again with that talk.

567
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,301
Mom, why'd you marry
into a family like this anyway?

568
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,263
I chose my own path, dear. Nobody else.

569
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,349
I'd never decide to live like you did.

570
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,768
Like, never. Never.

571
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:53,022
I'm going to marry a man from Seoul
for sure, no matter what.

572
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:57,318
I'd never marry a man who doesn't know
what "nostalgia" is. Never!

No, of course not.

578
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,127
If I hadn't met your father,
I wouldn't have any of you.

Gwang-rye,
will you please stop crying already?

599
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,413
Look at you there.
You're sending away your precious son.

600
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,834
May he get to shore and find himself
a wife from a noble family.

[Gye-ok scoffs]

602
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:43,174
[Mak-cheon] So we tried it your way
and fed worms to the chicken.

603
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,302
I'm impressed, my dear.
I really am. You did great.

604
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,721
I'm a bit frightened of you too.

I wanted to ask you something, if I could?

607

Go ahead.

608
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,696
You can talk to me
like you would with your own mother.

609
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,449
Uh, is it true

610
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,204
that Gwan-sik is one of
the fastest four runners on Jeju Island?

611
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,083
Is he… is he really
that close to winning medals?

612
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,255
I think if he could focus on it,
he probably could've won medals, yes.

613
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,466
He's not even really in fourth place.
He's practically third.

614
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,678
Honestly, it's pretty much neck and neck.

615
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,848
What a total and utter idiot.

616
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,226
Uh, do you guys usually
talk to each other that way?

617
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,104
He said he was only
in athletics for the food.

618
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,648
He never said he was actually good.

620
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:45,778
How can he follow me around for ten years
without telling me he likes athletics?

621
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,741
He always lets me go on and on
about becoming a poet, while he…

622
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:51,951
while he…

623
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,454
Boys from the Yang family are like that.

624
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:58,541
Because they always assume
they shouldn't express their own opinions.

Gwan-sik…

629
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,184
will lose everything if he stays with you.

630
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,479
He will lose his dreams
as well as his family.

You know what it means to be lonely,
don't you?

Oh, don't look so down.

652
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,141
I've been coaching for ten years,

653
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,269
and none of my students ever ran
a hundred laps 'cause I told 'em to.

654
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,354
You're the first one to take me up on it.

655
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,858
Your mother is going to sell fish
so you can go study on the mainland.

656
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,652
So let's train hard
and win a gold medal for her, eh?

657
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,571
Once you win a gold medal,

658
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,033
you'll forget all about that girl.

659
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,160
You know that gold medals…

660
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,286
Yeah?

661
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,412
…aren't pure gold?

662
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,165
Huh?

663
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,211
Why should I work so hard
for something that's not pure gold?

664
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,963
I don't need one anymore.

665
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,506
What, is your life over?

666
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,801
You've been going on and on about
going to the mainland and winning gold.

667
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,344
I said that 'cause…

668
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,681
because Ae-sun wanted to leave the island.

669
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,268
Are you telling me
your only purpose in life is this Ae-sun?

670
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,352
That's right.

671
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,521
Come on, get up. Get up!

672
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,900
The hundred laps,
I… I only ran them because of Ae-sun.

673
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,112
I can't get to Seoul selling fish.
School grades aren't good enough.

674

So I thought being good at sports
was my only shot.

00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,866
Who wants to do that?

676
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,079
-Come on, stand up.
-I actually hate athletics.

-What?
-I'm not cut out for it.

679
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,169
They could give me a box of gold.
I'll never finish above fourth.

[ticking fades]

690
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,206
I'm a modern man, you know?

691
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,293
I'm willing to forgive you.

692
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,631
Any other family
would've shown you the door.

693
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,346
How dare that boy speak to me that way?
He's a nobody.

694
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,722
God!

695
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,560
When all his family does
is run a tiny little fishmonger?

696
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,272
He doesn't even own anything,
that impudent little punk.

697
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,149
The store isn't that tiny.

698
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,986
-What?
-I said it isn't that tiny. His store.

699
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,488
Well, well,
you think just because I'm nice to you,

700
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,615
that gives you the right
to speak to an adult that way?

701
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,784
Then why is an adult marrying a child?

702
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,120
[chuckles] Listen, you brat.

703
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,789
-Don't speak rudely to me.
-Watch yourself.

704
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,543
I'm really starting to think you don't
fully appreciate your situation here.

705
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:13,796
I can't speak my mind to a girl
whose tuition I'm going to pay?

706
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,716
It's not like I'm marrying
the virgin daughter of a wealthy family.

707
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,384
Keep your damn money, then.

708
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,428
I don't want it.

709
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,806
Really?

710
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,059
Wait, wait, are you… serious?

711
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,438
[Ae-sun sobs] What about college?

712
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,900
What about being a poet in the mainland?

713
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,985
[emotional piano music playing]

714
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,072
Well, I think that…
that my family should pay for me to go.

715
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,415
Hold on now. I… I thought that
you were marrying me to go to college.

716
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,751
Why else would you marry me?

717
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,838
I said, why else would you marry me?

718
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,758
'Cause I don't

719
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,510
have anywhere else.

720
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,555
What?

721
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,768
'Cause there's nothing else I can do.

722
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,562
[young Ae-sun] <i>I'm going to do it all.</i>

723
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,565
[laughs] And I mean all of it.

724
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,692
I'm going to be the chief
of the fishing village,

725
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,819
and then I'll be president
five times in a row.

726
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,781
-[laughter]
-All right. Go on, do it!

727
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,450
This country could use
a <i>haenyeo </i>president for once.

728
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,703
I can't believe that she wasn't a boy.

729
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,498
How can a girl
with such a tiny little face

730
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,334
have such giant potential? You tell me.

731
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,170
If she has such talent,
what choice does she have?

732
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,297
-She'll have to be president.
-[laughs]

733
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,925
Go ahead.
You already have eight votes from us.

734
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,593
[laughs]

735
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,011
[young Gwan-sik] Nine votes.

736
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,098
[woman 6] That's right. Nine votes.

737
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,475
What grade did you get in math?

738
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,728
When you grow up, what will you be?

739
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,356
[sniffles]

740
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,067
What are you asking him for?

741
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,153
[young Gwan-sik] The First Gentleman.

742
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:04,949
The First Gentleman.

743
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,201
[laughter]

744
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,537
What did he say? [laughs]

745
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,538
Goodness.

746
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,747
Oh, stop it.

747
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,915
[woman 4] Too much.

748
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,583
[woman 3] Aw.

749
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,128
[woman 5] So cute together.

750
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,213
[emotional piano music continues]

751
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,633
[clock ticking]

752
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,971
[breathes anxiously]

753
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,850
The truth is, I'm getting married
because I have nowhere else.

754
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,686
I have nowhere to go. I can just die.

755
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,315
But they say you're better off living
on a pile of dog crap than dead.

756
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,649
I'm the pile of dog crap?

757
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,986
Hey, can't you just hire me or something?

758
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,280
I'll be a housekeeper.
I'm worth it, I swear.

759
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,323
[laughing]

760
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,200
[scoffs]

761
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,494
Look, if I'm getting married,

762
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,705
I'm already getting
a housekeeper for free.

763
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,832
Why would I hire you?

764
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,917
You may be the queen of love,

765
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,045
but not everyone dreams about
marrying their soulmate.

766
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,338
I just want a normal wife.

767
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,758
I want a humble daughter-in-law
and a frugal mother to my children.

768
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,676
Jeez.

769
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,809
You know what? I only met my ex-wife
five times before we got married.

770
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,728
That's how a lot of people do it.

771
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,813
Why are you making this such a big deal?

772
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:18,731
God.

773
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,442
You know what? Stop.

774
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,027
Just give us the cheapest one.

775
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,491
[clock chiming]

776
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,415
Now, I want you to tell me the truth.

777
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,002
You slept with him, didn't you, Ae-sun?

778
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,088
[emotional music playing]

779
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,305
[crying]

780
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,810
Good riddance, you crazy brat, you.

[Ae-sun's daughter]
<i>If she hadn't run that day…</i>

782
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,816

[ship horn blares]

784
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,652
[Gye-ok] Come on, Gyeong-ok.

785
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,778
Let's go home.

786
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,492
[ship horn blaring]

787
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,869
[woman 5] It's raining cats and dogs.

788
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,706
Thank goodness this trouble is over.

789
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,085
Their feelings will fade with distance.
Mark my words.

790
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,087
Yeah, you know what they say.

791
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,923
Once a broken heart,
always a broken heart.

792
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,425
That's what they say at least.

793
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,717
[Ae-sun] Gwan-sik!

794
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,387
Gwan-sik!

795
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,598

[emotional music continues]

797
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,936
[Ae-sun] Where are you going?

798
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,688
[crying]

799
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,106
Don't leave me!

800
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,360
Please don't leave me here alone!

801
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,029
-Oh dear.
-[Ae-sun] Gwan-sik!

802
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,073
What could be stronger than young love?

803
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,825
[Ae-sun] Yang Gwan-sik!

804

Careful, you're gonna fall.

813
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,140
Come on up. [groans]

814
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,933

Please don't go!

Don't go!

My goodness. That crazy brat.

833
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:22,289
-Hey, don't you have a heart?
-Mind your own business, woman!

834

[grunts angrily]

835
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,585
Leave her alone.
Let her scream if she wants.

[Ae-sun crying]

837
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,680
Why do you take everything away?

838

Why do you take everything away?

Ah.

845
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,709
What's going on?

846
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,627
Is someone kicking the Dragon King?

847
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,504
Why are the winds so strong
all of a sudden?

848
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,881
Ah. Hey!

849
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,593
We got some headwinds, everyone.

850
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,803
Turn this boat around!
You have to turn it around!

-[coach] We're at sea!
-Turn this boat around!

-Please! It'll just be a second!
-[coach] You're crazy!

858
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,445
Let me go! Turn it around, please!

859
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,114
Why is that little crazy lunatic
on my boat again?

860
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,034
Please, Captain, please!
You have to turn it around!

Are you insane?

864
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,250
You think you're gonna die

I'll make you something with pork.

-Hmm?

You were such a gift.

You're the reason
they moved out, you know.

963
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,670
You were born eight months
after the wedding,

964
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,464
even though they were caught
in only two days. [laughs]

965

You were a gift.

967

not in Jeju.

I think three would be perfect.

978
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,670
So, if we're going to pay,

979
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,839
listen, pay for their education,

980
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:12,467

So, strategically,

984
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,519
we should try to have a daughter first.

985
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,396

00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,517
My only dream is this little thing.

1037
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,269
[Ae-sun chuckles]

1038
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,271
[Geum-myeong]
<i>The springtime of their lives</i>

1039
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,523
<i>passed by so quickly.</i>

1040
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,859
FLAG
THIS IS A SILENT OUTCRY

1041
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:20,447
<i>By the age of 18,</i>
<i>Mom lost her dream and started a family.</i>

1042
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,451
<i>By the age of 19,</i>

1043
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,829
<i>Dad gave up being a gold medalist</i>
<i>for his daughter Geum-myeong.</i>

1044
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,457
-Maybe she'll be a soccer player.
-[Ae-sun chuckles]

1045
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,708
[Gwan-sik] Look at her legs.

1046
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,251
You know what?

1047
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,630
I hope she becomes
a teacher of literature, Gwan-sik.

1048
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,799
I wonder what she'll become.

1049
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,426
[Ae-sun] I wonder.

1050
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:48,725
{\an8}[Geum-myeong] <i>Springtime for them</i>
<i>wasn't a season to realize their dreams,</i>

1051
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,602
{\an8}<i>but to give them up for good.</i>

1052
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:59,236
<i>And they did it willingly.</i>

1053
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:06,201
{\an8}GEUM-MYEONG, OUR ETERNAL NOSTALGIA

1054
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,121
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

1055
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:13,250
Hello. Mind answering a few questions?

1056
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,292
-Oh.
-Yes.

1057
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,629
So you're here to see the flowers today.
What's going through your mind?

1058
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,966
[man] Well, the flowers remind me
of my first love.

1059
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,009
[reporter] Ah, first love. Of course.

1060
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,511
[woman] Go live with her, then.

1061
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,681
-[reporter] Oh, okay.
-Hye-ran. That's dirty. It's dirty.

1062
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,349
Thank you for the interview.

1063
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,269
-Okay, so let's have another interview.
-Hye-ran, it's dirty. It's dirty.

1064
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,561
Come here. Let's go.

1065
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,606
[reporter] Oh, hello.
You must be newlyweds.

1066
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,942
-[man 2] Yes, that's right.
-[reporter] Congratulations.

1067
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,027
[wistful music playing]

1068
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:45,949
These ones… aren't my grandmother's.
They're mine, you know?

1069
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,410
Your birthday rings aren't yours.
They're your mother's.

1070
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,246
But I really wanted a ring
to propose to her, and…

1071
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,331
[groans] You're both so stubborn.

1072
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,627
Don't look at me like that.

1073
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,714
I actually snuck out for this, so, uh…

1074
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,550
If you could finish by tomorrow…

1075
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,553
You expect me to work all night
just because you said please, kid?

1076
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,729
All right, leave them.

1077
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,775
No girl will live with a man
who won't give her a ring.

1078
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,120
Is the toilet clean?

1079
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,205
Huh? Yeah.

1080
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,624
It's completely fine.

1081
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,966
A new ring, a new dress.

1082
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,385
This will be
a real celebrity wedding, huh?

1083
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,390
Is this the one you want?

1084
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,602
[Gye-ok] You're not walking down
the runway at a fashion show.

1085
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,188
Just rent out an outfit. My goodness.

1086
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,775
Whatever you want.
It's up to you what to wear.

1087
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,903
[groans] With a hat that big,
you might as well join the circus.

1088
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,404
If you want it, take it.

1089
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,281
[Gye-ok] Goodness gracious.

1090
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,742
[Gwan-sik] You like it?

1091
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,994
[Ae-sun] Mm.

1092
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,998
I'll expect you wanna move out?
If you have the money, go ahead.

1093
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,167
What should I do with my hair?

1094
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,755
Should I put it up under the hat
or wear it down?

1095
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:25,757
Huh?

1096
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,966
[Ae-sun] My hair.

1097
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,052
Should I put my hair up or wear it down?

1098
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,474
-Well, don't you think…
-Uh-huh?

1099
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,185
Mm, are you sure,

1100
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,312
years from now,

1101
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,773
you won't regret the hat?

1102
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,108
Why?

1103
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,444
I just think it could,

1104
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,114
uh,

1105
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,784
embarrass you maybe?

1106
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,454
[scoffs]

1107
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,123
So you're a fashion expert now?

1108
00:56:58,206 --> 00:56:59,999
Have you even heard of André Kim?

1109
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,376
No, not really.

1110
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,881
If you're moving out,
do it as soon as possible.

1111
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,216
Oh my gosh.

1112
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,094
-Hmm? Mm.
-[Gwan-sik chuckles]

1113
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,807
Hey. Can we have
quail noodle soup after this?

1114
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,392
You just had it yesterday,

1115
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,060
little piggy.

1116
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,645
[Ae-sun groans, chuckles]

1117
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,190
[Gye-ok sighs]

1118
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,235
It's cute.

1119
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,361
[Ae-sun chuckles]

1120
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,239
[camera shutter clicks]

1121
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:34,576
[Geum-myeong] <i>Mom,</i>
<i>what were you thinking with that hat?</i>

1122
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,744
<i>Were they punishing you or something?</i>

1123
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,458
[feel-good jazz music playing]

1124
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:29,250
"THE SAME SKY, THE SAME STARS,
ETCHED IN THE SAME HEARTS."

[music ends]
