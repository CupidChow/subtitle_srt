00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,900
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,100
The pay-as-you-throw waste system rollout
is causing ongoing confusion.

3
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,000
<i>Fearing they'll have to pay</i>
<i>to dispose of trash,</i>

4
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,700
<i>people are throwing away things</i>
<i>they don't need to.</i>

5
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,900
How could I just throw it away?

6
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,900
I spent money

7
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,600
and sent it off out of respect.

8
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,400
<i>Residents are putting up warning signs</i>
<i>over trash dumping…</i>

9
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,200
It's so hot! Come on, hurry!

10
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,600
It's so hot.

11
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,600
WEDDING INVITATION

12
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,500
<i>Too many home appliances…</i>

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,000
I had to rip the limbs off the stuffed toy

14
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,000
so it would fit
in that designated trash bag.

15
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,000
It just felt so wrong.

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,900
Don't you even have kimchi?

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,700
Everyone knows my engagement is off?

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,300
Hey, what in the world do you eat?

19
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,500
-How do you survive on this?
-Life goes on for the living.

20
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,000
That's enough already.
Your mom called me again.

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,800
Seems like she's checking if you're alive.

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,900
You heard of pain spots?
You know, where you feel pain.

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Our organs have pain spots too.

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,600
All our internal organs have them.

25
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,200
A broken heart

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
isn't just a figure of speech.

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,900
It actually hurts.

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,300
My heart

29
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,100
clenches

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,700
painfully.

31
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,300
It's true.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,600
Call your family, you ungrateful brat.

33
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,300
<i>I could no longer meet</i>
<i>my best friend of seven years,</i>

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,000
<i>but my best friend of 20 years</i>

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,500
<i>was still looking only at me.</i>

36
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,600
Is everything really okay?

37
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,500
How about food?

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,800
You must be out of side dishes.

39
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,700
Should I go?

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,900
I made a lot of jangjorim.

41
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,100
Even married couples can part ways.

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,400
Remarkable people always
live their own way.

43
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,700
By the way… haven't you heard from him?

44
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,000
All right, I won't mention him.

45
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,800
Okay, go on, get some sleep.

46
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,200
Forget what exactly?

47
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,100
Did she say that again?

48
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,700
All she ever says is, "Forget it"
or "You don't need to know."

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,600
I wish she'd talk to me.

50
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,200
I wish she'd open up to me.

51
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,100
Well, she thinks she's a grown-up now.

52
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,300
What else is a mother for?

53
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,700
Who's gonna worry about her more than me?

54
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,400
Are you sad
she's not looking for Mom anymore?

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,800
She used to only look for me.

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,500
Now I'm the only one she doesn't tell.

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,700
She's shutting me out.

58
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,100
Traitor.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Where else would you find
a traitor like this?

60
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,400
<i>I'm only telling you, Mom.</i>

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,400
This is a secret,

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
but I like Kim Jeong-geun.

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,500
I might even marry him.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why?

65
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,000
Why do you like Jeong-geun?

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,800
He's cute. He's the cutest
in our neighborhood.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Goodness.

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,400
Geum-myeong, you're a big girl now.

69
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,800
There's even a boy you like.

70
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,400
But you know,

71
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,400
I wish you'd grow up a little slower.

72
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,100
Just a little slower.

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Why?

74
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,900
You're adorable right now.

75
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,100
You're just so adorable.

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,300
<i>Geum-myeong.</i>

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,500
Even when you grow up,

78
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,100
promise to tell me
lots of your secrets, okay?

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,500
Of course, you're my secret keeper.

80
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,700
Really?

81
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
You're my best friend, Mom.

82
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,000
Even more than Kim Jeong-geun?

83
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,100
Goodness.

84
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,400
Mom, who's your best friend?

85
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,800
Mine? You're my best friend.

86
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,100
Then who do you like?

87
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,400
I like Yang Gwan-sik.

88
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,900
More than me?

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,900
No, you're my favorite
in the whole wide world.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,100
Actually, you're my favorite too.

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,400
Really?

92
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,700
Yeah, that's why I bought Popeye
for a snack.

93
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,700
Because you said Popeye was your favorite.

94
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,700
My favorite snack is Apollo.

95
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,500
Oh my. That's why you bought Popeye?

96
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,400
I decided not to buy Apollo

97
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,300
because I love you.

98
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,300
My goodness.

99
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,300
POPEYE

100
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,500
Thank you.

101
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,700
That makes me so happy.

102
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,700
<i>We used to be each other's world.</i>

103
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,000
<i>One left that world,</i>
<i>while the other stayed behind.</i>

104
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,100
What should I make for you later?
I'll make anything.

105
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,000
I want jangjorim.

106
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,700
<i>Jangjorim?</i>

107
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,100
<i>My mom still stayed in the world</i>
<i>where her sweetest secret keeper was.</i>

108
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,300
How can the two of us eat all this?

109
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,000
Where's the fun in eating these?

110
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,800
She works, so it must be hard for her
to visit us over the weekend.

111
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
She'd be tired too.

112
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,400
<i>After receiving about a thousand calls</i>
<i>from home asking if I'd eaten,</i>

113
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,200
<i>I felt a strong hunger.</i>

114
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,800
Mom, I'm hungry.

115
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,500
<i>I started craving Mom's cooking.</i>

116
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,500
Baby.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
How did you manage to come? How?

118
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,100
I took a vacation.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,100
You should've called me.
It's late already.

120
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,300
I'm hungry.

121
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,600
Yeah, we have food.

122
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,700
I'll whip up some fresh rice in no time.

123
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,900
Baby.

124
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,900
I made a whole pot of jangjorim.

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,600
Your dad has been peeling quail eggs
for you since yesterday.

126
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
That's right. Chonggak kimchi!

127
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,700
It's well-fermented now.

128
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
You like it sour, don't you?

129
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,500
Eun-myeong likes it fresh,
and you like it sour.

130
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,100
I always have to make it separately.
You're just killing me, you are.

131
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,600
The floor's cold. It's cold.

132
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,300
<i>I actually knew it already.</i>

133
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,200
<i>How quiet the house must have been</i>
<i>until just five minutes ago,</i>

134
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,200
<i>and how lonely they must have been.</i>

135
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,500
All right.

136
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,100
If you had called,
I would have gone to the airport.

137
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,300
So you can show up an hour early
like last time?

138
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,800
Go back to sleep after you eat, okay?

139
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,400
Are you feeding a pig?

140
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,700
<i>As a kid, after I fell and cried,</i>
<i>they would give me candy.</i>

141
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,500
Mom, I don't eat broccoli.

142
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
It's for digestion.

143
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,600
Let's have some nice,
simple noodles for lunch.

144
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,500
Here.

145
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,500
You call this simple?

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,100
Then what does "not simple" look like?

147
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,200
<i>After I recovered from the mumps,</i>
<i>they bought me a pork cutlet.</i>

148
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,900
Come on, you love spicy noodles.

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Geum-myeong!

150
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,500
Steamed buns!

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
You love red beans.

152
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,400
<i>For their heartbroken daughter,</i>

153
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,700
<i>they once again focused</i>
<i>on doing just one thing.</i>

154
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,900
Yeah, she just showed up out of the blue.

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,700
Obviously, she missed her mom.

157
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
That's right, you punk.

158
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,900
Amberjack!

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,100
Real amberjack.

160
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,600
Is there fake amberjack?

161
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,800
<i>Against all odds,</i>
<i>they raised me yet again.</i>

162
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,800
Dad, I'm going to gain weight.

163
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,300
Wow, it's amberjack.

164
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,800
<i>They made sure not a pound of me</i>
<i>disappeared from the world.</i>

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,300
Really? Okay.

166
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,400
-It's freezing.
-Wow, your brother wants to talk to you.

167
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,100
What? You miss me
now that you're in the military?

168
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,100
"Oh, Sister!"

169
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,800
<i>So you got dumped, huh?</i>
<i>He dumped you, didn't he?</i>

170
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,400
<i>"Oh, Yeong-beom…"</i>

171
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,400
<i>In the fortress</i>
<i>that was both comforting and unsettling,</i>

172
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,700
<i>I slept well and recharged,</i>
<i>just like a bear hibernating for winter.</i>

173
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,000
Geum-myeong.

174
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,700
Geum-myeong.

175
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,600
Geum-myeong.

176
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,900
What is it?

177
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,700
You want to sleep more?

178
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,300
Do you really have to sleep more?

179
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
What?

180
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,900
Wake up.

181
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,100
What is it?

182
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,100
Let's go somewhere together.

183
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,100
We can just go later.

184
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,400
Dad, I'm tired!

185
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Go back to sleep.

186
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,600
<i>Why did that thought cross my mind</i>
<i>at that moment?</i>

187
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,300
<i>When I went on trips with Yeong-beom,</i>
<i>I used to jump out of bed at 4:00 a.m.</i>

188
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,900
You knew I'd get up, didn't you?

189
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,400
Why did he put a life jacket on me?

190
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,600
GEUMEUNDONG

191
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,100
Aren't you fishing?

192
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,300
-It's my day off.
-You?

193
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,200
Apparently, there are no clouds.

194
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,600
It's coming now. There it is.

195
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
You woke me up to see the sunrise?

196
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,700
You know the new Sunrise Condo
by the Sunrise Restaurant?

197
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,100
You have to pay 30,000 won a night
to see it from there.

198
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,900
But you're seeing it for free,
thanks to your dad.

199
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,700
I'll just pay 30,000 won too.

200
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,100
Pay me, then.

201
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Seeing the sunrise gives you energy.

202
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,600
When I see the sunrise,
I pray no matter what.

203
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,400
For you all to do well,
I just pray every single day.

204
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,700
You see the sunrise every single day?
Are you out here at this time every day?

205
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,300
Don't you want to sleep in?

206
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Who in the world doesn't want to sleep in?

207
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,800
So why is yours the only boat
that sets out so early every day?

208
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,100
How do you live like this every day?

209
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,100
Maybe if I sleep less,

210
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,800
you two can sleep more.

211
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,900
That just wakes me up.

212
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,000
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

213
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,800
<i>there's never been a day</i>
<i>when Dad woke up later than I did.</i>

214
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't you have any hand cream?

215
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,900
Wow, your mom only packed things you love.

216
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
The rolled omelet is yours though.

217
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,100
Your mom is so excited to cook for you.

218
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,500
Doesn't it get scary?

219
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
It's scary.

220
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,500
There's nothing in the world
as scary as the ocean.

221
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,400
So you just put up with it?
Even if you're scared?

222
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,200
When the wind is fierce and I get scared,

223
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,300
that's what I look at.

224
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,300
The lighthouse?

225
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,500
No.

226
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,700
You see that tiny light over there?

227
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,800
It's the light of a fishing boat.

228
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,700
I just look at that.

229
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Thinking that the boat must feel
lonely and scared like me

230
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,600
makes it less scary.

231
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,200
Thinking about going together
makes it manageable.

232
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,400
Mom and I are always
sailing a boat by your side.

233
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,400
If you're ever hungry,

234
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,800
don't think twice and come home.

235
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,300
Dad.

236
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,400
You're embarrassed, huh?

237
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,900
How do you face the neighborhood?
You already gave out the invitations.

238
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,500
Not at all. I'd be more embarrassed
if you married into that family.

239
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,300
I knew you wouldn't marry him.
I know everything.

240
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,900
You do everything well,
so it'll all go well.

241
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,100
You always say that.

242
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,900
If you say so, does everything go well?

243
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
What else can I do

244
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,800
other than say these words?

245
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,700
If you were born into a richer,
more successful family instead of mine,

246
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,700
they would've done everything,
all kinds of things for you

247
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,500
and made sure you never got hurt.

248
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,900
Then don't be my dad in the next life.

249
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,300
Don't ever be my dad again.

250
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,200
-Don't go through all this trouble.
-What trouble?

251
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm just happy.

252
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,000
Not once did I have trouble,
thanks to you.

253
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,500
Not even once.

254
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,000
You always give me 120 things
when you only have 100.

255
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,900
How can you give me more?

256
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Don't ever bring up "rich dad."

257
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,500
I wouldn't trade you
for the richest man in the world.

258
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,900
I think that's cured my knees.

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,400
Just go to the hospital if you're in pain.
You think cooling patches fix everything?

260
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,800
Seriously, you're so annoying.

261
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
You're so annoying.

262
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,400
To be honest, I don't mind…

263
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,600
if you don't get married.

264
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,000
Actually, I like that better.

265
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,300
I'm going to get married.

266
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,900
You're always happy being married.

267
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Why do you keep telling me not to?

268
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,600
<i>That day, I saw a different sun.</i>

269
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,600
<i>Only after my sun,</i>
<i>the first to light up the lonely ocean,</i>

270
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,200
<i>had set forever…</i>

271
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,200
<i>did I realize how warm it was</i>
<i>to be by my dad's side.</i>

272
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,300
Why are you getting off the boat?

273
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,700
I saw the sunrise with my dad.

274
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,000
What about your mom? Isn't she working?

275
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,100
It was just me and my dad.

276
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,600
-Just you two?
-Yes.

277
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,400
-Just the two of you?
-Yes!

278
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,800
Hey, do you study hard?

279
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,200
Dad, do you need help?

280
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,000
You look just like your mom.

281
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,100
Do you study hard?

282
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,700
-I'm actually working.
-Where?

283
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,900
-At a major corporation.
-Which one? Damn it.

284
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
Give it to me.

285
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,100
-You're setting sail on a Sunday?
-What's a Sunday for a seaman?

286
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,300
Hey, wear your shoes properly.

287
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
Why? Did your wife tell you
to go out again?

288
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,900
Again? Damn it! What do you even know?

289
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,800
What do you know about my family?

290
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Every family has its own way.

291
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,400
He's so disrespectful.

292
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,700
-To someone else's dad.
-Hey!

293
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,400
Hey, he may be a captain now,

294
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,200
but he used to pull in the nets
and cook ramyeon for me, you hear me?

295
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,700
Well, in any case,
you're both captains now, aren't you?

296
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Who said otherwise?

297
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,900
That brat Yang Eun-myeong
broke up with his daughter, right?

298
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,100
That family, seriously.

299
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,900
They are just… Damn it.

300
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
<i>My husband</i>

301
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,800
won't be working for you anymore.

302
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,900
He won't be working for you!

303
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,900
Fine. Then don't.

304
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,100
Please don't.

305
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,500
Why's she holding her dad's hand
at her age?

306
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,600
SANDGLASS

307
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,300
Well… what are you up to these days?

308
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,800
Are you running the store properly?

309
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,900
Is it makeup you're selling
or that ridiculous hairstyle?

310
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,500
You know,

311
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
If you've got time,
you and I can go out on a boat,

312
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
you know,

313
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,500
early in the morning…

314
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,800
Okay?

315
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,800
You know, when the sun rises, we can--

316
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,100
Hire somebody.

317
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,700
What?

318
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,100
I'm busy too.

319
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,300
Do you write to that boy or not? Do you?

320
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,100
If you visit him, you're dead meat.

321
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,400
-He won't see me even if I go.
-So you went?

322
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
You did, didn't you? You brat!

323
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,200
I can have him put in military prison!

324
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,100
A friend of mine is a general.

325
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,300
Really,

326
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,100
aren't you ashamed?

327
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,900
You what?

328
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,600
You go around meeting
every woman out there.

329
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,800
It's hilarious that you won't let me
date a single guy.

330
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,700
Goddamn it!

331
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,000
Seriously. What the hell do you know?

332
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,400
Your four kids witnessed it.

333
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,800
Shouting "Goddamn it" all the time
will never make us listen to you.

334
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,100
I should shave your hair off, you little--

335
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,400
Fine, go ahead and shave my head!

336
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,300
You've already ruined my life anyway.

337
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,000
See how you like it
when you're stuck with me forever.

338
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Don't you dare slam that door on me!

339
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,000
It was the wind!

340
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,000
-Listen--
-What?

341
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,600
Too noisy again? Do you own this house?

342
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,300
And what the hell are you even studying?

343
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,400
It's about dinner.

344
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,600
Make whatever.

345
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,000
Actually,

346
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,700
can you eat out before coming home?

347
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,000
Why do you keep eating at home now?

348
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,100
It's uncomfortable for everyone.

349
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,200
Everyone? It's uncomfortable for everyone?

350
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,400
Why is it uncomfortable?

351
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Raise your hand if it's uncomfortable!

352
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,300
T.O. I LOVE EUN-MYEONG

353
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,500
600KM APART, 6MM AT HEART
I WILL ALWAYS WAIT FOR YOU

354
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,400
I DO WAT I WANT
DON'T TELL ME WAT TO DO

355
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,700
You all get to eat white rice,
thanks to me!

356
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,400
You hear me? It's all thanks to me!

357
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,700
Apparently, their kumquat field
is around 10,000 to 17,000 ㎡.

358
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,800
That's quite a big difference,
10,000 ㎡ to 17,000 ㎡.

359
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,200
You know what they say
about the father of that family?

360
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,700
They call him Seogwipo's Yang Gwan-sik.
He's such a devoted husband.

361
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,400
But they actually have
more than a kumquat field.

362
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,800
I heard they own a mountain too.
That family owns a huge mountain.

363
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,400
Do you have a crush on the guy or what?

364
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,700
Why do you keep talking about
the kumquat man?

365
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,600
They have a kumquat field.

366
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,500
They own a mountain. They also have a son.

367
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,300
A public official.

368
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,600
He is 29 and went to a college in Seoul.

369
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,100
To know what a man is like,
you must look at his father.

370
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,100
They learn how to treat their family
from their father.

371
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
That's why Eun-myeong's
such a dating expert?

372
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,600
The kumquat man's son
looks like the actor Choi Jae-sung.

373
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,000
You need a handsome man.

374
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,700
You fight a lot less
if you marry a handsome one.

375
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,500
Mom, it's only been a year
since I broke off the engagement.

376
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,500
So what? Is it a crime or something?

377
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,400
The entire neighborhood knows.

378
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Seeing someone else already?
How does that make me look?

379
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,100
So what if they know?

380
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,700
The entire neighborhood knows nothing.

381
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,700
-Why didn't you hand them out?
-Just because.

382
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,200
I had a feeling you'd call it off.

383
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,500
What?

384
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
That's how I raised you.

385
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,700
<i>If she can't even ride that,</i>

386
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,300
she'll spend her whole life
in the kitchen.

387
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,600
I want her to have everything.

388
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
And I want her to do everything,

389
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,900
every single thing she wants.

390
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,100
I don't want her to set the table.

391
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,400
I want her to be the one to flip it.

392
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,200
Geum-myeong.

393
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,300
You gotta pedal harder. Go on!

394
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,600
Keep having run rolling!

395
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Keep rolling!

396
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,900
<i>Why didn't you flip some tables yourself?</i>

397
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,500
<i>Weren't you angry that you couldn't?</i>

398
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,700
Seven.

399
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,700
Eight.

400
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,600
<i>Why were you always so nice?</i>
<i>Was there a prize for it?</i>

401
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,200
ONE BASKET OF TANGERINES
80 WON FOR TEN

402
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,200
That's 11.

403
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,500
-What?
-Eleven.

404
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,400
<i>It was because of you.</i>

405
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Right.

406
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,100
<i>Because of you.</i>

407
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,300
<i>You were looking at me</i>
<i>with those sweet, twinkling eyes.</i>

408
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,200
How could I just live as I please?

409
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,700
When I held you guys after I gave birth,
this is what I thought to myself.

410
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,800
"From now on, my life will become

411
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,500
the stories my children remember
when they grow up."

412
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,700
"The stories my children will reminisce
about when they come to my funeral."

413
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,700
Once I realized that,

414
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,000
I couldn't bring myself
to live a single day dishonestly.

415
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,300
<i>"The eldest child</i>
<i>of Yang Gwan-sik and Oh Ae-sun."</i>

416
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,500
<i>I think I kind of understood</i>
<i>why that was written on the invitation.</i>

417
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,800
<i>I was their Geum-myeong.</i>

418
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
Geum-myeong.

419
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,300
You did nothing wrong. You avoided
a pile of crap because of your luck.

420
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,400
Yeong-beom isn't a pile of crap.

421
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,700
And I know.

422
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,300
You don't have to tell me for me to know.

423
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,200
You're crying on the inside.

424
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,400
When you were a child,

425
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,200
Kim Jeong-geun
didn't want to sit next to you,

426
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,800
and you cried for four days.

427
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,900
How do you even remember his name?

428
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,900
How can I forget it?

429
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,500
It's a secret my secret keeper
told only me.

430
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,300
Think of it as wrapping something precious

431
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,800
and tucking it away
in a warm spot on the floor.

432
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,900
Okay?

433
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,600
Once in a while, it'd be nostalgic
to take it out and look at it.

434
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,800
They say your first love
is meant to be a memory.

435
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,600
How would you know?

436
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
You live with your first love.

437
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,000
Live with the joy you had
riding your bike when you were a kid.

438
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,000
It'd be a waste
to miss out on the fun now.

439
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,800
My goodness.

440
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,100
Your hands are still so young.

441
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,900
Just like freshly bloomed petals.

442
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,200
Flower petals.

443
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,700
It'd be a waste for you too.

444
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
You should do something.

445
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,800
Write poems.

446
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,300
I write every day.

447
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,300
My poetry collection is over there.

448
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,000
1995 HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNT BOOK
OH AE-SUN

449
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
<i>Just like an old garment is turned</i>
<i>into new clothes by a skilled tailor…</i>

450
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,500
<i>I went there like a rag,</i>
<i>but I came back neat and sharp.</i>

451
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
She was only here for a few days,

452
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,300
but the house just feels so empty now.

453
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,200
Well, it's always been just the two of us.

454
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,900
Seriously, my goodness.

455
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,500
She should buy things for herself, not us.

456
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,600
She's so caring.

457
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,900
She's just way too caring.

458
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
FOR THE FOOD
WRITE YOUR POEM

459
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,300
<i>I received so much,</i>
<i>yet my smallest gesture made us even.</i>

460
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,600
<i>That's how unfair we were.</i>

461
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,100
Goodness, my bones.

462
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,900
The cold makes my bones ache
more and more.

463
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,400
Oh my.

464
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,600
What kind of debt must one owe
to be born a mother?

465
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,900
Our elder went into the water
even past the age of 80

466
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,400
but passed away
without a single intact undergarment.

467
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,600
Her kids chipped away
at the money in their old mom's hands,

468
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,500
yet they couldn't see
it was the price of her life?

469
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,200
They took all from their mother's life
yet cried like devoted children.

470
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,900
But she said she broke even

471
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,300
because even a president might end up
in a prison uniform,

472
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,000
but at least she made a living
on her own until the end.

473
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
Oh my.

474
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,700
Not even a dog would steal
a haenyeo's fortune.

475
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,400
The problem lies in one's character,
not one's fortune.

476
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,800
Ae-sun also needs to toughen up.

477
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,400
She feels sorry for everyone,
so she's always broke.

478
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,300
Should I go stop her?

479
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,900
Let her be.

480
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Once we leave this life,

481
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,500
Ae-sun won't have her aunts or friends.

482
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,300
How long can we stand up for her?
Make sure she stands without backup.

483
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,300
Well, at least I don't just take it.
I fight back.

484
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,700
Come on.
Why can't you just live well, just well?

485
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,600
That's why, from the very start,
no one has a fate like yours.

486
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,900
You have a husband
who's a complete fool for you,

487
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,200
a top-university daughter,

488
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,700
and the haenyeo bullies
just gave you a good spot.

489
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,400
-Hey, I'm right here.
-That's not all.

490
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,700
Your sister-in-law
takes care of your parents-in-law.

491
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,200
I wondered when she'd boast about that.

492
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,300
By principle, why should I look after Mom
when she has an older son?

493
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,200
You think you're taking care of her?

494
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,800
You sold off your parents' house
for your business.

495
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,500
Now you're turning your elderly mom
into a maid to look after your children.

496
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,800
"Taking care"? As if.

497
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,600
My mom hates that auntie the most.

498
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,200
When you were a child,
Ae-sun fed you three meals a day.

499
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,200
You should be repaying her
for raising you.

500
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,300
You think Ae-sun's pocket is yours?

501
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,500
What's your problem?

502
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,900
What the hell did you bring?

503
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,400
Why did you bring that mat?

504
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,400
ELVAN WELLNESS MAT

505
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,200
Ae-sun, if Gwan-sik sleeps on that,

506
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,100
it will help his knees heal
and even prevent cancer.

507
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,100
It's actually more expensive,
but I'm not here to profit from family.

508
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,600
I think of you first
when I see something good.

509
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,800
If Gwan-sik places his crooked fingers
on the hot mat, the infrared--

510
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,100
What are you doing? This isn't refundable.

511
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,400
Mother also has back pain, right?

512
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,700
Don't lie and say you bought it for her.

513
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,200
Tell her it's from me.

514
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,200
If I'm spending money,
I might as well boast about it.

515
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,200
You're making me embarrassed.

516
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,400
Go. Just go.

517
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,000
Please come empty-handed next time.

518
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,900
Ae-sun. Your personality
determines your fate, right?

519
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,800
What, are you going to say
my fate is good again?

520
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,800
Look.

521
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,500
You took all my money again today.

522
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,200
Eat one more.

523
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,400
Just one more!

524
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Goodness, what a lousy fate I have.

525
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Who knew I'd be cleaning up after
my grandchild past the age of 60?

526
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,200
Unplug it when you're not using it.
It'll catch fire.

527
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,900
Whenever he catches a cold,

528
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,500
that damn Gyeong-ok blames me
for how I dressed him.

529
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,000
This is worse than looking after in-laws.

530
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,500
-Hey!
-Seo Dong-min!

531
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,000
Stand at attention! Attention, now!

532
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,400
Why sit there
if you're not going to say anything?

533
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,200
Just go. Go home to your wife.

534
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
No one's ever been on my side
my entire life.

535
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,800
So, how's your back?

536
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,300
Just mind your wife's back.

537
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,700
Stop using patches and go get acupuncture.

538
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,900
I'll take you there and back.

539
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,800
Yeah, right.

540
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,000
Well, I guess

541
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,700
I've always been biased--

542
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,900
Even a staunch nationalist
wouldn't be as biased as you

543
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,100
in a Korea-Japan match.

544
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,700
Well, listen…

545
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,800
I wouldn't trade you
for the richest man in the world.

546
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,200
I wouldn't trade you
for Korea's most celebrated mother.

547
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,500
Lift your foot!
Why would she want to be your mom?

548
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,400
Doesn't she have a preference?

549
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,800
No daughter-in-law can truly be filial
with a filial son,

550
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,100
and no mother-in-law can tolerate
a son foolishly devoted to his wife.

551
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,500
Even the most celebrated mother
would turn her back on you.

552
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,300
Give it to me.

553
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,200
What's an ungrateful son for?

554
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,900
At least he can do this.

555
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,500
Who said you're an ungrateful son?

556
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,000
Who said that?

557
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,300
Didn't you say you should've raised dogs?
The whole neighborhood knows.

558
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,500
Tell them to stop talking crap.

559
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,200
You've been a filial son too.

560
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,800
I know what it's like to lose parents
but not a child.

561
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,100
Staying alive was the real filial duty.
Who wouldn't know that?

562
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,200
Mom, look.

563
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,300
It's Jong-gu.
Your eldest grandson, Jong-gu, is here.

564
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,300
Grandma, it's me, Jong-gu.

565
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,900
You don't even recognize Jong-gu?

566
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,200
Jong-gu, the stupid idiot.

567
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,100
Mom, you taught Jong-gu to read and write.

568
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,500
He didn't even know his times tables then,
but he grew up to be a card shark.

569
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,600
Sister, you know who I am?

570
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,100
Who am I?

571
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,700
Come on, sister.

572
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,400
Dear me.

573
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,300
My mom once mastered
the Korean and Chinese alphabets,

574
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,200
but she's totally lost her sharpness.

575
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,300
How come it's her mind
that crosses the river first?

576
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,300
-Hello, Ae-sun.
-You're here, Ae-sun.

577
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,000
Come on in.

578
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,600
When did you come all the way?

579
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,700
I thought I might never celebrate
my sister's birthday again.

580
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,000
I came just in case this is the last one.

581
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Grandma, I'm here.

582
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,400
She doesn't know.
She doesn't recognize anyone.

583
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,300
Ae-sun, this is really upsetting me.

584
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,400
She doesn't recognize anyone.

585
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Goodness.

586
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Grandma.

587
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,700
Grandma, I brought you senbei snacks. See?

588
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,900
After you finish your meal--

589
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,200
Of course I know.

590
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,000
Han-gyu's daughter.

591
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,000
My son Han-gyu's daughter.

592
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,800
You…

593
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,900
Have you been well?

594
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,800
So I've always been
Han-gyu's daughter to you?

595
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,800
You forget my name
but remember that I'm Han-gyu's daughter?

596
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,200
Does that make you sad?

597
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,500
No, I'm happy.

598
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,600
I'm so happy.

599
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,600
What is it?

600
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,200
Is something bothering you?

601
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,700
What is it that's bothering you?

602
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,900
What is it?

603
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,700
Is something bothering you?

604
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,000
Is something bothering you?

605
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,200
Nothing's bothering me. Nothing at all.

606
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,600
So what if it is?
Will you buy her another boat?

607
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,700
Just one word
about Han-gyu's daughter's struggle,

608
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,200
and my mom just went ahead
and got her a whole boat.

609
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,600
Mother, I'm struggling too.

610
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,000
Your 60-year-old daughter-in-law
is struggling too.

611
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,600
-Please get me a boat too.
-Stop it.

612
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,000
Grandma.

613
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,900
Do you want to come live with me now?

614
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,200
No.

615
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,600
Come live with us.

616
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,500
I don't want to.

617
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,700
You know Gwan-sik is so caring.

618
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,300
He'll do anything I ask him.

619
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,200
No.

620
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Why not?

621
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,900
Not your house.

622
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,500
Why? Because we are two generations apart?

623
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,800
Grandma, I'll get you dentures
in the spring.

624
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,500
I can cash in my savings plan then.

625
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,900
I'll make sure you get dentures with that.

626
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,100
You? Dentures for me?

627
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,400
Yeah.

628
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,700
You also helped me get new teeth
when I was a child.

629
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,600
<i>Gap-toothed little pup</i>
<i>Don't go near the waters</i>

630
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,700
<i>You'll scare the baby fish</i>
<i>Don't go near the magpie</i>

631
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,000
<i>Caw, caw, they will badmouth you</i>

632
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Let's see.

633
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,200
I won't pull it just yet.
Let me just check if the thread is hooked.

634
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,200
Liar. You say that,
but you'll still pull it out.

635
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,800
You're so smart, just like your dad.
Let's pull that tooth.

636
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,600
That crow is waiting for your tooth.

637
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,100
Wait a moment. Let me count to ten.

638
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,200
It won't hurt. It won't hurt at all.

639
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,600
Pull his tooth first.
His tooth is wobbly too.

640
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,100
Let me see how much it hurts.

641
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,800
His parents can pull his out.

642
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,000
Why do you have a thread on your tooth?

643
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,800
Go get your tooth pulled at home.

644
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,500
You came here to sell hairtail.
Why are you getting a tooth pulled?

645
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,400
Gwan-sik, you do it first.

646
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,200
You try it first.

647
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,600
Can you see if it hurts or not?

648
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,800
Aren't you scared?

649
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,200
So you aren't scared?

650
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,100
My clever little girl.

651
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,700
Where did you pick up
this cute little fool?

652
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,600
Good job.

653
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,300
Huh? Did you pull it?

654
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,700
It didn't hurt, did it?

655
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,500
<i>There comes a season for everyone</i>
<i>when they lose their second tooth.</i>

656
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,800
When did my gap-toothed little pup
grow so big?

657
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,500
The crows won't bring you
new teeth anymore.

658
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,100
I should take care of them.

659
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,300
I know something's bothering you.

660
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,300
I know how you feel.

661
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,600
I know exactly how you feel.

662
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,600
I also want to call out his name loudly
at least once…

663
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,300
and cry my heart out.

664
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,600
After holding it in all my life,

665
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,100
it's now hard for me…

666
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,000
to even say Han-gyu's name.

667
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,200
So I feel even more sorry.

668
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
I know

669
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,400
how you feel.

670
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,600
I know exactly how you feel.

671
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,900
<i>"I know exactly how you feel."</i>

672
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
<i>Those words</i>

673
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,100
<i>brought Mom to her grandma's lap…</i>

674
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,500
<i>where she cried for a long time.</i>

675
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,600
Why won't you go with her?

676
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,300
She's the daughter
of your favorite son, Han-gyu.

677
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,500
I wonder how much she paid for this.

678
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,500
Why? Do you find it harder
to ask your granddaughter for favors?

679
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,300
Or because of grandson-in-law?

680
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,100
This mat is expensive, isn't it?

681
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,600
You bought her a boat,
so why feel uncomfortable?

682
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,000
Go and enjoy
your granddaughter's food for once.

683
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,100
I couldn't even raise her myself.

684
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,600
I couldn't even feed her a whole croaker
when she was little.

685
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,600
How can I go live there?

686
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,100
You just can't forget
about the damn croakers.

687
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,300
You used to share your croakers
with her all the time!

688
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,300
Oh dear.

689
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,900
Once I get up there,

690
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,600
all that's waiting for me
is Han-Gyu's scolding.

691
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,700
All that's waiting for me
is a scolding from my child.

692
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,700
So warm and cozy.

693
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,900
I think I'm going to sleep well.

694
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,100
Oh my, Mother.

695
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,400
You look like a new bride.

696
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,500
Your children will remember you
by this photo, so pink looks great, right?

697
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,200
Did I live well?

698
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,900
Did I pay off my debt?

699
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,500
You did plenty.

700
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,200
Immeasurably so.

701
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,400
I'm out of breath.

702
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,400
Really out of breath from it all.

703
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,000
You must be gasping for air, right?

704
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,800
So,

705
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:58,700
was it a picnic or an ordeal?

706
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,000
<i>Definitely a picnic.</i>

707
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,200
<i>I got to see all my children.</i>

708
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,600
<i>It was an unbelievable picnic.</i>

709
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,800
I can't believe it.

710
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,700
KIM CHUN-OK OF GIMHAE KIM CLAN
MAY YOU FINALLY BE REUNITED

711
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,100
Every season in life is full of farewells.

712
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,300
Right?

713
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,200
No one arrives,

714
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,800
and all I see
is people leaving one by one.

715
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Father, Mom.

716
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,600
<i>Your grandmother, your father.</i>

717
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,900
You were right, Mother.

718
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,300
My daughter-in-law was a cut above yours.

719
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,600
Right?

720
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,700
Dear me, I brought three spoons again.

721
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,100
<i>Auntie Chung-su.</i>

722
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,900
<i>My grandmother.</i>

723
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,300
You should've gotten dentures
before you left.

724
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,300
<i>And…</i>

725
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:04,200
Still, let's leave this world together.

726
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,300
Okay?

727
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,500
<i>We thought we came to the picnic together,</i>

728
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,800
<i>but each had their own tide.</i>

729
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,000
<i>Just as the tides ebb and flow,</i>

730
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,900
<i>some have left,</i>

731
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,600
<i>but for some…</i>

732
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,300
He's here.

733
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,900
The door's open. It's open.

734
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,400
<i>…it was the season</i>
<i>for a new arrival at the picnic.</i>

735
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,300
Oh dear, you must've been through so much.

736
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,900
Eun-myeong, I'm so happy to see you.

737
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,700
Thank you so much, my son.

738
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,200
Why are you just standing there?
Come on in.

739
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,400
I made all kinds of things for you.

740
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,100
You want to give us a salute
before coming in?

741
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,300
Salute?

742
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,000
Wait, why do you have so many things?

743
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,100
Mother.

744
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,600
Fine. Go ahead.

745
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,700
Did you bring something?

746
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,000
What is it?

747
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,100
Hello.

748
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,700
Oh my.

749
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,900
Hi, Hyeon-suk.

750
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,400
You're Bu Hyeon-suk.

751
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,400
My goodness, you guys are…

752
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,200
You guys are still seeing each other.

753
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,100
What now?

754
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,800
What do you want to do?

755
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,200
What…

756
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,500
Why are you putting your hand there?

757
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,900
You're scaring me.
Hyeon-suk, what are you doing?

758
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,800
Mother, Father.

759
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,100
What?

760
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,300
What?

761
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,800
I don't wanna hear it.

762
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,300
You're Grandpa and Grandma now.

763
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,800
Oh my God.

764
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,200
You're Strikey's grandmother.

765
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,000
<i>New sprouts still lift their heads</i>

766
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,000
<i>even in the frozen soil</i>
<i>of the front lines.</i>

767
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,300
These punks…

768
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,600
<i>A winter, as early as their spring,</i>
<i>was on its way.</i>

769
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,800
You little punk,
you were sent to serve your country.

770
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,400
Ms. Yang!

771
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,200
Yang Geum-myeong!

772
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,500
Yang Geum-myeong!

773
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,200
Taiji, don't retire!

774
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,900
Taiji, please!

775
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,800
Taiji!

776
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,000
Geum-myeong!

777
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:40,800
<i>A glistening winter,</i>
<i>as dazzling as spring, was on its way.</i>

778
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,000
A GLISTENING WINTER

779
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:38,800
"JUST GET READY AND GO,
RIDE THE MOMENT WITH ALL YOU HAVE."
