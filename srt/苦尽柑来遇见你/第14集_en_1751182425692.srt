00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,982
《Meet You When the Bitter Orange Ends》

2
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,954
How could he think of putting all the blame on his friends?
Just run away like that?

3
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,211
When I first opened the pawn shop
He just wanted to take everything away and run away

4
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,464
You think I don't like him?
Is it because his grades are at the bottom?

5
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:33,718
When he came to our house when he was ten years old
I stole your dad's windshield washer fluid.

6
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,719
What is windshield washer fluid?

7
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,138
- Why did he steal that?
- God knows why

8
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,557
He just steals whatever he sees.

9
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,351
I came with empty pockets

10
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,561
But every time I say goodbye and leave

11
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,730
Pockets are always full!

12
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:50,026
What's the point of saying this?
The problem now is that piece of powder green sandware

13
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,986
That woman is a big liar.

14
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,615
She said that item was in the book "Appraising Treasures"
Estimated value: 70 million

15
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,075
7000…

16
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,452
70 million won?

17
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,247
Why did she give the powder-green sandware to the pawnshop?

18
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,873
Oh my god

19
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,752
Why did you do that? Why?

20
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,548
Why do you have to partner with Zhelong?
And why open a pawn shop?

21
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,300
Why blame the pawnshop?
Failure was due to financial crisis

22
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,262
They're handing out credit cards for cash advances

23
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,556
Then who else would come to the pawn shop?

24
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,226
There is more than just this kind of gold fundraising
Damn the gold raising campaign!

25
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,854
How can I...

26
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,189
Do we have to stop raising gold just for you?

27
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,486
You want to make a fortune and pretend
Now it's not your fault?

28
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,698
You should do what you can

29
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,701
Get a loan to open a pawn shop and try your luck to make a lot of money

30
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,578
I do this because I don't want to live like you

31
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,248
I hate the idea of doing things within your means.

32
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,334
You're always covered in plasters
But what have you done for me?

33
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,377
Liang Yinming!

34
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,964
What have you done for me? You're always so partial

35
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,551
Check your conscience, have you ever told me that I am the best?

36
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:01,431
To Jin Ming
You always say: "You do everything well"

37
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,268
Have you ever said this to me?
Why do I talk about money all the time?

38
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,479
How can I compare to Jin Ming?

39
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,356
I do this just to get your attention.

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,859
Can you please take a look at me?

41
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,285
Why can't I celebrate my birthday?

42
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,038
You gave it to Jinming, but what about me?

43
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,664
Yin Ming

44
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:27,999
sorry

45
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,378
I have a real headache now.

46
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,714
stand up

47
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,216
Make me rice cake!

48
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,884
I want rice cakes too!

49
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,761
Come here Yinming!

50
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,645
Your brother died three days after your birthday.

51
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,563
Accept life without birthdays

52
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,858
You are the eldest son, you should comfort your parents.

53
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,027
You have to live for yourself and your brother.

54
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,821
Otherwise your mother won't survive.

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,574
But that's not fair!

56
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,328
I don't want it!

57
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:09,165
I don't want it!

58
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,251
Yinming comes out

59
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,004
(Liang Jinming's schedule)

60
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,385
What are you drawing?

61
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,344
Look

62
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,345
(Liang Yinming's spelling test)

63
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,810
Mom and Dad got together because of Tong Ming's matter
There's a hole in my heart

64
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,395
How can people live like that?

65
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,192
They have to fill this place so they can survive.
So what should we do?

66
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,403
Don't ask me, just tell me.

67
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,115
You did a good job
You get a "good" stamp, right?

68
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:43,992
Look here

69
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,746
We have to stamp it countless times with a small seal

70
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,166
You have to stamp every day to fill this up.

71
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,504
They can continue to live

72
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,090
Do you understand?

73
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,635
You know everything, so what should I do?

74
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,429
“Know everything”?

75
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,725
(Leung Kuan-chih)

76
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,519
Look here to see my score

77
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,317
Wow, it's improved a lot

78
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,528
I got a question wrong on the Home Economics test

79
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,905
The teacher gave a strange question

80
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,576
One question? Just one wrong question in all subjects?

81
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,638
Am I a dog?

82
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,724
Was I born to eat leftovers?

83
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,478
Dad and your sister need to bring lunch boxes

84
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,773
I want more pork chops. Give me a re-fry.

85
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,692
Your sister is picky about food and she still wants to take exams

86
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,612
Dad works very hard.

87
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,660
What are you making a fuss about?

88
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,412
Have you entered puberty?

89
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,836
(18th National Wrestling Champion Jiang Hudong)

90
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,921
Oh my god

91
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,634
Kang Ho-dong's mother must have no regrets.

92
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,929
Who has a son who can bring back a little golden bull?

93
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,681
What else do you expect?

94
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,769
You just want a little Taurus?
With this, you don't need anything else?

95
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,606
Mom, follow me.

96
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,692
Just stay by my side
At worst you can get a little gold bull

97
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,277
I'll buy you a Mercedes Benz.

98
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:51,452
I will stop dad from going out to sea and stop you from setting up stalls

99
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,288
You have to hope that I am not Jin Ming!

100
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,917
How long do we have to wait?

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,630
If you can win me a little golden bull

102
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,176
I can go to Hallasan to dance and show off

103
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,721
Oh my god, you are such a boaster!

104
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,141
Where did you learn this?

105
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,605
Your sister never talks much about what she does.

106
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:35,246
Mom's unintentional words
Let Yinming grow up in hunger

107
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,374
It's really unfair to be partial.

108
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,210
It's better not to love at all

109
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,589
It's unfair to give less love

110
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,341
It will hinder the growth of children

111
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,761
My mother's worries have come true.

112
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,851
Aren't you afraid?

113
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,229
Of course I'm afraid

114
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,565
I still can't believe it

115
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,153
How is this going to get out of me?

116
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,448
but

117
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,409
What is more terrifying than giving birth to a child

118
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,245
What happens next

119
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,665
How to say it?

120
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,210
that

121
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,922
They say only those who have experienced it know best.

122
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,924
But I don't know

123
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,344
I didn't learn much experience

124
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,306
Are you worried that you don't know how to be a mother?

125
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,226
What should I do when they reach puberty?

126
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,354
What if they’re a bit of a jerk?

127
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,523
Are you that worried?

128
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,485
To be honest, I am most afraid of...

129
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,450
I don't know how to be a mother.
And hurt them

130
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,327
I'm most afraid of this

131
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,374
The little guy only trusts me when he comes to this world

132
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,502
I can't leave scars on my child's life.

133
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,674
You won't leave scars on your child's life.

134
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,762
You can't do that even if you want to.

135
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,558
To be honest…

136
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,979
I really want to be a good mother

137
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,356
A truly good mother!

138
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,778
Do you know why I named my son Zai Yi?

139
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,614
It means "first"
Because I've never been first.

140
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,534
Never

141
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,121
This is how you raised me.

142
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,341
Do you think your mother has ever been number one in her life?

143
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:57,471
How many pieces of the pork chops your mom has always dreamed of have you eaten?

144
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,098
You go

145
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,017
- You're stupid...
- You go out for a moment.

146
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,894
You stupid...idiot

147
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,354
Don't get me out of here.

148
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,150
Your stupid and conscienceless son will pay his debts himself.

149
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,320
Whatever you want! What a filial son!

150
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,949
dad

151
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,118
dad!

152
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,661
Get her out

153
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,456
Get her out of here!

154
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,249
Give me some money

155
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,376
Please give me some money!

156
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,003
Do I owe you money?

157
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,963
I know you have money for me.

158
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,174
Just consider it as giving me inheritance in advance!

159
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,508
Am I already dead?

160
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,678
So what should I do?

161
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,264
Do you want me to be the prisoner's wife?

162
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,767
Do you want Jae-yi to be the son of a prisoner?

163
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,812
Let them catch the real criminals.
If he is innocent why should we spend money on him?

164
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,943
Yinming really did nothing wrong!

165
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,572
He did this to make our lives better!

166
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,240
If he's innocent, he'll come out.

167
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,331
So money is more important than my daughter?

168
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,792
Of course it's a hundred times more important.

169
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,545
Have you ever fulfilled your duty as a daughter?

170
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,885
Did you make me captain or president?

171
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,055
Money can solve everything!

172
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,850
Do you think you will be treated preferentially if you throw a tantrum?

173
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,730
I don’t need a disobedient child!

174
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,821
Dad, do you know what I envy most about Jin Ming?

175
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,365
She has a father like that.

176
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,494
Even if I were to be reborn again, I would be
There won't be a father like her.

177
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,790
She's like a luxury car with a big engine

178
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,252
But your daughter isn't worth a carriage.

179
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,304
Me too!

180
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,058
Is 70 million really a lot?

181
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,271
"Only 70 million"?

182
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,233
Hey, have you ever earned even 100 won?

183
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,528
Respect and gratitude

184
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,656
and love for parents

185
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,077
Even 10 billion can't buy it

186
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,289
No amount of money can be removed

187
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,084
The nail you hammered into your child's heart

188
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,086
Do you think you're the only one thinking about this?

189
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,466
I've thought about it too, and I think further than you!

190
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,926
Your boat is more precious than your own child.

191
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,846
It has a price tag as soon as it’s built, right?

192
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,642
But a person's worth can only be determined after death.

193
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,522
From tonight you can't sleep all night

194
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,693
Worry about how much your life is worth

195
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,492
(Auntie's Seafood House)

196
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:07,953
(Zhelong Hair Salon)

197
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,705
Take my life.

198
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,418
Even if you beat me to death
I don't know where Zhelong went.

199
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,921
Even if you cut me open, you won't find a penny.

200
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,381
That piece of pink sandware is worth 70 million won!

201
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,427
Why should she let her son
Pay for your son's escape?

202
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,805
My son is also a victim in some ways.

203
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,932
Look at her mouth!

204
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,059
My good boy believed in a snake

205
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,103
As a result, I was bitten

206
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,398
Just look at Yinming's hairstyle.

207
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,776
Who has been doing his hair all these years?

208
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,278
He led my son astray.

209
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,989
It ruined my son's future.

210
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,243
Aichun, don’t you want to say anything?

211
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,787
We can't keep fighting for you!

212
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,251
Are you in cahoots with him?

213
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,755
If you know where my son is please tell me

214
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,759
Thanks to my good son, the store name had to be changed.

215
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,016
Did Zhelong sell the powder green sandware?

216
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,688
Bought you this TV and gold ring?

217
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,232
Is there any evidence?

218
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,568
Show me the evidence

219
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,570
Seeing you like this

220
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,947
I know why Zhelong is so bad!

221
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,199
Yinming went to prison

222
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,035
Is it because I have a mom who dropped out of high school?

223
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,163
He asked for this.

224
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,838
what the hell?

225
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,424
You brainless bitch!

226
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,717
Let go!

227
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,720
There are three of us! Damn it!

228
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,690
- Pay back the money!
- You let go first!

229
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,983
Pay me back!

230
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,653
Letting others take the blame will only get you so much in return!

231
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,532
Aichun, let her go first...

232
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,037
You will also go crazy if your son is arrested!

233
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,789
I don't care about anything now!

234
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,707
Understood?

235
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,794
She is indeed Guangli's daughter

236
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:35,017
This is the first time in my life that my mother has pulled someone's hair

237
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,191
You can't beat her now.

238
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,902
Isn’t this a cool move?

239
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:49,073
The way she pulled her hair and twisted her body
Like wrestling

240
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,909
People say that mothers become stronger and stronger

241
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,328
Being a father will make you weaker and weaker

242
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,456
- That Ironheart?
- right

243
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,462
Dad also did something for the first time in his life

244
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,643
Didn't I tell you
Should we invest in the construction of Seogwipo?

245
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,730
Your son always talks about making a fortune by luck.

246
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,359
Stay and play for a while

247
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,654
Damn financial crisis, really.

248
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,991
I have to do all the deliveries myself lately.

249
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,367
- Hey!
- boss

250
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:34,994
Can you

251
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,121
Lend me...

252
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,001
You've known me for a long time.

253
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,627
I never rest

254
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,296
I'll catch all the fish in the sea...

255
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,674
Captain Liang, you are not young anymore.

256
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:53,137
The weather is bad and your knee hurts.
Even the net can't be pulled open by one person

257
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,096

258
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,348
Everyone knows I'm a good fisherman and...

259
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,684
The world has changed

260
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,981
Others are fishing with trawlers bigger than houses

261
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:08,235
But you're still the same
Release all those small and endangered fish

262
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,613
You are the most strict in following the
People during the spawning and closed fishing seasons

263
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,117
Who on earth can make so much money?
Do you earn a lot, Captain Liang?

264
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:16,910
boss

265
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,621
I will pay you back

266
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,249
Whether it is fishing or working hard
I will pay you back

267
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,877
Oh my God, please be more careful!

268
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,421
It's really distressing.

269
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,173
Let's go! Get out of here!

270
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,926
Everyone in the port is avoiding you, Captain Liang

271
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:38,682
How could such an honest man become like this?

272
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,393
Parents carry the burden of their children

273
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,732
My son just turned 26.

274
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,862
He is like a deformed finger of mine

275
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,447
And I...

276
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,449
I…

277
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,495
I can't just give up and leave here.

(August 15 is Yinming’s birthday)

282
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:39,678
Dad went back to the sea just three days after sending Tongming away

283
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,888
(Typhoon Carmen on August 18)

284
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,768
In the end, Dad sold all 20 years of his life.

00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,731
Dad can never let go

Erase that moth. Why did you draw it here?

289
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,174
That's a butterfly

290
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,638
Write a poem for me too.

291
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,265
The title is "Liang Kuanzhi"

292
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,478
Why should I write?

The author is Dodong-ri Girls' High School
Wu Aichun from Class 5, Grade 1

295
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,418
Annoying when around
Not being around makes me anxious

296
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,836
Why read it so many times?

297
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,840
It's okay when I'm funny
Others make me angry

298
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:04,972
I opened my eyes and pretended not to see
I closed my eyes and the image came towards me

299
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,225
I can't notice
Just like the sea I see every day

300
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,478
But when you're not around
I feel like I'm the only one in the world

301
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,148
Like candy in your mouth

302
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,151
The sweetness is overflowing

303
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,237
is that so

304
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,990
is that so

305
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,617
Because of this

306
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,870
Will my heart be like spring every day?

307
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,293
Didn’t I tell you to go home and watch it?

308

00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,560

310
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,312
I just knew it

311
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,149
Who said that was you? Who said that?

312
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,113
Hello!

313
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,158
You thought we kissed once
Can we just keep kissing each other?

314
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,076
- Oh my god
- Can't I?

315
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,997
Can't I kiss?

316
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,794
No questions allowed!

317
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,630
You're not allowed to ask anymore.

318

“Every day is spring”

319
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,955
There is no spring day at all

320
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,043
There is no spring day at all

321
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,969
The boy's hands now emit
Rustling of tree branches in winter

322
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,721
- Yes, that's our ship.
- Our ship

323
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,098
Dad's boat

324
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,015
Dad's boat

325
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,851
- Hello
- Are you in there?

326
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,437
Staring like that will damage the boat.

327
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,941
My wife keeps saying she wants to see our boat again.

328
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,692
You said you wanted to see it too.

329
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,860
No, I didn't.

330
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,990
dad!

331
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,618
- dad!
- dad!

332
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,870
Hi

333
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,623
- dad!
- dad!

334
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,250
- Did you catch a lot of fish?
- dad!

335
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,503
- Dad! Come on!
- dad!

336
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,049
Have you thought of a name for the ship?

337
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,010
You will like it more after naming it

338
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,637
that

339
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,431
Yin Ying

340
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,100
You must be Yinying.

341
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,519
It's really great.

342
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,063
My Jinming and Yinming...

343
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,484
Tong Ming also grew up relying on this ship.

344
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,403
So it will grow with her.

345
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,487
Thanks

346
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,451
Oh my god

347
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,040
Wow this is a complete record of the boat!

348
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,922
These are from the last three years if you need...

349
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,176
These are all outdated.
I don't know if it's still useful.

350
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,594
(fishing record)

351
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,762
Can I really keep these?

352
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,973
I won't be a captain anymore.

353
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,768
Okay, thank you very much. Thank you.

354
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,814
- Eunyoung says "Thank you"
- Thank you, Grandpa.

355
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,358
Yeah, thank you too.

356
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,818
Thank you

357
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,488
Only we don't know

358
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,910
We never knew
Dad's time at sea was fleeting

359
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,412
(Seogwipo Police Station)

360
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,040
As long as it comes out

361
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,709
Let me ask you how you got the money.

362
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,795
- You sold the house?
- Let's go

363
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,838
Did you sell the boat?

364
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,593
The boat was sold, right?

365
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,388
Damn

366
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,648
No crying

367
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,942
If you cry, your dad will cry too

368
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,694
Your dad will cry countless times in his heart

369
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,530
Why are you selling your boat?

370
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,491
Why would you do this for me? Damn it!

371
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,246
We sell boats because you come first!
How could you not be?

372
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:43,333
Children may abandon their sick parents
But parents don't abandon their sick children.

373
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,961
I hate this really.

374
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,756
I really hate this!

375
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,467
How could we not rescue you?

376
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,469
How could we leave you there?

377
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,555
It's like a hole with countless small holes

378
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,140
But the bucket is always full of water

379
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,602
This is what Yinming has always had.

380
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,814
You can blame me but don't do that to your dad

381
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,025
Did you know that your dad eats five meals a day?

382
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,904
He works so hard.
So I've been eating five meals a day my whole life.

383
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,241
If it weren't for you, he wouldn't live like that.

384
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,161
You can blame me but how can you blame him?

385
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,079
Don't do this

386
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,414
If you are like this

387
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,041
Your father's efforts were in vain.

388
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,043
So what does he do now?

389
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,006
If he doesn't catch fish, what do you sell?

390
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,259
You just need to take care of yourself, okay?

391
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,803
No matter what you do

392
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,097
I can do it all

393
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,017
The literary girl has changed

394
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,900
Don't go, auntie, come here

395
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,944
I'll cut the squid for you.

396
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,530
Look how fresh this squid is.

397
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,534
I'll cut it beautifully for you.

398
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,330
20 pieces for 2,000 won and 40 pieces for 3,000 won!

399
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,874
Just bring the stuff.

400
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,917
I'll cut it for you!

401
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:12,088
The one who once said that a cabbage costs 50 won
The girl who bought three cabbages for 150 won

402
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,006
Now it has changed

403
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,133
Hello! Are you the only one doing business here?

404
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,552
If the price continues to drop like this, it will kill everyone!

405
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,473
Mom, did you buy the squid? I'll cut it for you.

406
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,099
I cut it beautifully.

407
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,102
What are you doing there, disturbing the mother of the child?

408
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,103
I am here

409
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,439
Are you stealing business?

410
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,524
You stole it from me, not me from you!

411
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,653
Mother, who are you here for?

412
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,156
My mother-in-law asked me to find a beautiful aunt

413
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,241
Who else could it be?

414
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,412
Who else could it be?

415
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,582
Hey! It could be me too!

416
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:53,380
The literary girl has evolved
Just like Squirtle evolving into Blastoise

417
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,464
Come soon

418
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,382
Oh my god!

419
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,552
Okay, let's slice it.

420
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,063
Wow, you're really fast.

421
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,858
When I was your age
I can't do that at all.

422
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,860
You lie

423
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,071
How could a fisherman’s wife not know how to cut squid?

424
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,074
My husband used to do it for me.

425
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,535
He doesn't want me to get hurt or scared.

426
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,370
Wu Aichun started showing off the first

427
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:30,375
My husband keeps begging me not to do this.

428
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,752
I just do it for fun.
Why waste time?

429
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,047
My husband is the captain, you know.

430
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,383
Is he still the captain?

431
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,469
You tell me what he is doing now?

432
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,221
What is he doing now?

433
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,558
Wait a moment

434
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,768
It's my daughter. She goes to Seoul National University.

435
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,686
(daughter of Seoul National University)

436
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,355
She always calls me at mealtime.

437
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,525
Hi daughter!

438
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,445
You want to make sure I eat every day, right?

439
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,322
This is the second show of Aichun

440
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,950
Frequent calls from children

441
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,910
It gives people a sense of superiority

442
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,956
Oh my god I don't need a medical exam!

443
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,667
No, don't bother.

444
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,839
I love you too take care

445
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:22,510
Hey I bet she didn't say she loves you
You said that yourself, right?

446
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,725
The less you have, the more you will show off.

447
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,937
Hey, your captain is here.

448
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,063
He's here

449
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,693
I think this is my mother's way of protecting herself.

450
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,905
No one else got the call anyway.

451
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:47,577
Only my children call me often.
Ask me if I have eaten or what I have eaten

452
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,996
They are just jealous

453
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,999
If the candle flame gets weak, you need to change it quickly.

454
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,001
Otherwise it will be cold

455
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,300
They don't understand the law.
I thought the detention center was a prison.

456
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:06,221
Damn Mi-sook knew it
Why do you keep asking?

457
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,348
"Why don't you talk about your son?"

458
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,974
"What is he doing lately?"

459
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,101
What a stupid question. It's really cheap.

460
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,981
No matter how miserable my life is

461
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,901
Nor would I be so despicable as to hook up with a married man

462
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,444
Is your life miserable?

463
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,781
Of course not

464
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,741
I'm just saying

465
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,786
I did not mean that

466
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,830
People here are jealous of me.

467
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,042
Do you want me to buy you a better face cream?
The expensive kind?

468
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,627
Why?

469
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,505
Looks like she's wearing blush, isn't it cute?

470
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,842
They call me pretty auntie

471
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,306
Oh my god

472
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,560
Why is life like this...

473
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,186
Why is this so?

474
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,153
What's wrong?

475
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,406
Are you old?

476
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,243
Why do I cry more and more?

477
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,831
How can I let you sit here like this?

478
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,207
Oh my god

479
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,627
I didn't fulfill any of your three wishes.

480
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,505
I delayed your life.

481
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,596
So what if you know what "nostalgia" is?

482
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,848
Can I go to college?

483
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,225
Can I be a poet?

484
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,685
Can I go to the Peninsula?

485
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,021
I can't give you all

486
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,650
But there's one thing I can do for you anyway

487
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,611
Come on

488
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:48,990
Can't you just say you can give me everything?

489
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,702
Tell me you'll give me the moon and the stars!

490
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,172
You should have refused me when I pursued you

491
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,050
You shouldn't be with me

492
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:13,389
Without you, I would really become
There is no orphan in this world.

493
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,142
No Leung Kuan Chi

494
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,312
How could Wu Aichun live as a coquettish girl?

495
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,148
Do you want me to teach that damn Meishu a lesson?

496
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,035
Why do you only look older?
But not in your heart?

497
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,622
How come your heart doesn't change? It's so annoying

498
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,130
(Charmzone Oil Control Cream)

499
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,882
You are so lucky Xianshu

500
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,719
My father-in-law never bought me any face cream.

501
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,433
I noticed that you don't dress up much anymore.

502
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,061
I don't even have a nice hairstyle.

503
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,938
You should get a haircut.

504
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,773
Perming is expensive

505
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,320
Read this to me

506
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,530
- Which one?
- This book

507
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,572
OK

508
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,249
Are you the only ones eating at home?

509
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,417
alright

510
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,877
You know his dad likes egg rolls too

511
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,797
Why hide two-thirds?

512
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,798
Oh my god

513
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,469
Ask Yinming to come back and eat with us

514
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,763
Don't make us set the table twice

515
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,934
How much damn alcohol did he drink?
Sleeping until noon?

516
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,479
Mom, I'm hurt.

517
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,109
I don't eat anymore

518
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,372
This daughter-in-law looks like our daughter.

519
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,385
Why don't you sleep?

520
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,433
You guys eat it.

521
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,645
Why did you sit down?

522
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,438
Would you like another drink?

523
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,441
You knew I loved drinking.

524
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,362
I was looking for a hammer.

525
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,032
I found some good stuff hidden by my daughter-in-law.

526
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,245
Who would buy a case of beer for their daughter-in-law?

527
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,958
Eating your mother's cooking for 20 years

528
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,836
It's not easy living with strangers, right?

529
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,715
Honestly, I don't think living with my in-laws is that difficult.

530
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,634
Um?

531
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,512
So that's it

532
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,556
actually…

533
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,187
I'm under a lot of pressure because of Yinming

534
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:54,026
What happened to him? Is that brat causing trouble again?

535
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,115
Dad, you don't know your son
What are you doing recently?

536
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,919
Stop going to the table tennis club.

537
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,754
Who do you think you are?

538
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,176
Everyone says that Fu Shangji is
The only one playing mixed doubles

539
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:22,221
Mixed doubles also features Xuan Jing and Liu Nankui!

540
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,806
Are you lonely?

541
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,602
Loneliness is damn annoying

542
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,646
I am the head of the family!

543
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:35,067
Come on, you don't have to pretend to be the head of the family all the time

544
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,110
Everyone is avoiding me

545
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,451
You can touch his

546
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,168
Is this what it feels like to have a first grandson?

547
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:56,005
Looks exactly like his dad.

548
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,215
Like his mother

549
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,802
Like his mother

550
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,512
OK

551
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,723
If you want to see your grandson, tell me.

552
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,225
I'll arrange it for you quietly.

553
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,270
What do you want from me, sir?

554
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,147
"gentlemen"?

555
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,943
You don't call me "Hello" anymore

556
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,445
What else can a father with a daughter do?

557
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,572
I understand how you feel

558
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,076
Do you also think your son-in-law is a thief?

559
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,287
Does wearing a charity badge make you great?

560
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,206
Let's show some sincerity at home.

561
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,583
This way you won't play table tennis during the New Year.

562
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,554
The citrus orchard is for you.

563
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,142
Just consider it as a reward for taking care of me.

564
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,189
When your father-in-law was alive...

565
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,444
He has never been to see the camellia in winter

566
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,490
Rapeseed flowers bloom on the west side of Jeju Island

567
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,367
He went to the east to have fun.

568
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,954
Wait until the camellia flowers bloom in the east

569
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,831
He went to the west to have fun.

570
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,042
This is Huaxin

571
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,463
He knows that others don't appreciate his behavior.

572
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:24,468
He was still doing those funny things until he died.

573
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,804
But I don't know how to survive

574
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,515
So I can only hold it in

575
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:34,312
I endured it and finally broke down my body

576
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,230
Mother-in-law

577
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,441
Why did you do that?

578
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,651
what do I do?

579
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,070
The citrus orchard is for you.

580
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,614
Whatever you do with it

581
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,208
Are you going out to try your luck again?

582
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,169
Seriously, you little bastard.

583
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:08,262
Dongzhen's brother is discharged from the army
So the guys had a party

584
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,348
I will go home early

585
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,395
You know I'll have diarrhea if I don't drink milk

586
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,948
We should have stopped him from the beginning.

587
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,244
If he causes trouble again
We'll have nothing to sell!

588
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,164
Children will cause trouble

589
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,667
But sometimes imperfection is better

590
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,965
Come through here

591
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,009
Well dressed, good job

592
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,809
that

593
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,895
Hong Nam's brother Hong Shik opened a shop

594
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,316
Now I am worried about Hongnan's brother
When Hong Shik?

595
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,485
How late will you stay?

596
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:07,947
I don't want

597
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,325
The chestnuts are hot.

598
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,244
Hey I don't like chestnuts at all

599
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,079
You always give me things you like

600
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,378
Don't stay outside for too long today when it's below zero

601
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,281
The excuse he used every night when he went out...

602
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,116
Glutinous Rice Cake

603
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,033
(glutinous rice cake with acorn jelly)

604
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,871
Acorn Jelly

605
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:02,001
...and now from his own children
Can't ignore it

606
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,086
Glutinous rice cake!

607
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,883
Acorn jelly!

608
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,515
Glutinous rice cake!

609
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,186
Acorn jelly!

610
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,439
There's no one selling glutinous rice cakes around here now, right?

611
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,567
Because it's Yinming who's selling it.

612
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,488
Even if he wants to find a job because he has been in prison

613
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,156
No one will hire him.

614
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,367
They all rejected him and said he was a loser who stole money.

615
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:39,747
He went out for six or seven hours in the cold weather.

616
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,458
I hate this

617
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,919
I really hate this.

618
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,717
Dad, can you support three more people now?

619
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:56,013
We kill one and eat very little.

620
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,101
A few days ago, a drunk kicked over a rice cake box.

621
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,562
Someone asked him to climb to the fifth floor.

622
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,191
I just bought a box of acorn jelly and asked him to take out the trash.

623
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,986
He has to do this. He has to find something to do.

624
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,405
Because he is the head of the family

625
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,825
Even though he told her...

626
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,370
Just tell him he did a good job.

627
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,955
Just tell him

628
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:27,753
...A wall in my father's heart quietly broke into pieces

629
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,047
How can I say he did a good job?

630
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,511
Yinming can't stand this kind of work

631
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,304
You know it too!

632
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,268
Damn it!

633
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:47,273
Suicides hit record high in past year

634
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,067
More and more heads of households

635
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,152
Suicide due to unemployment or financial difficulties

636
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,988
dad

637
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,741
Dad, can you go find Yinming?

638
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,285
(The unfilial son went to get some fresh air
Sorry, Hyun-sook, take good care of Jae-il)

639
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,619
I won't live if I can't find him!

640
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,329
I won’t live anymore!

641
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,539
Where are you going again?

642
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,665
He is on the boat

643
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,042
He's on the boat! Mi-sook saw him!

644
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,502
That ocean-going fishing vessel?

645
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,392
Don't go out to sea!

646
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,228
Don't let him go out to sea!

647
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,316
Will you bring Yinming back?

648
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,902
You will bring him back?

649
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:23,619
Do you know how much the fuel for this ship costs?
Why do you want me to turn around?

650
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,579
Please turn around just this once!

651
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,040
I'll pay for the gas!

652
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,502
Time is money, right? Stop talking nonsense

653
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,755
Shit, I’m almost dead!

654
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,632
I am Fu Shangji from Dodong-ri

655
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,592
I don't care who you are

656
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,010
A bad start

657
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:40,928
I double

658
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,974
I said double!

659
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,059
Damn it!

660
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,186
I told you to double it, why don’t you turn around?

661
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,491
Do you want to keep your son in a greenhouse?

662
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,368
He just vomits.

663
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,870
Thanks

664
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,330
Is this a passenger ship?

665
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,207
What? Did you come back for free?

666
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,459
Acting so generous!

667
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,671
Why do we have to let a little boy on board?
Why so much trouble?

668
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,755
Price reduction!

669
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,382
What price reduction?

670
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,259
- It's agreed.
- Why…

671
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,762
Do you know how hard that is?
It's easy to die.

672
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,640
Some people drowned, some were strangled by the net
The hand was broken by the rope

673
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,892
Everyone is avoiding this job!

674
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,520
Do you know how difficult this is!

675
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,898
Why would you do something that could put your life at risk?

676
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,527
If it's that difficult

677
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,946
How did you do it?

678
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,247
Let's go

679
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,959
- Your mother couldn't bear to let you go to sea
- But you did it!

680
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,962
No matter how hard it was, you did it!

681
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,466
Who said you can make money by going overseas?

682
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,884
You want to make a big profit?

683
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,721
I want to get your boat back.

684
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,100
I don't need to get the boat back.

685
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,103
Don't get on the boat. Find something else to do.

686
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,148
If you do other things
Are you going to buy them all again?

687
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:25,324
You know when I was selling rice cakes
What did people tell me?

688
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,328
Two more

689
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,625
Keep the change, please

690
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,419
- What?
- Listen to the kids

691
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,837
Be nice to your dad.

692
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,172
Be nice to him

693
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,056
I'm really not hungry

694
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,935
I really don't like this kind of food.

695
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,562
Be nice to your dad.

696
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,237
You want four more boxes at this late hour?

697
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,905
I don't know if anyone asked me to buy it.

698
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,240
Your mother?

699
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,908
Oh I was told to tell you...

700
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,284
Be nice to my dad?

701
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,791
Are they buying Christmas stamps?

702
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,544
Is my rice cake some charity?

703
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:20,879
Damn it!

704
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,426
How much? Damn.

705
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:32,057
Everyone who buys rice cakes wants me to be nice to you!

706
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,726
You're in cahoots with my father-in-law!

707
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,520
He gave everyone 5,000 won

708
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,565
You give money to your neighbors and the people in the ping pong club

709
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,442
Everyone is using my money to buy my rice cakes

710
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,278
What a shame

711
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,824
It's really embarrassing.

712
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,117
Seriously

713
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,620
I'm so ashamed and sorry.

714

This way he can get rid of his sleepiness and get out of bed.

You know all kinds of people in town.

Who would complain about eating rice cakes for free?

723
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:26,695
After all, he's not just my son, right?

724

I'm actually involved with people I hate.
I can't believe it, damn.

I don't want to know

727

Since you brought the little floral lunch box
From the day I boarded my ship

729

Live so happily

You also know that I dated her.

735

Okay, let's not go too far.

736

You have to help an adult.
How long will it take to clean up the mess?

00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:45,941
Adult?

751
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,860
I haven't raised you yet.

752
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,114
Maybe there aren't any adults.

I don't know if I should say this.

776

But I hired you because your dad is a top horse.

In horse racing, the best horses are worth millions

778
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,685
And their offspring are more expensive
