00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,789
Hello. Hi.

3
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,334
Wow, you look beautiful.

4
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,919
Could you help me? Oh my.

5
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,128
Well done.

6
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,797
-Help me with this.
-Okay.

7
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,431
<i>Here we go.</i>

8
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,474
{\an8}YALASHANG FILM CLUB

9
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,476
One, two, three.

10
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,231
I'll take one more.

11
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,108
Smile.

12
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,610
One, two, three!

13
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,657
What does it mean if I can't go?

14
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,160
Tonight… is our last night.

15
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,789
Our last night before you join the army!

16
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,585
Do I really have to…

17
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,045
What's wrong with you?

18
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,157
Hey, who knows what will happen?

19
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,618
They say you don't know
until you walk down the aisle.

20
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,831
Just wait and see.
I'll see you in a wedding dress.

21
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,791
Ta-da!

22
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,042
It's so beautiful.

23
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,218
I should cover this up.

24
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,806
I kept my promise.

25
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,434
Oh? Hey, over here.

26
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,351
Hey!

27
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,939
<i>Not knowing who might come back</i>
<i>or come anew,</i>

28
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,024
<i>my heart pounded</i>…

29
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,986
Oh my!

30
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,948
I didn't pop it on purpose.

31
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,536
<i>…and my feet felt like they were floating.</i>

32
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,835
SUCH AN UNEVEN LOVE

33
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,218
<i>A new person has also</i>
<i>come into my mom's world.</i>

34
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,430
<i>A squishy thing that claims to be human.</i>

35
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,517
HAPPY FIRST BIRTHDAY
FROM YEOM BYEONG-CHEOL, NA MIN-OK

36
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,537
<i>Evoking unexpectedly deep affection</i>

37
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,498
<i>despite being two generations apart,</i>

38
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,085
<i>an endearing monster has come the world.</i>

39
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,546
Don't babysit your grandkid,
no matter how adorable.

40
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,883
They're even more adorable
when you only see them occasionally.

41
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,512
Once Geum-myeong gets married,
throw off the burden of parenting.

42
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,305
Live carefree and soar free.

43
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,019
Everyone says the kid has my eyes,
but the trap is from his mother's--

44
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,479
The jaw area.

45
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,778
What about your family?
Aren't they coming?

46
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,489
Well, you know…

47
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,616
I wouldn't take an unemployed son-in-law.

48
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,329
Well, what about your brothers?

49
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,915
They just said

50
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,626
they better not see our asses again.

51
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,796
-Faces.
-Sorry?

52
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,507
Faces.

53
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,054
-Feces?
-Faces!

54
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,057
Faces.

55
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
That's 19 grams.

56
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,568
Goodness, they mentioned "19 grams"
on the phone a dozen times.

57
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,486
They told me to go to college with it.

58
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:25,283
Goodness, that stingy old man.
Hasn't he heard of inflation?

59
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,828
He should pay the market rate for college.
They have money, don't they?

60
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,206
He got this for us by selling rice cakes?

61
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,249
Yes.

62
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,126
This grandpa drives a Mercedes, right?

63
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,087
Of course he does.
Everyone eats rice cakes.

64
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,634
Not a cool job though.

65
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,511
"Cool"?

66
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,974
Let's go.

67
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,063
YANG CHE-IL'S FIRST BIRTHDAY

68
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,607
Should you be spending on that now?

69
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,278
I'm going to do everything for him.

70
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,655
You always just got by on my birthday.

71
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,075
-At the time, it was all we--
-I'm sure.

72
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,451
It was only tough on mine.

73
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,538
How will you support your family now?
Planning to live with us forever?

74
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,957
-I'm working on a business plan.
-Business?

75
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,459
With Cheol-yong?

76
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,294
I told you not to run a pawnshop.

77
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,129
Life is all about the lucky strike--

78
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,632
I should just strike you, damn it.

79
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,760
Others mature when they have a family.
Why are you chasing empty--

80
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,011
I don't need your help.

81
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,138
Am I expecting much from you?

82
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,391
Just get up early, for starters!

83
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,434
Go to the loading docks or something.

84
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,561
-And look for a job!
-Seriously.

85
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,564
You want me to live like you?

86
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,358
Is that what you want?

87
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,276
Father.

88
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,488
You have to open the faucet fully
to fill the bucket up.

89
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,450
You get nowhere in life
trying to mend every leaking hole.

90
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,368
You know it too.

91
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,579
Don't just count on Geum-myeong.
Watch what I can do too!

92
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,750
I won't be the dad who orders pork belly
for three when my family eats out.

93
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,920
I'll be the dad
who orders five or six servings.

94
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,944
Why are you like that to your father?

95
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,365
Your heart softens as you age.
Even Steelheart gets scars.

96
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,704
Then Geum-myeong's mom
can comfort Geum-myeong's father.

97
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,621
Good grief.

98
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,916
How do you keep getting more spiky?

99
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,003
Frankly, you should be thankful
I've grown this much.

100
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,713
Kids grow as much as you believe.

101
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,466
Geum-myeong grew so much
because you believed in her fully.

102
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,968
You only ever doubt me,
so I've only grown this much.

103
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,595
You're unbelievable!

104
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,806
Carry the baby already!
My arms are hurting.

105
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,516
Goodness.

106
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,521
Here, give me Che-il. You two go inside.
Hurry, hand him over to me.

107
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,692
My sweet baby. Come here.

108
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,235
My goodness.

109
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,672
I really had no idea
my daughter would do this.

110
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,425
I felt betrayed.

111
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,552
I felt like my entire world fell apart.

112
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,262
I can't tell you

113
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,141
how sorry I am, and…

114
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,602
Goodness, if you get married pregnant,

115
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,314
you can't even get a brass ring,
let alone a gold one.

116
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,484
I never even got to have a wedding.

117
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,029
She won't ever get to wear a veil either.

118
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:55,660
Eun-myeong may still be struggling
to find his way,

119
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,537
but as a person--

120
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,665
I have nothing against Eun-myeong.

121
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,084
Why is that?

122
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,379
They say sons take after their fathers.

123
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,300
I've always envied your life
more than anyone else's.

124
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,471
You're the wife of a rich family.

125
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,307
On the kids' sports days,

126
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,562
I dragged three kids along on my own
under the scorching sun.

127
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:27,483
Then I saw your husband
fanning your back so you could cool off.

128
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,780
You've always had a knack
for noticing things.

129
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,949
It made me cry.

130
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,745
I wondered how you were so blessed
to be treated so well

131
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,084
and what sins I had committed
to step on such a pile of poop.

132
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,130
So,

133
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,882
is Hyeon-suk doing okay?

134
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,177
She doesn't know how to do anything.

135
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,972
Scold her if she doesn't know anything.

136
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,933
Scold her until she cries her eyes out.

137
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,810
I won't scold her.

138
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,812
I won't make her cry her eyes out.

139
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,524
I won't be giving Hyeon-suk a brass ring.

140
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,234
Okay?

141
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,615
If you want to see
your first grandson or Hyeon-suk,

142
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,952
feel free to visit them whenever you want.

143
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,329
Or call me to come out.

144
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,791
We share our children,
so we're in this together, right?

145
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,048
Goodness, how can he look
exactly like my daughter?

146
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,427
Dear me.

147
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,057
It seems like you can't win
against your daughter either.

148
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,270
<i>The title of a poem my mom once wrote</i>…

149
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,024
<i>was "My Damn Child."</i>

150
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,651
What's the big deal?

151
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,027
For crying out loud!

152
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,780
You little punk!

153
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,909
Is she off to save the country
or her company?

154
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,079
Good grief. Just give it to me.

155
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,581
Why buy Chivas
for a child's first birthday?

156
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,792
Cheol-yong must be out of his mind.

157
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,960
Because you and Dad look down on me,

158
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,672
she treats her only nephew's
first birthday like this, huh?

159
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:18,052
Your sister's having a rough time too.
Her company is also in deep trouble.

160
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,139
She acts all high and mighty
because she works at a big company.

161
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,601
But who takes care of you and Father?
Who'll care for you when you're sick?

162
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,396
As if you could take care of anyone!

163
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,108
Take care of yourself first. Yourself.

164
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,404
Don't be so harsh.
Even a crooked tree shades the weary.

165
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,324
<i>The shock is even greater</i>
<i>as the rumors turn out to be true.</i>

166
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,411
<i>This is likely to have</i>
<i>a deep, significant impact on our economy.</i>

167
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,162
<i>Kwon Jae-hong reports.</i>

168
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,666
<i>This afternoon, Korea First Bank,</i>
<i>Kia's main banking partner,</i>

169
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,920
<i>announced at a press conference</i>
<i>that 18 of Kia Group's 28 subsidiaries…</i>

170
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,172
<i>It was a season of reaping what was sown,</i>

171
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,632
<i>whether it was a gold toad…</i>

172
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,886
<i>or a postdated check.</i>

173
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,145
-Stop layoffs right now!
-Stop layoffs!

174
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:55,107
-We won't just leave like this!
-We won't!

175
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,819
{\an8}-Stop layoffs right now!
-Stop layoffs!

176
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,531
{\an8}-We won't just leave like this!
-We won't!

177
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,117
<i>The Asian financial crisis</i>

183

<i>Of the four subsidiaries subject</i>

184

<i>Taeil, after financial struggles,</i>

190
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,985
<i>was designated today</i>
<i>for bankruptcy protection.</i>

191

194
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,705
First of all, thank you
for giving me the opportunity

195
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,208
to be here in difficult times…

196
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,336
First,

197
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:03,592
thank you for the opportunity
to interview during this difficult time.

198
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,135
I am willing to do…

199
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,180
<i>After barely holding on</i>
<i>through severe financial struggles,</i>

200
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,683
<i>Haitai Group finally filed</i>
<i>for bankruptcy today.</i>

201
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,729
This toothpaste was exported
across Northeast Asia

202
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,817
and was often unavailable
due to high demand,

203
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,404
but due to the manufacturer's bankruptcy…

204
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,323
This toothpaste alone fights

205
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,700
common cavities

206
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,869

<i>and whitens stained teeth.</i>

208
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:37,918
This product is the result
of a technical collaboration

209
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,631
with an American toothpaste company
recognized by the WHO. And so…

210
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,135
<i>Newcore Group, the 25th largest company,</i>
<i>filed for composition</i>

211
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,220
<i>and was declared bankrupt today.</i>

212
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,305
<i>Dear viewers,</i>

213
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:54,310
<i>the government has decided</i>
<i>to request a bailout from the IMF.</i>

214
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,646
<i>Despite its reputation</i>
<i>for economic success,</i>

215
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,149
<i>Korea has been forced</i>
<i>to admit national bankruptcy</i>

216
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:05,070
<i>and seek recovery with assistance</i>
<i>from international organizations.</i>

217
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,073
<i>The government aims</i>
<i>to minimize the IMF policy intervention,</i>

218
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,367
<i>even if Korea receives its bailout funds.</i>

219
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:15,706
<i>The next stop is Sillim Market,</i>
<i>formerly known as Cannes Theater.</i>

220
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:22,087
<i>The next stop is Sillim Market,</i>
<i>formerly known as Cannes Theater.</i>

221
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,234

ON DECEMBER 1

222
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,070
<i>When one door closes…</i>

223
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,699

TICKET, JA 17

225
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,138
Hey, can't you just sit anywhere?

226
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,688
JA 17

227
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,110
This isn't a leg rest. It's an armrest.

228
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,778
It's an armrest.

229
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,784
<i>You need countless lifetimes of fate</i>
<i>to meet even once in this life,</i>

230
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,787
<i>so the third time should be the charm.</i>

231
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,669
Hey, did you see her?

232
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,838
Did you meet her?

233
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,882
-Sorry?
-You didn't see her?

234
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,801
Who told you to clean up?

235
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,555
I lined her up for you,
and you still missed the goal.

236
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,768
<i>If even the third time fails</i>…

237
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,730
<i>you must wait for the next life.</i>

238
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,814
Geum-myeong!

239
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,496
<i>Last time, it was Seo Taiji.</i>

240
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,499
<i>This time, it was H.O.T.</i>

241
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,833
Geum-myeong!

242
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,446
Geum-myeong!

243
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,520
<i>Only then did he realize.</i>

244
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,650
<i>You only get three chances.</i>

245
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,486
<i>If no one scores in extra time,</i>

246
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,489
<i>it will go to a penalty shootout.</i>

247
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,804
Stop!

248
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,099
Sir!

249
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,059
<i>When one door closes,</i>

250
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,021
<i>another is bound to creak open.</i>

251
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,814
Could've caught the next one.

252
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,274
Goodness.

253
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,859
Thank you.

254
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,130
<i>If the IMF crisis hadn't happened…</i>

255
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,011
<i>If I hadn't lost my job…</i>

256
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,936
<i>If the theater hadn't gone</i>
<i>out of business…</i>

257
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:39,154
<i>If any of those gears had failed</i>
<i>to do their part…</i>

258
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,705
Everyone off. This is the last stop.

259
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,876
<i>…perhaps this moment</i>
<i>would never have happened.</i>

260
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,093
Is this a dream?

261
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,096
Is it?

262
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,974
Yes.

263
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,151
I chased you from the theater.

264
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,487
I ran like mad.

265
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,825
I couldn't let you slip away,
even if it meant losing my breath.

266
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,037
Were you

267
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,415
alone at the theater?

268
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,709
-Yes.
-I see.

269
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,299
-Were you also--
-Yes.

270
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,306
Finally.

271
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,850
This is when we use

272
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,644
the word "finally," right?

273
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,471
Why do you keep laughing?

274
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,642
You look totally different now.

275
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,604
I guess you're not Picasso anymore.

276
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,688
I am.

277
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,108
I'm the Picasso
at a place called Picasso Art Academy.

278
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,906
Our academy would be ruined without me.
They pay me well.

279
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,408
It's just so great.

280
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:49,993
Really.

281
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,372
Me too.

282
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,999
It's just so great.

283
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,174
How did we both end up
at the theater today?

284
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,176
I actually went every day.

285
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,303
Just in case.

286
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,890
I really missed you.

287
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,896
I missed you a lot.

288
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,113
So we can now…

289
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,073
"Now"?

290
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,991
Or shouldn't we?

291
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,412
<i>A lager, please.</i>

292
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,455
Still, we shouldn't?

293
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,543
Oh, we can order alcohol now.

294
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,586
Let's order beer.

295
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,673
Just beer?

296
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,758
JINRO SOJU

297
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,889
Wait.

298
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,352
Why do you keep staring?

299
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,938
It's driving me crazy.

300
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,356
I know, right?

301
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,275
It's also

302
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,193
driving me crazy.

303
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,237
-Oh my.
-Oh no.

304
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,531
I usually don't get drunk easily.

305
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,533
You'll hurt yourself.

306
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,035
Just lift your foot a little. Yes.

307
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,372
You sound just like my dad.

308
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,458
What was that sound you just made?

309
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:20,959
Are you bleeding?

310
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,712
I think it's a cut.

311
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,840
I think we need to apply pressure.

312
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,551
It's not bleeding though.

313
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,389
Preemptive steps.

314
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:45,984
How can this be?

315
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,697
I feel like I'm about to drop dead…

316
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,704
"Drop dead"?

317
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,096
When I used to carry those books for you,

318
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,807
I kept thinking,

319
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,603
"I want to hold her hand."

320
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,106
<i>But we were…</i>

321
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,691
See?

322
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,194
This is why I said,

323
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,489
"Everyone has a dark side, after all."

324
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,658
<i>…no longer innocent.</i>

325
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,452
I think I've gone to the darker side.

326
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,630
<i>We dated like grown-ups…</i>

327
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,719
<i>more like La-Z-Boy than IKEA.</i>

328
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,830
Are you out of your mind?

329
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,500
What's with your face? And your hands?

330
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,547
Come on. Stop making that face.

331
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,718
Come on. Are you drawing me
like they did in <i>Titanic</i>?

332
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,556
Come on. How can I draw you
like they did in <i>Titanic?</i>

333
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,017
The model is different,
and so is the situation.

334
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,685
"The situation"?

335
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,772
Well, what should the situation be?

336
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,065
Wow.

337
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,692
<i>-</i>Come on, Park Toto.
-"Park Toto"?

338
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,777
Then what should the situation be?

339
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,197
Toto keeps going to the dark side, huh?

340
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,288
God, seriously.

341
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,791
Come on. How could you spit on my face?

342
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,586
Stop calling me Park Toto!

343
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:14,215
Why do you like Park Toto so much?
I thought you never laughed at anything.

344
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,259
<i>Toto and I shared the same sense of humor.</i>

345
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,429
You're rubbing off on me.
I'm starting to talk like you too.

346
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,641
<i>In a grown-up world</i>
<i>where we learned to fake smiles,</i>

347
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,517
<i>it was an incredible booster.</i>

348
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,312
Don't make me laugh while we're kissing.

349
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,688
I can't focus.

350
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,609
Babe, it's harder
to laugh together every day

351
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,612
than it is to kiss every day.

352
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,489
That's why we're a good match.

353
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,574
-Don't add garlic for now.
-Okay.

354
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,829
Do you really like raw fish?

355
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,039
You always eat it.

356
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,707
Yeah, I do.

357
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,713
Hey, do you want to eat

358
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,549
some real amberjack?

359
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,260
-Real amberjack?
-Yeah.

360
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,262
Real amberjack.

361
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,184
<i>And finally…</i>

362
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,401
<i>Finally, the two men met.</i>

363
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,280
Darn it.

364
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:24,160
Amberjack, my foot.
Where did this damn saury come from?

365
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,628
Hey, Dad.

366
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:39,008
Why are you looking at him like that?
You'll make my man uncomfortable.

367
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,054
<i>The day came when I sided</i>
<i>with my man over my old man.</i>

368
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,350
This is how I look at people.

369
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,104
Try to look at him with some kindness.

370
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,815
Being on a boat isn't easy
for someone from the land.

371
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,692
Was it easy for you from the get-go?

372
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,068
-Yeah.
-Yeah, right.

373
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,490
Are you letting them go
because they're still too small?

374
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,242
You're such a kind fisherman.

375
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,994
Your father

376
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:07,996
is so kind.

377
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,750
They're bait.
We're throwing them to their deaths.

378
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,378
Not so kind now, huh?

379
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:20,550
Come on, stop glaring at him
and catch me an amberjack.

380
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,762
I brought him here
to eat some real amberjack.

381
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,321
Why do you keep following her?

382
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,072
Why? She's just going to the toilet.

383
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,535
Just sit and eat some amberjack.
And pay for what you eat.

Why do you ignore them?

396
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,093
Maybe she doesn't like him.

397
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,930
You don't? What do you think of him?

398
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,683
Me?

399
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,108
Get your head off my shoulder!

400
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,486
So why are you here?
Why did you come to Jeju?

401
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,573
Are you playing 20 Questions or what?

402
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,825
I told you not to be like that.

403
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,579
You can't talk, ride boats,
or even drink, huh?

404
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,624
Why should I give my daughter to you?
Would you, if you were me?

405
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,294
I'm angry for absolutely no reason.

406
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,088
But even now, you're not even trying.

407
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,675
Even if I wanted to impress you,

408
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,803
if you don't like me…

409
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,557
no matter what I do--

410
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,435
He won't like you in any case,
so you won't even try to suck up?

411
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,811
Who do you think you are?

412
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,855
You little brat. You're so damn rude.

413
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,315
Let go.

414
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,150
Ten, nine, eight--

415
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,319
Seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one. What?

416
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,653
I said let go.

417
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,627
What do you think of him?

418
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,629
Well,

419
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,672
you know…

420
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,675
You have something to say?

421
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,969
If you do, just say it. Come on.

422
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,971
Here's the thing.

423
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,599
His family…

424
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,811
You know, his family…

425
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,109
I mean,

426
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,197
I'm doing whatever I can to impress you.

427
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,448
What did you do?

428
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,242
I haven't noticed a thing this whole time.

429
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,038
I normally don't eat much, but…

430
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,084
Sorry for preparing too much food.

431
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,086
Watch it.

432
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,339
I'm this close to actually beating you up.

433
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,092
Don't glare at me.

434
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:03,648
Why are you getting up again?
Why keep following her to the toilet?

435
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,066
What are you trying to do?

436
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,026
What are you going to do in the dark?

437
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,319
You'll be dead meat.

438
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,155
It's dark, so I have to--

439
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,783
Attention!

440
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,952
It's dark, so I'll…

441
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,913
It's cold, so…

442
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,714
Why the hell is that punk so stiff?

443
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,091
What if Yang likes him
more than he likes her?

444
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,470
No, what if my sister
is making a fuss over nothing--

445
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,597
Did you just call
your brother-in-law "punk"?

446
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,599
"Brother-in-law"? So you approve of him?

447
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,185
You selfish kid.
Don't eat all the shrimp by yourself.

448
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,645
Peel a few for him!

449
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,106
Wait, why? What is it about him?

450
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,649
Seriously, why?

451
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,276
My God.

452
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,579
Why do you keep following her?
Why? She's just going to the toilet.

453
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,750
Just sit and eat some amberjack.
And pay for what you eat.

454
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,919
Good grief, why do you keep…

455
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,839
In case she falls.

456
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,592
In case Geum-myeong falls.

457
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,095
You think I'd let my daughter fall
into the water?

458
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,390
You should worry about yourself.
Hey, attention.

459
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,601
Attention!

460
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,980
Still, I should protect her, so…

461
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,400
I'm worried, so…

462
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,414
I don't stand a chance.

463
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,626
How am I supposed to impress him?

464
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,358
You know what, babe?

465
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,903
You were a bit stiff in there.

466
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,030
Well,

467
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,075
I want to impress him,

468
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,996
but this is just how I am, and--

469
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,333
So that's just how you are.

470
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,419
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

471
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,714
It's hard to do things I never do, so--

472
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,718
So you think I'm the kind of person
who normally sucks up to others

473
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,430
and changes my voice around your mother
just because that's who I am?

474
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,727
Let me be clear. I'm…

475
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,062
-Are you listening?
-Yes.

476
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,815
I am my dad's daughter.

477
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,110
If my dad says no, that's a no for me too.

478
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,780
-No wedding bells.
-Babe.

479
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,866
Babe.

480
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,372
<i>Wait, why do you approve of him?</i>

481
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,710
Then why didn't you approve of my wife
from the get-go?

482
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,921
I won't stand anyone
treating my Hyeon-suk differently.

483
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,840
Go away. Just go.

484
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:19,510
Hey, does your Hyeon-suk know
you pooped your pants in kindergarten?

485
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,388
Does your Chung-seop know
you used my razor?

486
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,225
-Let go of me.
-Father!

487
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,108
Oh my.

488
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,736
Father.

489
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,696
Father!

490
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,783
Is it okay for me

491
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,785
to peel some shrimp for you?

492
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,913
Peel them for yourself.

493
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,582
He gets weird when he's drunk.

494
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,757
Look at him.

495
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,509
He absolutely adores Geum-myeong.

496
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:05,806
But you know,
his mom really wants Geum-myeong too.

497
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,935
She says she's really fond of Geum-myeong.

498
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,478
Isn't it funny?

499
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,064
Yep, it's so funny. It sure is.

500
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,690
You cried, didn't you?

501
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,192
Why would I?

502
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,195
Who in the world
wouldn't love our Geum-myeong?

503
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:20,947
You cried.

504
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,699
This is really wild honey
from Hallasan, right?

505
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,911
You're going to give this to his mom,
aren't you?

506
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,579
Well, you know,

507
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:33,542
Chung-seop's mom gave me a gift first.

508
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,879
She practically bribed me.

509
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,382
Not everyone would do that.

510
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,552
You know what I got yesterday?

511
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,931
What is this, some kind of treasure?

512
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:47,974
What could it be

513
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,768
that she'd pack so tightly?

514
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,520
Why are we letting him sleep here?

515
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,522
We should just get him a room at an inn.

516
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,817
How can we tell him to sleep at an inn?

517
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,736
I feel bad enough
that he has to sleep in the living room.

518
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,990
How can I sleep
under the same roof as Park Chung-seop?

519
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,574
Why can't you sleep?

520
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,159
I just can't.

521
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,539
Seriously, stop going out to check him.

522
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,458
He's not going to sneak
into Geum-myeong's room.

523
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,044
How can he
when you're glaring at him like that?

524
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,546
Don't!

525
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,588
Let me go. Hey.

526
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,551
Just sit down! Goodness!

527
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,579
Father, why do you keep coming out here
instead of going to sleep?

528
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,497
What about you? Why aren't you sleeping?

529
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,000
Why not? What is it?

530
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,585
What are you going to do?

531
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,422
What? What's wrong? Is there a problem?

532
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,563
<i>I went home in the fall,</i>
<i>picked the best persimmons.</i>

533
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:22,276
<i>I put in effort all season long,</i>
<i>thinking of giving them to you.</i>

534
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:28,157
<i>I made these, looking at them every day,</i>
<i>just like gazing at lovely Geum-myeong.</i>

535
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:32,536
<i>That's how fond I am of Geum-myeong.</i>

536
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,788
FROM CHUNG-SEOP'S MOM

537
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,414
<i>Perhaps Mom</i>

538
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:39,710
<i>had been waiting for a long time</i>
<i>to hear those words.</i>

539
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,881
Gonna stand watch all night?

540
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,510
And just what will you do
if he goes into Geum-myeong's room?

541
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,930
He'll be dead meat.

542
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,559
What can you do?

543
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,604
Has Geum-myeong's dad
ever once won against her?

544
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,735
Let her go now.

545
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,822
Your uneven love.

546
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,244
<i>Mom knew…</i>

547
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,292

<i>Single Bungle Show!</i>
<i>I'm your host, Kang Seok.</i>

00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,900
<i>Well, let's listen to an uplifting song.</i>

557
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,617
<i>Just like that, I leapt from the nest.</i>

558
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,672
<i>Like a bluebird soaring</i>

Don't smile too much today.

562
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:15,973
It'll annoy your father.

563
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,768
Mom, don't do that today.

564
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,604
Don't cry like this, okay?

565
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:24,899
Come on.

566
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,276
Are you done with me once I'm married?

567
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,486
You won't be my mom?

568
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,279
Listen to me.

569
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,657
I'll still be Yang Geum-myeong,
not Park Geum-myeong.

570
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,994
What are the last digits of my pager?
Not his home number, right?

571
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,913
It’s still our family's 3312, right?

572
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,832
Then which family would I belong to?

573
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,044
I know. I'm not giving my daughter away.

574
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,546
So don't cry.

575
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,507
If you cry, I'll cry.

576
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,634
All the wedding photos will be ruined.

577
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,223
Let's keep it nice and cool.

578
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,058
Okay?

579
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:47,273
Oh dear! How did you make it here?

580
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,400
How could I miss
your family's celebration?

581
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,068
The girl who's getting married…

582
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,278
Can you straighten this?

583
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,697
…is the one who loved caramel, isn't she?

584
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,284
Yes, it's Geum-myeong.
You always gave her free caramel.

585
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,912
Yes, go ahead, please.

586
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,001
Wow, you look pretty today.

587
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,381
-Hey, where's Ju-gyeong?
-Ju-gyeong?

588
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,509
-How can the photographer be late?
-There she is.

589
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,303
-Hey!
-Hey!

590
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,567
I shouldn't have come.

591
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,028
-Ju-gyeong!
-Hey!

592
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,654
-Hey!
-Hurry!

593
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,072
Come on, hurry.

594
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,824
Hey, hurry.

595
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,412
What was that?

596
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,041
She looks so damn beautiful.

597
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,044
Hey, the photographer can't be late.

598
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,379
You should've started snapping
when I got out of the car.

599
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,049
Are you happy? You're one confident bride.

600
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,929
-Come on.
-Start taking pictures of me from here.

601
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:01,847
Okay.

602
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,559
So pretty.

603
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,727
Let's go over there.

604
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,728
Go to the steps.

605
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,771
Those steps.

606
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,566
<i>Does everyone marry</i>
<i>their most passionate love?</i>

607
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,529
<i>The size of the love wasn't different.</i>
<i>Its temperature was.</i>

608
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,199
You sent us so many tangerines.

609
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,618
You never have to buy
another tangerine again.

610
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,287
<i>It was the temperature</i>
<i>that let me be myself.</i>

611
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,123
Did you say hello?

612
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,294
<i>I've found my prince.</i>

613
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,857
What a match made in heaven.

614
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,110
Did you teach him to be cringy,
or is it him?

615
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,653
He's my top student.

616
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,239
How lovely.

617
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,371
Next, the groom will enter.

618
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,376
The groom is making a confident entrance.

619
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,003
Please welcome him
with a round of applause.

620
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,893
Did I not say I hate it
when brides cry at their weddings?

621
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,979
Don't you dare cry, Dad.

622
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,022
If you cry, I'll really get annoyed.

623
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,941
Never mind. You know what?

624
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,402
Just try not to look me in the eye, okay?

625
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,449
Geum-myeong.

626
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,994
You can do well, right?

627
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:51,081
If things go wrong, back down.
Just run straight to me, okay?

628
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,082
Okay?

629
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,592
Can you really eat this?

630
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,344
If you don't like it, back down.

631
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,221
Just spit it out, okay?

632
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,686
Goodness.

633
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,147
YANG GEUM-MYEONG

634
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,691
Do these fit?

635
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,701
Say, "Hello, teacher."

636
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,828
Hello, teacher.

637
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,164
Goodness me.

638
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,418
I'm telling you,
we can't send her to school yet.

639
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,462
Let's just send her next year.

640
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,840
You want to keep her at home forever?

641
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,092
How will you ever marry her off?

642
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,178
You're being so silly. Isn't he silly?

643
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,722
Geum-myeong,
you think you can go to school?

644
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,309
I can. Jeong-geun went too.

645
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,186
What does it matter if he went?

646
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,563
I don't like you being close
with Jeong-geun.

647
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,023
I want to go to school.

648
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,905
Then go for now,
and if you don't like it, back down.

649
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,450
Just run straight home, okay?
I'll be at home.

650
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,868
-All right?
-Okay.

651
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,168
{\an8}Geum-myeong,
you can run well tomorrow, right?

652
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,128
I think I might come in first.

653
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,213
First place?

654
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,382
-Ready… That's not it.
-Go!

655
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,633
Run at "Go," okay?

656
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,804
But you don't have to come first.
Back down if you want.

657
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:33,392
If you fall, just run straight to me.
I'll be right behind you tomorrow. Okay?

658
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,393
Okay.

659
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,019
-Ready--
-Go!

660
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,897

We're here way too early again.

667
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,374
Seriously.

668
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,918
Why is our family so diligent?

669
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:03,380
What kind of lives have you led
to be like this?

670
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,464
Geum-myeong.

671
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,092
-You can guess well, right?
-Come on.

672
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:11,763
Why would I guess the answers?
Dad, I'm Yang Geum-myeong.

673
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,807
You're right.

674
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,602
I know from years of seeing you
that you do everything well.

675
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,812
You're good at everything.
Dad knows that now.

676
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:23,734
So you'll just say I do everything well?
You won't tell me to back down?

677
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:28,280
Still, if your head hurts
and you just can't do it, just back down.

678
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,074
Just run straight out.
I'll be right here. Okay?

679
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,036
You're always my backup, huh?

680
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:39,333

684
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:54,598
<i>my dad stood there holding the net.</i>

<i>"I'll be there even if you fall."</i>

686
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,563
<i>I wish I had told him</i>

687
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,983
<i>how comforting his words were</i>

<i>While he was standing there,</i>

690
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,576
<i>it seemed the snow fell only on my dad.</i>

691
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,832
The bride will now enter
and walk down the aisle.

00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,086
What?

00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,504
Dad's still right here.

695
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:29,800
Just do everything you want.

<i>Feeding on their verdant youth,</i>

00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,977
<i>I became a tree.</i>

700
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,736
If Chung-seop annoys you, come back to me.
Dad's always here for you. Okay?

701
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:55,450
No. Don't say things like that right now.

702
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,328
You're so annoying, Dad.

703
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,124
Please welcome the bride.

704
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,423
Please give her a warm round of applause.

705
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,491
Gwang-rye must be beaming from ear to ear.

706
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,786
She must be so happy at last.

707
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,960
When Ae-sun walked down the aisle
holding her uncle's hand,

708
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,296
I thought I'd just die from heartache.

709
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:53,550
<i>The daughter's respectable life</i>
<i>felt like a medal to her mother,</i>

710
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,761
<i>so she kept smiling.</i>

711
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,016
In case the bride didn't come
because she was crying,

712
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,060
the groom rushed out to greet her.

713
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,605
Please give them
another big round of applause.

714
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,698
We said we'd keep it cool.
Why are you bawling?

715
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,210
Aren't we getting married?
Should we call it off?

716
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,130
No, I'm going to do it.

717
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,676
Let's go.

718
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,034
<i>It was only the day before my dad left me</i>

719
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,162
<i>that I rushed to pour out apologies,</i>

720
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,874
<i>"Dad, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."</i>

721
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,419
<i>Dad told me back then</i>

722
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,131
<i>that he had been living in heaven</i>

723
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,093
<i>since the day I was born.</i>

724
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:30,939
I told you

725
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,567
your father would cry more than your mom.

726
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,571
My dad's crying?

727
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,880
I didn't think
your dad would be like that.

728
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,967
Why do men want to act tough
around their sons-in-law?

729
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,927
Why drink more than he can handle?

730
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,763
Dad wants to see
if he gets weird when he's drunk.

731
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,099
Who's the weird one now?

732
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,853
-Hey, Dad.
-Come on!

733
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,110
What about your mom?

734
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,029
Sorry?

735
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,906
Does she like Geum-myeong or not?

736
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:26,661
My mother has always been harping on
about wanting a daughter,

737
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,789
so she likes Geum-myeong more than me.

738
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:30,832
No.

739
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,878
-I'm sorry?
-She's my daughter, not your family's.

740
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,505
She's my daughter forever.

741
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,634
Right. Of course.

742
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,261
-Park Chung-seop!
-Yes, Father.

743
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,640
Do you have any idea
what you're taking from me?

744
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,600
Sorry?

745
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,186
I am giving you…

746
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,149
my heaven.

747
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,695
To you, who did absolutely nothing for her

748
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,698
throughout her 30 years of life.

749
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,618
Well,

750
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,205
I heard that Mother was the literary one.

751
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,795
Hey, Yang Heaven.

752
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,588
Carry your own honey.

753
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,845
<i>Dad had his uneven love stolen away</i>
<i>just like that.</i>

754
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:30,767
We now ask the bride and groom
to face the bride's parents.

755
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:42,195
Bride and groom,
please bow to the bride's parents.

756
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:58,169
Oh dear, the bride's father is crying.
My goodness!

757
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,379
Be quiet.

758
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,549
The bride's father
must've truly loved his daughter.

759
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,468
Gwan-sik is being robbed
of his most precious treasure.

760
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,429
He's being robbed of it!

761
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:10,515
He wouldn't cry like that
even if his mother got remarried.

762
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,813
I wish you well. Go on.

763
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,651
Next, the bride and groom
will bow to the groom's mother.

764
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,696
Enough is enough, okay?

765
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,451
You're so embarrassing, seriously.

766
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:33,538
Bride and groom,
please bow to the groom's mother.

767
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:48,720
Who is it?

768
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,889
Who's looking for you?

769
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,932
Who is this?

770
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,768
I don't know either.

771
00:55:56,394 --> 00:56:00,315
Didn't I tell you to dye your gray hair
before going?

772
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,735
Geum-myeong nagged me about it again.

773
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:09,783
Obviously, I'd take better care
of my own husband than she would, right?

774
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,453
She's got her husband to look after now.

775
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,628
<i>Life never allows us</i>
<i>to truly savor these moments.</i>

776
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:24,964
Yang Eun-myeong.

777
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,389
Me?

778
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:37,018
<i>Happiness comes right at you.</i>
<i>Misfortune always creeps up from behind.</i>

779
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,853
Where is Park Cheol-yong?

780
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:40,522
You know, right?

781
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,483
Me?

782
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,739
<i>When Mom says</i>
<i>not to hang out with a certain friend,</i>

783
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,951
<i>there's always a good reason.</i>

784
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:43,329
"IF YOU CAN'T, JUST BACK DOWN.
WE'RE ALWAYS HERE FOR YOU."

785
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,672
