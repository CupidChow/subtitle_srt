00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,486
(July 1973)

3
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,238
Six out of ten ships in Dodong-ri belong to my husband's family.

4
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,950
Eight out of ten people are related to their family.

5
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,619
Who would hire Kuanzhi?

6
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,580
That kid has no skills.

7
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,500
But his brother is the president of the fishery cooperative

8
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,126
It's even more amazing

9
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,881
The people on the island are not very friendly to outsiders. You are really unlucky.

10
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,717
This is…

11
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,054
What's going on?

12
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,767
They sent you away again? They said the economy was bad.

13
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,895
If the economy is bad, will we stop eating fish?

14
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,105
go home!

15
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,773
Hello

16
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,694
I heard they are building a road near Hallasan Mountain

17
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,947
Ask him to find a job over there.

18
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,533
Money is the same whether it comes from the sea or from work

19
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,496
Ama now collecting the finest conch!

20
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,666
Today's conch is a top-quality sea squirt.

21
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,295
I heard that he is the first one to arrive every morning.

22
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,256
Queuing up early to go to work

23
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,426
Kuanzhi is always the first worker to arrive

24
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,262
so annoying

25
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,390
Why is he so hardworking?

26
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,308
How's his work going?

27
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,352
Can he accept working on land?

28
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,064
He doesn't say much

29
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,899
Of course he won't like it.

30
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,027
Crew members always yearn for the sea

31
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,827
Honey

32
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,580
Oh my god, what's going on?

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,790
How did you do that with your hands?

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,544
I think craftsmanship still requires skills.

35
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,423
Did they ask you not to go?

36
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:55,925
Oh my god

37
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,890
Why did he have to repair the roof?

38
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,819
Please take a break.

39
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,989
A person is withering

40
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:26,039
A hard-working cow is withering away because it has no work to do.

41
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,961
Oh my god, he's finished it.

42
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,756
I thought it would take three days.

43
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,887
Mom said she picked up rotten vegetables from the field

44
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,682
They all look more energetic than the back of dad's head

45
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,647
(Dodongli Grocery Store)

46
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,881
Go to sleep. I've already cooked the meal.

47
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,012
Don't worry, take your time.

48
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,517
Are you a cow?

49
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,979
You've been selling fish since you were nine years old.

50
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,814
It's okay to take a break

51
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,567
Just like school holidays

52
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,320
I never took a break

53
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,782
It feels so strange

54
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,368
It's really strange

55
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,580
Okay, relax.

56
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,874
You should rest.

57
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,753
What if I go to relax my family of four?

58
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,803
If I work one day, we can survive one more day.

59
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,223
But doing this for a day...

60
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,852
It's really unfair.

61
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,859
What kind of starvation are you worried about?

62
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,946
If I need to, I will make money.

63
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:31,331
Are you relying on a literary girl like you who can't even say "cabbage is so sweet"?

64
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,684
Facing the cold rice jar

65
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,230
Mom remembered grandma's smiling face

66
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,320
She remembered her mother

67
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,449
Will smile to sell one more conch

68
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,286
I just want to ask...

69
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:11,788
I mean...

70
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,248
Can you give me some rice...

71
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,876
I don't understand what you are saying

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,213
Stop being hypocritical

73
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,548
There are many people who are worse off than you.

74
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,017
Just like I will always remember her young face

75
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,728
Trying hard to smile

76
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,526
Your father will be slaughtered wherever he goes.

77
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,903
Save 1,000 won per box

78
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,199
I can't believe you can bargain. You are worthy of being an aunt.

79
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,577
Are you happy?

80
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,329
So funny

81
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:58,251
When I was young, I couldn’t even say “cabbage is so sweet”

82
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,168
You? Really?

83
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,213
I am a shy literary girl

84
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,509
I think it's embarrassing to sell cabbage in school uniform

85
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,427
(Youth Central)

86
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,013
Just bury your face in the book

87
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,849
So how did you become like this?

88
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:19,272
Over time, I discovered that there are things that hurt my self-esteem even more.

89
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,900
For example, living in a one-bedroom apartment

90
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,653
You have to put up with the family's grumbling

91
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,239
I was hungry all night.

92
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,702
That's really embarrassing.

93
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,083
Everything was so strange to me then.

94
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,463
I don't know why I feel so humble and pitiful

95
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,301
There were many times when I felt like I couldn't hold on any longer.

96
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,636
Why don't you say something?

97
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,763
What's the point of not speaking?

98
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,392
Why are you putting on airs when you come to borrow money?

99
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,353
Why are you here without saying anything?

100
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,773
What's wrong?

101
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,275
Anything bothering you?

102
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:05,902
Love Pure

103
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,946
You are worshipping their ancestors now, not ours.

104
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,491
You should go to their house for help.

105
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,951
What is the Yang family's daughter-in-law doing here?

106
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,829
I thought you would be as eloquent as your mother.

107
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,165
But you're as dumb as your dad.

108
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,833
Is there really no other way?

109
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,504
What else can I do? Is there any land left to sell?

110
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:31,427
You must be desperate to come to us, but we are also in debt!

111
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,230
Damn it, Aichun, why can't you live a better life?

112
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,316
If you want, give her the ring.

113
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,955
There's no rice in the rice jar to feed the child, and you still don't ask?

114
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,003
What a kid.

115
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,557
Honey

116
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,892
Um?

117
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,937
I really want to

118
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,816
Get old quickly

119
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,237
Why?

120
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,697
Just want

121
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,243
I thought everyone would become an adult.

122
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,414
Can serve hot meals with both hands like my mother

123
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:47,169
I thought they would eat peacefully like Keiko

124
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,464
Even if the creditor comes to the door, I am not afraid

125
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,804
I thought that as people grow up...

126
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,310
Your hands and heart will naturally develop calluses

127
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,232
But it's still too hot for me

128
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,445
I get burned every day

129
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,739
And it hurts every time

130
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,242
Am I the only fool in the world?

131
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,744
Others

132
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,455
Will you be able to live well when you grow up?

133
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,167
They are just

134
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:31,881
Pretending to be an adult because others say they are an adult

135
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,930
I just want to get older quickly

136
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,268
Maybe this is because

137
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,815
My first time as a mother, wife, and adult

138
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,069
I don’t know why…

139
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,657
Everything is so difficult that it's hard to breathe

Go to sleep, go to sleep, rock yourself to sleep sweetly

Go to sleep, go to sleep, rock yourself to sleep sweetly

00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,474
Go to sleep...

Are you unable to sleep because you didn't give me the ring?

150
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,337
Don't reach that low.

151
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,881
My husband is still here

152
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,385
Don't take it out.

153
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,680
I won't be able to sleep if you give me your savings

154
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,391
What to buy when buying a boat?

155
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,352
Buy a boat and don't tell anyone

156
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,272
If anyone asks, just say you won the lottery

157
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,074
Did you steal this? This is my money.

(Passbook)

159
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,703
This is the money I made from selling soup and rice before the war

160
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,791
Have you kept it till now?

161
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,127
Zhong Jiu is a bottomless pit. He has already lost all his money.

162
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,756
So you hid it for me?

163
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,010
Your mother threatened me, saying this is the only way to make things even

164
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,553
What?

165
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,391
Please God, let her live.

166
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,478
How could she be allowed to leave her child behind and go away?

167

00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,570
Mother

169
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,371
Can you come with me?

170
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,249
I don't dare go alone

(Forever Youth Photo Studio)

172
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,968
Didn't I buy this for you when you got married?

173
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,181
This is my best dress

174
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,480
I think it's because the livelihood of the Ama women is always on the brink of life and death.

175
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,442
That’s why we have so many taboos.

176
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,611
They said they took a photo

177
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,364
It will be used at funerals soon.

178
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,452
I've been carrying a coffin all my life.

179
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,497
Maybe it's because of the fear of death

180
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,708
So I never took a photo.

181
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,792
Look at me

182
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,515
This photo will help kids remember you

183
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,643
Pink suits you

00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,857
One for your funeral.

185
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,401
One at my funeral.

186
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,447
You stay here for a while.

187
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,574
Come back to me

188
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,040
I outlive my children.

189
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,043
It's been too long.

190
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,463
Even though I lost my baby

191
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,467
I still eat three meals a day to this day.

192
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,349
I promise

193
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,559
I'll find your baby boy.

194
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,440
I will be with him in that world

195
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,401
Don't look for someone else as your husband

196
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,781
If you saw Han Kyu before me...

197
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,159
Tell him I'm sorry

198
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,956
Tell him mommy is sorry

199
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,167
Please tell him

200
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,169
please…

201
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,347
I will definitely bring the message to you

202
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,308
So you stay here

203
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,019
Taking care of Han Kyu's child

204
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,772
Take good care of Aichun

205
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,775
Just like taking care of Han Kyu

206
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,989
I see

207
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,159
Why did you ask me to come here to say this?

208
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,870
How else can you rest in peace?

209
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,583
She is only ten years old

210
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,169
Became an orphan

211
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,923
She really needs to find someone to rely on in this world.

212
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,346
It's all my bad luck.

213
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,265
It's all my fault

214
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,476
She has shame

215
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,146
I won't bother you all the time

216
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,898
If one day

217
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,694
That dumb girl came to ask grandma for help...

218
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,115
Her life must be extremely miserable...

219
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,327
Please help her

220
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,584
She can get through it no matter how hard it is.

221
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,045
Say nothing

222
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,883
But if she said...

223
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,012
"Grandma, I'm in a hard time and need help"

224
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,680
If she said that

225
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,184
Please help her as you would your own son.

226
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,271
Just once, no more, no less

227
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,066
Please help her once.

228
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,861
That way we're both clear.

229
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,906
You don't have to apologize to Aichun's father.

230
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,241
Guangli

231
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,368
Aichun is my granddaughter

232
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,580
Why are you still worrying about her when you are leaving?

233
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,875
I don't want to leave yet

234
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,461
I don't want to yet

235
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,130
Honey

236
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,010
You can go with peace of mind

237
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,387
Don't worry

238
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,790
I'm going to shoot

239
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,376
one two three

240
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,310
grandmother

241
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,774
Will I miss my mom less when I become a grandmother?

242
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,236
Of course not.

243
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,575
The pain of losing a parent grows with each passing year.

244
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:25,080
But the pain of losing a child will be engraved in the deepest part of your heart

245
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,458
When your parents die, you send them to heaven.

246
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,460
But the child is gone

247
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,797
You will always keep them alive in your heart

248
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,469
You can't let them go so you can only let them live in your heart

249
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,309
Hurry up and take it

250
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,520
I give you like I give you my son

251
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,114
I won't let you down

252
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,659
I will definitely live a good life

253
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,292
We won't let you down

254
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,087
This is what I want

255
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:30,729
Episode title: "A Midsummer Night's Full Return"

256
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,943
Our dear Captain Liang

257
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,865
I hope every day is this good!

258
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:48,789
Captain Liang is awesome. I'm so happy.

259
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,461
that's all

260
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,881
What a nice day! Today is such a great day!

261
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,824
Dragon King

262
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,160
May the boat not seek fish

263
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,329
Fish Follow the Boat

264
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,332
May you always return with a full load!

265
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,168
May you always return with a full load!

266
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,297
Please!

267
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,262
Bless us

268
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,932
Anything that floats is a boat.

269
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,351
Have a bowl of Captain Liang's rice wine!

270
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,644
Will the boat really float?

271
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,273
Why is she so excited?

272
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,654
Captain Liang!

273
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,072
Captain Liang!

274
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,116
Captain Liang!

275
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,160
Captain Liang!

276
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:14,333
The fortune teller said he was born with his hands full of food

277
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,337
Now he wants to let the Liang family ship sail into the sea of Jeju Island!

278
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:26,928
Captain Liang

279
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,848
Captain Liang!

280
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,227
What are you looking at?

281
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,355
Isn't this obvious?

282
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,982
Have you found Jong-gu? Are you in touch with him?

283
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,108
Don't I know you yet?

284
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,527
Go tell him

285
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:46,656
I, Jin Chunyu, want to report my grandson for robbery.

286
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,659
After all, Zhong Jiu is still the eldest grandson.

287
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,580
He wants to preside over the family sacrifice to revive the family business

288
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,623
Love Pure

289
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,126
My eldest son's daughter.

290
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,586
Captain Liang

291
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,172
Awesome! Great job!

292
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,550
The fourth generation of the Liang family's only heir, I am the son of Quan Guiyu

293
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,888
We are going to let the Liang family ships sail into the sea of Jeju Island!

294
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,478
This is actually the Wu family's boat, not the Liang family's.

295
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,441
My grandma bought me this boat.

296
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,947
The food in Kuanzhi's hand must be me!

297
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,536
Well, you are so lucky.

298
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,080
She is the most blessed person!

299
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,332
So what are you?

300
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,459
You should worship her!

301
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,839
She didn't bring the silver spoon you liked so much

302
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:48,051
But now you have a ship!

303
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,636
That’s amazing!

304
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,681
What a filial daughter-in-law!

305
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,725
The most blessed person!

306
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,605
Who bought her the boat? Who?

307
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,401
Do you love her that much?

308
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,572
dad

309
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,489
I think

310
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,576
She is the most interesting person in the world.

311
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,039
Wu Aichun!

312
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,585
At that time they stood there like tall green trees

313
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,840
It was an unforgettable early summer

314
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,929
Mom, you peed.

315
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:34,931
No way

316
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,893
It's too early.

317
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:42,230
Honey!

318
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,817
Honey!

319
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:53,950
Be careful!

320
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,348
What made you laugh so loudly just now?

321
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,558
This is what happens when you laugh too happily!

322
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,812
What did you do when you were my age? What was your life like?

323
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,189
I have no idea

324
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,275
I seem to be pregnant

325
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,917
Is this what Kuan Zhi did? Wow, he really knows how to do it.

326
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,461
He is now very good at making pancakes

327
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,635
Do you like silver spoons?

328
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,722
I'll be happy if I have several of them.

329
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,770
He made various pancakes for his ancestors

330
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,148
He is such a filial grandson. No one is more filial than him.

331
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,903
Are you really not going to attend the sacrificial ceremony?

332
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,323
I can't persuade him, right? You can't persuade him?

333
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:20,870
I would like to go but what can I do? I have to listen to my husband.

334
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:25,458
He stared at me and warned me not to go near your house

335
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,002
He's so scary.

336
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:32,757
Your daughter-in-law is better than my daughter-in-law

337
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,968
If I were a rabbit and you were a snake

338
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,304
That Aichun is the little tiger

339
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,555
Come on!

340
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,640
You're not a rabbit.

341
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,642
Not all people born in the Year of the Rabbit are the same.

342
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,520
Why isn't there a year of the raccoon, the mole, or the boar?

343
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,316
What? Then tell me a few more?

344
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,447
dad!

345
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,657
Oh my god

346
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,493
Hey how are you today?

347
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,661
Give this to mom

348
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,666
What's wrong? What's this for?

349
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,793
Is that how you greet people?

350
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,839
Are you really still a man?

351
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,133
You'll feel uncomfortable when you lie down to sleep, right?

352
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,720
Let me see

353
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,556
Tell Aichun...

354
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,769
Have you upset Aichun again?

355
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,313
What about Guiyu?

356
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,649
Who cares if I'm unhappy?

357
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,900
Your mother likes me

358
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,362
I gave birth to a son and made you the captain.

359
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,905
And gave her several silver spoons

360
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,450
I gave her everything she wanted.

361
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,702
Even if she wanted to hate me, she couldn't.

362
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,081
Isn't it strange that she would hate me?

363
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:52,045
Your daughter-in-law is indeed better than my daughter-in-law

364
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,923
My son is better than your son.

365
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,392
Why give them all three octopuses?

366
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,353
What about our children?

367
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,608
Are you leaving?

368
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,694
Are you going home?

369
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,697
Yes, we're leaving.

370
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,325
We're moving, okay?

371
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,411
Let's go then

372
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,329
I just want to say…

373
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,373
Go! Go on your way!

374
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,126
I really...

375
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,419
Stop talking

376
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,671
Some things don't need to be said

377
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,049
thank you

378
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,342
Crybaby Mom!

379
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,469
Pack your bags!

380
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,847
Thank you for everything

381
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,308
Go wake up the kids

382
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,894
We can't eat so much by ourselves.

383
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,355
We have to eat some pork to celebrate

384
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,482
Why do we pack our bags?

385
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,486
They say the hard times will pass

386
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,240
But it's been too long for you. First you lived in your husband's house and then you came here.

387
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,117
Isn't it?

388
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,620
Now go live in your own home.

389
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,986
You said you came here alone since you were six years old

390
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,992
You'll come over the mountain if you get a chance.

391
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,044
Mother!

392
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,422
Mother!

393
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,592
my darling!

394
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,637
You climbed the mountain by yourself again? Yes!

395
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,139
Oh my god!

396
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,186
Mother!

397
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,521
Oh my god

398
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,147
Mom! Oh my god, it's so hot!

399
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,441
Oh my god, it’s hot!

400
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,318
It’s so hot!

401
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,277
It’s hot!

402
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,656
Mom, I made this. Do you like it?

403
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,158
So beautiful!

404
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,161
Oh my god, it’s so hot! You’re awesome!

405
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,622
You are awesome, baby.

406
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,790
Mother!

407
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,752
Mom! I got full marks!

408
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,088
Baby it's cold!

409
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,715
How did you go up the mountain in such cold weather?

410
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,010
(Spelling Test)

411
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,096
Full marks

412
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,640
Awesome, I'm so proud, baby

413
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,026
You said you loved this house because it belonged to your mother.

414
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,826
You said you can always smell her cooking here

415
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:22,255
You said your mother was diving for abalone to buy this house.

416
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,301
Didn't we rent it?

417
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,014
I didn't buy it.

418
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:35,810
The owner is from Busan and he doesn't have the energy to take care of it.

419
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,395
Not rented?

420
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,773
This is our home

421
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,157
This is the first time I have my own home

422
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,910
Never

423
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,663
Even conchs and crabs have their own homes

424
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:01,210
But I have always been a homeless person

425
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,006
My mother's home

426
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,216
My uncle's house

427
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,429
My stepfather's house and the one in Dodong-ri

428
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,515
Those are not my homes.

429
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,435
But this is really...

430
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,062
This is really...

431
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,275
Are you happy? Yes

432
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:25,944
I am so happy

433
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:27,987
real

434
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,448
I am so happy

435
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,676
Next time I will buy a bigger house

436
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,513
It already feels like a palace here.

437
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,265
It's mine now.

438
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,852
It's more like a palace.

439
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,441
A little higher over there.

440
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,444
Summer makes everything grow

441
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,362
let me see

442
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,448
My hard-working parents enjoyed expanding their home

443
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:17,078
They didn't even realize there was sweat on their foreheads

444
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,287
Oh my god!

445
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,706
Put one there too.

446
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,916
Put another one there.

447
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:26,337
That's the mother-of-pearl cabinet in Tongyeong.

448
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,131
It's brand new, not second-hand.

449
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,383
It's brand new and all mine

450
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,676
It's really mine!

451
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,931
Jinming, do you want me to pass it on to you later?

452
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,267
Do you want it? Do you want it?

453
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,435
And you?

454
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,479
Do you want to take a picture?

455
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,774
No big deal! Wanna take a picture?

456
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,484
Look

457
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:53,072
Even after many years, I moved to an apartment with a closet.

458
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,285
My parents are reluctant to throw away this mother-of-pearl wardrobe

459
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,746
bring it on

460
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,627
This shining pearl wardrobe

461
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,549
It reminds them of those hot summer days.

462
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,145
Previous residents here

463
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,273
They don't take good care of this place because it's not their home.

464
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,820
I don't even bother to clean the hair in the sewer.

465
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,364
Are you that busy?

466
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,368
Don't come to see me in my dreams

467
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,790
Are you here because I bought this house?

468
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,792
Because you are happy?

469
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,169
Because you're proud of me?

470
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,005
The woman next door bought a truck

471
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:34,966
What?

472
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:38,136
Does he think being diligent at night makes him a good husband?

473
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:42,056
Why are you always going out to sea to catch squid when you're about to give birth to him?

474
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,226
You have to catch squid to buy this house.

475
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,687
He should have bought a car a long time ago.

476
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,442
Your neighbor has a driver's license and a truck

477
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,653
Are you here to talk about your neighbor?

478
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,864
Are you jealous that she has a truck?

479
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:03,035
Buying a house is hard enough, what about a car?

480
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,166
If the persimmon tree grows to the neighbor's house

481
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,293
That woman...

482
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,880
Will eat all our persimmons

483
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,799
You should make them pay for their food.

484
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,554
Love Pure

485
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:25,474
That woman has a truck.

486
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,189
She has a truck

487
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:45,912
Jin Ming

488
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,332
Jin Ming

489
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,503
Now go check on your next door neighbor...

490
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:37,046
Have two children, no matter whether they are male or female, and raise them well

491
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:45,263
My wife only gave birth to two children but your daughter-in-law won three medals

492
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,100
The eldest daughter is the gold medal breadwinner for the family

493
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,978
The second and third are both sons.

494
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,690
Your daughter-in-law is indeed better than my daughter-in-law

495
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,901
Much better! Very awesome!

496
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,738
Didn't you say that Aichun was not destined to have a son?

497
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,658
Before he was born, an ancestor came to him in a dream

498
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,244
So he will be very lucky.

499
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:09,996
Just wait and see

500
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,082
Kuanzhi returns home with a full load every day

501
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,585
Thanks to this kid's grandmother

502
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,380
You used to say it was her soul that haunted Aichun

503
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,965
Now she is an ancestor again?

504
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,466
Even if you encounter setbacks

505
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:26,554
This little guy is destined to have good luck

506
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,057
You used to say that Aichun was not blessed.

507
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,642
You are such a...

508
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,646
What? Liar?

509
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,232
Sometimes I can say something right

510
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,406
Return with a full load!

511
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,452
The wide ship returned fully loaded again!

512
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,078
It must be the blessing brought by Tong Ming

513
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,414
As long as you go out to sea, fish will come to the boat

514
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,584
It's not the blessing brought by pure love

515
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,004
Just wait and see. One day I will definitely become a high-ranking official.

516
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,088
you're right!

517
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,594
People's representatives serve the people

518
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,680
Wait, no one objects.

519
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,974
That is unanimous approval

520
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,768
…Presidential election

521
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,521
Park Chung-hee's only candidate for president

522
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,649
2577 votes in favor, one vote voided

523
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,111
Re-elected President

524
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,697
I recommend Wu Aichun as the vice president

525
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,782
agree!

526
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,741
I second!

527
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,742
I agree too!

528
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,286
Everyone got it?

529
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,830
I'm not interested in politics

530
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,540
Who is Wu Aichun?

531
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,167
Guangli's Daughter

532
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,835
If she was Guangli's daughter...

533
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,880
…Then let her come!

534
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,634
She was also a deputy monitor when she was studying.

535
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,135
To the deputy monitor

536
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,180
Deny I deny your request

537
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,140
The cabinet is chosen by the president

538
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,393
How do you decide who to appoint?

539
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,896
Do you think a lion would sit at the same table with a wild dog?

540
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,858
Some people are starting to show off their power by relying on their dominance

541
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:07,613
You must also be eligible to run for election

542
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:12,535
Can cats and dogs participate in the election? Just eat one.

543
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,661
But you have so many!

544
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,080
Maybe I should run for president.

545
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,249
If even dogs can run for election, why can't I?

546
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,255
What are you talking about, damn girl?

547
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,049
I'd rather not choose

548
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,303
Don't be a "deputy"

549
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,598
We didn't vote because there was only one candidate

550
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,642
But if there are other candidates then vote!

551
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,144
Vote! Vote!

552
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,937
What do I have to be afraid of?

553
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,773
Let’s face off!

554
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,817
Guangli's Daughter

555
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,611
I want to confront him head on!

556
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,779
hateful!

557
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,656
Can a woman be a CEO?

558
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,659
What's wrong? Are you scared?

559
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,163
hateful!

560
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,583
Damn! Are you serious?

561
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,543
If you are not afraid then vote.

562
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,086
Hey you damn girl

563
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,924
Damn it! Hey!

564
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,219
Um?

565
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,638
Let her be the vice president.

566
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,057
Don't let her embarrass herself if she wins the election.

567
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,191
I didn't know she was so interesting until today.

568
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,993
(Aichun hits a ball)

569
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,496
Aichun threw the ball into the air

570
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,583
Doto-ri has its first female vice president

571

(Jeju Island Moral Corruption Rectification Period)

572
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,085
Hey come on

573
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,003
(No social dancing allowed)

574
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,213
Stop talking and look forward

575
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,130
Look ahead

576
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,131
(Vice President)

577
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,509
Come closer, everyone.

578
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,261
It's better for the little guy to stand in front

579
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,639
Go to the side, come here

580
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,598
One Two

581
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,977
Didn’t anyone tell you to say “three” before taking a photo?

582
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,189
Okay, everyone, look here.

583
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,774
one two three

584
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,655
(Social dance class)

585
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,951
Come on! Come on, don't resist, come out quickly

586
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,125
Come here! Take a photo!

587
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,919
What? Why take photos?

588
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,296
Bring them here

589
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,841
Come and sit down quickly.

590
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,010
Gather them up like garbage! Catch him!

591
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,515
There should be someone else? Get out of the way.

592
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,231
Hello, is there anyone in there? Pull over.

593
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,652
How could you go in there and act like a hooligan?

594
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,321
rogue?

595
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,491
The women's restroom is my jurisdiction

596
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:03,247
Do you like me? Why do you appear wherever I go?

597
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:07,167
Let's go somewhere else, please?

598
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,171
What's going on? Are you still thinking about me?

599
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,428
Do you regret it?

600
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,318
Hey, what does pinching your nose mean?

601
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,154
Why are you doing this while I'm talking?

602
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,536
lady

603
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,747
it's all over

604
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,041
You are surrounded

605
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,129
Is there anyone inside?

606
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,059
This foot...

607
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,147
Go to his social

608
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,941
Since when do we have to dance to socialize?

609
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,153
The New Countryside Movement Makes People Live Too Comfortably

610
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,655
Let them just think about partying

611
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,115
No one did that during the war.

612
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,033
Twist dance?

613
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,785
Social dance?

614
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,704
They should be sent to the 38th parallel.

615
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,291
You should count to three before taking the photo!

616
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:40,886
That's crazy, right?

617
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,600
What the hell!

618
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,520
How did you get here? What should we do now?

619
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,732
What is the situation now?

620
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,445
real

621
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,204
How can I get them away?

622
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,456
Stand aside

623
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,841
Cover your face with clothes

624
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,801
You have to cover up Xianshu too!

625
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,805
Good idea

626
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,849
Right? Look at these women.

627
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,768
They eat so much and have so little time that they dance around

628
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,978
I can't believe it

629
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,231
You'll have to go through some hard times before you can get back to reality.

630
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,567
Life must be beautiful, right?

631
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,235
Too beautiful!

632
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,362
Dancing is legitimate exercise!

633
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,114
Hey! Good job!

634
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,991
Just ass!

635
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,786
If that's the case why do you cover your face with clothes?

636
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,747
Show up at the Olympics

637
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,248
Win medals and bring glory to the country

638
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,417
Hyun-sook came and saw a ghost!

639
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,335
One, two, three, did you hear that?

640
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,130
One, two, three, dance will never be a sport

641
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,299
Stop filming!

642
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,933
The woman was holding the child.

643
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,561
She must be a deserter.

644
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,605
Take a picture of that woman!

645
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,523
Go get her, get her!

646
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,277
I'll catch them!

647
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,326
Don't move!

648
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,997
Why does she always go against me?

649
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,959
She's better than you, President.

650
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,381
All you know is to count to three and take a photo

651
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:56,104
Taking children to the dance hall to attend the news

652
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,148
Are you doing this because you're bored?

653
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,651
Do you have too much money to spend?

654
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:04,404
I would go crazy if I didn't learn the jitterbug.

655
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,783
I will kill myself or someone else

656
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,789
I feel angry when I stay at home

657
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,585
But once you start dancing, everything will pass

658
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:22,381
So I couldn't help but dance

659
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,971
Even at home, the president...

660
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,014
He's still that bastard.

661
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,809
My nickname at home is "Damn!"

662
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:34,810
hateful!

663
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,729
He always says: "Damn it"

664
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:42,109
So Hyun-sook first learned to say "Damn" and then "Dad"

665
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,695
Mom, you are Cinderella

666
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:48,991
you're right

667
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:52,536
Cinderella left her shoe behind when she ran away from her dance

668
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,921
So your dad is a prince.

669
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,470
This pair is better

670
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,765
You have to wear matching shoes to avoid him getting suspicious.

671
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,143
Who knows?

672
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:21,565
Prince Dodongri might pick up a pair of crystal slippers for you.

673
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,192
Oh, your hairpin.

674
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,486
Did your husband really buy it for you?

675
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,530
Everyone says so

676
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,534
They say your husband fishes just to buy you hairpins

677
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,454
Seriously

678
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,917
People in this town really care too much about other people's heads

679
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,087
Is that hairpin expensive?

680
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,797
Love Pure

681
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,467
You look more elegant than before.

682
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,136
Like a high society person

683
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,890
I think

684
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,602
How people live determines what they become.

685
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,027
hateful!

686
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,157
If you can't stand it, leave.

687
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,743
He's not some remarkable person.

688
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,620
Why let yourself get angry?

689
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,123
Is this why you rejected him?

690
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,583
What?

691
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,087
Do you really not regret it?

692
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:31,760
Do you like me? Why do you appear wherever I go?

693
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,847
Let's go somewhere else, please?

694
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,353
What's going on? Are you still thinking about me?

695
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,064
Do you regret it?

696
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,526
Goodbye, thank you

697
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,905
I've heard those things.

698
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,909
I know you and my husband were together.

699
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,789
Come on ma'am!

700
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,083
What kind of experience?

701
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,669
We just kissed once.

702
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,088
I had a kiss when I was young

703
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,719
Why did you only meet him once? You should spend more time with him.

704
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,806
You might step on this shit.

705
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,189
Xianshu, please don't step on feces

706
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:31,278
You must marry a man like this lady's husband, okay?

707
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,949
Your handwriting is beautiful

708
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,621
It should be written by literary girls

709
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,009
Do you really want me to write it?

710
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,053
The paint will dry quickly

711
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,848
It is unlucky for a woman to board a ship

712
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,934
The Dragon King might capsize the boat.

713
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,310
You won't be able to come back

714
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,395
I don't believe in that stuff hey!

715
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,980
Don't say that.

716
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:52,109
The Dragon King and the gods are very petty and will bear grudges.

717
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,485
I don't believe it at all

718
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,280
You, Jinming, Yinming, and Tongming are my gods

719
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,908
Thanks to the four of you, I was able to survive the typhoon.

720
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,451
I won't die anyway.

721
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,411
I will definitely come back to you

722
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,249
I will go home

723
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,005
I know

724
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,257
You are our heart of steel

725
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,426
Come on up

726
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,679
You are my blessing, right?

727
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:24,099
You have to write it to bring good luck

728
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,949
The mother said she couldn't tell her daughter:

729
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,287
"It's unlucky for you to board the ship"

730
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,002
She didn't want her daughter to be in this world.

731
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,631
So mom was the first to flip the table.

732
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,555
I don't believe in the Dragon King.

733
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,140
I believe in myself!

734
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,018
Why is it unlucky for my daughter to go on board?

735
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:55,357
Do you know what's happening on land?

736
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,818
You don't even know the New Country Movement old man

737
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,738
Didn't you say that the Dragon King and the gods all bear grudges?

738
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,740
Silver and copper come here

739
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,909
I hold a grudge too!

740
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,663
Do you remember the anti-superstition campaign?

741
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,665
recent

742
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,793
The president is arresting shamans.

743
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,795
If you make me unhappy

744
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:20,257
I won't even give you a bowl of festival rice!

745
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:25,178
You rely on me for support and yet you say I'm unlucky?

746
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,974
You are such a weird old man!

747
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,767
Spit at him

748
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,566
Summer makes everything grow

749
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,610
My young parents have grown up too.

750
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,597
(Gold, Silver and Bronze)

751
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:24,529
Now we have a house

752
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,823
A ship

753
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,826
It's really amazing

754
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,245
Are you happy?

755
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,289
Um

756
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:35,999
I'm so happy

757
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,170
I am so happy

758
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,806
In a life full of rewards

759
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:57,062
All they want is for the hot summer sun to last forever

760
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,941
They didn't know at the time

761
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,903
What else does summer bring?

762
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,866
(Return with a full load)

763
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:14,496
(Midsummer Night's Full Load)

764
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:04,624
("The same sky, the same stars, the same heart")

765
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:14,634
