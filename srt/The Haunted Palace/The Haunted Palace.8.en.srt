(All places, organizations, characters, )

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,679
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,380
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,420
(Episode 8)

9
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,230
(Return)

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,530
Oh, no. Hurry.

11
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,400
Yeo Ri.

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,570
I had the court maids...

13
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,669
make them in haste.

14
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,040
So tell me.

15
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,280
Will they suffice?

16
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,849
Yes.

17
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,620
I must use them to lift the deadly spell.

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,350
All right then.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,689
Here. Help her pack.

20
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,690
Yes.

21
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,990
My gosh.

22
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,160
Are you sure you can go in your current state?

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,600
I must go.

24
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,400
If I do not go, Kang Chul will be in danger.

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,070
Your resolution is understandable.

26
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,440
Even that troublesome serpent seems to care deeply about you.

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,240
If you are that worried, we must go. Let us head out.

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,050
- Pack up quickly now. - Yes.

29
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,820
I must save Kang Chul first.

30
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,970
Hold onto it!

31
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,990
Your Majesty!

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,089
- Do not get in my way. Stand back. - But...

33
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,000
Do not make me rescue two of you.

34
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,740
The water spirit...

35
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,680
will show up during the day when the sun rises...

36
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,610
because putrid water is bound to rot faster...

37
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,520
when exposed to the warmth of the sun.

38
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,620
Kang Chul is in danger.

39
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,500
The water reeks of a rotten stench.

40
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,670
I cannot breathe.

41
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,510
It is the royal blood.

42
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,810
Come with me.

43
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,720
I shall take you with me.

44
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,610
Your Majesty.

45
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,920
Do not just stand there. Get him out of the water!

46
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,580
It is different from last night.

47
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,680
This entire place reeks of a rotten stench.

48
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,450
I cannot breathe.

49
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,120
You like to brag and call yourself the king of fresh water.

50
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,660
That is only the case when you are not in a human body.

51
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,730
How is it?

52
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,560
How does the putrid water taste?

53
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,930
This will be the final blow.

54
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,540
The deadly spell...

55
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,760
Your Majesty. He fell into the water too.

56
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,230
We must do something.

57
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,810
What is this?

58
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,350
Let us call it an emergency weapon.

59
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,820
But I doubt you will have to use it.

60
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,390
Earth overcomes Water.

61
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,460
Soil can limit and suppress water.

62
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,170
You disgusting trifling spirit.

63
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,280
I will show you what makes me...

64
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,520
the king of fresh water.

65
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,890
(Episode 8: Aguji)

66
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,440
Your Majesty!

67
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,440
Are you all right?

68
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,110
Your neck...

69
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,740
I am all right.

70
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,220
But...

71
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,790
Kang Chul!

72
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,650
He is under the deadly spell too.

73
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,080
I must make haste.

74
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,530
(Return)

75
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,949
To the east stands the Divine General of the Blue Emperor.

76
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,049
To the west stands the Divine General of the White Emperor.

77
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,179
To the south stands the Divine General of the Red Emperor.

78
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,319
To the north stands the Divine General of the Black Emperor.

79
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,680
To the center stands the Divine General of the Yellow Emperor.

80
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,890
I humbly ask you return all the deadly spells...

81
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,620
to their rightful places.

82
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,720
Kang Chul.

83
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,490
I think the spell is lifted.

84
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,630
How come he is not awake yet?

85
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:57,960
Kang Chul.

86
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,600
Wake up.

87
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,070
Kang Chul, wake up.

88
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,830
Wake up!

89
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,540
Oh, dear. From the sound of your loud scream, I can tell...

90
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,380
you are well now.

91
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,390
You are well.

92
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,590
You are all right now.

93
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,460
I thought something bad was going to happen to you.

94
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,140
The deadly spell is...

95
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,950
lifted.

96
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,420
That cannot be.

97
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,650
You must be mistaken.

98
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,390
I definitely heard that the girl was under the spell too.

99
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,060
How could she lift the deadly spell?

100
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,760
So that wench...

101
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,130
came from Yongdam Village.

102
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,060
Yongdam Village?

103
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,769
Where is the village located?

104
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,070
You useless fool.

105
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,740
Have you truly forgotten where Yongdam Village is located?

106
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,980
Well, that was...

107
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,380
a long time ago.

108
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,750
- It must be a coincidence. - A coincidence?

109
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,949
The serpent may be by her side,

110
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,820
she cannot possibly stand up against the General.

111
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,360
She also lifted the spell of the water spirit at once.

112
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,760
Do you still think this is a coincidence?

113
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,790
But...

114
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,460
the lord master did not say anything about that.

115
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,330
He is in the dark about it.

116
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,040
Please accept my offering

117
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,039
Help me cleanse the soul

118
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,710
- Help me settle the grudge - Back then, only the two of us...

119
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,250
went to the Yongdam Village.

120
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,990
Look at them.

121
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,830
- All right. - My gosh.

122
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,300
- Oh, my. - How embarrassing.

123
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,930
You seem fine now.

124
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,240
Of course. I am the mighty Kang Chul.

125
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,410
A mere water spirit cannot bring me down.

126
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,520
Oh, my.

127
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,540
Your Majesty. Let us head back to the Palace now.

128
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,110
Your wounds must be treated immediately.

129
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,080
Let us return.

130
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,950
Go on.

131
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,150
Are you all right? Let me see.

132
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,820
I am fine.

133
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,800
Oh, no.

134
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,130
I have a bad feeling about this.

135
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,850
Your Highness. His Majesty the King is present.

136
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,420
Your Majesty.

137
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,260
Your Majesty. Her Highness has fully recovered.

138
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,470
Your Majesty.

139
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,900
I apologize for causing you concern.

140
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,410
I have regained my health.

141
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,680
And our baby...

142
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,150
is also in good health.

143
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,590
I am truly relieved to hear that.

144
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,030
I feared terribly that...

145
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,930
I might lose you too.

146
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,610
Your Majesty.

147
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,820
(Return)

148
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,190
You trifling spirit.

149
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,090
Do not waste your energy.

150
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,930
There is not a drop of water here.

151
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,560
You cannot even run away.

152
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,140
Who put you up to this?

153
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,499
Answer me...

154
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,270
before I lock you up in the straw doll...

155
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,040
and bury you in the ground. Now.

156
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,680
Darn him.

157
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,620
Answer her!

158
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,450
Trying to punish you would be a waste of effort.

159
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,460
Darn it.

160
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,460
I doubt he will tell us what we need.

161
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,330
Put him back in the doll.

162
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,829
We will bury him in the deepest part...

163
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,430
of the parched land.

164
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,130
Burying him underground...

165
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,700
can wait.

166
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,980
You showed up in the Queen's dreams every night...

167
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,580
and tormented her.

168
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,380
But did you know?

169
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,250
You were tormenting the wrong person.

170
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,120
Seeing how you became a water spirit,

171
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,030
you must have drowned to death.

172
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,060
Someone fished your skull out of the water,

173
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,170
and then instead of holding a proper funeral for you,

174
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,200
this person put your skull in her pillow...

175
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,340
and cast an evil spell.

176
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,640
We ought to identify and punish...

177
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,540
who is responsible. Do you not agree?

178
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,010
This person must have promised you something.

179
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,920
Tell me.

180
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,250
I will grant your wish.

181
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,390
My wish?

182
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,630
Yes. Your wish.

183
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,270
So tell me.

184
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,310
You must grant me my wish first.

185
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,070
Only then...

186
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,910
will I reveal who it is.

187
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,979
His name is Bang Mak Dol.

188
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,220
He was a live-out slave who resided in Goksan, Chungcheong Province.

189
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,920
He got swept up and died in a flood ten years ago.

190
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,889
He promised to tell us the truth if we brought his remains...

191
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,260
to his daughter.

192
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,930
Then will you head out to Goksan now?

193
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,100
Yes. I should be able to meet his daughter...

194
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,270
when I visit his house.

195
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,340
Come closer.

196
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,210
Closer.

197
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,420
All right. Are you feeling well?

198
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,860
Oh, yes. I am well.

199
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,559
Thank you for bestowing me with such precious medicinal herbs.

200
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,389
Gosh, do not mention it.

201
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,100
I shall give you a horse.

202
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,830
Have a comfortable journey.

203
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,600
Officer Seo.

204
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,270
Her journey could be dangerous. Make sure to accompany her.

205
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,440
I will do my best to keep her safe.

206
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,680
Then I will get going now.

207
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,510
All right. Have a safe trip.

208
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,550
Darn.

209
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,120
What is it this time?

210
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,420
I hear the Queen is still resting comfortably in her chambers.

211
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,990
You were also under the spell.

212
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,990
How could he send you that far away?

213
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,359
Does he think he can just toil you because you are of low birth?

214
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,259
How dare you?

215
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,829
His Majesty kindly gave her a horse to make things easier.

216
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,830
He ought to have given her a palanquin, not a horse.

217
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,969
I must go back in there and argue for it.

218
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,240
I told you. I am perfectly fine.

219
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Really?

220
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,549
Your Majesty. You were kind...

221
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,280
to Yeo Ri on purpose, were you not?

222
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,950
Was it obvious?

223
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,750
Yes. A bit.

224
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,260
He was greatly vexed by that. It seemed he was about to lose it.

225
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,270
- Oh, no. - What is it?

226
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,240
What do you see? Is there something wrong with my reading?

227
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,980
Good grief. Just tell me what it is.

228
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,350
I wonder if it has to do with the ominous rumour about the serpent.

229
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,850
My colleagues have turned up dead out of the blue lately.

230
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,860
I cannot seem to rest due to fear.

231
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,760
- There will be a flood. - Go on.

232
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,060
The tree will be uprooted.

233
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,560
Does it mean...

234
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,130
I will die?

235
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,500
Do not worry. I will save your life.

236
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,140
I will write this out with all of my heart.

237
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,940
Do not put it away even for a moment.

238
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,810
Make sure to keep it with you at all times.

239
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,620
Even the mighty serpent is a snake, after all.

240
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,589
So I must stop him with a pig, the natural enemy...

241
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,060
that eats snakes.

242
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,440
No.

243
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,270
I do not believe in such things.

244
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,640
My goodness.

245
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,280
Think about the effort I made and take it for my sake.

246
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,409
I asked the Master...

247
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,550
of the Bureau of the Blind as a special favour...

248
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,049
and secured one for you too.

249
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,220
Do you honestly believe this will help?

250
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,459
We are in a strange time now.

251
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,430
Our close colleagues are turning up dead one at a time.

252
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,900
It almost appears as if someone is doing so to aid the King.

253
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,240
Be it a spirit or a serpent.

254
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,500
Caution now may spare us peril later on.

255
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,580
Please take it.

256
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,570
May I ask what this is about?

257
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,140
Is this the house of a man named Bang Mak Dol?

258
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,310
Yes. He was my father.

259
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,380
However, he passed away a long time ago.

260
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,120
May I ask what this is?

261
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,290
It is your father's remains.

262
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,530
Pardon?

263
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,700
What do you mean?

264
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,180
Father.

265
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,320
I am sorry.

266
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,290
My father passed away while trying to save me.

267
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,030
I am sorry.

268
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
My gosh.

269
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,470
My child, Kkeut Soon.

270
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,010
Kkeut Soon.

271
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,140
Hey.

272
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,310
We have granted your wish. Now, make good on your promise.

273
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,150
I am starting to get hungry now.

274
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,620
Excuse me, Lady Shaman.

275
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,890
My child is utterly heartbroken.

276
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,059
Could I please borrow your body,

277
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,030
so I can speak to her just this once?

278
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,899
Well, that is...

279
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,899
We have already done you a favour.

280
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,370
Are you trying to push your luck?

281
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,200
- It is not what you promised. - So what?

282
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,200
Then do you want my child, Kkeut Soon,

283
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,910
to live the rest of her life with such regret?

284
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,040
How could you be so heartless?

285
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,410
- Whatever! - What?

286
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,480
If you do not lend me your body,

287
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,949
I will not speak a word to you.

288
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,690
I cannot believe his audacity.

289
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,950
I am going to beat you up and teach you a lesson.

290
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,100
If I lend you my body for a moment,

291
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,860
do you truly promise to tell us everything?

292
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,230
I will tell you everything.

293
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,530
I will tell you every single thing I remember.

294
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,970
Letting a spirit possess your body will drain you greatly.

295
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,440
You are this willing to lend him your body?

296
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,439
Have you forgotten that your body belongs to me?

297
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,740
Hold on!

298
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,680
There is just one thing I must tell my daughter.

299
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,890
It has to be very brief.

300
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,220
Can I possess your body now?

301
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,560
Shall I enter now?

302
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,960
As if. You will do no such...

303
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,170
It worked! I am in.

304
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,570
Already?

305
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,610
You brat.

306
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,340
You silly girl.

307
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,210
What did I tell you? I, your father, told you not to go.

308
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,780
Why did you not listen to me? You caused such a disaster.

309
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,450
Father?

310
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,120
Is that you, Father?

311
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,050
Yes, it is me.

312
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,320
If I am not your father, who could I be?

313
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,860
Anyway,

314
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,630
you never listened to me ever since you were a baby.

315
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,229
Why did you go there when there was a flood?

316
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,500
Then what about you?

317
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,339
You would have scolded me if I lost the net again.

318
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,500
That is precisely my point.

319
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,940
You should have collected it when I told you to!

320
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,580
Oh, my.

321
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,550
Look at this boy.

322
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,950
From whom did he inherit such good looks?

323
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,160
Kkeut Soon.

324
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,690
You gave birth to a son and made your father proud.

325
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,590
Father, do not be silly. I gave birth to a girl.

326
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,660
What?

327
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,960
It is a girl?

328
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,770
She looks just like you when you were a baby.

329
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,610
Wait. I still have more things to say.

330
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,680
Father.

331
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,580
Kkeut Soon.

332
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,020
It was not your fault.

333
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,790
It was my fate. Understood?

334
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,660
And place a dried persimmon...

335
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,490
on the altar...

336
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,560
on my death anniversary.

337
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,270
Father.

338
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,870
Father, what do you want other than dried persimmons?

339
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,940
What else do you want to eat, Father?

340
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,140
That is all I want.

341
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,910
Father.

342
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,450
- My child. - Father.

343
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,120
Have a good life.

344
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,460
Stop wasting tears on me now.

345
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,530
Father.

346
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,230
By the way,

347
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,640
what is a dried persimmon?

348
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,779
A blind man?

349
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,040
Yes, he was blind.

350
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,849
I was carried away by the flood.

351
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,950
My skull rolled aimlessly on the stagnant riverbed.

352
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,150
Then a fisherman's net caught it and hoisted it.

353
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,590
That blind man...

354
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,720
was so pleased to see a spirit whose resentment ran so deeply.

355
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,390
So he bought my skull.

356
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,130
Who is that man?

357
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,430
Hold on.

358
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,600
His name was...

359
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,730
It was...

360
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,500
"You, Aguji. How dare you?"

361
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,770
Someone called the blind man by that name.

362
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,140
Aguji?

363
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,050
Yes. Then I was locked up in the Bureau of the Blind...

364
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,410
for many years.

365
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,220
Then not long ago, the blind man told me...

366
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,990
he would let me see my daughter...

367
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,560
if I brought him the royal offspring.

368
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,560
Aguji.

369
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,100
A grand vessel like you is hard to come by.

370
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,470
Clearly, you are way better equipped spiritually...

371
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,440
to become my vessel than the lowly Aguji fool.

372
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,870
The Eight-feet Spirit also mentioned Aguji.

373
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,740
Blind Aguji.

374
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,410
Who on earth is it?

375
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,949
Oh, my gosh.

376
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,489
I have not been to the capital in ten or so years,

377
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,689
and I cannot tell north from south.

378
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,129
If I had known I would visit so soon,

379
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,360
I would have asked...

380
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,669
where that Yoon Gap lived.

381
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,700
Do you...

382
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,600
Master?

383
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,369
Master.

384
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,470
- Mas... - Who is this old fool?

385
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,640
- Oh, dear. - You cannot eat what I must sell!

386
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,149
I am trying to make a living!

387
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,279
I am so very sorry.

388
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,189
My old master was hungry.

389
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,020
I will pay you for the food.

390
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,830
Here.

391
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,730
If you were to give me a discount...

392
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,710
I returned to the capital because you had sent word...

393
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,449
that you had found all the books the book broker had bought.

394
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,219
But what is this?

395
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,520
You do not have the book I am looking for.

396
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,959
My lord. I am just as frustrated.

397
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,429
What is that book?

398
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,430
I need to know what it is if I am to find it or not.

399
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,040
Search again.

400
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,639
All the books within the capital that he touched,

401
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,440
read, or even mentioned.

402
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,150
Find them all.

403
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,050
- This is not how you do business! - Get lost, then!

404
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,200
- Oh, my gosh. - Goodness.

405
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,040
Get up.

406
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,580
Are you all right?

407
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,150
You fool!

408
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,950
Get out of here this instant!

409
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,420
Is something up there?

410
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,920
- Where? - No.

411
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,430
Who is he talking to?

412
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,500
I do not see anything. What does he see?

413
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,640
Here you go, Master.

414
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,609
I was not sure I could afford the rice cakes.

415
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,909
You made a huge donation.

416
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,810
Not at all. I owe you even more.

417
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,450
I do not know why such things keep happening.

418
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,320
There is always a cause and reason.

419
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,990
- Pardon? - I chased it away for now,

420
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,030
but it looks like someone holds a great grudge against you.

421
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,870
I have no idea...

422
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,810
what you mean.

423
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,079
You must show remorse for your actions...

424
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,280
and send the spirit to the afterlife...

425
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,650
if you want to be free of such mishaps.

426
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,590
Namo Amitabha, merciful Buddha.

427
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,290
Let us go, Master.

428
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,530
Come along.

429
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,970
What?

430
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,039
We must hurry back and report to His Majesty.

431
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,639
She is too weak to ride a horse.

432
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,479
If it is that urgent, return alone.

433
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,850
What do you mean? We must catch Aguji.

434
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,049
He will know we lifted the deadly spell.

435
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,280
We must hurry back.

436
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,849
Do you know how you look?

437
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,989
You barely recovered from the deadly spell,

438
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,490
and then you let some random spirit possess you.

439
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,100
He may have a point. I will go alone.

440
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,329
Can you find him with just a name?

441
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,540
He must be one of the blind shamans.

442
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,500
Rest up before your return.

443
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,110
I will. Go on your way, then.

444
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
You are way too merciful.

445
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,790
Have you forgotten he almost killed you with his spell?

446
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,560
Do you know how draining it is to let a spirit possess your body?

447
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,030
Why did you allow it?

448
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,330
All the fool did with your body was chastise his daughter.

449
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,670
He was so pathetic.

450
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,669
That was not pathetic at all.

451
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,979
Humans do not live even a hundred years.

452
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,979
His daughter will die soon, and they will be reunited.

453
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,510
Why does he care so much?

454
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,920
Why? What?

455
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,450
Do you not get it?

456
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,990
They become that more attached...

457
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,460
because they do not live a hundred years.

458
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,160
Just because their lives may seem short and insignificant,

459
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:23,470
the love a daughter has for a father and a father has for a daughter...

460
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,200
should not be belittled.

461
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,750
My grandmother said...

462
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,480
everyone in the world...

463
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,120
were pitiful folk.

464
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,960
I never wished to know how Grandmother felt...

465
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,890
because I thought she was foolish.

466
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,410
Master.

467
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,710
Burn everything.

468
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,520
Very well.

469
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,199
With the spell broken, no one can say...

470
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,640
what the water spirit will tell.

471
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,170
Soon, us blind shamans will be questioned.

472
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,880
My gosh. What is happening?

473
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,709
- Please stop. - Oh, no!

474
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,080
Who are you?

475
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,880
Oh, dear.

476
00:35:45,881 --> 00:35:47,079
Why are you doing this?

477
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,320
What is going on? What is wrong?

478
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,560
My goodness.

479
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,190
What brings you...

480
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:58,029
to this shabby place?

481
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,659
Round up...

482
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,059
all the blind shamans!

483
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,229
That is the King's command!

484
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,300
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

485
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,270
Oh, dear.

486
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,370
Please spare me. I did nothing wrong.

487
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,119
I will have all the shamans removed.

488
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,030
Search the rooms thoroughly.

489
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,530
We must find evidence, no matter what.

490
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,770
Oh, my gosh.

491
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:14,569
Please spare my life.

492
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,570
Who are you?

493
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:19,409
I am... I am just a servant.

494
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,880
I do not know anything.

495
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,249
Oh, no...

496
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,990
Officer! I really do not know anything!

497
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,419
Oh, my gosh. Officer!

498
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,960
Take him to the State Tribunal.

499
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,430
- Yes, sir. - Officer.

500
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,430
His Majesty the King is present!

501
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,839
This lowly blind fool...

502
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,610
is honoured with an audience with you for the first time.

503
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,979
Do you know Aguji?

504
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,620
Did you just say "Aguji?"

505
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,229
I have never heard that name, Your Majesty.

506
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,200
If anything you say turns out to be a lie,

507
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,099
you will be tortured severely.

508
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,199
Why would a blind fool like I...

509
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,470
lie to you, Your Majesty?

510
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,780
Then is it true you visited the Dowager Queen?

511
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,580
Answer me!

512
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,309
Since when have you been meeting the Dowager Queen?

513
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,319
Did you ask me when the honourable...

514
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,189
and revered Dowager Queen started to show favour...

515
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,960
to a lowly fool like me?

516
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,490
Let me see...

517
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,829
It was the Year of the Black Rabbit,

518
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,930
when the former King passed away.

519
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,329
The Year of the Black Rabbit?

520
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,270
Her Highness married into the royal family at the age of 17...

521
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,840
and suffered a terrible loss.

522
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,110
Your Majesty must be well aware of it.

523
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,480
That horrendous evil spirit.

524
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,850
You must be careful, Your Majesty.

525
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,550
If you do not,

526
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,460
you will not be able to avoid a grave disaster either.

527
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,029
We searched every corner of the Bureau of the Blind...

528
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,299
and found nothing we could consider evidence.

529
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,469
We interrogated the other blind shamans too,

530
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,570
but none of them knew a blind man called Aguji.

531
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,609
You fool.

532
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,309
Will this be all right?

533
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,849
The Dowager Queen is involved.

534
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,249
Yeo Ri would not tell a lie.

535
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,920
One of them must be Aguji.

536
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,120
Lock them all up and continue to torture them.

537
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,290
Okay.

538
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,030
- Hello? - Yes?

539
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,030
- Two gukbap, please. - Coming right up.

540
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,540
I feel much better now that I ate something hot.

541
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,309
Bring me one more bowl.

542
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,349
- Okay. - No. You do not have to.

543
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,379
Okay.

544
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,549
Why not? I can eat more.

545
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,120
You had enough. Do you know how much a bowl costs?

546
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,550
I do not think I have enough money.

547
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,759
If this is how you treat your guardian spirit,

548
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,060
you will regret it later on.

549
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,959
We must get going now.

550
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,230
What? Right now?

551
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,470
- What? - Goodbye.

552
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,770
You will set off now?

553
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,209
We have a full belly, and we are rested.

554
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,810
There is no reason to stall.

555
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Oh, dear.

556
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,120
You will ride a horse off into a rainy night?

557
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,919
Dream on.

558
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,560
Why would it rain so suddenly?

559
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,630
My gosh.

560
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,830
Why a sudden downpour?

561
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,900
It is a passing shower.

562
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,710
We can set off when it stops.

563
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,530
Why are you...

564
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,570
looking at me like that?

565
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,100
How am I looking at you?

566
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,770
It is as if you are looking at someone you missed.

567
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,980
You have that look.

568
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,350
Is it not a fact that Yoon Gap had feelings for you?

569
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,390
Does this heart and soul confuse me...

570
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,890
when I see you because they are his?

571
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,200
Or are these just a trick I feel...

572
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,800
because I am trapped in this body?

573
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,440
I do not know.

574
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,710
This is how I feel.

575
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,240
How do you feel?

576
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,010
About what?

577
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,980
I always wondered...

578
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,880
if the smile you have...

579
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,380
is for me or...

580
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,860
for Yoon Gap.

581
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,440
We should set off when the rain stops.

582
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,939
It does not look like it will stop soon.

583
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,970
Wait.

584
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,009
You are a serpent.

585
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,810
You can control the weather.

586
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,850
- Did you... - Come on.

587
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,389
Do you think serpents control the weather just like that?

588
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,520
Some things are out of our control.

589
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,860
What?

590
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,870
Is anyone there?

591
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:01,510
I am dead thirsty. Bring me a cup of water.

592
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,420
How dare a criminal who is locked up give orders?

593
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,059
You be quiet!

594
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,189
A lowly guard like you...

595
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,630
dared to belittle me?

596
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,560
You had better bring me water...

597
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:26,440
unless you want to die in your sleep.

598
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,300
Water.

599
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,870
Darn you.

600
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,309
Master.

601
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:36,080
What will happen to us?

602
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,280
Some fool cursed the Queen,

603
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,550
and we might die for it.

604
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,549
Do you have a plan, Master?

605
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,390
- Yes. Think of something. - Enough!

606
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,160
Who are we?

607
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,429
Most of the influential people...

608
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,260
came to us for help at one time or another.

609
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,470
No temples are allowed in the capital,

610
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,740
and shamans can hold rituals a distance away from the fortress.

611
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,140
Whatever people say,

612
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,940
us blind shamans survived a very tough time.

613
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,740
Yes or no?

614
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,850
- Yes. - You are right.

615
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,880
No one can harm us.

616
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,220
You cannot do that, Your Majesty.

617
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,930
The blind men's uttering do not harm a soul.

618
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:26,399
You showed mercy even for the lowest slaves.

619
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,899
Why would you...

620
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,069
imprison the blind shamans...

621
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:32,429
when they have no one to turn to for help?

622
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,339
What are you saying?

623
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,869
Someone cast a spell...

624
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:39,209
too gruesome to be described on Her Highness the Queen.

625
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,580
Are you saying we should let it go out of pity for the blind?

626
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,880
The premier is right.

627
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,620
At one point, the Queen's life was in danger.

628
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,019
If anyone seems even a little suspicious,

629
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:54,219
investigating thoroughly to reveal the truth...

630
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,230
is the right thing to do.

631
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:00,330
Why do you all say I should release the men...

632
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,730
from the Bureau of the Blind as if you agreed on it?

633
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,810
Your Majesty. Do you think...

634
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,670
the Dowager Queen...

635
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,680
got the blind men to harm the Queen?

636
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,180
I never made that conclusion.

637
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:25,790
Your Majesty.

638
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:29,560
The blind shamans went to the Dowager Queen...

639
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,689
to say prayers...

640
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,860
for the deceased Prince Young In.

641
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,130
How about now?

642
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:40,240
Was that enough to explain away the misunderstanding?

643
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,510
They quote teachings from Confucius and Mencius,

644
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,910
but they send their wives to us...

645
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:52,079
to buy spells and talismans to sew to their underwear.

646
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,120
That is what the nobles do.

647
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,749
One word from us, and all their secrets...

648
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,050
will be known.

649
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,959
Who should tremble?

650
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,360
Should it be us or them out there?

651
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,230
It should be them.

652
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,700
Hello, all of you.

653
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,310
Where is he?

654
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,120
- Grilled Abalone. - What?

655
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:34,660
That is disgusting. Cough out the phlegm.

656
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,359
Can you stop calling me "Grilled Abalone..."

657
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,200
and call me "Head Eunuch" instead?

658
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:46,029
Well, I was greatly displeased...

659
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,369
by your actions,

660
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,739
and I criticized you for them.

661
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,579
But that was because I did not know who was inside of you,

662
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,549
and you did not know how to act according to our rules.

663
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:01,880
I do understand completely now.

664
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:05,990
So from now on, please refrain from calling me Abalone or whatever.

665
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,590
Just call me Head Eunuch.

666
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,260
Got it?

667
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,830
All right, then.

668
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,730
Then I will see you around.

669
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:18,799
I am hungry.

670
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,500
Tell Yeo Ri to wrap it up so we can go home.

671
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,370
- Head... - Good.

672
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,140
Grilled Abalone.

673
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,540
Why, you... "Grilled Abalone?"

674
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,750
I am sick of hearing "Grilled Abalone!"

675
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,250
Darn you!

676
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,420
So, you failed to find a blind shaman called Aguji?

677
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,360
That is right.

678
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,960
I checked with every servant in the Bureau of the Blind,

679
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,630
but no one knew a shaman by that name.

680
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,700
Besides that name,

681
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,640
was there any other clue the spirit told you?

682
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,970
It did not seem like he knew much for he had been locked up too.

683
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,510
I apologize. Please blame my incompetence.

684
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,650
No.

685
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,690
You have saved my family numerous times already.

686
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,690
You saved the prince and my queen too.

687
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,030
You also saved the child in my queen's womb.

688
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,960
Thank you.

689
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,670
Well...

690
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,040
About your maternal grandmother.

691
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,370
Was her name Neop Deok?

692
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:32,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

693
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:34,079
Before she passed away,

694
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,810
did she perhaps tell you about visiting the Palace?

695
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,410
No, she did not.

696
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,850
She never told you?

697
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,680
My grandmother, Neop Deok,

698
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,950
passed away in the Year of the Black Rabbit.

699
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,060
And before she passed, I was simply too young.

700
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,760
The Year of the Black Rabbit?

701
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:52,660
Neop Deok, the shaman, died in the Year of the Black Rabbit?

702
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,300
Yes, in May.

703
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:57,830
How did she die?

704
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,670
- No! - Oh, no!

705
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,640
My goodness!

706
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,940
- Oh, dear. - What do we do?

707
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:11,950
I am asking you how she died.

708
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,920
Well...

709
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,720
- No! - No, please...

710
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,420
- I cannot believe this! - No!

711
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,419
- My goodness. - What do we do?

712
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,530
What should we do?

713
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,330
It was an accident.

714
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,400
She drowned in the sea while conducting a shamanic ritual.

715
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,880
Your Majesty.

716
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,720
You are dismissed.

717
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,709
- My gosh. - No...

718
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,719
Do something!

719
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,349
- We cannot lose her like this. - No!

720
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,520
- Oh, dear. - What do we do?

721
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,030
You clumsy girl.

722
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,420
What upset you this time?

723
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,590
I heard...

724
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,560
they failed to find Aguji.

725
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,530
Those scoundrels did not hesitate to kill the prince.

726
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,960
Did you think it would be that easy to track him down?

727
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,830
He will be caught soon,

728
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,200
so do not be too disappointed.

729
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,270
Yeo Ri.

730
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:18,640
Yeo Ri!

731
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,879
I went to all that trouble to catch the evil water spirit...

732
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,080
because you told me to.

733
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,179
I loathe foolish humans,

734
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,520
but I kindly put up with them.

735
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,990
I did all of that for you.

736
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:34,190
What made you so angry that you are treating me like this?

737
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,030
You are right. You did all of that.

738
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,030
However, that was because I agreed to serve you as my guardian spirit.

739
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,240
Only then can you ascend as a dragon.

740
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,270
That was our deal.

741
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,970
Right.

742
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,310
Hence, I am doing my best to keep my end of the bargain.

743
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,310
I will be sure to keep my end of the bargain too.

744
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,380
I will faithfully serve you as my guardian spirit,

745
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,920
and until the day when you can ascend as a dragon,

746
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,920
I will pray for you with all my heart.

747
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,860
However,

748
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:09,690
that will be it.

749
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,390
I will do nothing more for you.

750
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,760
So, you should do the same.

751
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,029
Whether I am getting weak or not,

752
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,730
and whether I drop my glasses case or not,

753
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,900
it is none of your business.

754
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,210
And do not look at me like that.

755
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,050
I am certain that someone is behind it all.

756
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:41,760
That is why they are moving together in such an orderly fashion.

757
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,490
However, it is not the Dowager Queen's Palace.

758
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,260
This is not how the Dowager Queen does things.

759
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,030
Your Majesty.

760
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,470
Please release those from the Bureau of the Blind.

761
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,739
Premier.

762
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,210
I, too, wished to severely punish the person behind all of it,

763
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:02,210
no matter who it might be.

764
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,880
However,

765
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:06,280
there is no solid evidence...

766
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,820
that can convince the ministers.

767
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:12,950
You know I appointed you as Chief Investigator to find evidence.

768
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:14,960
I assure you...

769
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,060
that I am not trying to side with the Dowager Queen.

770
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,000
Even if it is true that...

771
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:23,470
someone cast a malicious spell on the Royal House,

772
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,400
the Dowager Queen and those serving her...

773
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,940
suffered the most, as you are aware.

774
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,980
The Dowager Queen has a lot of power now.

775
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,910
I am concerned that all of this might backfire on us.

776
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,950
I am afraid.

777
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,190
Your Majesty.

778
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:19,690
Those from the Bureau of the Blind...

779
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,720
have been released.

780
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,460
Is it truly all right to let them go like this?

781
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:27,260
This is why we need evidence...

782
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,440
Now, I am even more certain...

783
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,810
that someone is controlling the Eight-feet Spirit.

784
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,940
But who could it be?

785
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,890
Investigate the Bureau of the Blind, but be very discreet about it.

786
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,890
We ought to track down Aguji first.

787
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,440
Over there. Can you pass me that towel?

788
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,310
Goodness.

789
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,920
I made a huge mistake.

790
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:31,130
Passing me a towel was not part of our agreement,

791
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:32,490
which means...

792
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,960
it is not included in our deal.

793
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,100
My bad.

794
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,770
I am truly sorry.

795
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,239
- Move. - I feel so bad.

796
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,340
I said, move.

797
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,410
She could have stepped aside. What is her problem?

798
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,800
Grandma.

799
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,800
I caught myself...

800
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,310
smiling at him.

801
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,950
I smiled as I was looking at...

802
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,380
the scoundrel who took your life.

803
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,160
At first, I thought I was simply confused.

804
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,730
I thought that was why, but...

805
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,530
I am sorry, Grandma.

806
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,270
Is it really true that Kang Chul killed Neop Deok?

807
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,299
What?

808
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,610
You heard everything?

809
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,069
You were in the Dowager Queen's Palace.

810
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,240
What are you doing here?

811
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:57,280
You promised to buy me a new pair of shoes but never did.

812
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,650
So, I will stay glued to you...

813
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,050
and make you suffer in every way I can.

814
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:09,760
Okay, fine. Now, can you please leave?

815
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:12,190
I will buy you new shoes in the morning, so leave now.

816
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,430
I am not in the mood to talk to you right now.

817
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,300
Wait.

818
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,369
How do you know about my grandmother?

819
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,500
I know her because I have met her.

820
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,740
I told you I was older than your grandmother.

821
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,470
Were you not listening?

822
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,380
You saw her? In the Palace? When?

823
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,180
Well, it was...

824
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,950
Let me think.

825
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,190
Yes, in April of the Year of the Black Rabbit.

826
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,090
That was just a month before my grandma passed away.

827
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,290
Are you sure she visited the Palace in April of that year?

828
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,760
Yes, I am sure.

829
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,359
She came to the Palace...

830
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,800
and left with the people in the Royal Family, so I followed them.

831
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,870
I saw everything while hiding.

832
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,069
Neop Deok and the Eight-feet Spirit...

833
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,940
made quite the scene at some temple.

834
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,540
What did you say?

835
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,180
Oh, boy.

836
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:08,949
Where is Kang... I mean,

837
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:10,179
where is Royal Scribe Yoon?

838
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,420
He stepped out to take care of something. You did not know?

839
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,060
My goodness. What is the matter?

840
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,830
I just remembered I had to take care of something. You should go to bed.

841
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,030
But where are you going...

842
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,229
Goodness. Hey!

843
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,300
What if the patrolmen see you?

844
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,039
Neop Deok did manage...

845
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,200
to suppress the powers of the Eight-feet Spirit.

846
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,869
But I believe the Eight-feet Spirit...

847
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,980
went after her, saying it would teach her a lesson.

848
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,380
I cannot figure out what women want.

849
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,720
After smiling at me as if she was determined to seduce this man,

850
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,760
she is all cold to me now.

851
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,519
Even the northern wind in the dead of winter...

852
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,960
would not be as cold as this.

853
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,730
Seduce what? This man?

854
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:55,300
As in, a human?

855
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,200
I was just saying.

856
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,340
Then you can just quit.

857
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:05,540
Being her guardian spirit.

858
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:08,440
What?

859
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:14,080
- Do you regret it? - Regret what?

860
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,990
That time, how you said...

861
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:20,390
you killed her grandmother.

862
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,260
Goodness.

863
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,700
I told you. It cannot be done.

864
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,969
Oh, boy. It simply cannot be done.

865
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:38,109
How dare you request an audience with His Majesty at this hour?

866
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,540
I must meet His Majesty now.

867
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:41,380
It is about the Eight-feet Spirit.

868
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:42,880
What?

869
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,850
Did something else happen?

870
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,580
So?

871
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:51,990
What brings you here at this late hour?

872
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,320
Your Majesty.

873
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:56,290
Your Majesty ascended the throne in the Year of the Black Rabbit.

874
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:59,190
Was the Eight-feet Spirit seen in the Palace that year?

875
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,530
Do you know if someone in the Royal Family...

876
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,200
was possessed by the Eight-feet Spirit back then?

877
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,470
It is a confidential matter involving the Royal House,

878
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,880
- so I cannot answer that question. - No.

879
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,880
I must know.

880
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,210
When was the Eight-feet Spirit first seen?

881
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,450
Who caused the resentment in the first place?

882
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,390
I ought to know.

883
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:25,850
So,

884
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:27,960
please tell me, Your Majesty.

885
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,170
If Your Majesty cannot be honest with me,

886
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,030
I can no longer...

887
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:42,740
help Your Majesty.

888
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,110
Fine.

889
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,680
It was here.

890
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,320
That miserable time.

891
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,220
Even back then,

892
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,520
the Eight-feet Spirit was here.

893
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,560
That darned evil spirit.

894
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,930
My father...

895
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,130
The late king...

896
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,470
was attacked by it.

897
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,220
I think that darned evil spirit...

898
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,420
killed my grandmother too.

899
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,760
It was not Kang Chul, after all. It was the Eight-feet Spirit.

900
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:45,270
The Eight-feet Spirit killed Grandma.

901
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,240
Prepare warm bathwater before you do anything else.

902
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,380
After being in that filthy place,

903
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,110
I smell bad.

904
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,780
Yes, no problem.

905
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,530
Aguji, you fool!

906
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,970
Oh, my. Lord Master!

907
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,520
Please spare me!

908
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,420
I know what happened cannot be undone,

909
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,620
but I am utterly upset too!

910
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,829
You kindly spared me once again this time.

911
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,730
I will never forget your kindness.

912
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:49,860
But please do not be concerned.

913
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,830
The General of Heaven and Earth has a plan.

914
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:54,600
He will take down those fools and witches...

915
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,710
and instantly recover all the damages with his brilliant plan.

916
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,680
What? No!

917
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,490
No!

918
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:13,390
Lord Master, no! Please do not do that.

919
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,059
No, Lord Master!

920
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,960
No! Please, no!

921
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,790
No!

922
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:24,300
No, please...

923
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:28,170
Oh, dear General. This cannot be happening.

924
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,869
This will anger the General of Heaven and Earth.

925
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:34,310
Lord Master, what do we do now?

926
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,310
Lord Master!

927
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:40,779
Whatever that ghost says, I do not care.

928
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,849
Please, no...

929
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:44,189
You used to put nasty curses on people...

930
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,690
to earn a living.

931
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,760
If it were not for me, you would not be where you are today!

932
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,320
After messing everything up like this,

933
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,960
you are still asking for the General of Heaven and Earth?

934
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,160
Who is the one you serve?

935
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,769
- That darned ghost... - Please...

936
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:59,530
or me?

937
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:02,170
Of course, it is you, Lord Master.

938
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,039
I will put my life on the line...

939
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,610
to faithfully serve you until the day I die.

940
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:09,480
Lord Master.

941
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:13,250
You said you would give me a month, and there is still some time left.

942
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:17,550
I promise you that I will be sure to kill the prince.

943
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:19,520
Good.

944
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,920
If you do not get it done until then,

945
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:25,260
I will take your life with my own two hands.

946
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:27,960
No, please...

947
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:31,730
Help him.

948
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,440
Oh, gosh. Lord Master!

949
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:40,810
That glasses-maker! The wench who ruined everything.

950
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,810
That wench has that shaman's blood.

951
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:49,250
She is a direct descendant of Neop Deok, the shaman!

952
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,580
(Special thanks to Kim Young Kwang for his cameo appearance.)

953
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,559
(The Haunted Palace)

954
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,129
The Eight-feet Spirit killed my grandma. It was not you.

955
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,300
Why did you not tell me?

956
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:42,270
I told you to keep your lips sealed.

957
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,509
Why did you tell Yeo Ri that?

958
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:46,439
I suppose you were worried about her.

959
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,110
I am sure they like each other.

960
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,979
If we could tie that serpent down for a brief moment,

961
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,520
we would be able to get rid of Yeo Ri very easily.

962
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:55,849
Noblemen over the age of 60...

963
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:57,419
all had that talisman?

964
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,650
I cannot invoke the winds?

965
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:01,919
Your mother's life lies in my hands.

966
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,659
If you wish to save her, come to the abandoned house.

967
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:04,960
What... Why are you doing this?

968
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:07,960
Save me, Kang Chul. Please.
