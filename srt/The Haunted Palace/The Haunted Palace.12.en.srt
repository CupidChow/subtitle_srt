00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,009
(All places, organizations, characters, )

6
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,589
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,340
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,460
When men die, they leave behind spirits.

9
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,090
But serpents, divine beings,

10
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,930
dissipate as if they never...

11
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,930
existed.

12
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,390
Absolutely nothing...

13
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,520
remains.

14
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,380
Kang Chul.

15
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,760
Yeo Ri.

16
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,890
I am miserable.

17
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,220
This feeling is unbearable.

18
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,020
My heart...

19
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,140
aches so much.

20
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,400
If I rip out my heart,

21
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,360
will the pain stop?

22
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,700
Please...

23
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,240
help me.

24
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,370
Why am I feeling this way?

25
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,120
I am sorry, Kang Chul.

26
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,460
Bi Bi is gone because of me.

27
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,550
You should blame me and resent me for it.

28
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,970
I am responsible for what happened to Bi Bi.

29
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,600
So you should...

30
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,680
hate me instead. All right?

31
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,250
(Episode 12: Gwangam Chronicles)

32
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,930
My lord, they were the intruders.

33
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,320
For what reason did you set foot in the Bureau of the Blind?

34
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,070
The King's maternal grandfather...

35
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
He has been backing the blind man all this time.

36
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,330
The Bureau of the Blind was already shut down.

37
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,910
I am asking you why you set foot in there.

38
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,620
Answer me at once.

39
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,500
His Majesty the King is present.

40
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,049
Premier. What is going on?

41
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,469
Your Majesty.

42
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,929
Last night, they broke into...

43
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,850
the Bureau of the Blind when it had already been shut down.

44
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,890
For that, I apprehended them.

45
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,230
What happened in the Bureau of the Blind?

46
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,819
Your Majesty. Why...

47
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,199
Your Majesty, Master Pung San was...

48
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,030
in the Bureau of the Blind's shrine.

49
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,540
How insolent. How dare a lowly girl like you...

50
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,750
address His Majesty without permission?

51
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,419
Numerous military officers had already searched...

52
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,919
every nook and corner of the capital,

53
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,670
but no one was able to find him.

54
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,800
Why would he show up in the Bureau of the Blind again?

55
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,380
However, I am certain it was him.

56
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,260
I gave them a task.

57
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,350
Your Majesty.

58
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,390
I ordered them to search the shrine discreetly.

59
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,310
They were simply following my order.

60
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,939
I see, Your Majesty.

61
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,860
You are dismissed, Premier.

62
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,910
All right. I shall take my leave then.

63
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,500
Dismiss the military officers.

64
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,500
You are all dismissed!

66
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,130
Yes.

67
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,140
My gosh, Yeo Ri. How did this happen?

68
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,510
Sang Deuk.

69
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,890
What on earth happened?

70
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,980
And what is the matter with him?

71
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,810
It was a trap.

72
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,769
I went to the shrine to find the identification tag...

73
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,110
of the Eight-feet Spirit.

74
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,359
But Master Pung San...

75
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,530
and the Eight-feet Spirit were at the shrine.

76
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,700
Your Majesty.

77
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,450
We finally figured it out...

78
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,700
who is behind Aguji and the Eight-feet Spirit.

79
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,790
It is Lord Kim Bong In.

80
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,970
Did you say...

81
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,010
Lord Kim Bong In?

82
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

83
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,560
That cannot be possible.

84
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,230
Why would the premier...

85
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,610
I am sure you are mistaken.

86
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,820
I wish...

87
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,990
I was mistaken too.

88
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,430
I do not believe it.

89
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,060
It simply cannot be.

90
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,939
Yeo Ri has been reliable so far.

91
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,570
But it is possible for her to be mistaken.

92
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,190
Do you not agree?

93
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,990
I am sure she also makes mistakes.

94
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,160
You are right, Your Majesty.

95
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,780
Yes.

96
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,750
Yeo Ri must be mistaken.

97
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,170
What is this?

98
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,920
The glasses-maker...

99
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,880
and Royal Scribe Yoon Gap are still alive.

100
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,050
What happened?

101
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,430
What?

102
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,850
How dare you?

103
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,770
The General of Heaven and Earth...

104
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,610
fulfilled his wish last night.

105
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,239
Fulfill his wish? What do you mean?

106
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,359
He swallowed a serpent's glowing pearl.

107
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,029
Therefore, he fully recovered from the damage...

108
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,619
Kang Chul inflicted on him...

109
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,500
and became more powerful than before as a result.

110
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,539
The General of Heaven and Earth...

111
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,500
is no longer just a Vengeful Spirit.

112
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,210
He has joined the ranks of deities.

113
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,610
Gap...

114
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,290
Did something happen?

115
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,340
I have been giving him only porridge lately.

116
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,010
Is it because he has no energy?

117
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,350
My gosh.

118
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,100
Hello.

119
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
Follow the premier discreetly.

120
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,080
- Come on. - Harder.

121
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,329
No!

122
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,460
Hold on.

123
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,130
That is not the right direction.

124
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,089
You must move it this way.

125
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,090
Yes. There you go.

126
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,760
Yes, that is it.

127
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,019
Haechi is a divine being,

128
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,900
known to quell the fire energy.

129
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,269
The statues of Haechi now stand...

130
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,940
in four corners, facing all directions.

131
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,400
I am certain it will be helpful.

132
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,409
While Yeo Ri and Royal Scribe Yoon Gap...

133
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,449
are out of the capital,

134
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,200
I will protect you from the Eight-feet Spirit.

135
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,090
But how come Royal Scribe Yoon is not here today?

136
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,420
Whenever you visited my mother,

137
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,550
he always played with me in the yard.

138
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,089
Royal Scribe Yoon is not feeling well.

139
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,220
So he did not come to the Palace today.

140
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,810
Still?

141
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,559
Should I send a physician for him?

142
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,110
No, Your Majesty.

143
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,360
He is not physically ill.

144
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
I see.

145
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,900
It must be his heart that is wounded grievously.

146
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,660
Did you say he lost an old friend?

147
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
Yes.

148
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,210
And the Eight-feet Spirit became even more wicked.

149
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
Yes.

150
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,670
We must hurry.

151
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,220
We will set out as soon as the sun rises tomorrow.

152
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,660
Your Majesty.

153
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,580
Are you all right?

154
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,630
Yes.

155
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,210
Yeo Ri.

156
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,970
Yes, Head Eunuch.

157
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,890
Well,

158
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,599
is his condition that bad?

159
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,269
I mean, Royal Scribe Yoon.

160
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,390
Yes. He is not feeling well.

161
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,940
I see.

162
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,479
Well, I do not mean anything by this.

163
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,820
I am still not happy with the way he behaves around His Majesty.

164
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,609
But what choice do I have?

165
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,079
His Majesty needs his help.

166
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,739
And sometimes, His Majesty even finds him entertaining.

167
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,080
That naturally makes me a little concerned about him.

168
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,750
I am not sure if I follow.

169
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,500
That brings me...

170
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,340
to this box.

171
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,470
I prepared yugwa for him.

172
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,600
I requested a skilled female chef...

173
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,309
from Saenggwabang to prepare this.

174
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,479
So here.

175
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,520
Sweet yugwa is the best remedy to console a heartache.

176
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,690
Thank you.

177
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,320
Royal Scribe Yoon will be very happy.

178
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,400
Yes. All right.

179
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,659
I have a lot of work to do. So excuse me.

180
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,279
Go on. All right?

181
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,620
Bye.

182
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,640
Gap.

183
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,730
Why are you not eating?

184
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,309
You have been complaining about the food lately.

185
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,729
I helped out at the banquet and they gave me food as payment.

186
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,030
Have some more.

187
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,900
I do not have an appetite.

188
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,320
Why do you not have...

189
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,450
- My gosh. - Hey.

190
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,080
Oh, no.

191
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,250
What is the matter with him?

192
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,090
Is it because we do not have any meat?

193
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,590
My gosh.

194
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,800
- Yes. - Please go ahead.

195
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,850
Gap.

196
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,020
Come here. Hurry.

197
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,120
Here. Go on.

198
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,660
I managed to get two eggs.

199
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,709
The monks do not approve of killing.

200
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,499
So it did not feel right to serve this with dinner.

201
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,130
I will give the other one to Yeo Ri. Go ahead, and eat it.

202
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,930
What is it? Is something on my face?

203
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,510
Quit looking at me, and eat the egg.

204
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,099
If you do not eat anything, you will pass out on the street.

205
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,390
You will have no energy.

206
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,900
I will eat this later.

207
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
No, eat it now.

208
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,700
My goodness. I wanted him to eat it now.

209
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,230
You asked me who recommended Pung San to me.

210
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,280
It was Prince Young In's nanny.

211
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,820
After the passing of the late king,

212
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,360
when I was struggling,

213
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,990
she recommended him to me and said he was trustworthy.

214
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,830
But after hearing what you said about Pung San,

215
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,210
I summoned her and pressed her to speak the truth.

216
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,670
She confessed that...

217
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,170
Lord Kim Bong In...

218
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,800
threatened her into recommending Pung San to me.

219
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,220
I was completely clueless.

220
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,310
I let him deceive me like that.

221
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,990
Your Majesty, how much longer must I wait for my punishment?

222
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,200
I am sure you know everything.

223
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,200
It was me...

224
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,290
who told Pung San...

225
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,540
the news of the Queen's pregnancy.

226
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,380
I am to blame...

227
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,920
for Prince Young In's death.

228
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,760
I am also to blame...

229
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,640
for Queen's...

230
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,850
Your Highness.

231
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,730
Thank you for telling me the truth.

232
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
Your Majesty.

233
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,560
I found it odd when the premier's bodyguard...

234
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,350
headed out late into the night, so I followed him.

235
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,360
Then I saw him meeting with Pung San's servant.

236
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,150
I tried to follow his servant and catch Pung San.

237
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,610
But I lost him while pursuing him.

238
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,570
I apologize.

239
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,080
What would you like to do, Your Majesty?

240
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,840
Tell the premier I would like to see him.

241
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,060
Your Majesty, the premier has arrived.

242
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,630
Your Majesty.

243
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,210
I heard you requested my presence.

244
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,850
Do you remember what it is?

245
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,350
This is...

246
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,860
a treasured item of the late king.

247
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,070
It is his quiver.

248
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,779
Yes. It is.

249
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,570
(A back-carried case for bows and arrows)

250
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,370
The quiver was soaked in blood due to the late king's madness.

251
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,160
You...

252
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,080
wiped the blood with the utmost care...

253
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,000
and broke in the leather.

254
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,800
Then you brought it to me.

255
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,840
How could I forget?

256
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,630
That day,

257
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,100
you fell into my arms...

258
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,680
and wept profusely...

259
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,310
like a child.

260
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,560
Yes.

261
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,650
The once-stained quiver was made clean...

262
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,320
as if it were your will to cleanse the dreadful memories...

263
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,110
once and for all.

264
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,830
It seemed like a promise that you would protect me...

265
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,040
for I was about to ascend the throne as the son of a mad king.

266
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,840
So it brought me relief.

267
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,890
But why did you do it?

268
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,720
I devoted my entire life to study...

269
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,690
the duties of a man...

270
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,230
and responsibilities of a king without rest.

271
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,860
You cloaked yourself in the voice of a benevolent grandfather...

272
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,700
and the face of a most loyal subject.

273
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,530
Yet, you murdered your son-in-law.

274
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,330
And to kill your grandson and great-grandson,

275
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,749
you allowed your monstrous intent to take over...

276
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,460
and even employed the evil spirit.

277
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,340
How do you expect me to deal with it?

278
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,340
How could anyone...

279
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,430
commit such deeds so foul and subhuman?

280
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,190
It is...

281
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,980
all because of you, Your Majesty.

282
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,070
What?

283
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,860
I have told you numerous times.

284
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,490
"Follow the laws of nature."

285
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,080
"Do not turn the nobility against you."

286
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,830
"Accept my blunt advice..."

287
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,960
"and rule the land as a docile king..."

288
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,290
"for the peace of future generations."

289
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,710
However, why did you not...

290
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,880
take my advice?

291
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,219
Premier.

292
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,140
Do you have evidence that I summoned the evil spirit?

293
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,310
You will never be able to find evidence to substantiate your claim.

294
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,400
You probably discovered that I had been working...

295
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,740
with the evil spirit through the shaman, Yeo Ri.

296
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,659
You will be disgraced as the king who supported shamanism.

297
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,619
See if you can sacrifice the girl...

298
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,290
to bring evidence to confirm your claim.

299
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,790
Even if you do so,

300
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,210
you will not have your way.

301
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,210
You ascended the throne...

302
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,549
as the son of a mad king,

303
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,090
so your legitimacy is questionable. Considering that,

304
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,890
how many of your subjects do you think will follow you?

305
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,650
I do not need any evidence.

306
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,310
Because...

307
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,640
you just confessed to everything all on your own.

308
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,480
Let them in.

309
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,790
Kim Bong In...

310
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,760
ordered the wicked blind shaman, Pung San,

311
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,380
to bring harm to the late king...

312
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,430
and even tried to harm the Queen and the royal offspring.

313
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,270
This is the gravest act of treason.

314
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,140
Strip him of his position immediately,

315
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,440
seize all of his family's assets,

316
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,020
and exile him to Geoje Island.

317
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,280
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

318
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,910
Why are you still standing there?

319
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,950
Drag this criminal out of the royal court at once.

320
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,580
You...

321
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,330
You...

322
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,130
How...

323
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,670
I...

324
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,650
Kang Chul is in so much pain.

325
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
I cannot force him to come.

326
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,030
What do I do?

327
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,420
Perhaps, I can talk to His Majesty, so we could leave without him.

328
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,170
Kang Chul.

329
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,350
We have a long way ahead of us. What took you so long?

330
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,600
I wondered if we should leave without you.

331
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,520
Are you out of your mind?

332
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,769
It will be mostly men going on this journey.

333
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,150
How could I let you go alone?

334
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,690
What?

335
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,410
You want me to blame and resent you to keep myself going?

336
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Do you think that is something I can do?

337
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,790
I may now understand the sense of loss...

338
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,620
you people endure even if it is in the slightest measure.

339
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,880
But that does not change who I am.

340
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,050
I am not as foolish as humans.

341
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,379
I know the rightful place where my blame and resentment...

342
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,720
should rest.

343
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,390
Then...

344
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,680
The Eight-feet Spirit.

345
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,640
I will crush him to pieces.

346
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,390
I cannot stand the fact that it has...

347
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,480
Bi Bi's glowing pearl.

348
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,949
- My gosh. - The vile man.

349
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,360
- Damn him. - How could he?

350
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,990
- He should rot forever. - He hurt his own.

351
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,290
Good riddance.

352
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,540
Who are you?

353
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,940
Aguji, you fool.

354
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,320
My goodness.

355
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,359
What brings you here...

356
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,689
this late at night?

357
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,699
Did you say the General of Heaven and Earth...

358
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,739
became more powerful?

359
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,450
Yes, I did.

360
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,619
Then have that ghost...

361
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,539
kill the king at once!

362
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,920
What? My lord master...

363
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,220
I told you already.

364
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,639
I do not know what he did,

365
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,600
but the General of Heaven and Earth cannot approach the king.

366
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,350
So if you bear with me a bit longer...

367
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,479
I am about to lose my own head.

368
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,859
How much longer must I wait?

369
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,399
- But... - Do not...

370
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,899
try to talk your way out of this.

371
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,989
Kill the king this instant!

372
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,740
This instant.

373
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,540
How dare you...

374
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,940
At one time I needed you.

375
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,230
But I do not anymore.

376
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,070
So...

377
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,780
I have no reason to put up with you.

378
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,240
You would dare to...

379
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,270
That is Yongdam Village.

380
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,650
What a strange connection this is.

381
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,900
Yongdam Village...

382
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,660
is where Yoon Gap and you, Yeo Ri, were born.

383
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:42,240
It is also where serpent Kang Chul tried to and failed to ascend.

384
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,410
The Eight-feet Spirit was also born here.

385
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,080
Yes.

386
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,750
It is too strange...

387
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,090
to call a coincidence.

388
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,010
I saw you.

389
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,550
A hundred years ago, on the day I was born.

390
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,760
I saw you fall to the ground.

391
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,720
So, how come...

392
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,350
you are attacking me and not them?

393
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,240
Head Eunuch. Go to Ducheong County's office...

394
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,070
and search the old records...

395
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,239
for anything useful.

396
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

397
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,930
Your Majesty.

398
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,690
I am honored you would visit...

399
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,020
my humble home.

400
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,030
It is so good to see you again.

401
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,700
Even though you left a short letter...

402
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,070
and abandoned your own King.

403
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,620
Your Majesty.

404
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,080
It is a joke. Just a joke.

405
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,960
I am traveling as my physician...

406
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,920
recommended I visit a hot spring.

407
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,299
Royal Scribe Yoon bragged about...

408
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,429
the beautiful scenery of his hometown,

409
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,970
I decided to make a stop.

410
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,720
I am glad you did.

411
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,430
Please come inside.

412
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,619
What is she up to?

413
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,370
Mak Geum and the butler's wife are watching her.

414
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,870
Do not worry.

415
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,589
Once His Majesty goes to sleep,

416
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,670
make them leave in secret.

417
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,550
I will send her to her mother's family.

418
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Yes, my lord.

419
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,730
What are you looking for?

420
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,190
I do not see the woman called In Seon.

421
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,070
Do you wonder where the woman who has a crush on you is?

422
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,570
You are overcome with jealousy again.

423
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,030
Do not worry.

424
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
You are one woman too many for me.

425
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,950
What?

426
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,789
We need Choi Won Woo to tell us...

427
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,580
about an ancestor from a century ago.

428
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,839
Is it not a good thing if someone in his family...

429
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,090
can show us a favor?

430
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,960
She could help us. That is why I was looking for her.

431
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,130
Yes, sure, of course.

432
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,180
Why not just ask where Lady In Seon is?

433
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,600
Excuse me.

434
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,389
Is Lady In Seon out somewhere?

435
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,190
I do not know.

436
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,320
Is that the last one?

437
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,570
Yes, this is the last one.

438
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,740
Those are all the records...

439
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,039
from the war from 100 years ago.

440
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,170
Almost everything got burned and people got dragged off.

441
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,090
We have almost no records left.

442
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,250
Is there anything other than these?

443
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,589
Did you not hear what I just said?

444
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,340
Almost nothing survived.

445
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,220
Wait.

446
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,560
Are you two really here with the King?

447
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,940
I am the Head Eunuch.

448
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,200
The Head Eunuch?

449
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,660
Oh, my gosh.

450
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,240
You are very high up, then.

451
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,789
What did you think I was, then?

452
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,409
- Just some eunuch... - "Some eunuch?"

453
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,670
I am so sorry. Do forgive me.

454
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,330
My lord.

455
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,550
The whole village is talking.

456
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,760
It is a big issue when the King visits this small county.

457
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,180
Now that I think about it,

458
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,510
the last time a King was here was 100 years ago.

459
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,730
What?

460
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:19,399
Another King visited Ducheong County?

461
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Yes.

462
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,979
It is a story told for generations like a legend.

463
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,569
During the war 100 years ago,

464
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,320
the King fled and ended up here is the gist of it.

465
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,700
I heard the story from my late grandfather.

466
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,500
The King during the war 100 years ago?

467
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,580
Do you mean Yeonjong the Great?

468
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,690
You must think highly of Royal Scribe Yoon, Your Majesty,

469
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,350
if you allow him to accompany you to the hot spring.

470
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,190
He is more loyal than any other, is well-learned,

471
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,610
and every single movement...

472
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,280
is greatly courteous and proper.

473
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,740
How could I not value him?

474
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,159
Your Majesty. You flatter me,

475
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,210
and I do not know how to respond.

476
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,879
You knew exactly how to speak...

477
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,840
and you acted the way you did until now?

478
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,760
Pardon?

479
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,470
It is nothing.

480
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,520
Your great-great-grandfather Lord Choi Gil Sang.

481
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,150
Since I am here,

482
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,069
would you permit me to read some of his writings...

483
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,950
seeing he was a great scholar?

484
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
Well...

485
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,700
My great-great-grandfather left behind a great many books.

486
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,080
Which one are you interested in?

487
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,999
I heard Lord Choi Gil Sang guarded the procession...

488
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,249
of Yeonjong the Great...

489
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,920
when the northern barbarians attacked 100 years ago.

490
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,760
Could you show me something he wrote then?

491
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,470
I see...

492
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,350
you did not visit to enjoy the scenery.

493
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,159
This wench's father took away my leg...

494
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,250
and ended my life too.

495
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,380
I am sure I chased away...

496
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,250
that One-legged Spirit.

497
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,130
Did it come back?

498
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,720
I feel the energy but do not see it.

499
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,680
My lady. Oh, no!

500
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,849
- My lady! - My lady!

501
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,940
Leave me alone!

502
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,599
No, my lady!

503
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,860
- You cannot go! - Release me!

504
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,109
Oh, my gosh.

505
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,650
My lady!

506
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,739
Oh, dear.

507
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,410
The One-legged Spirit possessed her again?

508
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,660
Oh, my goodness. My lady!

509
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,000
My great-great-grandfather left behind many writings,

510
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,460
but he did not leave any records...

511
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,090
about the war from 100 years ago.

512
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,340
Did he not?

513
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,430
Who goes there?

514
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,560
Step aside!

515
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,150
Stop!

516
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,740
This is my daughter.

517
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,700
She is gravely ill.

518
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,740
Please...

519
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,039
- My lady! - Oh, my lady.

520
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,250
Oh, my gosh! My lady!

521
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,800
We have not met in a while.

522
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,630
Let go!

523
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,389
You angered the spirits.

524
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,389
(To anger spirits by breaking a taboo)

525
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,440
"Angered the spirits?"

526
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,769
Something went wrong...

527
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,030
and a Vengeful Spirit possessed your daughter.

528
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,940
What on earth happened?

529
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,660
You got in my way once before.

530
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,159
Must you do this again?

531
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,080
You will pay for it!

532
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,410
What did you do?

533
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,710
You must tell me if we are to heal her.

534
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,090
She could lose her life if we do not do anything.

535
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,300
We were told one of our lord's ancestors...

536
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,510
were angry.

537
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,930
Who told you that?

538
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,440
Dang Gol, the shaman from the next village.

539
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,850
So you held...

540
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,230
a ritual to calm the ancestors?

541
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,910
Our lord...

542
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,700
had no choice.

543
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:27,080
So many strange things had been happening to him.

544
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,000
But the day after we held the ritual to calm his ancestors,

545
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,830
our Lady In Seon...

546
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,130
ended up the way she is now.

547
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,170
That shaman was mistaken.

548
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,130
This is not about the ancestors.

549
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,010
It is a Vengeful Spirit.

550
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,810
A man who lost a leg became...

551
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,140
a One-legged Spirit.

552
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,110
A man...

553
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,400
who lost a leg?

554
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,150
You killed me!

555
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,150
You fool!

556
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,450
You did this to my leg!

557
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,750
In Seon...

558
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,080
Is that true?

559
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,390
I asked if it was true.

560
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,580
I did not mean to kill him at first.

561
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,250
Who is the man you killed?

562
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:59,669
He was a book broker called Jang Eon Soo.

563
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,799
(Book brokers brokered book sales)

564
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,920
A book broker?

565
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,759
He stole books we considered family treasures,

566
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,050
and I meant to teach him a lesson.

567
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,930
I went too far and...

568
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,930
He lost his life.

569
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,980
When was that?

570
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
That was...

571
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,980
five years ago, Your Majesty.

572
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,190
Five years ago?

573
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,860
That corresponds with...

574
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,580
the time you resigned from your office...

575
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,620
and returned home.

576
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,420
Let us save your daughter first.

577
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,130
It will not be too late...

578
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,140
to charge you with murder afterwards.

579
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,850
Your Majesty.

580
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,940
Your Majesty.

581
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,200
I searched through all the records from the government office,

582
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:12,120
but I found nothing special about the war from 100 years ago.

583
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,950
However,

584
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,870
I did hear something strange.

585
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,290
What is that?

586
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,920
A century ago, Yeonjong the Great...

587
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,969
fled to Yongdam Village...

588
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,550
during the war.

589
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,680
What?

590
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,889
There were no records about that,

591
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,600
but there is a legend-like story that the locals tell.

592
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,940
Broken pieces of the story are coming together.

593
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,820
Something happened between that King Yeonjong...

594
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,700
and the Eight-feet Spirit here in Yongdam Village.

595
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,910
The book broker Jang Eon Soo...

596
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,950
will have the remaining pieces of the story.

597
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,539
- Jang Eon Soo? - The spirit that possessed...

598
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,040
Lord Choi's daughter?

599
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,670
Did you not feel it earlier?

600
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,460
Choi Won Woo was hiding something.

601
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,510
It will be among the books that the book broker stole.

602
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,969
Where are you going?

603
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,220
Why would you care...

604
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,930
I am leaving to do what Yeo Ri asked.

605
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,930
Yeo Ri did not ask you to do anything.

606
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,190
How dare that fool...

607
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,020
My goodness.

608
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,210
Drink some water too. Your throat must be so dry.

609
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:42,710
Here.

610
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,430
Did Yeo Ri not tell you?

611
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,599
Those were made by a maid...

612
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,680
from the Saenggwabang known for her cooking skills.

613
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,019
She gave me some only because I asked.

614
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,060
Her desserts taste better than even the Head Cook's.

615
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,440
Since it is so good, you should have one too.

616
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,750
You see,

617
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,300
I lost my sister when I was little too.

618
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,179
My family was extremely poor,

619
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,640
so she could never even take medicine before she died.

620
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,229
I could not let my other siblings end up like her,

621
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,440
so I volunteered to become a eunuch.

622
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,020
How do humans cope when they lose someone dear to them?

623
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,360
Well, you know. We have regrets and beat ourselves up.

624
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,070
And we miss them too.

625
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:01,370
I did all of that and one day realized so much time had passed.

626
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,960
This is so tasty.

627
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,650
It is the Hour of the Mouse now.

628
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,700
Are you sure we can save her like this?

629
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,410
We will try it and see.

630
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,710
(Fire)

631
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:55,170
(Fire)

632
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:07,060
(Water)

633
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:16,490
(Water)

634
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,930
(Fire)

635
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,390
This is supposed to...

636
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,850
right the wrong.

637
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,440
(Water)

638
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,570
(Fire)

639
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,780
(Water)

640
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,010
Oh, no.

641
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:29,770
My lady.

642
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,110
You little witch. You got in my way, yet again.

643
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,110
You will pay for this!

644
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,550
Are you all right?

645
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,760
- Behind you. - What?

646
00:47:59,761 --> 00:48:00,880
- Behind you! - Behind me?

647
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,890
We ought to catch him.

648
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:10,020
That thatched fool.

649
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,230
That fool is such a nuisance.

650
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,030
My goodness.

651
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,460
You little...

652
00:48:38,461 --> 00:48:40,210
Wait, hold on.

653
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,930
No, not yet.

654
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,060
You may slay me with your sword...

655
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,980
or lock me up in that coffer forever.

656
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:57,520
Just let me...

657
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,690
take my revenge on that old man before I go.

658
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,820
You already gave him and his daughter such a hard time.

659
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,449
How could you still say that?

660
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,320
How exactly do you plan to get your revenge?

661
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:09,740
The very thing...

662
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,410
he has been fearing the most.

663
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,630
Having that book revealed to the whole world.

664
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,459
The royal family's shocking secrets are recorded in that book,

665
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,170
and I want that book to be revealed to the whole world.

666
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,430
That is how I will get my revenge.

667
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,930
What is this book that everyone is making so much fuss over?

668
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,520
It is a profound book.

669
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,140
It is about a king who ruled this land a hundred years ago...

670
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,690
and a military official.

671
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:55,500
How did it go?

672
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,210
Did you take care of that ghost?

673
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,960
Yes, we caught that one-legged spirit.

674
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,840
He has been persistently harassing me.

675
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,100
I suppose he is now gone.

676
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,850
Yes.

677
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,140
However, he said something strange.

678
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,809
Something strange?

679
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,360
He said...

680
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,230
he hid "that book" in the spot where he died.

681
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,530
Do you perhaps know what that means?

682
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,910
As Lord Choi mentioned earlier,

683
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,000
that man was a book broker who stole precious books from his family.

684
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,170
It must be one of those books he stole.

685
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,590
Right, Lord Choi?

686
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,170
Your Majesty.

687
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,510
He died while being flogged in this yard.

688
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,470
It is impossible to hide a book here.

689
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,180
Is that so?

690
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:54,510
A ghost's words are not to be trusted.

691
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,810
I am certain he was telling a lie.

692
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,279
A few months ago,

693
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,200
you sold me all the books you did not need anymore.

694
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,120
I do not know how this book ended up in that pile,

695
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,580
but I believe it is not something I was supposed to see.

696
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,250
It is an old book. It must be almost 100 years old.

697
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,630
Now, you are looking at me.

698
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:07,749
Yes.

699
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,880
"The Gwangam Chronicles." That is the book.

700
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,799
It is very well-written,

701
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,680
but the stories in it are truly shocking.

702
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,349
The royal family's secrets are recorded in the book.

703
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,979
If this book is revealed to the world,

704
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,230
it will be such a disgrace to you and your family.

705
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,190
That book.

706
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:29,650
Where is it now?

707
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,740
Hand it over at once.

708
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,240
Goodness. He said to wait here. Where is he?

709
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,840
(Gwangam Chronicles)

710
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:37,680
My lord, you are here.

711
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:41,180
So? Did you bring the money?

712
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,030
I know it is 200 nyang,

713
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,530
but it does not weigh as much as I thought.

714
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,700
- What did you say? - I am truly sorry.

715
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,370
I forgot to bring the book.

716
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,790
I will be sure to bring it next time.

717
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:10,209
Please bring 300 nyang next time.

718
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:11,210
Why, you...

719
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,090
You should spend that much to protect your family's honor.

720
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:19,549
You.

721
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:20,720
You scoundrel.

722
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,680
How dare you try to mess with my family?

723
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,890
Do not do this.

724
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,650
How dare you.

725
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:49,120
You have until tomorrow. Bring 300 nyang.

726
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,750
You deserve to be beaten to death!

727
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,260
You are a mere book broker.

728
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,150
Darn it.

729
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,700
Darn you...

730
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,490
All this time, I had no idea it was here.

731
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,620
("Gwangam Chronicles")

732
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,419
("Gwangam Chronicles")

733
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,430
Great-great-grandfather, I apologize for this.

734
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,760
I ought to do this to save the family.

735
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:22,900
Oh, no. It is hot!

736
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,530
This... What is this?

737
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,660
- What are you doing? - Goodness.

738
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,700
What is this?

739
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,950
The book is ruined.

740
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,289
Well, the pages inside are fine, though.

741
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,750
What do you think you are doing?

742
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,249
- Hand it over at once. - I refuse.

743
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:41,710
Such insolence!

744
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,470
Hand it over, now!

745
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,800
Why, you...

746
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:49,550
Your Majesty.

747
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,560
Everything is in this book.

748
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,820
("Gwangam Chronicles")

749
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,070
Including how the Eight-feet Spirit came into being.

750
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:23,090
With your permission, I seek to summon the spirit.

751
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,300
With your permission, I seek to summon the spirit.

752
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,640
Go ahead and see if you can take me down.

753
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:34,310
I will never let you bring me down.

754
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,230
I will never succumb to you.

755
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,230
I will look you in the eye...

756
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,900
and take you on.

757
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,410
You will never...

758
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,410
defeat me.

759
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:26,750
The General of Heaven and Earth!

760
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,750
(The Haunted Palace)

761
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,839
Is everything in this book really true?

762
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,670
Back then, it was like being trapped in purgatory here.

763
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,009
The Eight-feet Spirit was born...

764
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:16,640
out of the resentment of the people in Yongdam Village 100 years ago.

765
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,560
The prince's chambers.

766
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:21,930
Royal Scribe Yoon?

767
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:23,430
It makes no sense.

768
01:01:23,431 --> 01:01:25,309
Why let go of the spirit so easily?

769
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:26,860
On purpose? But why?

770
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:28,440
I lost everything.

771
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,570
That made me even more resentful.

772
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:34,570
Just take down Royal Scribe Yoon Gap.

773
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,530
At this rate, I may not be able to protect Yeo Ri.
