00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,580
(Yuk Seong Jae)

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,860
(Kim Ji Yeon)

3
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,060
(Kim Ji Hoon)

4
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,479
(The Haunted Palace)

5
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,079
(All places, organizations, characters, )

6
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,679
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,350
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,620
But this is odd.

9
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,490
I see nothing.

10
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,590
Because of the sacred rope,

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,630
it cannot leave this spot.

12
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,730
The sacred rope...

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,370
It broke.

14
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,930
What?

15
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,210
Then where is the Eight-feet Spirit?

16
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,590
There it is.

17
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,320
The Eight-feet Spirit.

18
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,930
Because I brought the warding stone,

19
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,330
the Eight-feet Spirit possessed the King's body.

20
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,610
The prince is unharmed.

21
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,910
Is it your wish to die before him?

22
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,380
Step aside.

23
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,810
Your Majesty.

24
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,040
Who is behind the Eight-feet Spirit?

25
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,080
Who on earth could it be that he is unbelievably strong?

26
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,750
My lord, when did His Majesty...

27
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,080
learn such swordsmanship?

28
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,960
No!

29
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,850
You...

30
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,550
You are not human.

31
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,250
Your Majesty.

32
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,680
Are you all right?

33
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,280
Your Majesty.

34
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,820
What on earth...

35
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,590
Your Majesty.

36
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,139
To the east stands the Divine General of the Blue Emperor.

37
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,140
To the west stands the Divine General of the White Emperor.

38
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
To the south stands the Divine General of the Red Emperor.

39
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:10,310
To the north stands the Divine General of the Black Emperor.

40
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,779
To the center stands the Divine General of the Yellow Emperor.

41
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,810
With the generals' blessing, I issue this command.

42
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,040
General of Heaven and Earth...

43
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,310
Why...

44
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,050
Bow your head and surrender yourself.

45
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,840
(Episode 4: The Shining Gem of the Night)

46
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,990
He has fainted temporarily.

47
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,760
But his pulse is normal.

48
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,660
He will wake up soon.

49
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,960
How is his physical condition then?

50
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,199
Has he suffered any injuries?

51
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,400
No. He is unharmed.

52
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,610
You may leave.

53
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,010
Yes, Your Highness.

54
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,780
Explain it now.

55
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,520
What happened?

56
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,060
I apologize, Your Highness.

57
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,260
I failed...

58
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,990
to grasp what I witnessed.

59
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,830
I just could not...

60
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,300
Your Majesty!

61
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,740
The royal physician said you should not be walking like this.

62
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,240
Your Majesty.

63
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,970
Your Majesty.

64
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,940
Bite down.

65
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,080
What?

66
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,710
The arrow must be removed.

67
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,450
Wait.

68
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,950
I am already in pain.

69
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,079
You will just remove the arrow?

70
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,149
You acted all high and mighty, calling yourself a great deity.

71
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,190
Are you scared now?

72
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,390
Scared? Who said I was scared?

73
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,830
It is only because I happen to be stuck in this weak body...

74
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
You...

75
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,270
My gosh. I will stop the bleeding. Stay still.

76
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,710
- It hurts as if it is burning. - Good grief.

77
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,540
What?

78
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,080
What are you doing?

79
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,040
This should be enough to stop the bleeding.

80
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,940
In the end,

81
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,110
I get to use this on Scribe Yoon's body.

82
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,370
Hold it there.

83
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,570
I did not know her hands...

84
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,530
could carry such gentleness and warmth.

85
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,250
There it goes again.

86
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,450
Why is his heart pounding so intensely?

87
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,120
That good-for-nothing man, Yoon Gap.

88
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,619
How is it that...

89
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,390
nothing in his body seems to be working properly?

90
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,210
What was that?

91
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,680
I was treating you. Why push me away with a disgusted look on your face?

92
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,650
I was startled because you were so close.

93
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,379
How absurd. How could I try...

94
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,820
to stop the bleeding while staying away from you?

95
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,990
Listen. So the Eight-feet Spirit...

96
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,690
will not come near for a while...

97
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,120
as the internal damage is too severe.

98
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,260
But it will be back.

99
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,160
We must leave before its return.

100
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,900
I will not leave. If you wish to leave, go without me.

101
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,100
What do you plan to do here?

102
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,970
Will you let the Eight-feet Spirit claim your body?

103
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,210
You saw yourself how nasty that Vengeful Spirit was.

104
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,609
Anyone who wrongs it...

105
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,050
will not be able to get away with it.

106
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,280
You have become a target now.

107
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,450
Do you plan on staying here?

108
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,520
So...

109
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,149
you want me to feign ignorance and run away just to save myself?

110
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,690
Yoon Gap used you.

111
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,160
Are you willing to die for someone like him?

112
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,460
Are you truly that foolish?

113
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,470
He was the first person...

114
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,410
to tell me it was not my fault.

115
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,280
He was the first one.

116
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,350
When the floods came,

117
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,590
the draught struck, the plague spread,

118
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,360
or even when my grandmother passed away,

119
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,630
everyone blamed me for such disasters.

120
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,200
But only he told me it was not my fault.

121
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,340
Only then was I relieved to breathe.

122
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,940
When I took a breath,

123
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,310
I did not feel a pang of guilt for the first time in my life.

124
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,249
I was able to endure those difficult years thanks to him.

125
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,980
I barely managed to go on with my life.

126
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,019
But he died in vain because he chose to be near...

127
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,280
a cursed girl like me.

128
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,920
Then he was claimed by an evil spirit too.

129
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,760
Do you still want me to look the other way?

130
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,430
I cannot do so. I cannot run away by myself.

131
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,030
My heart will rot away in devastation once again.

132
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,930
I cannot endure that a second time.

133
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
What...

134
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,470
- Your Majesty. - I saw it with my own eyes.

135
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,370
You are not Yoon Gap.

136
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,980
Who are you?

137
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,830
Gwang.

138
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,370
Are you awake?

139
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,140
Can you recognize me?

140
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,740
Mother.

141
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,040
Yes.

142
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,250
It is I, your mother.

143
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,050
Father...

144
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,860
I must see Father.

145
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,630
Answer me.

146
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,400
Who are you?

147
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,030
I risked my life to save you.

148
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,140
Is this how you repay me for my help?

149
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,500
- What? - Yoon Gap is dead.

150
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,739
He was killed by the underlings of Kwak Sang Chung...

151
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,810
whom I saw this afternoon.

152
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,550
As this body will be of no use anyway,

153
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,850
I am simply using it for the time being.

154
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,150
Nonsense. That is absurd.

155
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,350
Tell me the truth!

156
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,790
- Your Majesty. - What are you doing?

157
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,220
Your Majesty, please spare him.

158
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,460
Step aside.

159
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,600
He had the audacity to lay his hand on my son.

160
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,000
He tried to bring harm to the royal bloodline!

161
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,670
No, Your Majesty. It is a misunderstanding.

162
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,800
He was the one who saved the prince...

163
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,140
when his life was in danger.

164
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,750
She is telling the truth.

165
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,820
Gwang.

166
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,430
Father.

167
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,560
I beg of you not to punish them.

168
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,570
They are the ones who saved my life.

169
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,370
Gwang.

170
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,780
Are you all right?

171
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,850
Yes.

172
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,120
An evil spirit had lodged itself within my body...

173
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,150
and tormented me without end.

174
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,790
And they chased it away.

175
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,700
An evil spirit?

176
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,510
I released them both as per your command.

177
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,580
But is that still your command?

178
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,720
He committed an unspeakable act against the prince.

179
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,790
He also wielded his dagger at you.

180
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,890
How did I look...

181
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,230
when I was dueling with him?

182
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,430
Please forgive me for saying so,

183
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,470
but you did not look like your normal self.

184
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,870
Just like when my son fell ill?

185
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,780
I do not have...

186
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,590
any memory of dueling with him.

187
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,360
Your Majesty.

188
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,920
Your Majesty.

189
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,240
Just like Kang Chul said,

190
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,570
the Eight-feet Spirit will return.

191
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,810
But...

192
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,050
I am not certain if I can defeat the Eight-feet Spirit on my own.

193
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,950
Kang Chul. What is wrong?

194
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,790
Did you bleed too much earlier?

195
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,230
- Water... - Water?

196
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,300
Are you thirsty? Should I fetch some water?

197
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,830
Shoot.

198
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580
Right.

199
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,820
He was a serpent after all. The emperor of the fresh water.

200
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,920
Dealing with such a nasty evil spirit...

201
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,860
could not have been easy even for the powerful Kang Chul.

202
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,800
I finally feel myself again.

203
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,120
Darn it. This is embarrassing.

204
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,360
A mere evil spirit caused me to lose face in front of her.

205
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,630
What a disgrace.

206
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,230
Is what you said true?

207
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,870
You were not the one who killed Scribe Yoon?

208
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,210
You can have my body.

209
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,580
Did you not hear me?

210
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,750
You can have my body.

211
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,190
Yes.

212
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,860
It is something you wanted for a long time,

213
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,190
and I shall let you have it.

214
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,500
I will accept you as the guardian spirit...

215
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,300
and faithfully serve you.

216
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,030
Until the day you ascend as the dragon,

217
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,870
I will pray diligently too.

218
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,310
What is the catch?

219
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,110
You were right.

220
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,610
I tried,

221
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,820
but I cannot defeat the Eight-feet Spirit alone.

222
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,119
I thought I would somehow find a way...

223
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,750
by stealing the King's warding stone.

224
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,060
But I was wrong.

225
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,160
I, without a guardian spirit, could not be a match...

226
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,960
to the Eight-feet Spirit.

227
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,630
But with your help, I may be able to do it.

228
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,740
When you and I worked together,

229
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,570
we were able to chase away that frightening Eight-feet Spirit.

230
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,570
So...

231
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,779
you want me to deal with him again?

232
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,650
Thanks to you, I was able to stay alive today.

233
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,080
But that does not mean...

234
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,950
I have let go of my anger and hatred toward you.

235
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,620
But...

236
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,960
I will do everything you tell me to do.

237
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,090
You name whatever you want, and I shall do it.

238
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,830
So...

239
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,530
please save Royal Scribe Yoon.

240
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,839
I have been begging you to allow me...

241
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,540
to possess your body for 13 years.

242
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,580
But now,

243
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,950
you are more than eager to accept me...

244
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,450
just to save him?

245
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,390
Hey, Kang Chul!

246
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,870
"Jeokseonjiga pilyuyeogyeong."

247
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,010
It means a family of noble deeds will certainly be blessed...

248
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,510
with many days of happiness and prosperity.

249
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,180
That is correct. Nicely done.

250
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,250
Then do you know where the quote came from?

251
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,120
I...

252
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,560
do not know.

253
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,299
The commentary...

254
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,729
from "Book of Changes" on Kun Hexagram...

255
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,300
is followed by this quote.

256
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,029
"A family of noble deeds..."

257
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,970
"is bound to receive lasting blessings."

258
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,740
"A family of evil deeds..."

259
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,240
"is bound to receive lasting disasters."

260
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,040
Your Majesty, you are too strict.

261
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,980
I clearly remember my younger days.

262
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,949
When I was his age,

263
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,990
you were ever so strict with me.

264
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,020
But it seems to me...

265
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,090
your strict nature has vanished before your great-grandson.

266
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,630
Was I that strict with you, Your Majesty?

267
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,410
His measurements have increased compared to two months ago.

268
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,990
Even in his illness, he continued to grow.

269
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,320
Yes.

270
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,160
Her Highness the Dowager Queen is present.

271
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,770
Welcome, Your Highness.

272
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,149
When I heard the news of his complete recovery,

273
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,920
I could not wait to pay my visit.

274
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,220
Is he truly all cured?

275
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,860
Yes, he is, Your Highness.

276
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,130
I apologize for causing concern.

277
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,430
I am so relieved.

278
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,330
Gwang. Come to me.

279
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,040
Sit next to me.

280
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,980
The smell has gone.

281
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,320
His eyes look different.

282
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,330
It has disappeared?

283
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,330
So suddenly?

284
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,360
How?

285
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,280
What happened?

286
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,540
What on earth happened?

287
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,810
Your Highness.

288
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,450
There is something in the Palace.

289
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,680
There is something?

290
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,789
What is that?

291
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,660
I do not know yet.

292
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,660
It disrupted my chant...

293
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,960
and insulted you.

294
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,690
That spirit...

295
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,059
suffered an internal injury.

296
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,330
What are you talking about?

297
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,069
During the former King's reign, yes,

298
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,500
but no one does a purging ritual now.

299
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,140
Before, when I chanted alone in your chambers,

300
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,210
I felt a formidable great energy.

301
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,710
But do not worry.

302
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,710
I will summon the spirit again...

303
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,380
and get rid of the prince for good.

304
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,990
No.

305
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,990
Leave it.

306
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,130
Your Highness.

307
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,030
Because I resented the King so much,

308
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,499
and to protect Prince Young In,

309
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
I tried to use that spirit for a while.

310
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,470
I do not wish to face it again.

311
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,570
That horrible smell.

312
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,680
I do not wish to sense it again.

313
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,160
It is Prince Young In's undershirt.

314
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,690
Say a chant to chase all spirits.

315
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,490
So that...

316
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,900
the spirit I summoned will stay away from him.

317
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,930
Do you understand?

318
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,670
Yes.

319
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,370
One can never accomplish much by working with a woman.

320
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,160
Her eyes were full of terror,

321
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,870
but the way she talked down to me...

322
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,570
How does she expect...

323
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,770
to put her son on the throne?

324
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,649
Oh, my gosh, no.

325
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,720
Please no.

326
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,390
General of Heaven and Earth.

327
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,360
No! Not that!

328
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,230
You cannot sleep forever. Get up.

329
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,469
You slept for two days straight.

330
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,870
Your back must be sore.

331
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,870
Will you get up already?

332
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,520
Did you shake me with your foot?

333
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:42,249
Just two days ago, you said I could be your guardian spirit.

334
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,020
How dare you treat your guardian spirit like that?

335
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,630
You are not my guardian spirit yet.

336
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,530
You did not give an answer.

337
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,300
I went on my knees,

338
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,830
and you ignored me.

339
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,970
Who cares about your knees?

340
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,900
Did your grandmother teach you nothing?

341
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,310
When a shaman welcomes a guardian spirit into their body,

342
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,140
there must be offerings prepared with care.

343
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,440
You have nothing...

344
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,010
Pumpkin taffy is good, right?

345
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,610
I just bought it.

346
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,509
If you become my guardian spirit,

347
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,420
I will buy you this every day.

348
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,759
Is that how little you think of Kang Chul?

349
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,690
You will offer me plain taffy?

350
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,290
What, then?

351
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,499
Do I need to set out offerings as if I were doing a ritual?

352
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,760
That is a given.

353
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,070
What else do you want?

354
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,640
- A five-colored bracelet. - What?

355
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,569
Are you deaf? I want a five-colored bracelet.

356
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,639
(It's made to wish for good health and a long life.)

357
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,009
Make me a lovely five-colored bracelet...

358
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,010
with all the care you can muster.

359
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,180
Why would you need a five-colored bracelet?

360
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,989
You lived for over a thousand years.

361
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,789
How much longer do you want to live?

362
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,850
Come on.

363
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,820
Do as you are told and make one for me.

364
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,730
I will watch and see how much care you put into it.

365
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,830
Yes.

366
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,270
I want this pumpkin taffy every day.

367
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,140
Offered with lots of care.

368
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,080
I would love to smack him on the head.

369
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,350
Darn him.

370
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
What?

371
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,320
I am being petitioned to correct our customs?

372
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,619
Last year, I had Hanseongbu...

373
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,989
send all the shamans...

374
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,960
far outside the capital.

375
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,620
Who would dare make such a petition again?

376
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,230
A few days ago on Mount Bugak,

377
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,100
traces of a purging ritual were found.

378
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,630
Did you say Mount Bugak?

379
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,340
Did you check?

380
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,540
Yes. It was that very place.

381
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,280
What do you mean?

382
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,380
You said you cleaned the site on Mount Bugak.

383
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,450
We did clear the area so not a piece of straw was left.

384
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,590
It looks like that child...

385
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,190
did another ritual since then.

386
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,300
Bring in Yoon Gap and the girl called Yeo Ri.

387
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,730
Immediately!

388
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,030
(Gangnyeongjeon)

389
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,310
I do not believe this.

390
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,810
Why does he need this?

391
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,410
He comes up with ideas just to torment me.

392
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,450
Do not make it, then.

393
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,020
You should not be here doing this.

394
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,420
You should be running away at full speed.

395
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,490
You look...

396
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,789
prettier than before.

397
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,960
Thanks to you.

398
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,570
Being less resentful is bringing out the real me.

399
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,440
That is not the problem.

400
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:26,280
Do you know how many souls the Eight-feet Spirit swallowed?

401
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,079
I freeze in fear when I so much as...

402
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,410
feel it from a distance.

403
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,680
Do you not fear the Eight-feet Spirit?

404
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,450
I do.

405
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,160
I came across all sorts of spirits,

406
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,290
but I have never met such a scary one.

407
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,630
I also...

408
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,900
am scared to death of it.

409
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,830
Why are you doing this, then?

410
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,900
To save a man?

411
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,150
Hey, Yeo Ri.

412
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,080
Give me that. I will do it.

413
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,850
I want to pay for my keep.

414
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,550
You do not have to.

415
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,890
These fancy glasses you made me.

416
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,190
They are worth 3 meals a day for 10 years.

417
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,429
They make sewing so much easier.

418
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,460
That is a gift, not pay for my keep.

419
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,230
Gosh. You say the sweetest things.

420
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,969
All right. I should go and prepare your next meal.

421
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:28,970
Thank you.

422
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,880
Make me some chive jeon while you are at it.

423
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,980
You use the cheapest ingredients,

424
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,290
but your cooking is quite decent.

425
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,290
Yes, my lord. I will cook that for you.

426
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,560
You should learn to be like her.

427
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,060
At first, I thought she was a common thug,

428
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,100
but now she sees how great I am and treats me with respect.

429
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,070
What are you doing?

430
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:03,409
Make yourself useful and chop some firewood...

431
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,909
or bring some water.

432
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,540
All you do is lie about demanding this and that.

433
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,850
Do you think she is your slave?

434
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,119
Oh, right. You were shot by an arrow.

435
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,920
- Are you all right? - Leave me alone.

436
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,590
Wait.

437
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,929
Why are your shoes so dirty when you stay at home...

438
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,230
doing nothing?

439
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,830
Did you sneak out last night?

440
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,640
They were always dirty.

441
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,410
Drag them out immediately!

442
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,580
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

443
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,780
What is the matter, officer?

444
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,970
Your Majesty. You forgave us for what happened that day.

445
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,170
Why are you doing this to us?

446
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,710
Yes, I forgave you.

447
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,910
That was my mistake.

448
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,030
These shamanic tools were found last night.

449
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,970
On that spot on Mount Bugak.

450
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,769
What?

451
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,740
You cured my son the prince.

452
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,809
I cannot deny that.

453
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,410
I acknowledged your service...

454
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,580
and forgave you for breaking the law.

455
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,820
And yet you dared to break it again?

456
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,890
These are not mine.

457
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,790
I did not do anything.

458
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,419
I should not...

459
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,460
have made an exception for my son's sake.

460
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,930
The law says shamans cannot enter the capital.

461
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,570
Strip Yoon Gap of his title...

462
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,570
and kick them both out of the capital!

463
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,070
The Eight-feet Spirit.

464
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,310
The Eight-feet Spirit will return.

465
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,990
Your Majesty. Do you not see it?

466
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,860
The spirit is not just after the young prince.

467
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,560
He is after you just as much.

468
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,270
The spirit...

469
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,970
has a long-standing grudge against the royal family.

470
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,740
We were lucky enough to avoid it this time,

471
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,210
but the Eight-feet Spirit...

472
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,870
will find a way...

473
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,540
to possess both you and the prince.

474
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,730
What will you do now?

475
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,400
To save your son,

476
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,140
will you break the law...

477
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,000
you think so highly of?

478
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,110
Yes. You will feel torn.

479
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,410
You acted like you were better than most for being King.

480
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,550
But in the end,

481
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,280
you also are a mere human.

482
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,990
Your Majesty.

483
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,490
Send them both away from the capital.

484
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,360
Your Majesty.

485
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,000
Your Majesty!

486
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:25,200
That will be enough for you to settle down somewhere.

487
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,340
Officer.

488
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Do not...

489
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,970
return to the capital.

490
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,440
Wait, sir.

491
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,380
Give His Majesty a message.

492
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,350
His glasses.

493
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,520
He must always keep them on his person.

494
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,490
Only that warding stone...

495
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,790
will protect him from the Eight-feet Spirit.

496
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,940
What? He kicked us out with just this much?

497
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,610
The King is the stingiest ever.

498
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,810
Are you not angry at all?

499
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,810
How could he kick us out like this?

500
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,049
That is the law, he said.

501
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,050
We have no choice.

502
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,520
This is wrong. I did not do it.

503
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,520
There was no trace of a ritual when I was there.

504
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,730
Who on earth did it?

505
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,420
We cannot...

506
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,390
go near the capital anymore.

507
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,520
We have no choice.

508
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,460
Is there anywhere you would like to go?

509
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,260
Mount Geumgang is quite beautiful.

510
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,760
How about going there?

511
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,970
Or how about we travel further and visit Qing?

512
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,940
Mount Naebul.

513
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,200
What? Where?

514
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,239
I will go to Mount Naebul.

515
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,040
Mount Naebul...

516
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,340
Are you going to...

517
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,150
Yes. I will go to Monk Gaseop.

518
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,380
My grandmother's tools are resting there.

519
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,250
I need real, potent tools.

520
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,790
I do not understand how the King had that warding stone.

521
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:29,060
Monk Gaseop must know something.

522
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,990
You have not given up yet?

523
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,359
We cannot enter the capital.

524
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,029
This has nothing to do with you now.

525
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,270
You said...

526
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,970
the Eight-feet Spirit always comes after...

527
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,770
someone who attacked it.

528
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,170
You said I was its target now.

529
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,510
It is for the better.

530
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,110
If it tries to kill me,

531
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,780
I will take it with me...

532
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,250
and save Young Master Yoon.

533
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,020
Go on your way if you do not want a part.

534
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,460
I will do it on my own.

535
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,140
Your Highness.

536
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,320
You did not attend the royal academy.

537
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,420
Were you here like this all along?

538
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,320
Mother.

539
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,330
What did you get up to this time?

540
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,760
What did you do now?

541
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,429
How many times did I clean up your mess...

542
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,630
so the King would not find fault with you?

543
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,710
Must I live in anxiety that you might cause trouble again?

544
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:50,940
Your Highness.

545
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,910
His Highness did nothing wrong.

546
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,740
There was just a small happening...

547
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,910
when he played soccer.

548
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,920
- Soccer? - Yes, Mother.

549
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,120
You see, I was playing soccer.

550
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,690
But the court maid who died in that well suddenly showed up...

551
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,630
and started choking me like this.

552
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,859
So, I...

553
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,660
"The court maid who died in that well?"

554
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,400
Does this mean...

555
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,810
you were behind the suicide...

556
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,670
of the queen's court maid in training...

557
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,340
who took her own life a little while ago?

558
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,990
You are such a coward,

559
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,760
yet you did something only a wild beast would do.

560
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,870
If you were that afraid of ghosts,

561
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
you should not have sinned!

562
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,610
Mother.

563
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,340
Please stay by my side.

564
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,180
I am afraid she might show up again.

565
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,820
I am terrified.

566
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,850
You pathetic...

567
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,620
and useless fool.

568
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,090
Mother.

569
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,490
Mother!

570
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,400
Mother!

571
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:26,900
Mother.

572
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,510
Did you call me a coward?

573
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,810
Keep your eyes wide open and watch what I do.

574
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:35,810
Your Highness!

575
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,680
You should not do this, Your Highness!

576
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,360
Come out and greet me!

577
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:56,200
Is this the residence of Ok Im,

578
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,200
the court maid who drowned in the well?

579
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,200
My goodness. Who might you be?

580
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,910
I am Ok Im's father.

581
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,879
- That worthless daughter of yours. - No!

582
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,979
- Do you know what she did to me? - Father!

583
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,380
How did you teach your daughter that she dared...

584
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,090
to humiliate me like that?

585
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,420
- I will teach you a lesson first. - Oh, no.

586
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,090
- Do you know who I am? - My gosh.

587
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,790
My lord!

588
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,890
- Get away from me! - My lord!

589
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:28,300
- Goodness, my lord! - Your Highness, please stop.

590
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,500
- Your Highness! - Let go!

591
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:32,970
Do you know who I am?

592
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,040
You do not know who I am. How dare she...

593
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,270
humiliate me like that?

594
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,310
No. Please, my lord!

595
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,409
Die!

596
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:43,610
My goodness, please...

597
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,590
Goodness.

598
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,730
He is actually quite naive.

599
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,220
Where did he go, all of a sudden?

600
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,080
Are you all right?

601
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,120
I just saw a tiger over there.

602
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:30,950
Oh, that tiger?

603
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,860
One lightning strike was enough to make it panic and run away.

604
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,030
It got hit by lightning and ran away?

605
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,640
Will you stay here all night?

606
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,110
We must find a place to sleep before it starts getting dark.

607
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,040
That darned king. Could he not have given us food?

608
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,139
Money is of no use when you are stuck...

609
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,340
in the middle of a mountain.

610
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,280
I should not have let that tiger go earlier.

611
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,320
I should have caught it so we could eat it.

612
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,860
- What is this? - Open it, and you will see.

613
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,470
As if that would fill me up.

614
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:52,830
Forget it. You can have this.

615
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,140
You said I must give you pumpkin taffy every day.

616
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,840
There is your five days' worth of pumpkin taffy.

617
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,179
Monk Gaseop's temple is not far away from here.

618
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,680
That should hold you over until we get there.

619
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,210
I shall have this...

620
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:07,980
for I should never ignore anyone's heartfelt offering.

621
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,230
However, this does not mean I will be your guardian spirit.

622
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,930
I will continue to observe you and see how you serve me,

623
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,440
so keep up the good work.

624
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,480
You know, I think I have seen it twice before.

625
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:37,380
A sudden lightning strike on a clear, sunny day.

626
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,509
I was traveling through the mountains...

627
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,520
to sell glasses to Lord Kim in the adjacent village.

628
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:45,650
Did you perhaps do that too?

629
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,920
Did you...

630
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:51,590
cause the lightning strike to scare a tiger away back then too?

631
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,530
This land has always been the home of many tigers.

632
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,200
Every village had a number of people who were killed by tigers.

633
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,370
Even as a little girl, you were fearless.

634
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,310
You hiked through the mountains whenever you could.

635
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,340
Is it not strange that you were never once attacked by a tiger?

636
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,220
Do not look at me like that.

637
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,319
You are the one human being who gave me hope...

638
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,820
that I could become a dragon and ascend to the sky.

639
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,060
I had to protect you...

640
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,500
to protect my only hope.

641
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,630
That was why I did it.

642
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,130
It is gone!

643
00:51:00,131 --> 00:51:02,430
- What? What is gone? - My pumpkin taffy.

644
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,830
Goodness. I am sure you finished it.

645
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,030
No, I did not.

646
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,669
I swear, I only had one.

647
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,970
I wanted to savor the rest, so I put it here.

648
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,330
How dare you steal my pumpkin taffy?

649
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:35,960
I will crush you to pieces.

650
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,570
Hey, Kang Chul!

651
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,189
Where is my pumpkin taffy? Give it back!

652
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,430
No.

653
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,960
Must I teach you a thing or two?

654
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,000
Yeo Ri gave it to me. How dare you steal it from me?

655
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,859
Where did you hide it?

656
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,500
No, I will not give it back.

657
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,570
- Oh, here? - No!

658
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,140
No!

659
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,120
You punk!

660
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,100
What is this?

661
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,830
This man.

662
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,140
He is unbelievably charismatic.

663
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,410
You are not human.

664
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,300
No!

665
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,340
My pumpkin taffy!

666
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:03,950
Save us, merciful Buddha.

667
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:06,680
Kang Chul!

668
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:37,950
That is my...

669
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,649
My pumpkin taffy!

670
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:40,819
Back off!

671
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,149
I will buy you more pumpkin taffy.

672
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,350
I will buy you ten more.

673
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,790
Yeo Ri, was he the reason you studied so hard under me...

674
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,490
to learn the Buddhist scriptures?

675
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:53,830
Yes, Monk Gaseop.

676
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,570
He is Kang Chul, the serpent.

677
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,899
Then how did he get trapped...

678
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,670
inside a dead man's body?

679
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,240
None of your business.

680
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,710
I am sorry about earlier.

681
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:16,179
You were about to attack my master,

682
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,650
so I lost it at that moment.

683
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,960
Thanks to you, I got some good exercise for a change.

684
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,629
Monk Gaseop, then...

685
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:29,360
my grandma's shamanic tools are not here now?

686
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:33,669
You know that Neop Deok was a truly exceptional shaman.

687
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:36,199
Her tools emit such a powerful energy too.

688
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,270
Hence, I buried them at the top of Mount Naebul.

689
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,440
We can go there in the morning and get them.

690
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,340
- Okay, Monk Gaseop. - Very well.

691
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,820
My goodness, Master.

692
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:49,549
You are drooling all over yourself.

693
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:50,919
All right, here.

694
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,160
My gosh. Is it that good?

695
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,860
All right, blow your nose. Go!

696
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:59,160
Very good. The other side too. Go.

697
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,459
As nimble as a clown, go ahead

698
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,730
And twirl

699
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,339
Gulp it down

700
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,869
Secure the mast

701
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,740
And dump it into the ocean

702
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,139
Splash!

703
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,340
Oh, dear.

704
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,540
Your Highness, please.

705
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,280
- If the Dowager Queen finds out... - Darn you!

706
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,150
So what if she finds out?

707
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,050
All she can do is get angry.

708
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,530
Mother was always like that.

709
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,660
For as long as I can remember.

710
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,370
She was always angry.

711
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,600
Even when I was little,

712
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,540
she was always angry with me.

713
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,349
Your Highness, please go inside.

714
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,910
No, that feels like such a hassle.

715
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,849
You can go.

716
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:55,679
But I must help you get ready for bed...

717
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,990
Hey! Stop being such a bother!

718
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:59,520
Go away!

719
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,100
Yes, Your Highness.

720
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,460
I will be off, then.

721
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,920
That must have taught that wench a lesson.

722
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,860
She is a ghost, but so what?

723
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,260
How dare she mess with me, knowing I am of royal blood?

724
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:08,720
What?

725
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,630
What can you even do by staring at me like that?

726
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:15,430
Try and mess with me again if you can!

727
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,869
This time, I will be sure...

728
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,699
to burn down that shabby thatched house...

729
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,100
and wipe out three generations of your family...

730
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:29,440
What is this?

731
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:35,480
What on earth is this?

732
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,320
What is this?

733
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,260
What is happening?

734
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,390
Go away!

735
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,130
No!

736
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,900
Go away.

737
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,570
(The Haunted Palace)

738
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,310
I should give it another shot now that I have Grandma's tools.

739
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,780
Are you planning to leave?

740
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,950
Did you not see a man and wench on the run headed this way?

741
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:43,820
What were you two going to do in there?

742
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,149
Prepare for the ritual first.

743
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,220
I will always have your back.

744
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,490
Someone is looking for you.

745
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:53,800
Someone offered up the prince as a sacrifice.

746
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,100
It was you? You did that to the prince?

747
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:00,570
Tonight, we will offer the prince to the General of Heaven and Earth.

748
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:03,100
I will lure the Eight-feet Spirit there.
