(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,350
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,310
You trifling spirit.

9
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,980
(Episode 7: A Deadly Spell)

10
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,510
The water spirit...

11
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,650
will cast a deadly spell on that cheeky girl too.

12
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,190
Then it will be the end for her.

13
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,960
But what if the water spirit runs away?

14
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,559
The spirit must bring us the royal offspring...

15
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,530
even if it means casting a deadly spell.

16
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,430
I vowed to bring his grudge to rest only if he fulfilled the task.

17
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,240
So he will bring us what we need.

18
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,380
I am fine.

19
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,920
I threw everything up.

20
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,490
I mean it. I am all right. I am not harmed.

21
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,160
What matters now is that we lost him.

22
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,860
What should we do?

23
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,230
We need to catch him to find the Eight-feet Spirit.

24
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,569
Had we forced ourselves to catch him,

25
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,600
we both would have paid a grave price for it.

26
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,270
The water spirit reeked of putrid water.

27
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,740
He forced you to drink the water.

28
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,880
Putrid water?

29
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,149
I am sure he was a water spirit...

30
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,819
living in putrid water from long stagnation.

31
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,150
Serpents who dwell in clean fresh water...

32
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,390
would abhor such foul spirits.

33
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,030
Oh, my shoe.

34
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,660
It must have slipped out in the water.

35
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,639
What are you doing?

36
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,740
We have a long way to reach home.

37
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,270
How will you walk without a shoe?

38
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,850
Even so, you cannot possibly carry me. Forget it.

39
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,790
Is it not obvious to you?

40
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,760
He cast a deadly spell on you.

41
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,320
Such a matter cannot be taken lightly.

42
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,110
You can put me down now.

43
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,210
Besides, Young Master Yoon's ankles are not well.

44
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,410
I do not wish to burden his ankles.

45
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,350
Just stay put.

46
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,590
Clearly, this body is in poor condition.

47
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,990
But he has enough energy to carry a small girl.

48
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,790
Get some sleep until we arrive.

49
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,930
You must be exhausted.

50
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,840
I must be losing my mind. Indeed.

51
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,879
- What did you say? - Stop.

52
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,850
- Hey, you are going to fall. - I want to come down. Put me down!

53
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,019
What was that? What if you hurt yourself?

54
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,150
- Because you keep doing this, I... - What?

55
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,459
You know, do you not?

56
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,930
You have been following me for the past 13 years like a leech.

57
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,960
So no one knows better than you...

58
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,860
how much I liked and missed...

59
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,530
the young master.

60
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,269
- But what? - I yearned for him for 13 years.

61
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,940
And he is standing right before me.

62
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,679
My body is brushing against his, and we are in close proximity.

63
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,780
It is only natural that my heart responds to that.

64
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,480
After all, I am human and a woman too.

65
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,280
Did you just...

66
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,950
speak so boldly of affection for me...

67
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,820
before my very eyes?

68
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,060
Without feeling shy at all?

69
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,100
Why would I be shy? You are not Young Master Yoon Gap.

70
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,770
That is right.

71
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,500
I am not that pathetic man, Yoon Gap.

72
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,770
Then why does my heart also flutter unbidden?

73
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,479
You were right.

74
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,980
Five desires and seven emotions...

75
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,990
indeed arise from our human body.

76
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,520
When my eyes lay on you and our hands meet,

77
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,460
knowing that you are not him, I cannot help but...

78
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,630
What am I saying right now?

79
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Right.

80
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,859
Just like you wanted before,

81
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,430
I want the same thing now.

82
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,670
Let us not be within ten steps of each other.

83
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,410
Let there be a graceful distance between us. Understood?

84
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,080
(Fire)

85
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,420
So tell me. Five days ago,

86
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,490
did you order the bedding of the Queen's chambers...

87
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,090
to be changed?

88
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,700
Yes. I did.

89
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,099
We have been doing so once every ten days.

90
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,230
To whom did you give that order?

91
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,410
Deok Chun. Who was on duty that day?

92
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,340
Yeom, Aeng Du, and I were on duty.

93
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,080
Those who received this task, stand up.

94
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,960
Now.

95
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,309
I am innocent, Your Majesty.

96
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,840
I am innocent.

97
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,549
I swear on my life. I did no such thing.

98
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,580
The deed was not committed by us.

99
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,489
I am not conducting the interrogation...

100
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,220
to take the life of a mere court maid.

101
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,660
Confess the truth and tell us who ordered such a thing,

102
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,360
and I will spare you.

103
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,600
So tell the truth now!

104
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Here it is.

105
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,850
I cannot do it.

106
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,250
How could I put this in...

107
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,760
Is it my death that you want?

108
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,800
You will have to do even if you do not think you can.

109
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
If you do not,

110
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,569
the fact that you have been...

111
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,799
giving information about the Queen to the Dowager Queen...

112
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,500
will end your life. Understood?

113
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,470
Shush.

114
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,380
I am not criticizing you.

115
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,580
As for people of lowly origins like us,

116
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,620
we must bend our backs and dirty our hands...

117
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,420
so that we do not starve. Got it?

118
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,730
Heavy, isn't it?

119
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,130
Complete the deed well, and I will give you that much again.

120
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,530
Do not cry. All right?

121
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,340
No. I cannot confess.

122
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,750
The moment I confess, they will kill me first.

123
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,780
It seems their lips will remain sealed for a while.

124
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,419
Lock up all three of them.

125
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,990
And do not give a drink of water until they confess.

126
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,560
The interrogation will continue tomorrow.

127
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,100
Lock all of them up.

128
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,330
Yes, my lord.

129
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,800
Drag all of them out.

130
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,160
Gap. Are you asleep?

131
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,900
My gosh, he must be asleep.

132
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,240
Goodness gracious!

133
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,380
How dare you pretend to be asleep?

134
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,610
How did you know?

135
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,119
Must you truly ask?

136
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,519
A mother knows if her child is truly asleep or just pretending.

137
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,490
- Get up now. - Oh, no.

138
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,420
- All right. - Darn.

139
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,360
Do not sound so upset.

140
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,099
I got a whole new batch without the snake's tail.

141
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,700
You said you would not drink it because of that.

142
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,260
Did Yeo Ri tell you that?

143
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,470
Besides, once you drink this up,

144
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,040
I will give you this. Here.

145
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,840
Ta-da. I will give you this pumpkin taffy.

146
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,010
Yeo Ri said you would drink it if I showed you the taffy.

147
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,280
All right.

148
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,420
What happened to your binyeo?

149
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,420
Where did your brass binyeo go?

150
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,760
Oh, that? I sold it.

151
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Did you sell the binyeo for this stupid herbal tonic?

152
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,590
Gosh, it was nothing.

153
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,029
It was too heavy. That is why I sold it.

154
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,530
I can buy it back later.

155
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,870
Here. Drink it before it gets cold.

156
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
My gosh.

157
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,970
What will you do if I cannot go back...

158
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,510
to how I was before even after drinking this expensive tonic?

159
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,050
What could I do?

160
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,220
You are still my child.

161
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,089
Even if your mind goes astray and you are not yourself,

162
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,590
you will remain my child. I will take care of you.

163
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,060
If you do not want to drink it, then forget it.

164
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,900
You are talking nonsense just to avoid drinking this tonic.

165
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,800
How wonderful.

166
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,240
Oh, yes. You finished it.

167
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,070
Oh, my.

168
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,139
What is it? Yes. Oh, right.

169
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,909
Here you go. Have the taffy.

170
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,950
There.

171
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,920
Is the taffy tasty? My gosh.

172
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,020
My goodness.

173
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,869
Yes. If it was indeed a deadly spell,

174
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,510
she would already have been in trouble.

175
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,540
She will be all right.

176
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,590
Get some sleep until we arrive.

177
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,920
You must be exhausted.

178
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,050
Young Master. I must have missed you very much.

179
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,990
Please give me a bit more time.

180
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,020
I will save you no matter what.

181
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,389
(I will come to collect you in the Hour of the Mouse.)

182
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,790
(The moment you see this note, swallow it to get rid of it.)

183
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,640
The court maid took her own life?

184
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,880
Yes. It appears she swallowed poison.

185
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,750
How could an imprisoned criminal get her hands on poison?

186
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,720
I apologize, Your Majesty.

187
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,119
As I was in charge of the interrogation,

188
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,950
I bear the full weight of the failure.

189
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,620
We found them in the living quarters...

190
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,590
of Aeng Du, the dead court maid of the Queen's Palace.

191
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,930
Someone must have given them to her.

192
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,670
I will have them investigate further.

193
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,570
Premier, it is you alone...

194
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,810
whom I can trust fully in the Palace.

195
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,180
Investigate anyone who had a close relationship with her.

196
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

197
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,150
I will carry out your command.

198
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,890
How nice.

199
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,960
The Palace is thick...

200
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,100
with the stench of malice.

201
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,969
How come I did not think of the capital before?

202
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,469
No. Why did I fail to think of coming into the Palace?

203
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,069
That is because you said the provinces in the south...

204
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,540
were more to your liking.

205
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,110
I have made up my mind.

206
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,150
- About what? - I shall fulfil...

207
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,520
the count of 100 devoured spirits here within this month.

208
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,589
Good for you.

209
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,260
You will ascend to the skies soon.

210
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,890
No.

211
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,530
I will fulfil only up to 99.

212
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,560
Then I ought to play with my poor brother for a while...

213
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,330
before I go.

214
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,630
What a nuisance you are.

215
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,070
Go away.

216
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,040
So what are you going to do?

217
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,700
What fun will I have to ascend to the skies without you?

218
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,180
How do you plan...

219
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,280
to win over that girl, Yeo Ri?

220
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,250
What do you think?

221
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,080
I must pretend to be interested in catching...

222
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,820
the Eight-feet Spirit like she wants for now.

223
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,420
Are you sure you are up for it?

224
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,530
I heard the trifling spirits gossiping a few times.

225
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,660
It sounded like...

226
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,030
the Eight-feet Spirit could cause trouble.

227
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,300
What have you heard?

228
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,570
Shall I look into it?

229
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,540
You sound oddly invested.

230
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,080
You said you were only pretending.

231
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,380
You almost fooled me too.

232
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,520
Look over there.

233
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,590
My entire banquet is walking away.

234
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
See you later.

235
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,440
So a malevolent object was found in the Queen's Palace?

236
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,410
Were you behind this?

237
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,910
Your Highness.

238
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,950
You were the one who gave this order for this deed.

239
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,180
How dare you?

240
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,989
When did I order you to commit such an evil deed?

241
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,220
Remember the tragic death Prince Young In suffered?

242
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,490
But His Majesty blessed the Queen with another child.

243
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,589
After discovering this news,

244
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,829
rightfully, you wanted to end...

245
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,060
the life of His Majesty's second child.

246
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,600
Did I misunderstand your intention?

247
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,670
Yes, you did.

248
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,140
That was not my intention.

249
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,269
Even the noble king, His Majesty,

250
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,709
was driven to take his brother's life so brutally...

251
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,110
because deep down,

252
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,050
he has been tainted by the seed of malice as well.

253
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,650
Please steady your heart.

254
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,889
For the sake of the unfortunate Prince Young In...

255
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,259
whose spirit must be loitering around this realm,

256
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,590
unable to cross the Samdo Stream,

257
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,390
you must seek retribution for his death.

258
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,310
Your Majesty.

259
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,010
We found this while cleaning the library.

260
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,980
What is it?

261
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,900
(Yoon Gap)

262
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,400
I am not your subject.

263
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,570
I am...

264
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,180
Kang Chul.

265
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,120
Royal Scribe Yoon Gap...

266
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,520
fulfilled his duty with unwavering loyalty...

267
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,130
and was always guided by righteousness.

268
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,530
Even when the burdens of state clouded my judgment,

269
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,700
the royal scribe offered me words of loyalty...

270
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
that brought me to my senses.

271
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,480
It is only appropriate to hold a ceremony to mourn for his death.

272
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,850
But as his spirit cannot be found in his body,

273
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,750
the peace of rest evades him.

274
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,420
As sorrow weighs heavily on my heart,

275
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,390
with this humble offering,

276
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,030
I shall attempt to console his spirit.

277
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,030
(Yoon Gap)

278
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,770
Your Highness.

279
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,480
Pung San was right.

280
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,749
He said the individual that came into the Palace...

281
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,550
fifteen days ago was a shaman.

282
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,349
During that time, no new court maids or eunuchs...

283
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,320
were appointed in the Palace.

284
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,060
But a new glasses-maker was appointed to Sanguiwon.

285
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,190
A glasses-maker?

286
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,830
She is a young girl.

287
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,030
She has recently been spotted going in and out of the Queen's Palace...

288
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,970
and the Royal Library quite frequently.

289
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,740
What?

290
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,400
I am begging you.

291
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,169
Could you look into that water spirit?

292
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,610
Gosh, no way!

293
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,679
I cannot possibly deal with the water spirit...

294
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,980
that spews foul water.

295
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,410
Not all water spirits are the same.

296
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,609
I am a pure water spirit...

297
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,549
that dwells in clean, drinking water.

298
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,749
You said you would do anything I asked.

299
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,649
You said you did not need my help.

300
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,460
Why are you bothering me now?

301
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,060
Bother you? Unbelievable.

302
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,730
Hey, come out here.

303
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,930
You!

304
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,770
I am right back where I started.

305
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,970
Where should I start?

306
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,879
It would be nice if I could catch the man who put up the talisman.

307
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,650
Who is this wench that keeps on stealing my shoes?

308
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,280
You better come clean.

309
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,079
The soles of your shoes are all worn out.

310
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,420
Who would want to take them?

311
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,589
I bet you probably lost them...

312
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,120
and are accusing us of stealing to avoid getting scolded.

313
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,519
No.

314
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,130
My shoes vanished overnight.

315
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,490
Who...

316
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,130
Come on.

317
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,270
Nothing has been going my way since I lost my shoes.

318
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,400
You brat.

319
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,870
Are you all right?

320
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,610
You should have been more careful. Oh, dear.

321
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,449
Come to think of it, my friends' shoes...

322
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,150
kept going missing when I was your age.

323
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,380
My teacher told me...

324
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,890
it was a spirit's doing.

325
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,020
A spirit's doing?

326
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,530
Yes. That spirit might help me find the man...

327
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,330
who put up the talisman.

328
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,240
Bi Bi?

329
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,380
The serpent that drove the capital into chaos...

330
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,820
was here.

331
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,290
- Well done, everyone. - Good work.

332
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,300
How lovely.

333
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,830
Shall I begin?

334
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,999
Which one of them should I start with?

335
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,540
That is the question.

336
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,170
Yes.

337
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,610
Oh, my.

338
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,480
His belly is so steep in malice...

339
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,650
that it is seeping out.

340
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,820
Let me begin with him today.

341
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,750
My gosh.

342
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,860
He is His Majesty's maternal grandfather.

343
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
My lord.

344
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,900
Have you been at peace and in good health?

345
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,029
Oh, yes.

346
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,230
You are His Majesty's glasses-maker, are you not?

347
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,770
Have you been well?

348
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,770
What do you think you are doing? Step aside.

349
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Yes, I have been well.

350
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,180
Step aside now. Understood?

351
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,550
His Majesty is very satisfied with the shaded glasses...

352
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,050
you made for him.

353
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,150
Could you make one pair for me too?

354
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,420
I fear that my eyesight is growing dim.

355
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,990
Of course. I will pay you a visit soon.

356
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,160
Yes, I will see you soon.

357
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,830
You!

358
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,800
You little...

359
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,810
Do you think I will be lenient with you because Kang Chul is?

360
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,810
How dare you...

361
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,140
ruin my meal?

362
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,210
I saw many tasty dishes for your banquet...

363
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,280
over there.

364
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,480
You are taking her side?

365
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,590
How could you take her side after seeing what she did to me?

366
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
So...

367
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,990
are you threatening to go after my disciple in my presence?

368
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,110
Darn it. So where is my banquet?

369
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,570
Over there?

370
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,110
Come on.

371
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,880
You just wait. One day, I shall...

372
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,750
You little...

373
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,760
Unbelievable.

374
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,470
One female shaman.

375
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,730
Two serpents.

376
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,940
Assistant Minister of Personnel Kang Seung Ju...

377
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,810
passed away last night?

378
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,280
Yes. He passed away while in sleep.

379
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,110
He seemed perfectly healthy when I saw him a few days ago.

380
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,780
Why all of a sudden?

381
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,679
From what I have heard,

382
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,720
such misfortune is quite common...

383
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,260
in the southern provinces.

384
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,290
People say there is a serpent who only targets...

385
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,860
noblemen over their 60s.

386
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,760
Noblemen over their 60s?

387
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,870
- How dare you? - Right.

388
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,300
So did you turn 60 this year?

389
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,219
What do you want?

390
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,049
We are here to see Lord Choi Won Woo.

391
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,349
Open the gate now.

392
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,590
Lord Choi is down with an illness.

393
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,520
No one is allowed inside.

394
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,229
How dare you deny his entrance?

395
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,730
Open the gate this instant...

396
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,210
Unless you want to be punished later,

397
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,039
escort us inside when I am asking nicely.

398
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,210
I said no!

399
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,880
You fool. Are you this dense?

400
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,279
Do you want to be punished?

401
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,079
I said no one could enter.

402
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,950
- How dare you? - If I let you in,

403
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,859
Lord Choi will be punishing me for it.

404
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,890
You insolent fool! How dare you?

405
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,559
Are you unable to take a hint?

406
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,730
What is the matter?

407
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,499
These men...

408
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,970
insist on coming in without an invitation.

409
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,979
My father will not receive...

410
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,380
any guests at all.

411
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,279
Our manservant...

412
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,619
is only obeying his master's command.

413
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,290
Please leave.

414
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,590
Give your father a message.

415
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,890
Tell him his long-time student...

416
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,460
Lee Jeong is here.

417
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,100
I am sure he will agree to see me.

418
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,870
My father taught many students in his time.

419
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,640
We sent away all the others who asked to see him, so...

420
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,910
Wait.

421
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,680
Lee Jeong.

422
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,850
I heard that name somewhere...

423
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,639
My lady. Who is he that Lord Choi agreed to see him?

424
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,710
Mak Geum.

425
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:07,379
Did I carry myself calmly and elegantly...

426
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,380
as a young woman of my social standing should?

427
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,849
Well... Yes.

428
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,190
You were your usual self.

429
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,290
Who was that man?

430
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,020
It was His Majesty.

431
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,690
Our King.

432
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,740
That will do.

433
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,640
I do not expect an ill man to bow deeply to me.

434
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,340
Your Majesty.

435
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,410
Do forgive your disloyal subject.

436
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,750
Do you still consider me...

437
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,320
your monarch?

438
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,919
Your Majesty.

439
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,530
When you resigned from office five years ago,

440
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,729
I tried to understand why.

441
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,059
The government was divided over the land reform,

442
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,969
and I accepted you were exhausted.

443
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,670
But have you not rested long enough?

444
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,500
Your Majesty.

445
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,940
I am now old...

446
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,180
and have no energy or power.

447
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,309
Royal Scribe Yoon...

448
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,480
will have told you how things stand.

449
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,979
I need you, Lord Choi.

450
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,520
Reforming the slave bill is nothing like the land reform.

451
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,020
It will bring upon...

452
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,559
a gruesome fight where one will bite another.

453
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,930
It is a great shame...

454
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,060
that it has already begun.

455
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,400
That gruesome fight.

456
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,800
I will no longer hesitate or step back.

457
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
That is why...

458
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,910
I came to see you tonight.

459
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,360
Your Majesty!

460
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,559
- Your Majesty. - Are you all right?

461
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,630
I am fine. Lord Choi. Were you hurt?

462
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,070
No.

463
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,400
I am fine.

464
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,909
- I apologize. - No.

465
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,470
That was a very close call.

466
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,920
That cursed cat.

467
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,460
I am fine. I bid you farewell.

468
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,969
This is so uncomfortable. I should save...

469
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,810
Young Master Yoon as soon as possible.

470
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,610
So...

471
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,850
About Bi Bi.

472
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,380
Can we let him loose like this?

473
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,080
Should we not stop him?

474
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,450
Just like me, he is a deity.

475
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,619
No human should get involved in a deity's affairs.

476
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,790
Even so,

477
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,789
letting him go on to eat people is a bit...

478
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,329
Bi Bi only eats...

479
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,160
evil nobles who live off of greed and lust.

480
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,130
Consuming humans like that...

481
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,769
is a good thing for society and the world.

482
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,099
That good karma is how he gets to ascend.

483
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,440
But still,

484
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,209
he tried to eat the King's maternal grandfather earlier.

485
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,840
He is a good, warmhearted man.

486
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,480
How would you know what a man is truly like?

487
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,620
You go ahead.

488
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,790
You are not going home?

489
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,960
I must finish something first.

490
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,740
What are you doing out in the cold?

491
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:02,580
- You must go to sleep. - Yes, my lady.

492
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,219
It will be the works of a Luminous Spirit...

493
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,490
that steals the shoes of children.

494
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,889
Hang a fine sieve on the door outside...

495
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,930
and hide your shoes in your room.

496
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,510
They are gone.

497
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,650
The shoes are not here.

498
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,390
I rubbed my eyes, and I still cannot see them.

499
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,530
This is too big.

500
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,900
I cannot go back to Mother without any shoes.

501
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,980
This has lots of holes.

502
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,850
I am good at counting. I am.

503
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,520
One,

504
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,490
two,

505
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,489
three.

506
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,290
See? I can count. I will start again.

507
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,429
One,

508
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,830
two,

509
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,760
three.

510
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:35,070
Darn you. Mother told me I was good at counting.

511
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,310
Three.

512
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,409
Four.

513
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,050
Darn you. I know what is next. Four.

514
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,550
Four. And then...

515
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,920
- Five. - I said I knew that!

516
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,760
Release me! Let me go!

517
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,460
You old hag.

518
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,130
Let me down immediately!

519
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,059
Wait and see. I will haunt all your descendants...

520
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,929
and steal their shoes and good fortune.

521
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,569
Oh, I am so afraid.

522
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,639
I am so scared I will have a son like you...

523
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,499
when I am married.

524
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,509
Shut your mouth! What son?

525
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,679
I am much older than your grandmother.

526
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,250
Oh, are you? Let us say you are.

527
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,150
This hurts. It is really painful.

528
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,419
I swear. It hurts so much.

529
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,390
You think that hurts?

530
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,260
From what I heard, you stole hundreds of shoes...

531
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,259
and court maids lost their luck...

532
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,299
for the whole year, and they suffered a great deal.

533
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,000
You say this hurts?

534
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,600
I am saying it hurts because it does.

535
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,310
- It hurts. - Silence!

536
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,979
You mostly stole shoes that belonged...

537
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,649
to the Queen's maids.

538
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,210
Were you at...

539
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,080
Prince Young In's chambers on the night of the Red Rooster?

540
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,850
What do you want to know?

541
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,119
Tell me who put up...

542
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,260
the talisman under his room.

543
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,229
If you tell me, I will cut you down...

544
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,530
and buy you new shoes.

545
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,600
I do not know his name.

546
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,870
It was a eunuch with scary-looking eyes.

547
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,480
His fingertips were black.

548
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,610
His fingertips were black?

549
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,930
How interesting. Very interesting.

550
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,670
One female shaman and two serpents.

551
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:46,499
And they threatened the General of Heaven and Earth?

552
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,970
A water spirit cast their deadly spell on you.

553
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,910
You will soon die.

554
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:04,120
Ash from a fire would make one's fingertips black.

555
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,120
You are right.

556
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,430
Where are you going?

557
00:38:16,431 --> 00:38:17,630
Stay here.

558
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,379
The frame has gotten stiff.

559
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,849
His Majesty wants you to take a look.

560
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,719
Yes, I will do that.

561
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,780
And also...

562
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:41,490
About him. Is it true that inside him...

563
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:45,060
is a serpent that failed to ascend...

564
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,470
and become a dragon that is called Kang Chul?

565
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,400
Is he a deity and not a human?

566
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,609
Yes. Shamans call him...

567
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,969
a mischievous evil deity,

568
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,309
but he is still a deity.

569
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,750
He mainly watches over the weather.

570
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,719
Yeo Ri. Do you think...

571
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,650
he holds a grudge?

572
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,719
Would he punish a human who did not...

573
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,590
treat him with respect or...

574
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,259
What do you mean by that?

575
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,560
Well, you see...

576
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,600
No.

577
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,699
I did not say anything.

578
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,470
Do as I asked.

579
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,870
Oh, hello.

580
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:35,179
What is the court lady of the Dowager Queen doing here?

581
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,549
Her Highness...

582
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,020
told me to bring Sanguiwon's glasses-maker Yeo Ri.

583
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,420
This girl?

584
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,920
Why does the Dowager Queen need to see a glasses-maker?

585
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,570
His Majesty the King is present.

586
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,919
- What happened? - Your Majesty.

587
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,050
She shudders with a high fever.

588
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,820
I suspect malaria,

589
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,819
but she has blisters down to her abdomen,

590
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,059
so I cannot make a clear diagnosis.

591
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,060
Then...

592
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,270
what on earth is she suffering from?

593
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,100
Your Majesty.

594
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,300
I have never seen such symptoms before.

595
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,310
I only beg for your grace and understanding.

596
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,050
- The physicians can leave. - Yes, Your Majesty.

597
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,130
Court Lady Oh.

598
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,660
Do you know what could be the cause of this?

599
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,899
I do not know if there is a connection,

600
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,969
but after she fell ill,

601
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,340
she said she saw the ghost from her nightmares again.

602
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,880
Summon Yeo Ri immediately.

603
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,710
Go, now!

604
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,960
Do you see this letter also?

605
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,100
It is "ryo" that means "bright."

606
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:41,069
Your Highness. If I may dare say so,

607
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,639
you can see letters that are close up...

608
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,579
as well as far away.

609
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,540
You do not need glasses.

610
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,850
If that is so,

611
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,280
why am I unable to complete this piece of embroidery?

612
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,790
That is because...

613
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,500
This is strange. My body feels so heavy.

614
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,030
Do I have a cold?

615
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,900
How did you become His Majesty's glasses-maker?

616
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,669
I hail from...

617
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,939
Yongdam Village in Ducheong County where I made glasses.

618
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,280
Royal Scribe Yoon Gap recommended me to His Majesty.

619
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,050
Yongdam Village?

620
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,650
How interesting.

621
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:36,090
Make a pair of glasses that will let me complete this.

622
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,159
She is just an ordinary girl.

623
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,870
She is the one who got my son killed?

624
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,770
Pung San.

625
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,400
Can I believe what you said?

626
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,410
She does not want a pair of glasses.

627
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,380
What does she want?

628
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,230
Why is she not here yet?

629
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,370
Get her something to vomit into.

630
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,579
Why is Yeo Ri not here yet?

631
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,950
The Dowager Queen is keeping her occupied.

632
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,319
I sent word that you need her urgently.

633
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,389
She will come soon.

634
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:43,930
You said that two hours ago!

635
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,330
Oh, Your Majesty...

636
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,300
This will not do.

637
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:52,270
I will get her myself.

638
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,870
Your Majesty!

639
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,220
Why you...

640
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:18,359
Your Highness. I lack the necessary skills.

641
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,099
Please summon a more skilled craftsman.

642
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,830
There will be none more skilled than you.

643
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,270
I know the King well.

644
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,739
He is gruff, difficult,

645
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,640
but also a perfectionist.

646
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,379
That man keeps you close, values your counsel,

647
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,750
and often calls you to the Royal Library.

648
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,749
Does she know what I am?

649
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,050
His Majesty the King is present!

650
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,130
You heard me. His Majesty the King is present!

651
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,370
Welcome, Your Majesty.

652
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,099
You cannot be here...

653
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,410
to greet me when you must be busy with work.

654
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,240
What brings you here?

655
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,880
I borrowed your glasses-maker.

656
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,690
I am incredibly pleased to know...

657
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,990
you found a use for my glasses-maker.

658
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,500
However, now is not the time for you to use her services.

659
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,630
Bring them here.

660
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,949
What are these?

661
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,649
They were found in the room...

662
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,050
that belonged to the court maid that harmed the Queen.

663
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,890
Why would you show me...

664
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,389
these items with a corrupt and dirty nature?

665
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,160
These accessories were all we found as proof.

666
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,599
You know all about what goes on in the Palace.

667
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,069
I thought Your Highness might know something.

668
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,700
How dare you, Your Majesty?

669
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,639
Do you suspect me?

670
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,980
Would I dare suspect you?

671
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,979
You did not give me life,

672
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,010
but you are my mother.

673
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,750
I am King, and my people watch my every move.

674
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,390
I would never insult my mother in such a way.

675
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

676
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,390
That is the person you are.

677
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,370
Never once did you do wrong.

678
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,100
So...

679
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,469
you would have never held...

680
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,009
a banned purging ritual to curse your own brother.

681
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,510
Your Highness.

682
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,920
I took my joke too far.

683
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,189
He was a half-brother that I am sure...

684
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,889
you wanted dead many times.

685
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:06,029
But our great King...

686
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,060
would not have done such a thing.

687
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,670
I came here right now...

688
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,499
because my Queen is in very poor health.

689
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,939
The Queen is unwell?

690
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,009
The physician says she could have contracted something contagious.

691
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,309
This girl was with the Queen yesterday.

692
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,579
I feared she might give you the illness.

693
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,280
That is why I rushed over.

694
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,350
Forgive me for taking her away so abruptly.

695
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,259
You look out for your mother...

696
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,800
in a way that sets a great example for the people.

697
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,070
You may take her away.

698
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,089
(Dowager Queen's Palace)

699
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,990
Discreetly keep an eye on the Dowager Queen's Palace.

700
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,090
They will make a move.

701
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

702
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,460
My goodness!

703
00:48:14,461 --> 00:48:17,600
Yeo Ri, what is that on your neck?

704
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:18,870
My neck?

705
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,900
Yes, right here. My gosh.

706
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:23,670
Oh, no!

707
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,670
Goodness. What is going on?

708
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:46,960
Yeo Ri!

709
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,240
Yeo Ri.

710
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,910
What is wrong with her?

711
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,980
Yeo Ri... What happened to her?

712
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,540
Calm down, Royal Scribe Yoon.

713
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,910
She is running a high fever, so we believe it is malaria.

714
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,980
She also has blister-like lesions, which we have never seen before.

715
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:10,290
Hence, we have not been able to properly diagnose her yet.

716
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,690
Blister-like lesions?

717
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,960
Lesions like that...

718
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,399
form a line, starting from the neck...

719
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,960
all the way down to the sacral chakra below her navel.

720
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:24,970
The deadly spell.

721
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,800
The deadly spell did this.

722
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,740
It got to her, at last.

723
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,480
That darned evil water spirit.

724
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,240
I should have destroyed it right there and then.

725
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,250
The physicians are to wait outside.

726
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,920
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Please come with me.

727
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

728
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,960
My queen exhibited the same symptoms.

729
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,130
What do you think?

730
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,800
Can she be cured?

731
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,310
Yeo Ri.

732
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:08,510
I believe the evil water spirit's deadly spell...

733
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,010
got to me.

734
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,380
That spell...

735
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,450
was targetting the child...

736
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,220
in Her Highness the Queen's womb.

737
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,520
- That evil water spirit... - That is enough.

738
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,220
Stop talking.

739
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,790
Look at the state you are in now.

740
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,690
You cannot afford to worry about others.

741
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:29,730
We must catch the evil water spirit...

742
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,370
to lift this deadly spell.

743
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,100
Otherwise,

744
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,640
Her Highness will be put in danger...

745
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,910
Yeo Ri.

746
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,150
What nonsense!

747
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:53,690
Your Majesty, this cannot be done.

748
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,259
We can never let it happen.

749
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,290
He is right, Your Majesty.

750
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,389
It is utterly wrong.

751
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,600
Did you not hear what she said earlier?

752
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,500
There is only one way to remove that deadly spell.

753
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,670
We must catch the spirit that did this.

754
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,570
However, it will not be easy to lure back the spirit that has fled.

755
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,409
Even so, how dare you suggest...

756
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,579
we use His Majesty as bait?

757
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,580
Then...

758
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:20,120
will you offer your son instead?

759
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,490
That evil water spirit is persistently after the fetus.

760
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,529
It means the Eight-feet Spirit who is after the royal blood...

761
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:31,990
is behind it.

762
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,959
If you are there too, the evil water spirit...

763
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,730
will smell your blood and show up again. I am sure of it.

764
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:41,870
Say one more word, and I will cut off your tongue!

765
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,380
Do you think I will let you slay me?

766
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,310
I, too, will stop at nothing.

767
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:51,710
If we keep dragging this out, Yeo Ri will die.

768
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,450
If you do not cooperate,

769
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,420
I will have no choice but to drag your son there.

770
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,250
You do not think I can do it?

771
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,500
- Drop your swords. - Your Majesty.

772
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:11,900
Now!

773
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,690
My queen is in serious condition.

774
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,090
What do you need?

775
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,470
Oh, my.

776
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,470
The glasses-maker was that shaman?

777
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,310
But where does that wench come from?

778
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,179
I hear she could come to the Palace...

779
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,680
because Royal Scribe Yoon Gap recommended her.

780
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,980
I hear she is from a village called Yongdam in the Ducheong County.

781
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,450
Did you...

782
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,720
just say Yongdam Village?

783
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,190
Yes.

784
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,030
What is the matter? Is there something you know?

785
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:17,830
Hey.

786
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,140
Hey.

787
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,970
Hey, Kang Chul!

788
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,140
Do not talk to me unless you are going to help me.

789
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,640
You said it was a lie.

790
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,980
You said you would simply play along.

791
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,550
How is this "playing along?"

792
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,390
I know you cannot fully use your powers at the moment.

793
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,220
You are not as strong as you used to be.

794
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:42,059
It is all because...

795
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,990
you have been trapped in a human body for too long.

796
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:49,460
What if we can never ascend at this rate?

797
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:51,600
Seriously...

798
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,670
Why go through all this trouble...

799
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,670
just to save a girl who is on the verge of death?

800
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,479
Goodness.

801
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,710
Shut your mouth.

802
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,060
I never even pee, but I nearly wet myself.

803
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:24,970
Darn it.

804
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,170
Yeo Ri, that wench. I am beginning to resent her even more.

805
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,139
You hold onto the warding stone.

806
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,300
No, we cannot do that.

807
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,870
Do not listen to him, Your Majesty.

808
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:07,979
Yeo Ri said Your Majesty...

809
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,949
should keep the glasses on you at all times.

810
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,980
The warding stone wards off evil spirits.

811
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,480
We must use him as bait to catch an evil spirit,

812
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,290
so he should not keep it on him.

813
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,490
We should not listen to him.

814
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,389
I agreed to bring Your Majesty here...

815
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:22,290
for I knew the powers of that crystal.

816
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,389
If Your Majesty's safety is not guaranteed,

817
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:26,090
I cannot do as he says.

818
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,830
You bravely decided to tag along here.

819
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,770
Now, you want to chicken out like a coward.

820
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,940
Do you know what I am telling myself as I am putting up with you now?

821
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,980
If you know you are here as bait, act like one.

822
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,410
Yeo Ri is on the verge of death now for she tried to save your wife.

823
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,280
If Yeo Ri dies because you do a clumsy job,

824
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,780
I will turn into an evil spirit worse than the Eight-feet Spirit...

825
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,950
and rip you to shreds.

826
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,590
I will make sure you die an extremely painful death.

827
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,660
Hold onto it.

828
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:03,930
Your Majesty.

829
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:08,970
I...

830
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,240
truly cannot stand you either.

831
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:21,080
Royal Scribe Yoon Gap was the vassal I was most fond of.

832
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,819
However, you dared to possess his body.

833
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,089
You are facing me as him,

834
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,790
speaking insolently to me in his voice!

835
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,460
But surely, you would not understand what it is like...

836
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,530
to see that.

837
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,600
Just know that...

838
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,340
I, too, am doing my best to tolerate you with utmost patience.

839
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,940
The longing for him is unbearable.

840
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,310
And I am staring right at his face and body.

841
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,610
But it is not him.

842
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,880
It is the face I treasure the most.

843
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,460
But you, whom I loathe the most, have taken over his face.

844
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,390
This is...

845
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,960
the most wretched nightmare.

846
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,330
Darn you.

847
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,170
You brought back the memory!

848
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,240
Your Majesty!

849
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,499
Are you all right?

850
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,240
I await Your Majesty's order.

851
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,680
I will slay him in a single sweep.

852
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:30,450
I, too, wish to behead him right this instant,

853
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,590
but I cannot save my queen if he dies.

854
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,890
However...

855
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,759
Even when I had to fight my political enemies in the court,

856
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,830
I managed to do it without a flinch.

857
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,500
I suppressed my emotions...

858
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,100
to keep my cool and persevere bravely.

859
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:48,470
But you...

860
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,740
I truly cannot stand you.

861
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,580
I cannot stand you!

862
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,350
Your Majesty.

863
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:08,460
How dare you!

864
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,530
You truly irk me,

865
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,840
and I would kill you right this instant if I could,

866
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,480
but I shall hold back for I need you as bait.

867
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:06,780
Head Eunuch.

868
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:08,750
Head Eunuch.

869
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,350
Head Eunuch.

870
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,420
Head Eunuch.

871
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,160
Head Eunuch.

872
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,470
- Did she wake up? - Yes, she did.

873
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,440
Oh, okay. Let us go.

874
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,580
I told you. You should not be moving around.

875
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:36,840
Open the door.

876
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,509
Why are you getting up?

877
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,420
Lie back down.

878
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,250
So? Are you all right?

879
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,890
What about Kang Chul?

880
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,850
Where is Kang Chul?

881
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,390
Kang Chul...

882
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,890
Oh, please.

883
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,400
Go on.

884
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,040
Well, if you are talking about the serpent,

885
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,840
he went to catch that evil spirit.

886
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,310
What is insane is that...

887
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,340
he took His Majesty with him.

888
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,579
Goodness. What are you doing? You have not fully recovered yet.

889
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,849
If anything bad happens to you, he will make me pay for it.

890
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:21,060
That serpent went on about it and threatened me.

891
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,190
I must go.

892
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,260
I must go there and stop him.

893
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:27,500
Or else, everyone will be put in danger.

894
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,600
What?

895
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,779
I am here offering myself as bait,

896
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,980
but that evil spirit still has not appeared.

897
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,090
Perhaps, there was something wrong with your plan.

898
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,420
Did you think the evil spirit would welcome you with open arms?

899
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:32,960
I bet he is watching you from somewhere,

900
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,130
waiting for the right moment to strike.

901
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:38,800
However,

902
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,740
this is indeed strange.

903
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,940
Spirits usually appear at the Hour of the Mouse.

904
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,740
How come he has not appeared when it is almost dawn?

905
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,110
Could it be because...

906
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,280
he is doing a clumsy job as bait?

907
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:00,960
I must say, I am surprised you actually followed me here.

908
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,360
I have seen many men who do not cherish their wives.

909
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:06,790
My queen...

910
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,500
is more than a wife to me.

911
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,329
She came to the Palace at a young age...

912
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,070
when things were difficult, to say the least,

913
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,270
and held out with me through countless hardships.

914
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,980
I ought to protect her, at all costs.

915
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,590
Does that five-coloured bracelet belong to Yoon Gap?

916
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:35,860
It is mine.

917
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,090
Yeo Ri made it for me when she became my disciple.

918
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,829
Yeo Ri made it for you,

919
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:43,900
not Yoon Gap?

920
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:44,970
That is right.

921
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:48,070
She prayed from the bottom of her heart as she touched each thread.

922
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,970
What was that? That insulting scoff.

923
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,210
It was nothing.

924
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,650
You see,

925
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,380
it utterly offends me to hear you say Yeo Ri's name.

926
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:04,950
The ill-fated connection...

927
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,420
between you and Yeo Ri goes back generations.

928
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,130
You...

929
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,900
So, you know everything?

930
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:22,099
Then that shaman, Neop Deok too...

931
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,840
Do not even bring it up in front of Yeo Ri.

932
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,309
She will stop at nothing.

933
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:27,480
If she learns that too,

934
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,780
I do not know what she might do.

935
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,860
The sun is rising.

936
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,470
We cannot afford to waste any more time.

937
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,070
If it is my blood that you want,

938
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,380
I will give it to you.

939
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:14,690
Your Majesty.

940
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,640
Come on, quick!

941
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,380
Run!

942
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,479
Do not turn around.

943
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,480
Run!

944
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,020
Kang Chul, no.

945
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,430
This is a trap. Please.

946
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:40,980
Hold onto it!

947
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,860
(We thank Kim Ki Ri for his cameo appearance.)

948
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:18,980
(The Haunted Palace)

949
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,120
Come with me.

950
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,089
If I do not go, Kang Chul will be in danger.

951
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:26,520
This entire place reeks of a rotten stench.

952
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,390
I cannot breathe.

953
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,420
Kang Chul.

954
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:33,890
Who put you up to this?

955
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:37,159
Round up all the blind shamans!

956
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:41,100
His Majesty will not be able to avoid a grave disaster either.

957
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,040
That horrendous evil spirit.

958
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,470
We must find evidence, no matter what.

959
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:49,879
When was the Eight-feet Spirit first seen? Please tell me,

960
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,950
Your Majesty.
