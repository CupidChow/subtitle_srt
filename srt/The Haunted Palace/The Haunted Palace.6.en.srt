00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,560
(Yuk Seong Jae)

2
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,770
(Kim Ji Yeon)

3
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,150
(Kim Ji Hoon)

4
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,300
(The Haunted Palace)

5
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,959
(All places, organizations, characters,)

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,419
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,380
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,770
Kang Chul, now.

9
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,440
Hurry!

10
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,100
General of Heaven and Earth, please appear.

11
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,229
General of Heaven and Earth, please appear.

12
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,559
General of Heaven and Earth, please appear.

13
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,399
General of Heaven and Earth, please appear.

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,990
Come forth and appear!

15
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,250
Kang Chul!

16
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,050
Darn it.

17
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,680
Kang Chul's glowing pearl will not be enough...

18
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,100
to stop the spirit?

19
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,440
No, the paper talisman is getting ripped.

20
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,360
Stay far away.

21
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Darn it.

22
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Your Majesty, it is time.

23
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,350
General of Heaven and Earth, please appear.

24
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,730
What...

25
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,490
The General of Heaven and Earth...

26
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,410
Step aside!

27
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,540
It is that wretched shaman again.

28
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,370
It is the shaman in the Palace whose identity remains hidden.

29
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,830
Who on earth is this shaman?

30
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,420
Why is the shaman getting in my way every time?

31
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,050
Oh, General.

32
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,130
General...

33
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,110
Your departure will not be so easily granted.

34
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,500
Darn it.

35
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,600
So this is the medicine the Queen is taking these days?

36
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
It is not from the royal physician.

37
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,150
It is secretly brought in from her family's estate.

38
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,740
A prenatal stabilizer?

39
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,290
Yes. I secretly asked the female physician.

40
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,080
She said the medicine helped prevent miscarriages.

41
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,840
When Her Highness was pregnant with the young prince,

42
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,420
she often took this medicine from what I heard.

43
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,180
The royal physicians do not seem to be aware of this.

44
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,300
I do not understand why she is keeping it a secret.

45
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,520
Your Highness.

46
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,770
Bring Pung San to me.

47
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,189
Your Highness. But he is...

48
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,360
Yes, I know.

49
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,570
He is as vile as a snake.

50
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,780
However, my baby is dead.

51
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,910
My poor child...

52
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,830
How am I to make sense...

53
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,840
of his bizarre death?

54
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,930
As soon as the sun rises,

55
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,180
I will fetch the blind shaman.

56
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,530
(Episode 6: The Skull in the Pillow)

57
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,360
This is the man...

58
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,200
who put up the talisman around the library.

59
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,249
We must capture this man first...

60
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,670
to uncover who has been helping the Eight-feet Spirit.

61
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,339
We have been asking every eunuch in the Palace to track him down.

62
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,090
He may not be a eunuch.

63
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,510
Broaden the search beyond the Palace and look for him.

64
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,179
Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,429
How is the security at the young prince's chambers?

66
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,389
As you instructed, we dispatched...

67
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,850
additional royal guards and officers.

68
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,890
I handpicked only skilled and trustworthy men.

69
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,860
No one will dare to enter his chambers recklessly.

70
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,609
I have put up...

71
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,990
new paper talismans and bells around his chambers.

72
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,399
Even if someone infiltrates the security and puts up a talisman,

73
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,410
allowing the Eight-feet Spirit to enter again,

74
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,739
the spirit will be trapped around the paper talismans...

75
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,540
and the ringing of the bells will notify the intrusion.

76
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,420
By the way, I have noticed his absence today.

77
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,880
Oh, he must have strained himself during yesterday's incident.

78
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,640
He is not well, so he is resting at home.

79
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,140
I see.

80
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,320
So...

81
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,240
about the glass lens...

82
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,739
That day at Mount Bugak,

83
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,039
you fought against the spirit...

84
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,410
after stealing this lens from me.

85
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,540
You also told me to use this lens...

86
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,500
to fight against the spirit if the plan did not work.

87
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,920
What on earth is this glass lens?

88
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,470
Your Majesty, it is...

89
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,300
a warding stone.

90
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,299
A warding stone?

91
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,219
It is called the stone of the Dragon King.

92
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,220
The stone carries a mystical power.

93
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,730
You had the warding stone with you at all times.

94
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,979
Hence, you were protected from any threat...

95
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,730
of the Eight-feet Spirit.

96
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,200
Your Majesty.

97
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,160
May I ask how you came to possess the stone?

98
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,380
- I... - Could it be possible that...

99
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,960
Shaman Neop Deok gave it to you?

100
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,090
Neop Deok?

101
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,259
I am certain that it once belonged to Shaman Neop Deok.

102
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,930
It is a female warding stone.

103
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Are you certain that...

104
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,390
you do not know Shaman Neop Deok?

105
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,990
Neop Deok...

106
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,409
was a beloved shaman of my late grandmother,

107
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,330
the Dowager Queen Indeok.

108
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,500
I know that my grandmother used to call on her,

109
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,500
so the shaman came to the Palace a few times.

110
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,710
Then...

111
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:27,470
This crystal lens was given by that shaman.

112
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,390
I did not believe in shamanism,

113
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,139
but I considered it a crystal lens,

114
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,260
handled with great care from a virtuous shaman.

115
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,560
I turned it into a glass lens as you can see.

116
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,890
But...

117
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,860
how do you know Shaman Neop Deok?

118
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,150
She was...

119
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,410
my maternal grandmother.

120
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,290
What a strange connection this is.

121
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,900
My grandmother had been in the Palace?

122
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,570
By then, had she already predicted that this would happen?

123
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,030
That the Eight-feet Spirit would be threatening the royal family.

124
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,290
Is that why she gave the female warding stone...

125
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,370
to His Majesty?

126
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,290
There is only one thing...

127
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,710
I, a humble shaman, can do for the pitiful soul...

128
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,050
of Your Highness.

129
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,980
Please keep it with you all at times.

130
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,440
It will protect Your Highness.

131
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,580
I have become weaker.

132
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,500
Compared to the time at Mount Bugak, this fight was far more difficult.

133
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,880
Why...

134
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,840
Darn it.

135
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,849
You told me that the King's shaman was responsible...

136
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,770
for the passing of Prince Young In.

137
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,400
Were you able to find out who the shaman was?

138
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,320
It is about Royal Scribe Yoon Gap whom we discussed before.

139
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,779
A young woman had been with him when he was kicked out...

140
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,450
and brought back into the Palace.

141
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,870
She has been sighted numerous times in the Queen's Palace these days.

142
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Who is she?

143
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,540
People say she is a glasses-maker.

144
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,380
The King requested her presence in the library many times.

145
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,510
A glasses-maker?

146
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,140
I need to investigate further regarding this matter.

147
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,300
A mere girl could not have succeeded in stopping...

148
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,600
the powerful General of Heaven and Earth.

149
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,270
How dare you try to be cunning in front of me?

150
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,650
Your Highness.

151
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,399
That is not true.

152
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,570
If that is not the case, what can you not answer me?

153
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,990
My son suffered a tragic death.

154
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,040
But the King will father another child.

155
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,619
You told me that the King kept a shaman by his side.

156
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,919
How dare you try to deceive me with false information?

157
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,170
Your Highness.

158
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,959
The energy in the Palace shifted 15 days ago.

159
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,299
The one who entered the Palace for the first time...

160
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,839
and remained at His Majesty's side these past 15 days...

161
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,600
must be the shaman.

162
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,600
Fifteen days ago?

163
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,980
Yes. By the way,

164
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,189
regarding your comment just now,

165
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,400
have I understood correctly that another royal child shall be born?

166
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,950
The Queen is pregnant with the King's child.

167
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,830
So the General of Heaven and Earth will have another child to feed on.

168
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,619
Are you all right?

169
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,880
Yes. I am all right.

170
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,339
Why are you walking around alone in your condition?

171
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,130
Right. I do have an assistant.

172
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,139
But something came up, so he cannot accompany anymore.

173
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,140
By the way,

174
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,719
you have such good energy for a young woman.

175
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,640
- Are you a court maid? - No.

176
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,690
I am a glasses-maker at Sanguiwon.

177
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,070
You must be quite talented for a young girl.

178
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,280
Anyway, thank you.

179
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,820
Sure.

180
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,620
So it was you. Yes.

181
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,290
Is he a shaman?

182
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,330
What do you plan to do with this dreadful thing?

183
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,040
It turns out...

184
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,710
a new royal child is to be expected.

185
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,800
The fetus is not even formed yet.

186
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,050
But the fetus shall be sacrificed as a remedy...

187
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,220
to heal the General's wounds.

188
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,720
The spirit is untouched by any earthly malice.

189
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,479
It will be extremely helpful...

190
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,940
for the General to regain his strength.

191
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,420
Were you waiting for me?

192
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,130
Of course.

193
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,169
I am your guardian spirit.

194
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,550
I see. So you came to make sure other spirits did not cling onto me.

195
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,720
Yes. That is correct.

196
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,520
Are you all right?

197
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,569
I noticed that last time, you stayed in the clean fresh water...

198
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,320
to regain your strength.

199
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,360
Do you not need to go there this time?

200
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,780
I already went.

201
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,370
I see. You already went.

202
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,210
So it is about what happened yesterday.

203
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,999
I thought that since you had the glowing pearl...

204
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,790
and I had my grandmother's tools,

205
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,509
I must have fooled myself...

206
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,340
thinking that we could take down the Eight-feet Spirit.

207
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,930
Because I was impatient and reckless,

208
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,510
I caused you to strain yourself.

209
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,190
So will you quit being my disciple?

210
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,270
What?

211
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,439
You thought that I could take down the Eight-feet Spirit.

212
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,030
So you decided to become my disciple.

213
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,280
But last night, I failed to do so.

214
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,989
Therefore, you do not have...

215
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,870
any more reason left to serve me as your guardian spirit.

216
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,580
No.

217
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,249
You know that the contract between the guardian spirit...

218
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,340
and the disciple cannot be abandoned that easily.

219
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,469
I cannot say that...

220
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,380
all my hatred and resentment toward you have vanished.

221
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,970
However, I know this for sure.

222
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,850
That for a long time, you always kept me safe somehow.

223
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,900
And that you continue to do so.

224
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Am I wrong?

225
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,410
You are right.

226
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,850
How odd.

227
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,260
You are right here.

228
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,850
But I am sensing the energy of a serpent from there too.

229
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,980
Bi Bi?

230
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,450
All right. Let us have a drink.

231
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,910
- Oh, my. - Thank you.

232
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,950
Have you heard?

233
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,789
Rumor has it that the passing of Prince Young In...

234
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,500
was the spirit's doing.

235
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,790
The rumor also reached my ears too.

236
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,579
But this rumor about the spirits...

237
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,839
began with the late king, did it not?

238
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,879
Right.

239
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,009
Word has reached many ears that the spirits were behind...

240
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,929
the recent deaths in the royal family...

241
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,970
over the past few years.

242
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,219
My gosh.

243
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,180
So the spirits have been killing off the members of the royal family?

244
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,400
Well, as you know, it is a baseless rumor...

245
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,240
crafted by the court ladies without any just cause.

246
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,789
What is going on with Lord Choi Won Woo?

247
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,080
Oh, him. You see,

248
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,330
after paying his respects at the late prince's funeral,

249
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
he went back without meeting His Majesty.

250
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,380
From what I heard, he was down with an illness.

251
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,130
So it is believed he did not meet anyone here.

252
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,810
It appears you have nothing to worry about. Surely.

253
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,020
Minister of War. Allow me to pour you a drink.

254
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,280
He is my childhood friend, a provincial governor in Gwacheon.

255
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,780
My gosh.

256
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:58,990
He has been begging me...

257
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,830
for a chance to meet with you.

258
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,290
I must step out to relieve myself.

259
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,160
- Pardon? - My gosh.

260
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,250
- What... - Oh, no.

261
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,250
You...

262
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,260
Who are you looking for?

263
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,800
My younger brother.

264
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,850
A younger brother? You had a younger brother?

265
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,770
The energy of the serpent from earlier...

266
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,950
How dare you?

267
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,659
You are a mere royal scribe.

268
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,789
How dare you walk past the Minister of War without paying respects?

269
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,250
How arrogant of you!

270
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,000
Have you not been taught proper manners...

271
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,630
as you were born of lowly origins and out of wedlock?

272
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,670
It appears so.

273
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,930
- How dare you? - Right.

274
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,430
So did you turn 60 this year?

275
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,180
What?

276
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,060
If you did not, it is good news for you.

277
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,150
If you did, you must be careful here.

278
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,110
Come to think of it, I was able...

279
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,360
to claim this body and accept her as my disciple all thanks to you.

280
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,610
So I am returning the favor just for you.

281
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,320
My sword...

282
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,450
How dare he mock me?

283
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,910
You...

284
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,540
Let me warn you.

285
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,340
I am in a rush as I must go and look for my brother.

286
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,210
If you get in my way again,

287
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,720
I will not let it slide then.

288
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,810
I told you I would not let it slide.

289
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,020
Darn it. You!

290
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,460
Good grief. It was true.

291
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,249
When you kept bragging about the palm blast,

292
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,590
I thought you were just joking.

293
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,340
But you blasted off a man...

294
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,590
just now.

295
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,340
You have not seen anything yet.

296
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,390
Yeo Ri. Do not forget who I am.

297
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,560
I am the evil deity people fear above all else.

298
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,730
Wait. How far did you fly him off?

299
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,860
I am not sure.

300
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,110
By nature, wind is unpredictable.

301
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,440
So I do not know.

302
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,740
Looking at the direction, he must be heading south.

303
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,610
Perhaps, he might have reached the ocean in Jeju.

304
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,700
Unbelievable.

305
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,739
- Why did you hit me? - What do you plan to do?

306
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,700
He is the Minister of War. He is a man of high status.

307
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,670
How will you handle the consequences?

308
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,290
That man...

309
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,880
killed Yoon Gap.

310
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,089
What?

311
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,840
He was the one who stabbed Yoon Gap to death.

312
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,350
Is that true?

313
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,650
Then Kwak Sang Chung, the man you told me about before...

314
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,610
Yes. That was him.

315
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,520
I saw it happen with my own eyes.

316
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,240
Nicely done.

317
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,279
Well done.

318
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,529
If you were going to blast him off,

319
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,369
you should have sent him over to Japan.

320
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,370
Darn it.

321
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,539
- Minister Kwak. - Where is he?

322
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
- Where did he go? - Minister Kwak!

323
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:39,749
- He went this way. - Oh, no.

324
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,210
- I heard his scream from here? - Where?

325
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,170
Oh, no!

326
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,630
What...

327
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,300
You are Royal Scribe Yoon Gap, are you not?

328
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,010
My gosh.

329
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,810
What brings you...

330
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,730
to a place like this?

331
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,230
I heard Lord Kwak's scream just now.

332
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,280
Did you perhaps hurt him?

333
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,610
What?

334
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,490
Lord Ahn. That is a nasty joke.

335
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,330
Lord Kwak has remarkable martial arts skills.

336
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,699
There is no way a mere scribe could have taken him down.

337
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,620
Where on earth is Lord Kwak?

338
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,670
I just used my palm blast...

339
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,590
Along with the sound of a windblast,

340
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,090
- we also heard his scream. - Yes.

341
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,049
But we did not see anything.

342
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,340
- What? - Right?

343
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,140
You did not see anything, right?

344
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,139
- Oh, no. - Good grief.

345
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,019
- My goodness. - What should we do?

346
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,559
- Oh, no. - My gosh.

347
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,769
How could this happen?

348
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,850
- Good grief. - Oh, no.

349
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,820
A serpent.

350
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,570
There was another serpent other than Kang Chul.

351
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,850
He is dead. He killed a man in an instant.

352
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,140
Who is this serpent?

353
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
My gosh.

354
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,519
- I wonder where Lord Kwak went. - Oh, my goodness.

355
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,019
- How are we going to find him? - Lord Kwak.

356
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,780
- Let us go. - My goodness.

357
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,359
Wait. Governor Jang.

358
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,490
What?

359
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,080
What has gotten into you all of a sudden? Oh, no.

360
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,830
- Please get up. - What is happening?

361
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,700
- Open your eyes. - Why am I lying...

362
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,790
Open your eyes! Oh, no.

363
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,120
- Go and fetch a physician. - Yes.

364
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,210
- Is anyone there? - Oh, no.

365
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,459
Anyone?

366
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,919
- What is going on? - Yes, my lord.

367
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,760
Come here. Make haste.

368
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,630
- Governor Jang. - Please hurry.

369
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,589
Oh, no. Governor Jang.

370
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,800
- Let us hurry. - Gosh.

371
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,810
- Governor Jang. - My goodness.

372
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,030
Who are you?

373
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,740
Me? I am a serpent called Bi Bi.

374
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,080
I am here to eat you.

375
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,790
How could you eat me?

376
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,580
Stay there.

377
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,169
Do not come closer.

378
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,500
Do not come...

379
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,490
Goodness.

380
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,530
It has been a while since I ate well.

381
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,490
That fool's belly was so full of evil and greed.

382
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,500
It was delicious.

383
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
He ate him.

384
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,880
He ate a human.

385
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,009
You have not changed at all, Bi Bi.

386
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,010
Who are you?

387
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,180
Do you see me?

388
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,600
Wait.

389
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,860
Hey. Kang Chul, is it you?

390
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,860
My goodness.

391
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,360
It is for real.

392
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,820
Kang Chul...

393
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,870
is in there.

394
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,700
Darn it.

395
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,000
Goodness.

396
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,870
The lowly spirits in the marketplace...

397
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,629
talked about some idiot serpent...

398
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,960
getting locked up in a human body.

399
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,550
I refused to believe it.

400
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,340
But that was you, Kang Chul?

401
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,890
Darn it.

402
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,310
How did the great and lofty Kang Chul...

403
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,020
end up like this?

404
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,770
You are nothing but skin and bones.

405
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,729
Is it hard to hunt nobles?

406
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,480
Maybe I ate too many of them.

407
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,489
I came to the capital because there are...

408
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,030
almost no more nobles over 60 left in the southern region.

409
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,989
The capital is like a banquet with delicacies spread out.

410
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,660
I can pick freely.

411
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,540
How many more do you need?

412
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,830
Twelve.

413
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:31,169
Twelve more and I will have eaten one hundred nobles over sixty,

414
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,380
and I will become a black dragon and will fly sky high.

415
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,720
I will send you word from up there.

416
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,389
Kang Chul!

417
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,640
The water here is so cool! Join me soon so we can play!

418
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,190
Enough with the nonsense...

419
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,940
and get out.

420
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,270
From where?

421
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,400
Get out of that stinky human body.

422
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,280
Do you think I want to be in here?

423
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,620
What?

424
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,120
What?

425
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,450
Are you kidding me?

426
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,120
You do not know how to get out?

427
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,250
You know how?

428
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,790
It is simple.

429
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,460
The body you are in. Yoon Gap's body.

430
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,920
Break it. Kill the mortal body.

431
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,970
Humans are the easiest thing to kill.

432
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,720
I must kill...

433
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,140
this body?

434
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,350
Jump from a high cliff...

435
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,820
or stab the heart with a knife.

436
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,190
Why are you stuck when the solution is so simple?

437
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,490
Yes.

438
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,280
There is the perfect tool.

439
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,830
Take it.

440
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,330
Darn you.

441
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,170
Turn it around.

442
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Yes.

443
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,380
Stab it in.

444
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,010
Stab?

445
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,350
No!

446
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,850
How dare you try to kill his body? You can never!

447
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,690
It is the girl from before.

448
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,690
Our eyes met earlier.

449
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,900
Do you see me?

450
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
Yes.

451
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,530
And he is my guardian spirit and I am his disciple.

452
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,199
Until we catch the Eight-feet Spirit and save Young Master Yoon,

453
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,280
he agreed to keep this body intact.

454
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,620
What?

455
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,910
Gap.

456
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,830
- Get out of the way. - Gap.

457
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,380
Gap!

458
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,680
Say I am asleep.

459
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,220
Gap.

460
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,230
I came in to get these,

461
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,480
and Young Master Yoon is asleep.

462
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,070
He fell asleep already?

463
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,190
I heard voices from outside.

464
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,529
He talks dreadfully in his sleep.

465
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,320
He must have had a long day at work.

466
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,369
What should I do with the fool?

467
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,410
Why?

468
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,459
The expensive medicine I bought.

469
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,369
He scattered it all around the toilet.

470
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,380
He did what?

471
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,709
Darn you.

472
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,049
Do you know how much it cost?

473
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,879
You wasted it all!

474
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,339
You could have left it for me instead.

475
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,179
You upset me to no end.

476
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,640
You fool.

477
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,929
How can you sleep through this?

478
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,720
How can you?

479
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,350
Darn you.

480
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,820
Are you off to the toilet?

481
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,280
What a disgrace.

482
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,280
The great Kang Chul.

483
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,700
Now you have to use a dirty, smelly toilet.

484
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,540
That girl.

485
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,000
Is she the one you followed around?

486
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,220
Will you really fight that Eight-feet Spirit thing?

487
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,340
For a human girl?

488
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,340
I already promised.

489
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,930
Come on, brother.

490
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,680
Kang Chul.

491
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,520
I get it.

492
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,559
If a human with great powers honors you as their guardian...

493
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,150
and you receive their prayers,

494
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,650
you get another chance to rise. I heard that legend too.

495
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,200
But how can you trust a lowly human being?

496
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,200
Humans change their minds like we flip our hands.

497
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,040
Bi Bi.

498
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,330
Of all that I learned while living in this disgusting human world,

499
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,830
do you know what the most useful is?

500
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,040
What is it?

501
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,710
Lying.

502
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,430
You are the worst of the worst.

503
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,350
There is none more evil.

504
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,900
I will play along for a while.

505
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,490
There are many foods I have not tasted yet.

506
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,119
When that girl willingly opens up to me...

507
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,700
and does my bidding,

508
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,960
then I will kill this body, get out,

509
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,790
and take her.

510
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Yes.

511
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,920
That is a good plan.

512
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,170
Take her and just...

513
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,720
Come here, you fools!

514
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,310
Is anyone there?

515
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,980
Get me down from here.

516
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,400
You fools!

517
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,320
I am Kwak Sang Chung, the Minister of War!

518
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,740
Get me down this instant!

519
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,110
Come here, fools!

520
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,540
Is there really no one there?

521
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,170
Will someone get me down?

522
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,050
The old fools.

523
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,009
I will make them pay once I return.

524
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,050
I will...

525
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,220
No.

526
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,520
Please.

527
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,690
Please, will someone help me?

528
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,110
Get me down from here.

529
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,830
Goodness.

530
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,380
Wait.

531
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,390
Stay there. I will leave first.

532
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,319
- This is insane. - What is?

533
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,410
Darn you.

534
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,950
You startled me.

535
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,160
Not enough to make you go red in the face.

536
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,960
Well?

537
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,210
What is it?

538
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,130
About you, Yeo Ri.

539
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,170
- About you, Bi Bi. - Yes.

540
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,880
When you...

541
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,760
want to eat a human noble.

542
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,180
Do you keep noticing them?

543
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,310
Does your heart beat hard and fast when you are near them,

544
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,599
and do you want to grope them?

545
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
No.

546
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,810
Why grope when I am too busy eating?

547
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,650
Are you like that?

548
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,700
So, about Yeo Ri.

549
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,110
She finally agreed to accept me as her body's guardian spirit,

550
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,870
but I feel a burning inside when she is near.

551
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,240
Sometimes...

552
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,620
I feel as though I wish to eat her alive.

553
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,250
That is quite strange.

554
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,460
Do you feel that way about other humans?

555
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,960
Other humans?

556
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,140
Royal Scribe Yoon...

557
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,640
really lives here?

558
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,599
Would the son of a concubine with a bottom-rung job...

559
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,810
would live in a huge mansion?

560
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,860
Oh, dear.

561
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,580
I guess...

562
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,709
love that transcends social class...

563
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,919
is a story just for the books.

564
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,550
I see you suddenly got greatly enlightened.

565
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,890
Good for you.

566
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,599
We should return home, then.

567
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,390
Your father will scold you harshly if he were to find out.

568
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,690
I should...

569
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,980
return this plant.

570
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,270
What if he misses it?

571
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,210
Other humans?

572
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:34,710
Yes. See if you feel that way...

573
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,170
with any other human being.

574
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,300
Another human.

575
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,280
Another human.

576
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,500
I feel nothing...

577
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,290
at all.

578
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Young Master.

579
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,140
This is the plant you left with me.

580
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,890
I came to give it to you.

581
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,810
The plant the quack monk gave us?

582
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,180
Forget it.

583
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,350
Keep it or throw it away. Do as you wish with it.

584
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,270
What?

585
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,530
Now I get it.

586
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,370
I do not want to eat her the way Bi Bi eats men.

587
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
My goodness.

588
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,390
You stayed in your room, so I thought you would not come.

589
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,680
Why would you say that?

590
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,640
A guardian spirit must go where his disciple goes.

591
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,900
I am left with no choice.

592
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,900
I cannot eliminate...

593
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,150
the Eight-feet Spirit as I promised.

594
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,780
And I cannot...

595
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,280
eliminate this body and leave you either.

596
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,580
All I can do is keep lying...

597
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,710
and extend the time I have with you.

598
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,810
It is strange.

599
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,430
He was different.

600
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,810
He was not like when we first met.

601
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,770
How had he changed?

602
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:44,440
I felt more of a wild side to him.

603
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,070
I like him even more now.

604
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,700
He is not cool at all.

605
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,489
He pushed you aside.

606
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,870
That was because he felt embarrassed.

607
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,160
See? He even gave me this as a present.

608
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,750
Did you not hear him say you could throw it out?

609
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,340
Do you not get it?

610
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,509
He acts all gruff and unfriendly,

611
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:09,300
but he has a warm heart.

612
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,759
The storybooks are full of such men.

613
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
Oh, sure. If you say so.

614
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,690
What is the matter?

615
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,400
- What is it? - Keep quiet.

616
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:30,950
Father?

617
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,410
What is he doing with a thug like them?

618
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,589
You may eat.

619
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,670
The girls who make the desserts are pretty skilled.

620
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,630
Thank you.

621
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,520
Would you mind if I took them with me...

622
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,849
instead of eating them here?

623
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:07,270
Why? You want to share it with Royal Scribe Yoon?

624
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,570
It is not just that, but...

625
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:14,280
He is waiting outside because...

626
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,580
he is not allowed in your chambers.

627
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,870
Do not worry and eat.

628
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,620
I will give you some to share with him later.

629
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,419
Give them dashik and yakgwa instead of yugwa, Mother.

630
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,840
They are more tasty.

631
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:34,050
I see you took a liking to Royal Scribe Yoon.

632
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,389
- Did he treat you nicely? - It was more like...

633
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,100
Rather than that...

634
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:44,900
He is funny.

635
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,439
I have never seen anyone like him in the Palace.

636
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
What?

637
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,110
- Your Highness. - Mother.

638
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:05,880
A vision?

639
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,920
I apologize.

640
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,420
I feel...

641
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,010
too nauseous.

642
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,300
Your Highness. Are you all right?

643
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,930
You should leave for now.

644
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:24,980
Of course.

645
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,770
Your Highness. Are you all right?

646
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,610
Why are you standing there?

647
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,950
Your Highness. Have you...

648
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,450
been suffering from bad dreams at night?

649
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,240
How do you know that?

650
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,170
Take the prince and leave us.

651
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,860
How could you tell?

652
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,990
I just saw a vision about you.

653
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:26,910
You were struggling with a nightmare.

654
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,170
I have been having...

655
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,800
that bad dream for days now.

656
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,870
At first,

657
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,750
I simply thought it was a horrendous nightmare.

658
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,630
But as time went on, the dream became more vivid.

659
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,340
It felt so real.

660
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:24,180
Did you say some kind of black liquid poured out of his mouth?

661
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,230
Could you figure out the meaning behind it?

662
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,730
Please allow me to quickly inspect Your Highness' bedchamber.

663
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,590
Oh, my!

664
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,010
Minister of War!

665
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,720
Thank goodness you are okay.

666
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,050
The skies must have protected you.

667
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,930
I am truly relieved to see you.

668
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:06,680
What on earth happened?

669
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:09,810
They combed through the capital to find you.

670
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,559
Where have you been?

671
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,399
- What? - My goodness.

672
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,360
Gosh, your leg! What happened?

673
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,980
Yoon Gap.

674
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,150
Where is that punk, Yoon Gap?

675
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,820
Pardon me?

676
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,130
That scoundrel.

677
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,000
That little...

678
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,630
Why, you...

679
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,050
Darn you.

680
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,890
You. What are you, a ghost?

681
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,390
What did you do?

682
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,310
What on earth did you do to me?

683
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:52,600
You came back sooner than I thought.

684
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,730
And you are in better shape...

685
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,650
than I thought.

686
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,520
What did you say? You punk!

687
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,900
I will be sure to kill you.

688
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,859
I will make you pay for everything you did to me and more!

689
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,620
What is this ruckus all about?

690
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:11,700
- Your Majesty. - Minister of War.

691
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,040
What in the world happened to you?

692
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:18,169
And what did Royal Scribe Yoon do to you...

693
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:19,630
that you are so angry now?

694
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,959
This scoundrel made me...

695
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,840
He caused a whirlwind to...

696
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,850
The whirlwind...

697
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,530
I do not expect you to be polite to me.

698
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,490
After all, you are not Yoon Gap.

699
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,910
You are neither my vassal nor my subject.

700
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,660
If you know all that, just be on your way.

701
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,499
Why did you call me here?

702
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,540
However,

703
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,790
the moment people start gossiping about you for acting up like this,

704
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,550
I can no longer protect you or Yeo Ri.

705
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,260
Is that all right with you?

706
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,350
In other words, you have ordered us to stop the Eight-feet Spirit,

707
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,470
but if things go south,

708
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,730
you will wash your hands of it, and it will all be on us?

709
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:22,770
Is that what you mean?

710
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,490
You insolent punk.

711
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,570
- How dare you... - You are right.

712
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,200
I am not your subject.

713
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:32,870
I am...

714
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,040
Kang Chul.

715
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,000
Kang Chul?

716
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,460
People say where Kang Chul walks, autumn turns to spring.

717
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,760
You mean, that spiteful serpent?

718
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,470
The evil deity in the legends?

719
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:57,020
I have heard the story too, Your Majesty.

720
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,480
The serpent that wanted to ascend as a dragon...

721
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:02,770
but fell back to the ground as it was spotted by a human.

722
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,150
That is why it makes humans suffer.

723
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,650
That serpent full of malice.

724
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:10,570
That is...

725
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,780
you?

726
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,130
It is clean.

727
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,390
I do not see anything wrong here. Why did she have such a dream?

728
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,110
Would Your Highness...

729
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,610
kindly allow me to come up for a moment?

730
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,450
Yes.

731
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,250
What is the matter?

732
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:12,690
Your Highness.

733
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,250
Oh, my goodness.

734
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:29,040
Do you now understand...

735
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,300
who I truly am?

736
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,049
The shallowness of the human eyes...

737
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,850
might prevent you from fully understanding it.

738
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,640
You will keep seeing me around for a while,

739
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:44,810
so I shall be kind and explain in depth.

740
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:46,850
Listen carefully.

741
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,520
Let us say the king is here.

742
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,940
I, Kang Chul, am a deity, albeit an evil one.

743
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:55,530
That means I am up here.

744
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:00,450
So, who should be polite to whom?

745
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:02,950
What do you say?

746
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,550
By the way,

747
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,220
what happened between you and the Minister of War?

748
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,889
I heard you were seen at the spot...

749
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:20,390
where he disappeared.

750
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,970
Was it your doing?

751
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:23,470
Oh, that.

752
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,889
He kept barking like an annoying mutt,

753
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,890
so I caused a whirlwind and blew him away.

754
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,400
A whirl...

755
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,570
- What? - A whirlwind.

756
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,990
I used my palm blast to make him blow away in a whirlwind.

757
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,160
What? Come again?

758
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,080
You used your palm blast to do what?

759
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:45,250
How many times must I tell you?

760
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,370
I made him blow away in the wind.

761
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,630
But I am confined in this human body at the moment,

762
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,550
so I cannot use my powers to their fullest.

763
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:58,300
I thought the wind would carry him all the way to Jeju Island,

764
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:00,180
but he managed to return in a few days,

765
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,760
so I suppose it could not carry him that far.

766
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,100
So,

767
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,350
you caused a whirlwind that blew him away?

768
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,440
You did that?

769
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Your Majesty!

770
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,830
We have a problem.

771
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,390
This was found...

772
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,390
in the queen's chambers?

773
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,600
And my queen? Is she all right?

774
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,520
Yes. She fainted for a moment,

775
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,820
but the physician says she is okay now.

776
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:58,690
However...

777
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:03,990
She is carrying a child in her womb now,

778
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,490
so the physician says she must be very careful.

779
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,210
What do you mean?

780
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,040
She is carrying a child?

781
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:18,210
Are you saying Her Highness is pregnant now?

782
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:22,010
Your Majesty! Please take my life.

783
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,889
Her Highness was deeply afraid...

784
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,349
something bad might happen because of the Eight-feet Spirit,

785
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,430
so I could not tell Your Majesty.

786
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:36,730
Then this skull is...

787
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,089
I trust my wish will be granted expeditiously.

788
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,549
I trust my wish will be granted expeditiously.

789
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:10,350
I trust my wish will be granted expeditiously.

790
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,410
Goodness. That is...

791
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,840
(Fire)

792
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,380
What is that?

793
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,930
This was made by the person...

794
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,730
who wrote that talisman from the other day.

795
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,310
That must mean...

796
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,110
this has something to do with the Eight-feet Spirit.

797
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:00,730
Correct.

798
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,030
And this talisman is...

799
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,320
Speak!

800
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,820
It seems to have been made...

801
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,620
to cause harm to the child in Her Highness' womb.

802
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,980
Arrest all the court ladies and maids...

803
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,100
in the Queen's Palace without a single exception!

804
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

805
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:52,620
One moment.

806
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,660
Please allow me to have another look at it.

807
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,460
What are you trying to do?

808
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:03,800
I cannot just stand idly by.

809
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,260
How could they even try to harm a child in the womb?

810
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,550
I will make them pay for this.

811
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,800
Can you find out more?

812
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:15,060
The ghost that has been haunting Her Highness must be here.

813
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,350
It seems that the energy is blocked for some reason.

814
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,569
I should go to Sanguiwon to get my myeongdu.

815
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:27,240
(Myeongdu: A shamanic mirror that reflects spirits)

816
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:00,940
Stop!

817
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:03,560
Never do that.

818
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:04,980
What did I tell you?

819
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,990
Like I said, the myeongdu reflects spirits...

820
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:15,070
and the world that humans cannot see.

821
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,660
It is through the myeongdu that a shaman can deliver messages.

822
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,790
Treasure it as if it is part of your body.

823
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,210
You ought to cherish it.

824
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,920
The myeongdu reflects spirits.

825
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,510
With this...

826
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,220
What is the matter?

827
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,950
You had better surrender.

828
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:03,410
With his swordsmanship, he can easily make...

829
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,710
a measly spirit like you vanish instantly without a trace.

830
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,220
He is a water spirit.

831
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,850
What? No way.

832
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,520
A water spirit held out for so long out of water?

833
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,150
I bet it was because of that talisman.

834
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,650
That was why the water spirit could stay out of the water.

835
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:37,660
He got away through this waterway.

836
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:39,030
We must catch him.

837
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,060
There he is.

838
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,150
That is where he is hiding.

839
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:35,760
Do not let it go.

840
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,640
I wish to pull a spirit out of the water.

841
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:45,680
Please understand.

842
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,120
I got him.

843
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:13,710
Darn it.

844
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,050
- Are you all right? - Yes.

845
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,690
What is wrong?

846
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:11,940
You trifling spirit.

847
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:07,160
(The Haunted Palace)

848
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:10,079
Confess the truth and tell us who ordered such a thing,

849
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,119
and I will spare you.

850
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,539
I thought Your Highness might know something.

851
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,880
Do you suspect me?

852
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:20,920
This is strange. My body feels so heavy.

853
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:22,670
It got to her, at last.

854
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,049
My queen exhibited the same symptoms.

855
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:27,889
That evil water spirit is still after the child in the womb.

856
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,810
Will you offer your son instead?

857
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,889
There is only one way.

858
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:34,769
We must catch the spirit that did this.

859
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:36,730
If we keep dragging this out, Yeo Ri will die.
