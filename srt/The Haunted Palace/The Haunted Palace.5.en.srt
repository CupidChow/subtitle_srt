1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,600
(Yuk Seong Jae)

2
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,940
(Kim Ji Yeon)

3
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,190
(Kim Ji Hoon)

4
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,300
(The Haunted Palace)

5
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,090
(All places, organizations, characters,)

6
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,840
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,340
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,940
What happened to him?

9
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,360
Is he dead?

10
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,690
Yes.

11
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,030
He is.

12
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,700
Who on earth did this to him?

13
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,570
I do not know, My Majesty.

14
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,240
When I came this morning...

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,950
bearing a bowl of water for His Highness' morning wash...

16
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,330
And there was no trace of intrusion.

17
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,380
Then who is responsible for this tragedy?

18
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,390
It is the same stench that filled the young prince's chambers.

19
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,650
Move out of my way.

20
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,400
No.

21
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,910
No... This cannot be.

22
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,120
Remove this.

23
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,790
This cannot be true. No.

24
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,620
Bo, wake up.

25
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,210
Your mother is here.

26
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,380
Please wake up.

27
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,630
Open your eyes!

28
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,380
Do not just stand there.

29
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,640
Make haste and save him!

30
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,890
The Eight-feet Spirit.

31
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,220
The Eight-feet Spirit will return.

32
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,600
Please open your eyes!

33
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,560
My goodness. Oh, my body.

34
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,810
Oh, my.

35
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,980
You...

36
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,820
How long have you been perching there?

37
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,320
Were you so concerned about Yeo Ri's well-being overnight?

38
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,740
To the point that you stood guard...

39
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,200
enduring the chill of the morning dew?

40
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,490
The Eight-feet Spirit is not an ordinary spirit.

41
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,120
You are right about that. That clever girl has even asked...

42
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,080
to retrieve her grandmother's shamanic tools.

43
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,830
It must not be an ordinary spirit.

44
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,090
You.

45
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,550
I hear that you are the most revered for your expertise in gubyeongsisik.

46
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,300
(Expelling spirits from possessed bodies and guiding departed souls)

47
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,560
Is that what Yeo Ri said?

48
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,930
There is an evil spirit called the Eight-feet Spirit.

49
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,890
I can only hold off the spirit temporarily with my power.

50
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,690
I cannot get rid of him for good.

51
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,280
Quack.

52
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,320
Could you guide the evil spirit out of this world?

53
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,040
Do you truly know nothing? Is that why you are asking me?

54
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,540
Know what?

55
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,590
The only way to settle the deep resentment...

56
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,470
of such a powerful evil spirit and truly guide to the afterlife.

57
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,100
The dragon's pearl.

58
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,350
Or something that could be found within the body of a serpent...

59
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,770
like you.

60
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,020
A glowing pearl.

61
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,120
Without it,

62
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,870
the resentment of the evil spirit will never be quelled.

63
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,290
Let us begin!

64
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,550
Here it goes!

65
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,790
Therefore, there is...

66
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,710
only one feasible way to guide the Eight-feet Spirit.

67
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,500
It is for you...

68
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,880
to sacrifice yourself.

69
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,670
Like you said,

70
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,720
you could hold off the spirit temporarily with the glowing pearl.

71
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,220
But that is all.

72
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,100
You must deplete the energy of the glowing pearl...

73
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,680
in your stomach and sacrifice yourself,

74
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,520
so that a powerful evil spirit like the Eight-feet Spirit...

75
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,400
may be guided out of the world.

76
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,070
What do you say?

77
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,570
Will you do what I suggest?

78
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,450
You quack.

79
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,570
You must have a death wish.

80
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,660
You want me to use up...

81
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,040
the energy of my glowing pearl and die just to get rid of...

82
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,250
the Eight-feet Spirit?

83
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,110
Are you planning to leave?

84
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,030
Yes.

85
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,610
If I delay it any longer,

86
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,200
I may never be able to save Scribe Yoon.

87
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,740
I should give it another shot now that I have Grandma's tools.

88
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,210
What is it?

89
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,590
What?

90
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,350
You are not ready to serve me as your guardian spirit.

91
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,970
You sounded so confident when you promised me offerings.

92
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,560
Offerings?

93
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,150
Does it mean...

94
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,610
you are accepting my offer?

95
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,690
I will decide after I see your effort behind the offerings.

96
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,460
I finished making it a while ago.

97
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,170
But you have been so distant lately.

98
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,550
I did not have the chance to talk to you.

99
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,970
I assure you that I made it with all my heart.

100
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,090
I fully devoted my heart to each woven thread,

101
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,600
praying with each one...

102
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,390
from scratch.

103
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,190
Will you truly be my guardian spirit?

104
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,280
Can you truly get rid of the Eight-feet Spirit...

105
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,740
and save Scribe Yoon?

106
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,870
Yes.

107
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,410
I will do what you want.

108
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,200
So...

109
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,750
prepare for the ritual first.

110
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,710
- The ritual? - I am stuck in this human body.

111
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,000
It may not be a proper spirit-acceptance ritual.

112
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,090
But it must still carry the basic elements of one.

113
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,010
Yes, you are right. Rituals are important.

114
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,050
What else must I prepare other than the offering table?

115
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,430
Oh, right. Wait here.

116
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,060
Hold on.

117
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,300
Bring my boy back.

118
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,800
My son!

119
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,800
I trusted you.

120
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,680
But you failed to protect my son.

121
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
How could you let him die?

122
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,650
I will rip you into pieces.

123
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,230
I will tear you apart and kill you!

124
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,070
Your Highness.

125
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,070
I, your humble servant, failed to protect Prince Young In.

126
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,410
Allow me to pay for my failure with my death.

127
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes.

128
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,540
I will kill you then.

129
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,210
I shall kill you,

130
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,050
so...

131
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,390
he has company on his way to the afterlife.

132
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,270
If it were possible, I would gladly...

133
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,770
sacrifice myself 10 or 100 times. However,

134
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,650
we must bring justice...

135
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
for our wronged prince, must we not?

136
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,740
Bring justice?

137
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,570
There is a powerful shaman in the Palace.

138
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,870
There was nothing I could do to stop this shaman.

139
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,620
We must find this shaman.

140
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,330
If we fail,

141
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,130
you will also be in danger, Your Highness.

142
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,880
My son, Bo,

143
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,220
died because of...

144
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,350
that shaman?

145
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,720
Yes.

146
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,930
A new presence must have entered His Majesty's inner circle recently.

147
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,060
That must be the presence of the new shaman.

148
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,240
Then the King...

149
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,740
Yes.

150
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,160
Technically, this is all because of that mystery shaman.

151
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,290
Had the shaman not attacked the General of Heaven and Earth,

152
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,250
the General would not have hurt Prince Young In.

153
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,590
But who on earth is this shaman?

154
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,510
(Episode 5: The Eight-feet Spirit Has an Ally)

155
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,010
I, your disciple, will accept you as my guardian spirit...

156
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,260
and serve you wholeheartedly.

157
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,760
I, Serpent Kang Chul,

158
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,760
will accept you as my disciple...

159
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,560
and always have your back.

160
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Give me your hand.

161
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,860
When did you prepare the ring?

162
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,280
When you were putting together the table for the ritual,

163
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,910
I went down to the marketplace and bought it.

164
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,040
Do you like it?

165
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,170
Well, it is not awful.

166
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,460
I will not cleanse my hair yet.

167
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,590
When you save Scribe Yoon from the Eight-feet Spirit...

168
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,340
and leave his body,

169
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,720
I will cleanse it to make it official.

170
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,470
Suit yourself.

171
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,350
However,

172
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,730
even if Yoon Gap's spirit cannot return to this body,

173
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,660
you will continue to be my disciple regardless of the outcome.

174
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,200
What do you mean?

175
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,870
It is as I have stated.

176
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,540
I could leave his body in the end,

177
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,670
but it does not guarantee his spirit can find its way back.

178
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,170
Even you cannot be certain of it.

179
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,840
No, I cannot be.

180
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,260
Furthermore,

181
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,550
even if you manage to save Yoon Gap's spirit...

182
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,260
and bring him back to life,

183
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,640
nothing will change...

184
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,180
until I ascend to the sky as a dragon.

185
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,140
No matter how deeply you care for him,

186
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,980
I will never...

187
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,900
let go of you.

188
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,980
I know that.

189
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,480
So...

190
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,700
make sure to get rid of the Eight-feet Spirit.

191
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,120
Fine.

192
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,490
As long as you serve me as your guardian spirit,

193
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,410
I will destroy the Eight-feet Spirit,

194
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,960
leaving no trace of it behind.

195
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,220
Your Majesty, the departure of Prince Young In...

196
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,770
has left all of us in shock.

197
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,440
I propose that we postpone the court assembly...

198
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
and perform the funeral rites...

199
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,610
in accordance with the customs.

200
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,150
Proceed thusly then.

201
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,150
Follow the established customs.

202
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,030
However, you must pay special attention to the funeral.

203
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,450
Dispatch the chief royal secretary and offer condolences...

204
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,770
Your Majesty.

205
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,780
Your Majesty.

206
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,660
Your Majesty. Are you well?

207
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,790
Premier.

208
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,040
I must have been quite tired.

209
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,420
I asked to see you here,

210
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,920
but how could I doze off like this?

211
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,890
There is no need to put on an act in front of me.

212
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,640
Ever since the passing of the late king,

213
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,890
you have always...

214
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,070
viled your emotions, not revealing a hint of your feelings.

215
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,860
This very side of you has made you a great king.

216
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,820
However, watching you...

217
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,580
has been nothing but agony as if my heart was ripped from my chest.

218
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,120
I am well aware that you treasured...

219
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,080
the late prince.

220
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,000
Everyone...

221
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,050
only talked about him...

222
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,220
as a royal-blooded threat to my throne.

223
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,890
But my heart was only filled with pity that...

224
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,100
he had lost his father at a young age.

225
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,150
As he aged, his nature grew darker...

226
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,940
and his action led to much strife.

227
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,770
Despite his shortcomings,

228
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,650
I never once wished this would be his end.

229
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,120
Not even for a moment.

230
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,370
Your Majesty.

231
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,370
Could this truly be the spirit's doing?

232
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Your Majesty.

233
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,380
Such a notion is preposterous.

234
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,130
Spirits?

235
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,180
Yes.

236
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,800
I know.

237
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,140
What I just said was nothing but a preposterous comment.

238
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,150
Yeo Ri.

239
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,370
Here.

240
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,490
We have a long way to go. So carrying this...

241
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,950
It is a caragana root.

242
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,580
It will come in handy one day.

243
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,420
Take good care of it.

244
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Go on.

245
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,460
I might need to use this?

246
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,460
For what?

247
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,170
Never skip watering it.

248
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,140
Water it whenever the topsoil gets dry.

249
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,050
And...

250
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,440
What? What do you want?

251
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,810
- No. - Nothing. I was just looking.

252
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,780
I hope you live for another 1,000 or 10,000 years...

253
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,200
all by yourself, suffering from boredom.

254
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,950
- What? You... - All right then.

255
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,450
It gets dark faster in the mountains,

256
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,530
so you must hurry.

257
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,780
Go on.

258
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,620
Good grief.

259
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,210
I hope he does not feel so tired.

260
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,840
- I am worried about his condition. - Yes, that is right.

261
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,420
It is quite a long trip.

262
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,130
It is him! Lord Choi Won Woo has arrived.

263
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,840
Lord Choi.

264
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Lord Choi!

265
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,610
It has been five years.

266
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,700
Your effort in enduring such a long journey is admirable.

267
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,580
My gosh.

268
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,700
I, only a humble man, do not deserve such a grand welcome.

269
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,750
Please do not be so modest.

270
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,290
Every scholar in our country...

271
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,210
admires and has great respect for you.

272
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,550
I only returned as there is a royal funeral.

273
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,800
I do not wish to make a fuss.

274
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,010
I urge all of you to return home now.

275
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,810
Notify me when everyone outside has left.

276
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,900
There is a place I must go discreetly.

277
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,560
You must be fatigued from the trip.

278
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,570
Do you plan to go somewhere else before offering your condolences?

279
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,460
We will be in the capital after this hill.

280
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,170
Let us go to the gate of the capital first.

281
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,210
If we cannot enter through there,

282
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,000
we will look for another way to enter the capital.

283
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,020
Five desires and seven emotions arise from the five senses.

284
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,480
They originate from the five sensory organs.

285
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,570
As long as I do not look at her,

286
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,530
desires or emotions will not stir within me.

287
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,280
What are you doing?

288
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,280
Did our trip to the temple make you want to recite the Buddhist chant?

289
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,870
Well,

290
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,830
as a guardian spirit, I pondered why...

291
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,580
humans easily gave into sin and readily turned evil.

292
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,170
I see.

293
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,260
So did you come to any fruitful realization?

294
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,590
Now that I reside in a human body, I have come to understand all.

295
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,470
Having a physical body like this is the problem itself.

296
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,640
It is also the source of their sin.

297
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,390
Our eyes, tongue, ears, and sense of touch...

298
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,310
lead to desires.

299
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,310
Hence, humans commit so many evil deeds.

300
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,940
Look at this.

301
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,730
You are touching me now.

302
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,570
Deep in my heart...

303
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,160
Wait.

304
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,630
Oh, no.

305
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,510
Stop the palanquin!

306
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,390
Stop!

307
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,700
I told you not to overeat earlier.

308
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,950
Yakgwa is not making me nauseous.

309
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,620
The palanquin is extremely unstable.

310
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,420
How could I not get nauseous?

311
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,550
You easily become nauseous in the palanquin.

312
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,510
You could have just stayed home.

313
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,050
Why did you have to follow your father to the capital?

314
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,720
Oh, that?

315
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,430
I wanted to look around the capital as I had been away for a while.

316
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,770
Why did you smirk like that?

317
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,270
Did you think you could fool me?

318
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,150
You are here because you want to meet this guy, Yoon Gap.

319
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,440
I already looked into him.

320
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,030
He was born out of wedlock.

321
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,240
He serves as a scribe which is basically a lowly post...

322
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,820
of no importance.

323
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,370
Did I say I planned to marry him?

324
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,750
I just wished to see his face once. That is all.

325
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,040
Nothing will happen by looking at his handsome face.

326
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,550
- My gosh. - What?

327
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,220
Oh, yes.

328
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,550
- What? - Go inside.

329
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,900
What? Why did you go into my palanquin?

330
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,200
He wants us to be quiet.

331
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,330
By the way,

332
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,540
what do you plan on doing in the palanquin?

333
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,970
Could you move back a bit?

334
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,930
It feels like I am being strangled.

335
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,050
Did you not see a man and wench on the run headed this way?

336
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,850
Tell him that I did not see anyone matching the description.

337
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,520
You heard that, right?

338
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,390
She did not see anyone.

339
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,380
Have you already forgotten His Majesty's command...

340
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,670
that you were never to show your face around the capital?

341
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,090
Why have you returned so soon after being cast out?

342
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,560
So we did not enter the capital.

343
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
What?

344
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,600
Yes, you are right.

345
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,230
We had no reason to run for our lives.

346
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,480
The command was never to enter the capital.

347
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,030
Why would you berate us for being outside?

348
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,280
Why?

349
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,370
Then you had no intention of entering...

350
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,830
the capital?

351
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,330
Well, no, I would say so.

352
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,370
In that case, you both must come with me.

353
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,250
Where to?

354
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,380
Will you take us far away again?

355
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,510
Will you?

356
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,930
Someone is looking for you.

357
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,260
What?

358
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,890
(Do not enter)

359
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,030
Will you tell us now...

360
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,950
what exactly happened?

361
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,660
We were thrown out.

362
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,240
Are we allowed to enter the Palace?

363
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,290
Follow me.

364
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,260
Where are...

365
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,890
The prince who lived here.

366
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,520
Is he dead?

367
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,940
How do you know that?

368
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,730
I saw a vision of him once before.

369
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,610
Three days ago,

370
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,570
he was found here deceased.

371
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,960
Something is off.

372
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,040
If he died mysteriously,

373
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,960
his negative energy or soul would remain where he died.

374
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,260
I do not sense anything.

375
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,400
A talisman?

376
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,860
There is more to this.

377
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,860
You.

378
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,610
It was you?

379
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,320
You did that to the prince?

380
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,490
No. It was not me.

381
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,530
It was not you? Then why did you try to run?

382
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,370
Because I knew you would suspect me.

383
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,750
What?

384
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,830
Yes. He had massacred my whole family,

385
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,920
and I did come here because I hated him.

386
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,460
But this was not my doing.

387
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,510
I did not forget the promise I made you.

388
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,510
No!

389
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,060
Go away.

390
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,450
The Eight-feet Spirit?

391
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,240
He appeared himself?

392
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,790
Darn it.

393
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,420
That explains the stench.

394
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,460
What are you doing here?

395
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,760
How are you in the Palace when I threw you out of the capital?

396
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,930
Was this your doing?

397
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,140
Did you dare go against my command...

398
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,270
and let them into the Palace?

399
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

400
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,230
I brought them here.

401
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,060
I know I could lose my life for this,

402
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,570
but I believed I was doing right by you.

403
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,780
What?

404
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,240
It was my idea.

405
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,540
My dear Queen.

406
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,750
I asked Officer Seo...

407
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,590
to bring them both back here.

408
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,220
Do not punish him.

409
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,130
Punish me instead.

410
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,760
My Queen.

411
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,850
He is a member of the Royal Guard.

412
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,970
How could you break the rules...

413
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,440
and give a personal command to an officer?

414
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,770
Because...

415
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,940
I cannot lose anyone.

416
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
Not my son...

417
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,530
or you.

418
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,620
I cannot lose anyone.

419
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,540
I cannot allow anyone to die...

420
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,670
before my own eyes...

421
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,800
the way Prince Young In did!

422
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,060
You can be the sage king who upholds law and order.

423
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,560
I will be...

424
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,190
an immoral mother who holds purging rituals.

425
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:23,400
If you fear this could tarnish your immaculate reign,

426
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,440
all you must do is drive me away.

427
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,740
That is the length I will go...

428
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,910
to protect you and my son.

429
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,670
So Your Majesty.

430
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,590
Please...

431
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,630
Enough! Stop!

432
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,470
You there. Did the lord master send you?

433
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,720
Will you please lead me to him?

434
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,260
I will explain everything.

435
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,640
Please take me to him.

436
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,020
Oh, my gosh.

437
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,650
My lord master.

438
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,320
My lord master.

439
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,740
My lord.

440
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,740
My lord master. Please.

441
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,530
I was not behind Prince Young In's death.

442
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,490
The General of Heaven and Earth was angered.

443
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,870
Please give me one more chance.

444
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,170
My lord master.

445
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,000
Did you hear how Prince Young In died?

446
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,250
The General of Heaven and Earth...

447
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,670
will not do anything as trivial and possess others.

448
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,840
He will take lives directly.

449
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,890
You can get what you want without getting your hands dirty.

450
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,600
So please,

451
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,020
give me one more chance.

452
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,390
My lord master.

453
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,560
My lord master.

454
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,190
My lord.

455
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,450
My gosh. What is happening?

456
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,530
He gives you a month.

457
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,990
Prince Gwang must die by then...

458
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,540
or he will have your limbs ripped out.

459
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,330
Very well.

460
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,920
I understand.

461
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,920
I understand, my lord master.

462
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,920
This was under the prince's chambers.

463
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,970
That girl found it.

464
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,350
This was written...

465
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,150
with ash from a fire.

466
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

467
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,490
When we were on Mount Bugak,

468
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,240
the Eight-feet Spirit burned the charcoal in the sacred rope,

469
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,570
and it let out a unique stench that smelled like burning.

470
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,540
The Eight-feet Spirit relates to fire.

471
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,330
Fire?

472
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,330
It is a fire spirit?

473
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,460
That is correct.

474
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,380
It moves through fire...

475
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,500
and can light its own flames.

476
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,670
I think the Eight-feet Spirit was burned to death.

477
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,640
Of anyone who could have a grudge against the royal family,

478
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,180
does anyone come to mind?

479
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:54,110
We must identify the spirit and know what their grudge is...

480
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,360
if we are to truly send it to the afterworld.

481
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,450
I have no idea.

482
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,200
I cannot think of anyone.

483
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,300
Hot! It is burning hot!

484
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,800
Hold it up.

485
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,550
It is not hot.

486
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,470
Hold it up.

487
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,680
I am incompatible with fire and I cannot touch it.

488
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,770
Why you...

489
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,730
Like this?

490
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,530
The writing is crude,

491
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,950
but it was written with great power.

492
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,080
The Eight-feet Spirit...

493
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,170
has not fully recovered yet.

494
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,500
It is not doing well at all since I stabbed it with the blade.

495
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,340
How can you tell that from one talisman?

496
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,090
Come on.

497
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,470
Think about it.

498
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,550
He feeds off the souls of royals to gain power.

499
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,390
He needed a victim,

500
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,470
but had no energy to move himself.

501
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,890
So he entered with this talisman that breaks through locks...

502
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,270
and inhaled the poor prince.

503
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Someone...

504
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,570
offered up the prince as a sacrifice.

505
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,110
To the Eight-feet Spirit.

506
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,990
Are you saying...

507
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,330
someone in the Palace is aiding the Eight-feet Spirit?

508
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,250
You are catching up at last.

509
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:33,830
Who on earth would do something so scary and immoral?

510
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,000
The problem is that it does not end there.

511
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,880
The Eight-feet Spirit possessed the young prince...

512
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,130
and taunted him for a long time.

513
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,260
It enjoyed every moment as it drove the prince mad.

514
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,390
But it was different this time.

515
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,520
He killed the prince right away.

516
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,640
To heal the internal injury it sustained...

517
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,600
while fighting us on Mount Bugak?

518
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,520
Yes, that is right. And...

519
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,150
it will continue on this path.

520
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,110
If you cannot stop him, you die on the spot.

521
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,620
That goes for both...

522
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,910
you and your son.

523
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,640
We uphold Confucian's teachings,

524
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,940
and I am King of such a nation.

525
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,320
That is why...

526
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,360
I cannot command a purging ritual.

527
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,070
However, this goes beyond spirits. It now involves people.

528
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,410
As King,

529
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,460
I am about to say something that goes against...

530
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,920
the beliefs and rules that I held dear.

531
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,050
Can you stop the evil spirit?

532
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,920
I cannot say for sure.

533
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,090
However,

534
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,470
there is someone I must save...

535
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,060
by eliminating the Eight-feet Spirit.

536
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,110
Yoon Gap will be reinstated as Royal Scribe.

537
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:23,990
I will keep him close...

538
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,610
and he will carry out my secret errands.

539
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,240
Yeo Ri will work at Sanguiwon.

540
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,870
As the private glasses-maker to all the royals,

541
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,500
she will make glasses for me whenever I ask.

542
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,420
Your Highness.

543
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,430
You must be so distraught.

544
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,970
As soon as I heard the news,

545
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,100
I was overcome with sadness...

546
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,980
and it felt as if the skies had fallen.

547
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,360
Do you know...

548
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,110
what I am most resentful about right now?

549
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,700
I carried him and labored to birth him,

550
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,040
and yet I never loved him as a son.

551
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
I actually...

552
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,040
hated him.

553
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,880
Your Highness.

554
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,630
I never hugged him. Not even once.

555
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,970
I never...

556
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,090
called his name gently, with love.

557
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,850
That...

558
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,850
That is...

559
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,390
what upsets me the most.

560
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,020
My lord.

561
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,890
I saw Yoon Gap in the Palace earlier today.

562
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,190
What do you mean?

563
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,110
He was thrown out and chased away from the capital.

564
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,110
It seemed that His Majesty brought him back.

565
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,490
He left the Royal Library a short while ago.

566
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:34,870
Not him again.

567
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,410
I remember...

568
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,330
nothing.

569
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,000
He said he remembered nothing,

570
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,500
but his eyes said he knew everything.

571
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:50,300
Why did the King bring him back?

572
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,090
Get that away from me.

573
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,180
It is good for you.

574
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:57,770
- Oh, my gosh. - Hey.

575
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,640
Drink this up. Come on.

576
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:03,400
- Gap. Drink it. - Do not come closer.

577
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,520
I told you I did not want it.

578
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,360
How can you say that about something this expensive?

579
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,240
I asked all sorts of people...

580
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,360
and went to a skilled physician a village over to get this.

581
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,580
A cow's brain, a snake's tail, and a dried centipede are in that.

582
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,370
How can you ask me to drink it?

583
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,000
I dislike the smell to start with.

584
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,790
- You drink it. - Our ancestors said...

585
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,790
what is good for you tastes bitter.

586
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,170
I was told this would help bring your wayward mind...

587
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,340
back to where it belongs.

588
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,960
Please.

589
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,880
You got thrown out of the Palace because you caused trouble...

590
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,840
with your amnesia and madness.

591
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,510
Drink this because I cannot and will not put up with that again.

592
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,890
How dare you, you fool?

593
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,900
- Yeo Ri. - Yes?

594
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,030
Hold him down.

595
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,200
Oh... Yes, I will.

596
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,410
Do not dare!

597
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,200
Stay right there.

598
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,870
I will use my palm blast...

599
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,240
even on you Yeo Ri...

600
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,410
Oh, come on.

601
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:02,750
Not that silly palm blast you keep talking about.

602
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,160
That is so not scary.

603
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,250
You dare take that tone with your body's guardian spirit?

604
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,380
Oh, my goodness.

605
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,340
He is talking nonsense about guardian spirits now.

606
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,720
- We must feed him this now. - Right.

607
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,920
Oh, whatever.

608
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,230
Here it goes.

609
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,610
Oh, my goodness.

610
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,740
What a waste of this precious medicine.

611
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,580
Yeo Ri. I will make another bowl.

612
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,990
- Keep Gap here. - I will.

613
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,830
I cannot stay here any longer.

614
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,750
I must leave.

615
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:52,880
Why? Not long ago, you said you liked her cooking.

616
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,550
You just had to take a few gulps.

617
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,050
Why did you cause this mess?

618
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,850
A snake's tail went into that.

619
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,680
Snakes and I are distant cousins.

620
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:03,890
How could I drink that?

621
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,310
I feel bad for her because she spent a lot...

622
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,270
when she does not have much money.

623
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,730
Look this way.

624
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,290
Hey!

625
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,960
What?

626
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:34,170
You are to stay at least ten steps away from me at all times.

627
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,420
What?

628
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,220
What was that, all of a sudden?

629
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,350
Gosh, that hurts.

630
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,400
Why does this keep happening?

631
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,980
When I am with her, I get this burning feeling inside me,

632
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,200
as if I want to eat her alive.

633
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,160
Seriously, what is wrong with me?

634
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,790
Goodness. What was that?

635
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,750
He treated me as if I had an infectious disease.

636
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,170
But back then, he did not...

637
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,140
My goodness.

638
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:31,850
I am just confused.

639
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,730
Yes, I am confusing him with Royal Scribe Yoon.

640
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:35,480
Yes, that is why.

641
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,230
That must be it.

642
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,900
How much longer do you plan to stay here?

643
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,480
Am I not allowed to stay here?

644
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,650
But His Majesty gave me permission.

645
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,320
It is not that.

646
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,620
Because you are here,

647
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:33,710
that troublemaker royal scribe is still lounging around here too.

648
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,750
Do not mind him.

649
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,670
He is still here, for he finds it comfortable to lounge around here.

650
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,300
How could I not mind him?

651
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,180
Here he comes.

652
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,740
How could you be either lying down or slouching around all the time?

653
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,450
Royal Scribe Yoon's body will end up with bedsores at this rate.

654
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:13,410
I used to live freely without a body.

655
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:16,330
But now, I am confined within this clumsy human body. That is why.

656
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,960
Do you even know how heavy a human body truly is?

657
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,220
Are you making a paper talisman?

658
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,560
Do you think you can catch the Eight-feet Spirit with it?

659
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,280
Your Highness.

660
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,910
I heard you had not eaten anything in days.

661
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,290
This is milk porridge.

662
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,460
Please have some.

663
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,920
Milk porridge?

664
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,010
What mother...

665
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,390
can eat...

666
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,600
after losing her child?

667
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:17,640
His Majesty asked the Royal Kitchen to prepare this for you.

668
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,230
Please remember how much His Majesty cares for you...

669
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,690
and have this porridge, even if it is just one spoonful.

670
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,740
I told you I did not want this!

671
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,170
I apologize.

672
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,420
I feel queasy.

673
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,760
Please excuse me.

674
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,950
Your Highness, are you all right?

675
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,370
The queen...

676
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,990
does not seem to be doing all right.

677
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:17,370
I know.

678
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,040
She looked white as a sheet.

679
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,670
She must be feeling very sick.

680
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,250
She was always weak like that.

681
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,840
She was like that even when she was pregnant with the prince.

682
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,800
She suffered from severe morning sickness.

683
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,100
She always had to stay in bed...

684
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,970
because she often showed possible signs of a miscarriage.

685
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:38,930
Your Highness.

686
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:40,940
Do you perhaps think...

687
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,730
It seems that she is going through some kind of change.

688
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,440
Find out.

689
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,790
The Eight-feet Spirit will appear...

690
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,870
on the Day of the Red Horse to cause harm to the prince?

691
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,630
What makes you so sure?

692
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,210
The Eight-feet Spirit is a fire demon,

693
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:11,880
so it will make a move when the energy of fire is at its peak.

694
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,430
It attacked Prince Young In...

695
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,020
on the Night of the Red Rooster when the energy of fire was strong.

696
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,940
I took makeshift measures...

697
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,270
to keep the Eight-feet Spirit away from His Highness' room,

698
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,520
but without catching the Eight-feet Spirit,

699
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,820
we can never uproot the problem.

700
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,860
Then...

701
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,990
what can I do to help?

702
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,660
Tell everyone in the Palace that His Highness the Prince...

703
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,710
stays at the Royal Library until late at night.

704
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,540
It will be easier to catch the spirit...

705
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,920
with the paper talisman at the library...

706
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,500
than in His Highness' chambers.

707
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,630
I plan to lure the Eight-feet Spirit to the library.

708
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:19,160
Why do we not find a different shaman instead of a novice like you?

709
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,790
An experienced shaman with a powerful guardian spirit.

710
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,660
We cannot do that.

711
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,330
Any other shaman...

712
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:28,040
will only focus on getting rid of the Eight-feet Spirit.

713
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,750
But that...

714
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,710
might make Royal Scribe Yoon's soul ascend too.

715
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,800
Then I will forever lose the chance to bring him back to life.

716
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:42,350
The king will surely be thrilled to learn about your ulterior motive.

717
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,110
Take this.

718
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,360
My grandmother said this crescent dagger...

719
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,570
was imbued with divine power.

720
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,740
It may look small,

721
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,870
but she ascended countless spirits with that crescent dagger.

722
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,550
I once heard...

723
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,850
that the glowing pearl inside a serpent's body...

724
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:27,100
could be very powerful, although dragon's pearls would outpower it.

725
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,860
I clearly saw it in Mount Bugak too.

726
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,940
Even that mighty Eight-feet Spirit...

727
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,360
could not use its powers in front of the glowing pearl.

728
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:39,110
I will use the paper talisman to confine the Eight-feet Spirit.

729
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,870
Then you will stab it with the crescent dagger,

730
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,830
using the power of the glowing pearl.

731
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,770
I hear the prince...

732
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:54,940
has been spending time in the Royal Library every night.

733
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,440
Put this up in the library in secret.

734
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,360
Tonight, we will offer the prince...

735
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,990
to the General of Heaven and Earth.

736
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,360
If any suspicious person is seen in or around the library tonight,

737
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,190
do nothing and quietly observe.

738
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,320
You must catch them...

739
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,700
as they are leaving the library.

740
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,240
It is now the Hour of the Mouse. It was the time you mentioned.

741
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

742
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,540
The Eight-feet Spirit will show itself soon.

743
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:22,300
Please follow my aforementioned instructions if any problem arises.

744
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,400
Give me a piggyback.

745
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,900
What?

746
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,730
I see no eunuchs around.

747
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,990
I cannot ask Father to give me a piggyback ride.

748
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,900
Why should I give you a piggyback ride?

749
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,950
I have to stand guard here because of you.

750
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,990
Now, I even have to be your nanny?

751
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,080
Why, you little...

752
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,210
Your Highness, I will give you a piggyback ride.

753
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,210
Come here.

754
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,180
Your Highness. You see that, right?

755
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,300
The Eight-feet Spirit...

756
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,970
will see your undershirt in front of that water bowl...

757
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:16,390
and go there, thinking it is you.

758
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:20,020
Then I will cast this big net and catch the spirit.

759
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,730
You have no reason to be afraid.

760
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,530
I am not afraid.

761
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,650
- Do you think I am a little child? - My goodness.

762
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,450
Oh, right. My apologies.

763
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:32,870
I am serious.

764
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,370
I know that ghost well.

765
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,540
That ghost is not scary.

766
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,710
It is sad.

767
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:45,500
Sad?

768
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,300
Yes.

769
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,300
I do not know why,

770
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,380
but it was sad.

771
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,930
Very sad, in fact.

772
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:58,680
Sad? What do you mean?

773
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,580
It is here.

774
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,320
Is that ghost here now?

775
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,870
Hush, please.

776
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,350
Kang Chul, now.

777
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,060
Hurry!

778
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,810
General of Heaven and Earth, please appear.

779
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,890
General of Heaven and Earth, please appear.

780
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:52,940
General of Heaven and Earth, please appear.

781
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,530
Come forth and appear!

782
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:12,710
Kang Chul!

783
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,470
Darn it.

784
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:19,720
Like you said,

785
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,220
you could hold off the spirit temporarily with the glowing pearl.

786
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,550
But that is all.

787
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:33,060
You must deplete the energy of the glowing pearl...

788
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,110
so that a powerful evil spirit like the Eight-feet Spirit...

789
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:37,280
Shut it.

790
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,240
You darned monk.

791
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,990
Kang Chul's glowing pearl will not be enough...

792
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:44,950
to stop the spirit?

793
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,790
No, the paper talisman is getting ripped.

794
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,910
(The Haunted Palace)

795
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,120
Were you able to find out who the shaman was?

796
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,750
Are you all right?

797
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:34,130
So it was you. Yes.

798
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:37,050
Who are you looking for?

799
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:38,050
My younger brother.

800
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,050
A serpent.

801
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,670
There was another serpent.

802
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:41,880
Kang Chul, is it you?

803
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,260
So, about Yeo Ri.

804
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:45,090
I feel as though I wish to eat her alive or...

805
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:48,390
See if you feel that way with any other human being.

806
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,180
What do you plan to do with this dreadful thing?

807
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,560
The Queen is pregnant with the King's child.

808
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,020
So the General of Heaven and Earth will have another child to feed on.

809
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,230
And my queen? Is she all right?
