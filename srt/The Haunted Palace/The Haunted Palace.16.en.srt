1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,421
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,799
Step back, all of you.

4
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,010
I will take care of this Imugi myself.

5
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,721
Move it!

6
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,346
WATER

7
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,397
Get him!

8
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,047
Noble Elder.

9
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,385
I offer you my congratulations
on reclaiming the shrine.

10
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,640
But my lord…

11
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,392
that damn Imugi managed to get away

12
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,394
and I hear the Warrior Deity…

13
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,441
I mean, His Majesty is quite enraged.

14
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,401
They bolted in a panic.

15
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,780
What could they possibly manage
to do now anyway?

16
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,199
The whole nation

17
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,453
is in the palm of the Warrior Deity.

18
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,846
Gangcheori.

19
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,850
It is cold. Why are you out?

20
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,522
I am going to do
a quick sweep of the area.

21
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,737
Let's go inside.

22
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,161
Your Highness.

23
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,247
Please try to have a spoonful.

24
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,595
Examiner Yoon Gap, what happens to us now?

25
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:28,601
Must we continue running from Father
who remains possessed by an evil spirit?

26
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,940
Answer me.

27
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:39,988
Your Highness.

28
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,448
We will figure out a method soon.

29
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,993
Please do not worry too much.

30
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,046
But, little boy,

31
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,049
why are you still so short?

32
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,759
You should eat more.

33
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,306
Do not worry.

34
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,474
You will return to the palace soon enough

35
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,435
and I will save your father
from that ghost.

36
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,603
Do you mean it?

37
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,565
Of course.

38
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,488
Then, you should eat up now,
Your Highness.

39
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,041
What is the matter?

40
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,376
You…

41
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,336
What are you planning to do?

42
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,881
What do you mean?

43
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,677
This.

44
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,181
You consumed this caragana as tea,
did you not?

45
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,392
I know.

46
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,271
You need this flower
to wholly drain the luminous pearl.

47
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,151
I already told you.

48
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,402
You are an Imugi,

49
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,780
and this fight was not yours
from the start.

50
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,742
Then, you just want to do nothing
and wait for them to attack?

51
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,120
You know that the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
is after you as well.

52
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,291
A while ago, you asked me…

53
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,628
to run away with you.

54
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,882
Let us do that.

55
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,135
Do you mean it?

56
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,889
I cannot do this anymore.

57
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,892
I cannot continue to face
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

58
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,020
I wanted to see it through
for my grandma's sake,

59
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,314
but I am nowhere strong enough.

60
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,108
Do you expect me to believe that?

61
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,277
I have been by your side
for all these years.

62
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,155
Even after you rejected your shaman fate,

63
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,908
you could not help but aid
every wandering spirit you came across.

64
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,910
But now,

65
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,247
you suggest we turn our backs
on the King and Prince in peril…

66
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,208
and just run away?

67
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,881
The thought of the King, the Prince,

68
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,468
and even the late Queen breaks my heart…

69
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,305
but you are the most important to me.

70
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,976
I am terrified

71
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,895
something might happen to you

72
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,565
to make you end up like Bibi.

73
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,985
If something happened to you,

74
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,113
I would not be able to continue living.

75
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,675
Even if we run away,

76
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,052
he will continue coming after us.

77
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,929
I told you.

78
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,432
My longtime wish…

79
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,853
is to live an ordinary life
with the warmth of another.

80
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,273
I want to live that life with you.

81
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,942
Even if it is just for a few days.

82
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,487
So, Gangcheori…

83
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,989
Please…

84
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,174
A harsh road lies ahead of us,
but we must take the baby Prince along.

85
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,427
He will be devoured by the ghost
if we leave him behind.

86
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,596
All right. Let us do that.

87
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,932
Your mother. We must take her as well.

88
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,144
All right. I shall go and get her now.

89
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,529
Is there anything you want from the house?

90
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,532
How about Neop-deok's ritual robe?

91
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,077
I am in no place

92
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,330
to look after her robe
when I am on the run.

93
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,501
I just need you and your mother
to return safely.

94
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,088
I will be back in no time.

95
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,619
Yeo-ri.

96
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,209
How are you back in the palace?

97
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,378
What about His Highness? Is he all right?

98
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,587
Yes, he is safe.

99
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,883
What are we to do?

100
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,219
Chaos is afoot in the palace.

101
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,098
It is still His Majesty's body
and we cannot refuse him,

102
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,642
but his actions
are clearly led by the ghost.

103
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,105
This Eight-foot-tall Ghost is
about to devour everything in its wake.

104
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,359
Before that happens,

105
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,821
I shall finish him.

106
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,905
You will?

107
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,575
Where is Imugi Gangcheori?

108
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,494
I will be able to do it on my own.

109
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,288
As long as you help me, my lord.

110
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,290
What? Me?

111
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,095
My goodness. Why are you here?

112
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,348
The state troops just barged in here,
looking for you.

113
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,017
You need to flee now.
You are not hurt? Yeo-ri is fine as well?

114
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,144
Run away now.

115
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,271
We must leave at once. Pack lightly.

116
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,574
Is Yeo-ri inside?

117
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,661
The thing is…

118
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,503
Yeo-ri.

119
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,255
Where is Yeo-ri?

120
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,925
She said she and Court Lady Oh
had to step out for a moment.

121
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,846
She wanted you to wait for her here.

122
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,181
What sort of nonsense…

123
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,413
ASCENSION OF GANGCHEORI

124
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,333
<i>It might be granted if I wish hard enough.</i>

125
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,752
<i>The Big Dipper up there might.</i>

126
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,385
Tell me the truth.

127
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,179
Yeo-ri…

128
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,223
Where did she go?

129
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,684
The palace.

130
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,230
She went to the palace.

131
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,985
She said she knew of a method
and that you would only get in the way.

132
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,196
She told me to keep it secret.

133
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,785
Hold on.

134
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:49,828
Where are you off to now?

135
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,830
I am going to get Yeo-ri. You stay here.

136
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,667
Then, you will get her

137
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,294
and come back together, right?

138
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,133
Why are you not answering me? Well?

139
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,553
I am off.

140
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,768
He will be back.

141
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,355
He will be back with Yeo-ri.

142
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,570
<i>I tried to honor your wishes.</i>

143
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,904
<i>How could you…</i>

144
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,072
I told you.

145
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,783
My longtime wish…

146
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,288
is to live an ordinary life
with the warmth of another.

147
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,165
I want to live that life with you.

148
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,293
Even if it is just for a few days.

149
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,795
So, Gangcheori…

150
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,548
Please…

151
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,050
<i>You must be safe.</i>

152
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,635
<i>If you are not,</i>

153
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,679
<i>I will never forgive you.</i>

154
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,672
<i>My wish to live</i>

155
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,926
<i>an ordinary life filled</i>
<i>with the warmth of another…</i>

156
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,764
<i>was already granted.</i>

157
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,642
<i>Thanks to you, Gangcheori.</i>

158
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,107
<i>I did not lie to you.</i>

159
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,943
<i>I truly did want</i>

160
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,487
<i>to run away with you.</i>

161
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,240
<i>I am sorry, Gangcheori.</i>

162
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,369
<i>I did not keep my promise.</i>

163
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,704
<i>I am truly sorry.</i>

164
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,290
<i>Sorry…</i>

165
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,400
Pung-san should be on his way
back to his shrine by now.

166
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,194
I hear the Eight-foot-tall Ghost Majesty

167
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,530
does not let anyone into his chambers.

168
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,078
So, he should be alone right now.

169
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,539
Yes, my lord.

170
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,297
Are you all right, my lord?

171
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,302
I realized after tonight,

172
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,764
we might all end up dead.

173
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,392
It is making my knees grow weak.

174
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,855
Forgive me.

175
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,857
I brought this about…

176
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,862
No. How could you be to blame?

177
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,574
I have sworn an oath to always be ready
to give my life for His Majesty.

178
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,660
I, too, can no longer stand by

179
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,663
as that dirty, evil spirit continues
to occupy His Majesty's body.

180
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,331
Let us go.

181
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,349
Sang-deuk.

182
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,809
You cannot, my lord.

183
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,228
His Majesty forbade all from entering.

184
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,314
I know that,

185
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,150
but I have an urgent matter
that I must discuss with him.

186
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,739
I have acquired new intel on the Imugi
His Majesty is searching for.

187
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,575
You can tell me.

188
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,328
I will pass it along to His Majesty.

189
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:04,291
Well… this is something
I should personally deliver.

190
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,377
What is that?

191
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:13,634
Oh, that?
Some sweets that His Majesty enjoys…

192
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,178
And <i>sikhye</i>. That is all.

193
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,687
- Who are you?
- Are you not--

194
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,816
Step back.

195
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,492
Your Majesty.

196
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,755
Why that--

197
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,382
Take that.

198
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,885
Yeo-ri.

199
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,178
This is your chance.

200
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,373
You…

201
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,960
I am here, under the command
of the Ten Kings of the Underworld,

202
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,963
hurled forth like an arrow unleashed
through the path curved like a bow,

203
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,507
to escort you,
Cheon Geum-hwi of the Wood Dragon Year,

204
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,176
to the afterlife in merciless chains.

205
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,847
Follow without protest.

206
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,559
You wench.

207
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,979
How have you embodied the Fire Reaper?

208
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,733
FIRE REAPER: A GRIM REAPER THAT GUIDES
SOULS BURNED TO DEATH TO THE AFTERLIFE

209
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,366
What?

210
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,034
The Fire Reaper?

211
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,119
The Fire Reaper commands you,
born on the Fire Boar Day

212
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,373
of the Wood Boar Month,
in the Wood Dragon Year.

213
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,834
Cheon Geum-hwi shall follow
without protest.

214
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,299
I shall…

215
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,551
drag you to the afterlife!

216
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,872
What in the world are you?

217
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,209
How could some little brat
possess such power?

218
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,004
How do you wield power
over the Fire Reaper?

219
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,674
Unbridled rage brings forth
a fiery demise.

220
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,553
Unbridled rage brings forth
a fiery demise.

221
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,016
On this quiet day, with this prayer,
Vengeful Ghost Cheon Geum-hwi

222
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,810
shall follow the Fire Reaper
under the command of King Jingwang,

223
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,936
without protest.

224
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,149
The blades of
the Serrated Mountain of the Damned

225
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,900
shall bring reckoning upon your sins!

226
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,241
Se-won. You must hurry.

227
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,326
Now!

228
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,686
My goodness. The Warrior Deity
will be dragged in at this rate.

229
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,396
How is this possible?

230
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,523
Even her grandmother could not.

231
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,109
How did that fledgling wench manage that?

232
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,074
Great scornful Warrior Deity,

233
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,660
borne of grievance from a sea of blood,
with divine power and aid,

234
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,746
fueled by the might of his bitter grudge,

235
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,207
his thousand years of devoted wailing!

236
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,436
Warrior Deity!

237
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,088
You possess remarkable talent
for such a young wench.

238
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,050
After all your relentless interference,

239
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,261
I have wanted to shred you to pieces.

240
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,471
And here you are, of your own accord.

241
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,391
It would be a waste
of such spiritual energy,

242
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,605
but I will only find peace
after I kill you, wench.

243
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,705
Yeo-ri!

244
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,186
You cannot.

245
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,147
Do not do it, Gangcheori.

246
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,358
How could you…

247
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,567
Just leave.

248
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,278
Please leave.

249
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:31,988
Please.

250
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,616
You were wrong.

251
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,660
If you depart first,

252
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,206
how am I to endure
all those long years without you?

253
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,458
You cannot, Gangcheori.

254
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,002
Please…

255
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,968
Gangcheori.

256
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,851
Damn wicked spirit.

257
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,102
You are right.

258
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,732
I am a maliciously evil spirit,
as you say.

259
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,443
But what does that make you?

260
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,987
What did you say?

261
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,280
A deity?

262
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,408
Did you call yourself a deity?

263
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,787
That gruesome night, 100 years ago,

264
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,457
as my kin and fellow villagers met

265
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,459
their tragic deaths, I cried out

266
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,836
a hundred,

267
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,505
a thousand times…

268
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,761
for anyone to help us.

269
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,763
I silently screamed out to the heavens.

270
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:24,309
However, you only ever cared
about your ascension.

271
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,897
Despite the mighty power you held,

272
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,859
you could not care less about us.

273
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,114
A deity…

274
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,659
You dare call yourself a deity?

275
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,788
I have no use for such deities.

276
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,793
I will be sure to end you myself!

277
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,702
Gangcheori.

278
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,670
No…

279
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,555
Gangcheori…

280
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,065
No!

281
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,090
Yes.

282
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,468
You are right.

283
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,805
Even with my divine powers…

284
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,644
I failed to save you all.

285
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,231
Thus…

286
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,278
I shall save you now.

287
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,243
No…

288
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,461
No!

289
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,719
The Warrior Deity…

290
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,971
has disappeared.

291
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,517
The Warrior Deity…

292
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,772
is gone.

293
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:27,111
The Warrior Deity!

294
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,885
Gangcheori!

295
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,555
Gangcheori!

296
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,892
Gangcheori!

297
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,854
Gangcheori!

298
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,815
No…

299
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,734
Gangcheori, no!

300
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:11,322
No… Gangcheori!

301
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,525
SPIRIT TABLET
OF THE LATE CHEON GEUM-HWI

302
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,278
CHEON GEUM-HWI

303
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,287
<i>The Paper Dance…</i>

304
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,625
<i>Symbolic paper money is offered</i>
<i>to the spirit of the deceased</i>

305
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,420
<i>to pray for the appeasement</i>
<i>of its unresolved grudge in this world</i>

306
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,590
<i>and for it to find passage</i>

307
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,634
<i>to eternal peace.</i>

308
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,096
<i>Furthermore,</i>

309
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,556
<i>it lights a lantern for the deceased</i>

310
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,601
<i>to show them the way.</i>

311
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,558
Cheon Geum-hwi…

312
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,560
Cheon Geum-hwi?

313
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,937
Is he with us now?

314
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,814
Yes…

315
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,150
Cheon Geum-hwi…

316
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,278
and the villagers of Yongdam are here.

317
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,151
I…

318
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,946
I saw everything.

319
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,161
I saw for myself why your grudge…

320
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,122
runs so deep.

321
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,417
The sins of my ancestor are grave.

322
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,879
Furthermore, my sin…

323
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,007
of ignorance is also quite grave.

324
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,720
I will never forget what sort of bloodshed

325
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,393
ensured the royal throne I sit on now…

326
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,689
not even for a moment…

327
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,734
until the day I die.

328
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,990
I will devote all of myself…

329
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:09,036
to ensure there is never another subject…

330
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,291
with a blood-wrought grudge like yours.

331
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,674
I offer you all

332
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,719
my sincerest plea for forgiveness.

333
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,255
For many long years…

334
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,926
I abhorred your bloodline.

335
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,097
The resentment of those
who died because of me

336
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,933
grew deeper by the day…

337
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,813
and the painful guilt
that weighed heavily on me

338
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,232
made avoiding
further bloodshed impossible.

339
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,861
However,

340
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,113
with a few measly words…

341
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,160
I feel as light as air.

342
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,915
How hollow it feels.

343
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,001
So very hollow…

344
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,670
Just…

345
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,882
a few measly tears…

346
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,472
was all it took.

347
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,655
An Imugi without a luminous pearl…

348
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,701
just disappears, right?

349
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,705
Gangcheori will now…

350
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,751
cease to exist in this world.

351
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,963
Yeo-ri.

352
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,927
<i>You feared you could not endure</i>
<i>the long years without me?</i>

353
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,095
<i>Rotten jerk.</i>

354
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,680
<i>Then, what about me?</i>

355
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,642
<i>How am I to survive without you?</i>

356
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,936
Yeo-ri.

357
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,438
My heart aches as well.

358
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,606
However…

359
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,860
I cannot help but think

360
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,988
that all of this was
the will of the heavens.

361
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,284
Perhaps, when the King
abandoned his people

362
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,120
and the Way of Heaven
collapsed to the ground,

363
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,958
the heavens sent the ascending dragon
back to the earth

364
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,795
in order for it to save

365
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:32,091
the poor people of Yongdam Village.

366
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,887
There is a chance that was

367
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,141
Gangcheori's purpose
in the world from the start.

368
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,061
What are you talking about?

369
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,064
Are you saying they were determined

370
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,569
to kill my son
to save others from the start?

371
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,988
What sort of wretched will
of heaven is that?

372
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,949
May Avalokitesvara show us mercy.

373
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:01,829
If you can kill my child twice
in the name of heavens' will,

374
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,539
bring him back.

375
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,878
Bring my child back to me!

376
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,339
May Avalokitesvara show us mercy.

377
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,968
My poor boy…

378
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,053
Gap…

379
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:26,270
My poor boy… Bring him back to me.

380
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,660
You will achieve
that noble pursuit you seek.

381
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,162
After all,

382
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,373
you are one of those mortals…

383
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,628
I come across occasionally.

384
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,597
You must have known, my Queen.

385
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,350
How much affection I had

386
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,520
for that brazen Imugi…

387
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:14,151
<i>You knew that every time I was</i>
<i>with that disdainfully haughty fellow,</i>

388
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,779
<i>funnily enough,</i>

389
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,782
<i>it felt like I had made</i>

390
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,493
my first companion in life.

391
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,462
Yes, Your Majesty.

392
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,256
I know all too well.

393
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,635
You are the strongest,

394
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:44,181
but you are also lonely
and the most gentle-spirited.

395
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,517
I…

396
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,437
was so very happy

397
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,899
to live as your maiden.

398
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,112
Please let go

399
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,197
of all your painful memories

400
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,491
and I hope…

401
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,576
I hope…

402
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,247
you find happiness.

403
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,474
My Queen…

404
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,586
Grandma.

405
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,755
Grandma!

406
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,676
Yes, my child. It is me.

407
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:04,803
My dear child.

408
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:05,888
Grandma…

409
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,725
You have…

410
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,519
been through so much.

411
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,773
How weary it must have been.

412
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,363
Thanks to you,

413
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,991
I was able to escape
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

414
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,243
and make my way here.

415
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,622
You have done well.

416
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,832
Well done.

417
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,586
Grandma, I…

418
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,340
To get here…

419
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,302
Gangcheori…

420
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:47,888
Gangcheori…

421
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,516
Yes.

422
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,477
I know.

423
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,438
I know.

424
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,275
Yes, Yeo-ri.

425
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,819
Cry.

426
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,114
Cry as much as you want.

427
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,202
Cry as much as it takes

428
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,496
to soothe that sorrow.

429
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,251
Without experiencing it for yourself,

430
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,296
how will you ever understand

431
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,882
the sorrow of countless others?

432
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,542
Yeo-ri.

433
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,461
It is time for me to go now.

434
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,881
You're leaving already?

435
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,638
Do not worry, Yeo-ri.

436
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,473
I will always

437
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,059
watch over you.

438
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,604
You must stay strong

439
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,273
and keep going with courage.

440
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,410
Noble Elder.

441
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:19,289
This way. Come this way.

442
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,125
This way.

443
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,588
Here. You can sit down.

444
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,175
Noble Elder, what do we do now?

445
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,761
We do not even have the Warrior Deity
watching over us now.

446
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,056
It feels like we are just sitting ducks.

447
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:40,519
It will be more dangerous
for us to stay together.

448
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,356
You should go back the way we came.

449
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:47,359
We will meet up at the tavern
outside the capital. All right?

450
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:51,238
But it was already crawling
with state troops.

451
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,157
They will not circle back.

452
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,369
But still… I think that is a bad idea.

453
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,580
How dare you.

454
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,166
Do you doubt me?

455
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,296
No, I do not.

456
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,423
All right.

457
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,009
Then, we will

458
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,886
reunite a little bit later.

459
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:15,971
All right.

460
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,686
- Stop!
- Get him!

461
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,981
What do you want? I do not know anything!

462
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,442
Noble Elder!

463
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,958
The Yapper…

464
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,211
cannot die like this.

465
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,840
I will find another great deity to serve.

466
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,177
If I attach myself to a powerful one,

467
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:57,888
it will be a breeze.

468
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,806
I need to get up.

469
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,393
<i>I promise you this.</i>

470
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,772
You will end up suffering
the most excruciatingly painful death.

471
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,940
Why…

472
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,486
that damn…

473
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,489
wretched Imugi…

474
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:53,610
<i>We wait three days to place</i>
<i>the body in the casket to be buried.</i>

475
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,572
<i>It is because the living</i>

476
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,991
<i>foolishly and piteously hope</i>

477
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:05,121
<i>the dead will come back to life</i>
<i>within that time.</i>

478
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,934
<i>Three days had passed,</i>

479
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,769
<i>but Gangcheori…</i>

480
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,022
<i>did not wake up.</i>

481
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,830
My goodness…

482
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,093
Why…

483
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,399
Why…

484
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,531
Gap…

485
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,700
My goodness!

486
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,994
What the?

487
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,120
What is that?

488
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,756
What is all this?

489
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,134
What is wrong with you?
You almost suffocated me to death.

490
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,804
Do not just stand there.
Come here and untie me.

491
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,473
You…

492
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,768
Yes, it is me.
Your sacred patron deity. Gangcheori.

493
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,614
Oh my!

494
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:06,242
My goodness…

495
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,164
My goodness.

496
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,211
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

497
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:21,716
A total of 160 volumes of slave registers
were gathered from the inner offices,

498
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,010
palace quarters,
and the official residences.

499
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,764
Furthermore, in those volumes,

500
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,518
a total of 36,974 slaves were recorded.

501
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,269
Have them burn

502
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,231
all the records
discovered near Donhwa Gate.

503
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,608
Yes, Your Majesty, I shall.

504
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,903
Does the Crown Prince understand

505
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,156
the true intentions behind my pursuit?

506
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,826
Yes, Your Majesty.

507
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,787
You wish to reform the slave system

508
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,456
because you do not wish to see
another subject

509
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,459
end up with a blood-wrought grudge,
is it not?

510
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,379
Your Highness.

511
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,340
You speak such truly wise words.

512
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,644
You do not want to go?

513
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:21,443
Her Grace is making a sincere plea
for forgiveness for what her son had done.

514
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,777
We even prepared all this.

515
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,654
What exactly is the issue?

516
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,032
There is no issue.

517
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,366
Then, what is it?

518
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,702
I want…

519
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,789
- to spend more time with you before I go.
- What?

520
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,626
- Is something wrong?
- No, Your Grace.

521
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,838
It seems her grudge
has been appeased, but…

522
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:46,468
there are spirits who take a bit longer
to cross the River of the Afterlife.

523
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,020
You do not need to continue…

524
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,152
Get back in there.

525
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,618
I replaced the cracked corrective lens.

526
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,259
They are perfect.

527
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,554
Let me see here…

528
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,560
A token of my appreciation.

529
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,645
No, Your Excellency.

530
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,148
We would not be here
if it were not for you.

531
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,484
Consider this a repayment
for your kindness.

532
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,735
Kindness?

533
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,988
I paid back a little of the moral debt
I owed His Majesty, thanks to you.

534
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,119
Then…

535
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,830
how about this, instead?

536
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,249
I shall spread word

537
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:03,920
about how amazing these glasses are
to the nobility of Bukchon.

538
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,132
Yes, please do.

539
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,355
My word. How incredibly natural of you.

540
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,399
Just call for her
if you want to say something.

541
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,650
It's freezing…

542
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,547
Help yourself.

543
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,430
You got yourself another ring.

544
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,141
You mean this?

545
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,977
His Lord got me another.

546
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,271
We are to wed soon.

547
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,356
You…

548
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,526
You picked up that teacup
like that on purpose to brag, did you not?

549
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,326
It is a talisman for destined love.

550
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,245
It will help you find a kindred soul
to share the next 100 years with.

551
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,626
Does that really work?

552
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,628
You do not have to believe me.

553
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,463
When?

554
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,507
When did I say I did not?

555
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,304
By the way…

556
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,353
is there no talisman that would help me
meet someone handsome?

557
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,147
I do not need this 100-year business.

558
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,483
I care more about looks.

559
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:50,818
Pardon?

560
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,290
Wait,

561
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,585
so you really met the Heavenly Sovereign?

562
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,212
How many times must I repeat it?

563
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:13,216
He must have felt a bit guilty,
after putting me through that hell.

564
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:15,552
So, that is why
he brought you back to life?

565
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,429
The Heavenly Sovereign up there did?

566
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,306
He summoned me and asked,

567
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,016
"Do you want to ascend as a dragon

568
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,978
or do you want to go live
amongst the mortals once more?"

569
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,396
He told me to choose.

570
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:27,480
Thus,

571
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,733
you chose to live with us?

572
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:31,859
"Us"?

573
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,278
Certainly not for you.

574
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,655
I came back to live with Yeo-ri.

575
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,658
- Why you… It is still His Majesty.
- Watch yourself.

576
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,826
Let it go.

577
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,622
Regardless, I am quite thankful.

578
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:48,001
If I am being honest,
after you left like that, I felt…

579
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,839
Goodness.
Who am I even speaking to right now?

580
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,633
This is important. How could you…

581
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,972
Listen, you should not wear

582
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,890
glasses in front of your superior.

583
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,309
His Majesty, no less. Take them off.

584
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,393
Hold on.

585
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,979
Who could be my superior here?

586
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,063
Watch it.

587
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,941
I did not know you owned colored glasses.

588
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,652
Yeo-ri made me a pair.
Basically, a wedding gift.

589
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,030
- I am off.
- All right.

590
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,991
Hey! Where are you going?

591
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,577
We are not here to have fun.

592
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:26,456
We came to secretly observe
the living conditions of the people…

593
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,375
Who am I speaking to now?

594
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,961
I have been listening, Your Majesty.

595
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,254
Why that…

596
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:40,762
I believe Gwang's favorite skewers
are sold over there.

597
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,640
Let us pick some up before we return.

598
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,932
Yes, Your Majesty.

599
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,100
This way.

600
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,069
Yeo-ri!

601
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,614
Do you have them on?

602
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:06,537
How pretty.

603
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,519
Such a good eater.

604
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,939
Are you a child?

605
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,732
Help yourself, Husband.

606
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,985
Come now. I am no ordinary husband.

607
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:41,155
I am the loftiest of husbands
and the most dignified patron deity.

608
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,037
- Is it good?
- Yes.

609
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,957
This will not do.

610
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,043
I let everything slide
because you were cute up until now.

611
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,505
I even let you sleep between
Yeo-ri and me every night…

612
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,758
You are old enough to be disciplined now.

613
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,803
It is time you know how scary

614
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,304
your father can be.

615
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,070
I hate you, Father! You're scary!

616
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,281
Stop it!

617
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,033
Why this rascal…

618
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:30,413
Stop it! I don't like it at all!

619
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,416
Enough!

620
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:40,047
Must you act like this at the table,
day in and day out? Pure chaos.

621
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,259
Let us eat.

622
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:46,721
I knew you would
finally get scolded today.

623
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:51,058
My goodness. What are you two pouting for?

624
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,643
Unbelievable.

625
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:56,606
The<i> sikhye</i> came out very well.

626
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,775
Let us all have a taste.

627
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,026
- That looks good.
- Yes.

628
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:01,986
Have a taste.

629
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:05,490
Go on.

630
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:09,577
Hear me, Examiner Yoon Gap
and Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri!

631
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,624
My goodness, look how you have grown!

632
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,083
Grilled Abalone!

633
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,669
Will you ever let that go?

634
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,254
Passing it down like a tradition…

635
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,383
Anyhow, His Majesty has summoned you two

636
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,928
to come to the palace immediately.

637
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,638
He summoned me as well?

638
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,307
- Yes.
- Did something happen at the palace?

639
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:38,314
I cannot go into details here,

640
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:41,400
but there has been
another strange incident at the palace.

641
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,362
Anyhow, His Majesty has summoned you both.

642
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:45,655
Just give me a moment.

643
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,741
What is the matter?

644
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:53,162
I must say something at this juncture
as the head of this household.

645
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,623
The line for glasses made by Yeo-ri,

646
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,667
the nation's top eyeglass artisan,

647
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,211
stretches far beyond the capital limits.

648
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:04,340
You are asking her to take time off
to clean up the King's mess.

649
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:07,134
It is only right
she is properly compensated.

650
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:10,137
Raising a child costs so much.

651
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,723
- Do you even know?
- Most certainly.

652
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,183
Well done.

653
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,728
That is true…

654
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,605
How much do you want?

655
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,148
As you well know,

656
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,609
officially, we are not allowed
to perform heretical ceremonies.

657
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,280
At least, ten pairs of glasses' worth.

658
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,156
Do not be like that.

659
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,408
Above all else,

660
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:33,494
I cannot just use
my Imugi powers on demand.

661
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,913
- Perhaps, 5,000 pieces of pumpkin taffy--
- Gosh.

662
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,248
Mother, can you look after Ga-won?

663
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,417
Sure. Come to Grandma, Ga-won.

664
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,501
Hold on.

665
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:43,963
Do not worry and go.

666
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,340
I am not done haggling.

667
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,050
Let us go, my lord.

668
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,385
All right.

669
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,637
Let us go!

670
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,514
I told you I was still haggling!

671
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,724
Come on.

672
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:56,517
Shall we?

673
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:58,871
