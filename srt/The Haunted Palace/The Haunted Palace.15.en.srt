(All places, organizations, characters, )

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,719
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,380
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,400
Stay back.

9
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,950
- Stop him! - Protect His Majesty!

10
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,230
- No! - Your Majesty.

11
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,210
No!

12
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,260
My Queen.

13
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,190
My Queen.

14
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,900
My Queen. How...

15
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,110
No.

16
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,360
Arrest him!

17
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,580
No, Your Highness.

18
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,870
- Mother! - No, Your Highness.

19
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,960
- Mother. - Listen to me.

20
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,750
Bring me a royal physician.

21
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,499
Bring me a royal physician this instant!

22
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

23
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,230
The General of Heaven and Earth...

24
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,150
has finally swallowed...

25
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,690
the royal child in the Queen's womb!

26
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,080
(Episode 15: Spirit Possession)

27
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,500
I do not know what happened.

28
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,470
Nothing happens when I touch them.

29
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,890
Both of the warding stones for the King and the prince.

30
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,270
Though subtle, I can smell a hint of liquor on it.

31
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,730
Someone must have poured liquor, mixed with fire energy.

32
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,199
That is why the Eight-feet Spirit...

33
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,319
was able to attack the Queen when she had...

34
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,160
the warding stone with her.

35
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,199
No. That cannot be.

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,199
We made sure that they did not come in contact...

37
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,080
with other people.

38
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,380
Perhaps, it was done by those he trusted the most.

39
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,170
What?

40
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,260
No.

41
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,780
Give it to me.

42
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,500
Was it your doing?

43
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,340
Eunuch Lee at the prince's chambers already confessed everything.

44
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,430
Was it truly your doing?

45
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,799
Head Eunuch, please spare me.

46
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,680
I have done a terrible thing.

47
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,599
They captured my family and threatened me with their safety.

48
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,640
So I had no choice...

49
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,900
You...

50
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,650
You fool!

51
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,189
I took you under my wing and taught you...

52
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,110
everything to be a eunuch.

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,700
I had been raising a monster all this time.

54
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,369
Because of you,

55
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,790
I have committed a grave act of disloyalty to His Majesty.

56
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,670
You disgraced every eunuch in the Palace.

57
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,460
Take him.

58
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,920
Head Eunuch!

59
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,470
Head Eunuch! I am sorry!

60
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Your Majesty.

61
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,020
Please punish me with death.

62
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,940
What do you mean?

63
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,190
Tell me you can save her.

64
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,070
Tell me you can save her!

65
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,910
I will not ask you to save the baby she is carrying.

66
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,620
But you must at least...

67
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,740
At least save the Queen.

68
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,250
She has bled too much blood, Your Majesty.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,040
No.

70
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,670
No.

71
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,210
Tell me what I must do.

72
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,300
Tell me...

73
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,550
what I must do to save her.

74
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,970
Please save her.

75
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,730
Your Majesty.

76
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,770
My Queen.

77
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,990
Mother.

78
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,740
Your Majesty.

79
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,830
It seems...

80
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,330
I was...

81
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,830
wrong.

82
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,580
No.

83
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,920
Do not say so.

84
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,970
Please do not say that.

85
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,340
You cannot leave me.

86
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,180
My Queen, you cannot leave me like this.

87
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,390
Please...

88
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,730
I apologize for leaving this world...

89
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,610
before you.

90
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,530
Our son,

91
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,200
Gwang...

92
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,000
Please...

93
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,140
Mother!

94
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,930
Mother!

95
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,270
- Your Highness. - Mother!

96
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,020
Mother!

97
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,810
Mother.

98
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,110
Mother.

99
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,530
Mother!

100
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,870
Mother!

101
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,200
Mother!

102
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,160
Mother...

103
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,420
My Queen.

104
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,500
This is my fault.

105
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,710
I should have checked the stones before cheondojae.

106
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,050
I was a fool not to.

107
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,930
This is not your fault.

108
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,760
It could not have been that easy to take the Eight-feet Spirit down.

109
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,560
He desecrated the sacred cheondojae that was prepared with such care.

110
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,020
That crazy evil spirit.

111
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,150
The Queen...

112
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,660
We pray for the return of the Queen!

113
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,200
We pray for the return of the Queen!

114
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,750
I pray for your guidance, merciful Buddha.

115
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,960
We pray for the return of the Queen!

116
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,590
We pray for the return of the Queen!

117
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,890
We pray for the return of the Queen!

118
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,970
- Your Highness. - No.

119
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,350
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

120
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,310
Your Highness.

121
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,310
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

122
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,059
- Oh, no. - Your Highness.

123
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,400
Your Highness...

124
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,819
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

125
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,240
Your Highness!

126
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,490
- No. - Your Highness.

127
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,740
- Your Highness. - Good grief.

128
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,330
- Oh, no. Your Highness. - Your Highness.

129
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,910
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

130
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,290
- Your Highness. - How could this be?

131
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,560
You.

132
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,980
You said I would be a premier...

133
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,360
if I poured liquor on the stones.

134
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,490
But what is this?

135
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,399
My guard suddenly fell into madness...

136
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,740
and turned his blade upon the Queen.

137
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,699
Are you planning to kill me too?

138
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,579
How did you find me here?

139
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,789
If you suddenly pull a disappearing act on me,

140
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,920
that would leave me in a pickle.

141
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,750
I had one of my men follow you when we met before...

142
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,210
and found your hiding place.

143
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,590
You have wasted your resources.

144
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,930
With that, you have only brought your end closer.

145
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,390
- What? - When you were coming here,

146
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,930
did you notice anyone following you?

147
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,270
Arrest all of them.

148
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,519
- Understood. - No.

149
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,859
It was not me.

150
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,610
No. Listen to me. It was not me.

151
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,580
Now, is this the only way?

152
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,250
But if I do this,

153
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,540
I could die.

154
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,640
Everyone!

155
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,349
My gosh.

156
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,019
Did you all hear the news?

157
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,520
They caught those who are responsible...

158
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,900
for the Queen's death!

159
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,900
It is a madhouse over at the interrogation yard!

160
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,869
- My gosh. - They caught the culprits.

161
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,200
Those evil men!

162
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,210
I did not know a thing.

163
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,040
I was deceived by this man.

164
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,710
Please spare me, Your Majesty.

165
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,970
As soon as the sun rises tomorrow,

166
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
decapitate all of them.

167
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,350
Understood?

168
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,690
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

169
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:49,860
Oh, no. Your Majesty.

170
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,610
You vile thing.

171
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,780
Do you not fear the wrath of the deity?

172
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,450
Wrath of the deity?

173
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,820
Oh, you insult me.

174
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,029
The wrath of the deity...

175
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,200
had already befallen me from the day I was born.

176
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,159
I was born of lowly blood...

177
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,119
and came into this world blind to make it worse.

178
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,579
All my life, I have been treated as less than human.

179
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,960
If enduring such years of sorrow...

180
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,210
is not the deity's wrath, then I do not know what is.

181
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,300
That does not even begin to get close.

182
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,050
Mark my words.

183
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,720
You will face the most painful death.

184
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,520
Do not act all high and mighty.

185
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,140
You are nothing to the General of Heaven and Earth...

186
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,520
because the General also has a glowing pearl just like you.

187
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,110
Both you and that wench whom you treasure so dearly...

188
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,030
will be finished soon.

189
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,490
I should kill you here!

190
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,079
Stop it.

191
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,989
His Majesty restrained himself and did not behead him.

192
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,040
Kang Chul.

193
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,180
Oh, no.

194
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,850
Good grief.

195
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,680
Oh, no.

196
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,390
Stop.

197
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,530
Gosh. Look who it is.

198
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,160
It is none other than the beautiful Dowager Queen.

199
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,670
How dare you deceive me and trick me into sacrificing my son?

200
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,670
And you brought death upon the good-natured Queen.

201
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,260
You also used me as a pawn...

202
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,840
to serve your cause against the King.

203
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,010
Why was it me?

204
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,390
Why did you approach me?

205
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,099
Because you cowered like a rat,

206
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,520
consumed in fear.

207
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,569
- What? - Bending a fearful woman...

208
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,570
to my will was nothing but a child's play for me.

209
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,489
How dare you?

210
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,530
Your Highness.

211
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,080
He will be decapitated soon.

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,330
Please compose yourself.

213
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Let us go.

214
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,340
By sacred fire, I call forth the power of the spirit.

215
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,799
Though chained, allow my voice to reach you.

216
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,270
I humbly ask that...

217
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,310
Your Majesty.

218
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,020
Here.

219
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,990
The glasses-maker, Yeo Ri, brought them for you.

220
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
They are a talisman that keeps away spirits...

221
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,360
and a peachwood stick.

222
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
Your Majesty.

223
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,289
You have turned away your meals...

224
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,119
and have not set foot outside the library.

225
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,630
This cannot be good for you.

226
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,090
Your Majesty.

227
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,470
I must be punished with death.

228
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,220
Please...

229
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,310
Please look after your health.

230
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,600
Please look after your health.

231
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,320
Your Majesty!

232
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,760
I will bring you more.

233
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,570
What a surprise. She had tea.

234
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,000
How do I look?

235
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,340
Does it not look good on me?

236
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
I thought it would be too grand for you.

237
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,220
But...

238
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,980
it looks decent on you.

239
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,820
Do not be disappointed...

240
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,280
that I am keeping my distance.

241
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,700
If...

242
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,580
I embrace you like my son,

243
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,090
I would feel guilty for my hapless son.

244
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
I know.

245
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,930
Do not worry about that.

246
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,560
Humans are insignificant beings.

247
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,930
At times, they commit despicable acts.

248
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,850
But they are occasionally admirable.

249
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,150
That must be...

250
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,900
because mothers like you...

251
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,780
adored their children.

252
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,120
Is Yeo Ri going to make a new pot of rice?

253
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,720
It is indeed the flower of the caragana root.

254
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,140
Did the flower bloom from the flowerpot I gave you?

255
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,020
Well,

256
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,310
someone else has the flowerpot now.

257
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,030
But we did see that the caragana root had sprouted buds.

258
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,570
Really?

259
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,030
Did the caragana root truly bloom flowers?

260
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,990
What is it?

261
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,790
Why is the caragana root so important?

262
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,080
Well,

263
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,170
the thing is...

264
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,560
Royal Scribe Yoon.

265
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,920
By consuming the flowers,

266
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,090
he will be able to endure the battle...

267
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,469
against the Eight-feet Spirit without losing his glowing pearl...

268
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,430
until the power of his glowing pearl is fully used up.

269
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,560
Does Kang Chul know that?

270
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,060
Yes.

271
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,400
Kang Chul.

272
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,820
What are you thinking?

273
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,160
Answer me.

274
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,330
Is anyone out there?

275
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,670
Answer me.

276
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,640
You.

277
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,900
It is you.

278
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,190
You are the Eight-feet Spirit.

279
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,970
You should have taken my life instead.

280
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,060
Why did you kill her?

281
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,190
I was going to apologize to you.

282
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,480
I was ready to apologize to you...

283
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,940
from the bottom of my heart.

284
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,360
But why...

285
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,740
Why did you take the life of an innocent woman?

286
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,370
She had nothing but beauty and kindness in her.

287
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,710
I understand that your resentment lies deep in your heart.

288
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,170
But to what end...

289
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,260
do you intend to pursue this path?

290
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,220
It was a wrongdoing committed by my ancestor a long time ago.

291
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,970
Why must I suffer this much pain for his wrongdoing?

292
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,810
I am not responsible for his wrongdoing.

293
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,020
You are not responsible for it?

294
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,580
You know nothing...

295
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,620
of the death I suffered.

296
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,080
Or of the deaths my family,

297
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,630
my close friends,

298
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,710
and my neighbours...

299
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,960
had to face.

300
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,140
You do not know...

301
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,180
the promise I made to myself as I drew my last breath.

302
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,230
You do not know anything.

303
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,100
All your life, you have been clad in silk...

304
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,440
and dwelled with the splendour of this grand palace.

305
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,480
How could someone like you possibly know any of this?

306
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,660
Seon Woo.

307
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,970
We must go. Hurry!

308
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,950
Oh, no.

309
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,910
Oh, dear.

310
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,260
- Come here. - No.

311
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,229
Cheer for Yongdam Village's Warrior Chun!

312
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,359
- Hooray! - Hooray!

313
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,729
- Hooray! - Hooray!

314
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,569
He passed the martial arts exam.

315
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,319
That makes him General Chun!

316
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,360
Yes, that is right. He is General Chun!

317
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,829
Cheer for Yongdam Village's General Chun!

318
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,829
- Yongdam Village's General Chun! - Yongdam Village's General Chun!

319
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,919
Cheer for Yongdam Village's General Chun!

320
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,629
- Yongdam Village's General Chun! - Yongdam Village's General Chun!

321
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,629
Cheer for Yongdam Village!

322
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,050
- Hooray for Yongdam Village! - Hooray for Yongdam Village!

323
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,640
It was my fault.

324
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,600
Because of me,

325
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,520
everyone died.

326
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,860
I will never forgive you.

327
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,900
I will get my revenge even in death.

328
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,570
King.

329
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,780
Your descendants.

330
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,450
I will slaughter every one of them.

331
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,460
I will never forgive you.

332
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,750
Never!

333
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,190
You are not responsible...

334
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,900
for your ancestor's wrongdoing?

335
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,490
The king's robe you wear...

336
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,449
was paid for...

337
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,369
with the lives of my family, the villagers of Yongdam,

338
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,580
and myself!

339
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,590
You sit on the throne your ancestor kept...

340
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,050
by sacrificing us!

341
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,350
I bet you pretended to know nothing.

342
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,610
You would have praised yourself for what a great king you were.

343
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,479
You stroked your ego thinking you cared equally...

344
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,110
for all your people.

345
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,870
You are guilty alone for existing.

346
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,620
The blood that flows in you,

347
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,790
you gained at the expense...

348
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,540
of all those you killed and burned.

349
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,170
And you dare be shameless enough...

350
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,510
to say you are not responsible for anything?

351
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,239
Until all of the fool's descendants...

352
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
are wiped from this land...

353
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,670
My deep-set resentment will not subside.

354
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,040
No.

355
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,000
No.

356
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Please.

357
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,390
I will not make you completely unconscious.

358
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,520
So watch everything unfold with your own two eyes.

359
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,560
Your son,

360
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,360
the serpent that kept getting in my way,

361
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,660
and the wench Yeo Ri.

362
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,200
Watch how they all die.

363
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,370
Just like I did.

364
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
No.

365
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,590
No!

366
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,680
I am at fault.

367
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,140
I am at fault!

368
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,680
Please...

369
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:59,060
Please, no!

370
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,989
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

371
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,120
You seem...

372
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,160
The General also has a glowing pearl just like you.

373
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,910
Both you and that wench whom you treasure so dearly...

374
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,540
will be finished soon.

375
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
You surprised me.

376
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,650
Your ugly face looks even worse...

377
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,940
now that you are gloomy too.

378
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,650
What?

379
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,450
Come with me.

380
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,370
What? Where to?

381
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,749
I was sure it was somewhere here.

382
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,210
What are you looking for?

383
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,630
There it is.

384
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,590
Come take a look.

385
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,139
Yes. I will take this one.

386
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,600
Three jeon, please.

387
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,940
Come here.

388
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,930
Now you look bearable.

389
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,800
- What do you mean? - Covering up...

390
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,759
your ugly face makes your sight more bearable.

391
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,389
What? I do not want this.

392
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,429
Leave it.

393
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,730
Do not discard a gift from your guardian spirit.

394
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,940
Wear it every day.

395
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,650
This should help you...

396
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,980
tremble a bit less.

397
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,280
You always talk like that.

398
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,279
You could just say you wanted to buy it for me.

399
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,780
Why talk about how ugly I am?

400
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
Well, it is warm.

401
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,749
You cannot waste your pay this time.

402
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,660
Give it all to Young Master Gap's mother.

403
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,919
I bought you that instead of taffy for myself.

404
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,880
Did you have to scold me like that?

405
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,050
I think I like that one more.

406
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,380
Which one?

407
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,260
This one? Or this one?

408
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,220
Never mind. Now I see mine is the prettiest.

409
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,140
You picked it out too.

410
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:40,030
You are still the most beautiful human I know.

411
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,450
Hence,

412
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,620
my heart aches.

413
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,040
Hey.

414
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,830
Where are we going?

415
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,300
January 15 is coming up.

416
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,890
They are tying notes with wishes on them to burn.

417
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,219
You did not care for this back in Yongdam Valley.

418
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,350
Why do you care now?

419
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,100
It was not that I was not interested.

420
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,900
I stayed away from them because I hated everything.

421
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,900
People glared at me whenever I went close...

422
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,650
because they believed I would jinx their wishes.

423
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,530
Seeing how angry you are...

424
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,580
makes me think you had a wish you wanted to write and burn.

425
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,620
I did.

426
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,750
I was sick and tired of being alone.

427
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,539
I wished more than anything...

428
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,830
to have someone...

429
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,800
to eat and stay warm with.

430
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,340
That was my wish.

431
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,559
Are you hiding your wish from me?

432
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,140
You will jinx it. Go away.

433
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,190
Tying notes with wishes on them and burning them with the sheaf...

434
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,860
is how people pray to the Big Dipper.

435
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,030
You want to...

436
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,870
pray to a few stars so far away...

437
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,330
when you have your own guardian spirit?

438
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,499
No one knows if your wish will be granted.

439
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,790
It might be granted since I prayed in earnest.

440
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,340
To the Big Dipper.

441
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,720
- What did you write? - Do not jinx it.

442
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,470
Come on.

443
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,680
Hey, what is that?

444
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,180
What is what?

445
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,309
What do you mean?

446
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,769
I saw something over there.

447
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,890
- This? - Yes.

448
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
I heard...

449
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,740
Pung San will be executed today.

450
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,660
- Is that the fool behind it all? - Yes!

451
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,079
- My gosh. - Darn him.

452
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,289
He deserves to die.

453
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,580
Look at him.

454
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,630
Carry out the execution!

455
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,260
By sacred fire, I call forth the power of the spirit.

456
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,770
Though chained, allow my voice to reach you.

457
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,200
Allow my voice to reach you.

458
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,700
He laughs?

459
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,870
Halt!

460
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,460
Halt the execution!

461
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,090
It is His Majesty's command!

462
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,220
Your Majesty.

463
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,310
What you just commanded...

464
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,690
Your Majesty.

465
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,060
Why would you save their lives?

466
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,899
Ahn Seok Joo and that Pung San...

467
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,319
plotted to kill Her Highness the Queen.

468
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,780
They did not kill the Queen.

469
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,200
Royal Scribe Yoon Gap and glasses-maker Yeo Ri...

470
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,750
who urged me to host the evil purging ritual...

471
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,209
killed the Queen.

472
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,499
No, Your Majesty.

473
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,210
They did so to help you.

474
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,259
Are you saying you agreed with their plan to murder the Queen?

475
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,720
Not at all, Your Majesty.

476
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,259
I would not dare...

477
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,390
Carry out my command without fail!

478
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,469
Halt the execution...

479
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,940
of Master Pung San and the others.

480
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,940
Arrest Royal Scribe Yoon Gap...

481
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,690
and Yeo Ri, the glasses-maker.

482
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,190
They are to be decapitated at once!

483
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,110
This is the King's command!

484
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,739
Arrest Royal Scribe Yoon Gap and Yeo Ri, the glasses-maker!

485
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,740
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

486
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,500
Who is Yeo Ri?

487
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,250
What is happening?

488
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,670
- They are getting away! - Stop them!

489
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,050
My gosh.

490
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,680
Yeo Ri.

491
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,320
They cannot have gotten far.

492
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,940
Find them.

493
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,370
I checked this side.

494
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,540
- Look over there. - Yes, sir.

495
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,870
Come along.

496
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,050
What happened, my lord?

497
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,759
Why did His Majesty...

498
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,350
He is not the same.

499
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,020
He was grieving in sorrow.

500
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,849
He suddenly exploded with energy,

501
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:01,940
then gave this command.

502
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,310
The Eight-feet Spirit took over his body.

503
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,030
With no warding stone,

504
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,240
he has no reason to lie in wait.

505
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,320
Now that you mention that,

506
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,030
the King lets out the smell I used to smell around the Prince.

507
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,250
The Prince is in danger.

508
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,669
If the Eight-feet Spirit possessed the King,

509
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,420
the prince would be his first target.

510
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I cannot...

511
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,380
openly disobey His Majesty...

512
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,340
to save the Prince.

513
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,090
He is your King in appearance only.

514
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,299
What would happen...

515
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,140
if he were to come to his senses and realize he killed his own son?

516
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,970
The snobby man...

517
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,350
would end up losing his mind.

518
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,730
I will be at Choi Won Woo's home.

519
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,230
Bring the young Prince there.

520
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,950
What did you say?

521
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,790
He halted Pung San's execution?

522
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,949
And he commanded...

523
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,459
Royal Scribe Yoon Gap and glasses-maker Yeo Ri's arrest?

524
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,540
Yes, Your Highness.

525
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,000
He also brought Pung San into the Palace.

526
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,260
How could the King give such a strange command...

527
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,340
unless he were crazy?

528
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,150
You took off your mourning robe.

529
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
Your Majesty.

530
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,120
Have you forgotten what he did?

531
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,540
He used the evil spirit...

532
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,960
to kill the Queen and my son, Prince Young In!

533
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,210
But you stopped his execution...

534
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,300
and invited him into the palace?

535
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,590
Answer me!

536
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,220
How many days has it been since the Queen died?

537
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,020
I cannot believe you already took off your mourning robe.

538
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:11,110
You dearly cherished the Queen.

539
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,070
You are too loud.

540
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,240
Should I have you beheaded too?

541
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,160
What did you say?

542
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:21,620
What did you just say?

543
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,760
You are...

544
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,439
Look at you shaking like an aspen leaf.

545
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,820
What can you even do?

546
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,200
I do not intend to kill you.

547
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,330
You are not his blood anyway.

548
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,870
But if you do anything funny,

549
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,550
your life will not be spared either.

550
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,470
Oh, no! Your Highness.

551
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,300
My goodness.

552
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,350
Your Majesty.

553
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:29,309
Your Majesty, how could you do this to the Dowager Queen?

554
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,350
I do not want to hear it.

555
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:33,270
All of you, get out of my sight this instant.

556
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,320
If you do not wish to die, that is.

557
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:46,160
And end the queen's state funeral at once.

558
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,370
Your Majesty.

559
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:51,330
Your Majesty.

560
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,090
Your Majesty.

561
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,170
Your Majesty.

562
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:01,470
Your Highness.

563
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,560
Are you all right?

564
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,120
Who is it?

565
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,050
You are that glasses-maker, are you not?

566
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,800
Please let us inside.

567
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,100
What do you mean?

568
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:56,060
His Majesty is possessed by an evil spirit?

569
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,270
He stopped the execution of Lord Ahn Seok Joo...

570
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:00,570
and the master of the Bureau of the Blind, who killed the Queen,

571
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,070
and ordered to arrest the two of us.

572
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:04,740
Seo Jae Il of the Royal Guard...

573
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,450
also said His Majesty was suddenly acting strange.

574
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,280
I see.

575
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,750
Now that I have heard this, it does seem very strange.

576
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,210
However, I cannot blindly trust the two of you.

577
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,089
It is possible that His Majesty made such a decision...

578
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,930
because something else happened.

579
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,759
I cannot let you stay here knowing you are being chased...

580
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,140
for it could lead to an unnecessary misunderstanding.

581
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:35,390
I will not report the two of you to the guards,

582
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:38,810
so leave at once.

583
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,440
Your daughter was possessed by the book broker's vengeful spirit.

584
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,610
Have you already forgotten all about it?

585
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,950
The exact same thing is happening now.

586
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:51,700
The Eight-feet Spirit, who is after the king.

587
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,249
In other words, Chun Geum Hwi's vengeful soul...

588
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,250
has turned into an evil spirit...

589
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,080
and is possessing the king's body now.

590
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,790
And you still do not believe us?

591
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,209
You. Even the last time you came to Yongdam Village,

592
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,010
I could not stand the way you talked,

593
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,180
but His Majesty did not say anything, so I bit my tongue.

594
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,470
How dare you speak so rudely about His Majesty?

595
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,930
How dare you refer to His Majesty as "the king?"

596
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,520
Darn it.

597
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,810
Let us leave, Yeo Ri. I cannot talk to this man.

598
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,690
When and if Prince Gwang escapes the palaces and comes here,

599
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,400
do not kick him out so ruthlessly.

600
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,320
- What did you say? - My gosh, please.

601
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,620
Father, the two of them saved our lives.

602
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,330
We should not treat them like this when we should repay their kindness.

603
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,420
You may stay here tonight.

604
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:39,670
However,

605
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,130
you must leave at sunrise.

606
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,140
- Take it off. - My goodness.

607
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:53,890
Come on.

608
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,600
- Should I do it for you? - What is the matter with you?

609
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,689
- Hurry up and take it off. - Goodness. It is fine!

610
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,320
It does not even hurt anymore.

611
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,909
I saw you grimacing in pain while walking.

612
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,740
Seriously! It is my ankle. I will take care of it.

613
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,330
My goodness.

614
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,700
Go away.

615
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,250
I will come in now.

616
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
Darn it.

617
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,710
Yes, come on in.

618
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,350
It is getting late, so we could not cook up a feast for you.

619
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,390
I had them fix you a simple meal.

620
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,940
Thank you, my lady.

621
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,060
For accepting us too.

622
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,480
We would have had nowhere to go had we been kicked out earlier.

623
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,740
Like I said, you saved my life.

624
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,820
I, too,

625
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:53,320
know what it means to return a favour.

626
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,240
Yes, of course.

627
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:07,050
But this room is very small. Will you be all right here?

628
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,169
We prepared another room for you,

629
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:10,590
so you should sleep there.

630
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,220
Your food is prepared in that room.

631
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,050
This is not small.

632
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:16,680
It is bigger than my house.

633
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:31,280
I should apply warm compresses to your ankle.

634
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,450
Hey!

635
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,700
Stop.

636
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,120
The Eight-feet Spirit...

637
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,000
is possessing His Majesty's body?

638
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,050
Are you sure Kang Chul, the serpent, said so?

639
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,130
Yes.

640
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,640
Anyway, why are you two here?

641
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,140
Should you not be in the King's Palace?

642
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,390
- We got kicked out. - Sorry?

643
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,770
Is it something to brag about?

644
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,560
Goodness.

645
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,099
His Majesty...

646
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,479
I mean, His Majesty possessed by the Eight-feet Spirit...

647
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,020
has caught on...

648
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,820
that we are suspecting him.

649
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,070
Does this even make sense to you?

650
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,740
He kicked us out, knowing we had been serving him all our lives,

651
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,080
and he is protecting Sang Deuk, the traitor,

652
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,700
and that scoundrel who stabbed Her Highness the Queen.

653
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:22,910
Unbelievable.

654
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,620
What should we do?

655
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,800
Yeo Ri and Kang Chul were concerned about Prince Gwang's safety.

656
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,170
What? Prince Gwang? Why?

657
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,170
They said Prince Gwang...

658
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:36,890
would be the Eight-feet Spirit's first target.

659
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,720
Oh, no.

660
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,310
You mean, the flower of the caragana root?

661
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,730
Yes, do you have more left?

662
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,980
I came here to get more of those flowers.

663
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,150
Giving you more is nothing hard,

664
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:54,780
but I need to know what that flower can do.

665
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,240
I am pretty quick-witted too.

666
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,370
Just like how Yeo Ri is not a mere glasses-maker,

667
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,160
you are not an ordinary royal scribe.

668
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,080
I have figured out that much.

669
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,880
The flower of the caragana root bloomed in the middle of winter,

670
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,500
so it cannot be an ordinary flower either.

671
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,460
So, please answer my question.

672
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,720
Is it not the least you can do to thank me for the effort...

673
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,930
I poured into taking such good care of the plant?

674
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,850
You are right.

675
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,100
To be able to protect the person I wish to protect,

676
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,190
I need that flower. That is why.

677
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,900
The person you wish to protect?

678
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,360
Do you mean Yeo Ri?

679
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,340
What are you doing here?

680
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,760
Nothing.

681
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,300
Hey, could I get some red clay and salt?

682
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,470
Why do you need them?

683
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,100
- How much do you need? - The more, the better.

684
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,810
Something tells me I might need them very soon.

685
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,370
Open up!

686
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:51,810
Where is Gwang?

687
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,530
Your Highness, where are you headed?

688
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:02,610
First, let us go to my chambers.

689
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,040
But if His Majesty finds out that Prince Gwang is gone,

690
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,450
he will come straight to your palace.

691
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,040
In this vast palace,

692
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,800
we cannot even find a spot where Gwang can hide?

693
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:38,730
Your Highness.

694
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,510
- Did you look into it? - Yes.

695
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:03,880
She was right.

696
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,100
To find Royal Scribe Yoon Gap and the glasses-maker,

697
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,260
the guards are searching every corner of the capital.

698
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,350
My lord. It is I, Mak Geum.

699
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,730
What is the matter?

700
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,860
Your Highness the Prince!

701
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,440
Lord Choi.

702
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,829
We have confirmed that...

703
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:34,710
Prince Gwang was seen entering Choi Won Woo's house.

704
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,090
How did you know that Prince Gwang would run away?

705
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,799
Herd hunting...

706
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,260
would naturally make them go and find a place to hide.

707
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:48,220
That wench and that serpent...

708
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,810
must be there too.

709
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:52,850
We will catch them all at once.

710
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,570
No, do not do it.

711
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,570
Please!

712
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:17,870
This is...

713
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,540
the Dowager Queen's dragon hairpin, is it not?

714
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,090
Her Highness the Dowager Queen told me to give you this.

715
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:28,590
She said she trusted that you would keep me safe.

716
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:34,930
Thanks to Her Highness, Prince Gwang could escape safely.

717
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:39,020
Is it true that His Majesty is possessed by the evil spirit?

718
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,490
You refused to listen when I was telling you.

719
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:49,860
Do you believe me now?

720
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,830
My lord!

721
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,160
My lord, we are in trouble now.

722
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,250
The royal guards are outside!

723
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:05,590
Your Highness.

724
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,050
It is okay.

725
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,220
Take the kid and Yeo Ri and get out of here.

726
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,350
I will stall them.

727
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:16,810
No.

728
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,480
I will go outside and deal with them.

729
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,000
Keep His Highness safe.

730
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,040
Open the door!

731
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,500
His Majesty is here!

732
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,710
Break the door open.

733
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,270
Your Majesty.

734
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:52,150
What brings you to my house so early in the morning?

735
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:04,790
Your Majesty.

736
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,290
Now, I know who you are.

737
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,710
That coward, who was your ancestor.

738
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,630
He was there too.

739
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,300
Your Majesty.

740
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,510
Just like your ancestor did,

741
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,640
stay out of this.

742
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:25,100
If you do anything else to get in my way, I will slit your throat first!

743
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,080
Let us go now.

744
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:43,870
Stop right there!

745
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,380
Just go.

746
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,450
(The Haunted Palace)

747
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,370
Everyone, step back.

748
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:07,160
I shall be the one to slay this serpent.

749
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,669
The world now lies...

750
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:12,460
in the grasp of the General of Heaven and Earth.

751
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,209
What will happen to us now?

752
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:16,259
Must we ever live in flight to hide from my father...

753
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,010
who is possessed by the evil spirit?

754
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:19,800
To me, nothing is more important than you.

755
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:21,890
So, Kang Chul, let us run away together.

756
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:23,099
Do you truly mean it?

757
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,769
I have pledged my life to His Majesty.

758
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:28,230
I cannot bear to see the evil spirit...

759
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:29,769
defiling His Majesty's sacred body any longer.

760
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:30,770
Where is Yeo Ri?

761
01:03:30,771 --> 01:03:32,060
Stay safe, no matter what.

762
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,819
- You are... - The Court of the Underworld...

763
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,360
has ordered you to be sent to the netherworld.

764
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:39,030
You must cooperate.
