00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,410
(Yuk Seong Jae)

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,620
(Kim Ji Yeon)

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,060
(Kim Ji Hoon)

4
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,309
(The Haunted Palace)

5
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,609
(All places, organizations, characters, )

6
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,879
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,380
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,070
What is this place?

9
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,380
My gosh. You woke up.

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,420
What is this place?

11
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,120
This place? It is the palace.

12
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,420
The palace?

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,320
What am I doing in the palace?

14
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,630
What about him?

15
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,260
What happened to the man I was with?

16
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,230
He is undergoing treatment at the moment,

17
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,100
but he has not regained his consciousness yet.

18
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,200
Give me a moment.

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,140
Let me go and get you some porridge.

20
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,440
Young Master?

21
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,940
No.

22
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,840
That is...

23
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,110
Young Master Gap's body possessed by Kang Chul.

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,510
This was my fault too.

25
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,360
I knew Kang Chul would not stand idly by,

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,130
but I wanted to be with Young Master Gap,

27
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,130
so I just believed that vision I had seen like a fool.

28
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,970
I just wanted...

29
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,210
to believe that everything would be all right.

30
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,180
This is all my fault.

31
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,150
Because of me, Young Master Gap...

32
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,390
His Majesty the King is present.

33
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,700
What happened to Royal Scribe Yoon?

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,060
Did I not order you to stay by his side and protect him?

35
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,970
I apologize.

36
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,870
He said he had to stop by somewhere. He pleaded with me to let him go.

37
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,540
We had promised to meet, but he did not come. I looked for him...

38
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,640
and found him...

39
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,010
fallen under a cliff.

40
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,680
Do you think you can cure him?

41
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,160
He is breathing,

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,060
but he suffered a severe stab wound.

43
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,090
A stab wound?

44
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,900
He was deeply stabbed with a sword.

45
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,400
It will not be easy for him to regain consciousness.

46
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,670
Do you think it was some mountain bandits' doing?

47
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,970
Judging by the sword wound,

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,340
I believe it was done by a skilled swordsman.

49
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,070
It also looked like about 3 to 4 men...

50
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,610
fled the scene after covering their tracks in a rush.

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,650
He was stabbed?

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,410
What? No.

53
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,280
I did not kill him.

54
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,990
Was he telling the truth?

55
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,920
Is it true that it was not Kang Chul?

56
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,120
He...

57
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,759
took such a grave injury while trying to help me.

58
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,289
Do not skimp on medicine.

59
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,930
We must save him no matter what...

61
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,270
to find out...

62
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,770
who did this.

63
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,240
Who is that girl?

64
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,340
She was found next to him under the cliff.

65
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,650
I thought she might know who did this to him,

66
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,220
so I brought her here.

67
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,950
Did you see who stabbed Royal Scribe Yoon?

68
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,660
No, I did not.

69
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,820
Then were you not with him?

70
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,960
He had hurt his leg,

71
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,560
so I went to look for a spot where he could rest.

72
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,500
This happened while I was gone.

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,269
His ankle was wrapped with a piece of fabric...

74
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,870
ripped from a skirt.

75
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,970
Why were you with him?

76
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,210
I am a glasses-maker.

77
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,380
Royal Scribe Yoon said...

78
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,450
Your Majesty needed a new pair of glasses.

79
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,620
So, we were on our way to the palace together.

80
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,380
A glasses-maker?

81
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,299
(Episode 2)

82
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,970
What did you say? Yoon Gap is alive?

83
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,800
Stop spewing such nonsense!

84
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,110
I checked and made sure that he was dead.

85
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,340
Yes, I saw it too.

86
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,940
However, they said his corpse...

87
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,609
suddenly came back to life.

88
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,620
- What on earth are you saying? - There is more.

89
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,450
They tried to get him to kill him again,

90
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,889
but he took them down at once.

91
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,420
Do you truly expect me to believe that now?

92
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,729
That foolish bookworm did not even know...

93
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,060
how to hold a sword.

94
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,900
How could a dead man come back to life?

95
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,700
On top of that, he did what?

96
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,540
What in the world is happening?

97
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,770
They say...

98
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,780
the blind can see what ordinary people cannot see.

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,110
You were right.

100
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,710
It was that scoundrel from 13 years ago.

101
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,250
That horrible stench.

102
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,090
How could I ever forget it?

103
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,400
What should I do now?

104
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,010
Why are you not saying anything?

105
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,410
Are you listening?

106
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,300
Your Highness.

107
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,470
You do not need that screen...

108
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,870
when sitting before this lowly blind man.

109
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,870
As you are aware,

110
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,040
I cannot see anything.

111
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,860
What would you like me to do?

112
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,290
Do you want Gwang to fall prey to ghosts?

113
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,160
So that Prince Young In...

114
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,430
can ascend to the throne?

115
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,100
Or seeing that you are...

116
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,410
trembling with fear,

117
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,680
should I just go ahead and get rid of that ghost?

118
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,820
I...

119
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,490
I...

120
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:06,160
Yes, Your Highness.

121
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,290
You do not seem to know what you want,

122
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,630
but Your Highness' lowly blind servant here...

123
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,600
got the message.

124
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,409
Royal Guard Seo Jae Il...

125
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,310
brought Yoon Gap to the Royal Infirmary.

126
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,520
Before he regains consciousness,

127
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,990
we must kill him off no matter what.

128
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,960
If he wakes up,

129
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,860
we are all doomed.

130
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,310
Hold on. What is this sound?

131
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,780
It is coming from here, is it not?

132
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,589
What is all this?

133
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,759
- Oh, no. - What happened?

134
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,320
Clean this up at once.

135
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,489
My goodness. These are rare medicinal herbs.

136
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,629
- Oh, no. - Was this a thief's doing?

137
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,600
It was a lot of work to dry these.

138
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,030
What?

139
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,770
You regained consciousness already?

140
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,940
Are you all right?

141
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,640
Do you know where you are now?

142
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,980
I do not feel good.

143
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,510
I am struggling to keep my eyes open.

144
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,120
My body feels heavy.

145
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,490
Look here, Royal Scribe Yoon!

146
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,850
Snap out of it!

147
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,060
I feel achy all over,

148
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,730
and I am so itchy.

149
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,010
Why does this hurt so much?

150
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,309
You scratched your open wound with your fingernails.

151
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,809
How could it not hurt?

152
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,979
My goodness.

153
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,219
Hurry up. Disinfect and redress the wound.

154
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,320
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

155
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,810
This is just a bowl of rice gruel, which is nothing special.

156
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,520
What is this?

157
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,920
What is this intense aroma?

158
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,090
Are you just going to stare at it?

159
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,190
Do you feel discomfort?

160
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,460
What just happened? What is this?

161
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,390
What on earth did you put in this?

162
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,090
What do you mean?

163
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,999
We just boiled some rice with water.

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,360
That is it?

165
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,200
Yet, it is making my tongue dance inside my mouth?

166
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,500
Pardon me?

167
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,810
I am glad to hear that it is pleasing to your palate.

168
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,940
It is pleasing to my palate?

169
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,780
Palate?

170
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,590
Right.

171
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,559
- Humans have five senses. - Rice gruel?

172
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Touch, sight, smell, hearing,

173
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,530
and the sense of taste, which is the strongest of them all.

174
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,329
That is why even a mere bowl of rice gruel...

175
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,069
can make the human tongue...

176
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,570
dance like a butterfly.

177
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,690
- Goodness. - Please do something!

178
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,059
What are you all waiting for? Stop him!

179
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,199
No! He will hit me again!

180
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,029
I understand that he was on the verge of death,

181
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,069
but how could he change like this all of a sudden?

182
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,430
Darn, I wonder too.

183
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,940
- My gosh. - What should we do?

184
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,570
I get it.

185
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,110
It must be...

186
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,380
amnesia.

187
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,950
Amnesia?

188
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,090
- Really? - Yes, he has amnesia.

189
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,200
These lowly creatures called humans.

190
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,770
But the five human senses...

191
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,800
and the human tongue.

192
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,610
What a marvellous thing!

193
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,050
For over a thousand years,

194
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,319
I have barely nibbled...

195
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,460
on the energies of foodstuffs to sustain myself,

196
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,160
but these humans...

197
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,330
have been enjoying such delicious things!

198
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,400
Just because they have tongues,

199
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,670
these lowly humans...

200
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,600
can enjoy such delicious foods.

201
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,770
Darn, I am so angry...

202
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,270
that my stomach is turning.

203
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
It is him.

204
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,190
Move!

205
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,300
Darn it.

206
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,310
I must...

207
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,350
leave this place with Yeo Ri before he sees us.

208
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,950
(Episode 2: Where Kang Chul Walks, Autumn Turns to Spring)

209
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,890
You may sleep in my room tonight.

210
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,720
His Majesty will summon you in the morning.

211
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Yes, my lady.

212
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,730
This awful stench. What is this smell?

213
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,640
It is like a burning smell of some sort.

214
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,339
Anyway, this is the palace where His Majesty resides.

215
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,580
Why is it that the whole place is filled with such spooky vibes?

216
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,610
Yeo Ri.

217
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,120
Yeo Ri.

218
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,780
Young Master Gap?

219
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,400
Over here, Yeo Ri.

220
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,600
Save me.

221
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,070
- Rescue me. - Young Master.

222
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,170
You! Where are you going?

223
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,240
You cannot run off like that.

224
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,840
Hey!

225
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,420
Where has she gone?

226
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,090
Yeo Ri.

227
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,090
His spirit is in the palace.

228
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,040
Yes, I am here.

229
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,440
Come this way.

230
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,110
You are almost there.

231
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,340
Yeo Ri, over here. Inside the well.

232
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,910
Please save me...

233
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,610
Young Master!

234
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,380
I have been fooled.

235
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,630
Darn it. Why is this body so slow?

236
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,120
Come along.

237
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,830
Come with me.

238
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,530
I was wronged, and I am so lonely.

239
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,540
Wake up.

240
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,780
Wake...

241
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,450
up.

242
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,330
Darn it.

243
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,700
Is it because I have the eyes of a man?

244
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,760
Are you awake?

245
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,190
Young Master?

246
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,290
I am not that fool.

247
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,300
I have not seen him in a while.

248
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,910
It looks like he crossed the Samdo Stream long ago.

249
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,310
- Forget about him. - No.

250
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,980
The Drowned Spirit stuck in the well...

251
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,210
because she had not yet recovered her soul...

252
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,980
called out to me in Young Master Yoon's voice.

253
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,790
That spirit knew him.

254
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,990
Young Master Yoon's spirit must be within this Palace.

255
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
So what?

256
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,030
I will talk to the Drowned Spirit again.

257
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,840
Have you lost your mind?

258
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,069
Even skilled shamans...

259
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,240
lose their lives to spirits from the water.

260
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,110
You have no warding stone or guardian spirit.

261
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,979
Do you not know how enticing you are...

262
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,050
to such rogue spirits?

263
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,180
You are looking out for me?

264
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,220
How detestable.

265
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,889
I wasted 13 years...

266
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,120
to claim you.

267
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,890
Do you think I will let some lowly spirit take you?

268
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,740
- Wailing spirits? - We cannot be here.

269
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,710
Let go of me.

270
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,450
Darn it.

271
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,780
Why did I end up...

272
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,750
with Yoon Gap's...

273
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,220
weak, useless body?

274
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,809
(Myung, "bright")

275
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,720
(Hee, "delight")

276
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,420
That is "hee" meaning "delight."

277
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,819
(Hwan, "to shine")

278
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,490
Do you see this character as well?

279
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,260
I do not see it.

280
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,690
It is "hwan" meaning "to shine."

281
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,900
The young girl has a fascinating skill.

282
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,170
Yes.

283
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,040
These glasses seem to suit me perfectly.

284
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,570
Then I will polish that crystal for your glasses.

285
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,840
I see it is curved toward the center.

286
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,140
This must be a concave lens.

287
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,309
It is for people...

288
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,420
who can see what is close but not what is at a distance.

289
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,520
How do you know that, Your Majesty?

290
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,960
I made many pairs of glasses,

291
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,090
but no one could understand how they worked.

292
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,360
Of course.

293
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,630
Why else would I be King?

294
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,000
I even read "How to See Far..."

295
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,100
by Johann Adam Schall von Bell.

296
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,510
I read that book, understood the principle,

297
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,440
and taught master craftsmen to make...

298
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,320
these very glasses.

299
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,990
- That is... - No pair of glasses...

300
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,190
has satisfied me as much as these.

301
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,530
Not only does it restore my sight,

302
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,970
it even helps clear my head. It works like magic.

303
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,970
Is that warding stone?

304
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,210
This is the warding stone.

305
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,740
Consider it an extension of your body.

306
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,980
Keep it with you at all times.

307
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,510
That is a female warding stone.

308
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,050
It is shaped differently because it was shaped into glasses,

309
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,190
but I am sure of it.

310
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,390
What is that doing here?

311
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,720
That is why...

312
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,190
I do not need new glasses.

313
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,900
What?

314
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,570
I am sorry.

315
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,970
I asked to see you...

316
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,470
because I heard Royal Scribe Yoon brought you here to serve me,

317
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,610
and I wanted to know about you.

318
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,310
You are excused.

319
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,620
What should I do?

320
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,720
I have questions for the Drowned Spirit.

321
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,720
I need an excuse to visit the Palace.

322
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,660
Your Majesty. I travelled far...

323
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,870
with Scribe Yoon to come here.

324
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,600
My only purpose was to be honoured...

325
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,799
with the chance to make your glasses...

326
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,370
with my menial skills.

327
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,840
Scribe Yoon who is at death's door...

328
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,479
brought me here for that exact reason.

329
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,650
I heard Yoon Gap woke up last night.

330
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,980
He is not a royal and cannot be kept...

331
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,790
in the Royal Infirmary for long,

332
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,249
so he was taken to Hyeminseo for treatment.

333
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,289
(A government office that treated the poor)

334
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,620
Oh, yes.

335
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,160
That is very fortunate,

336
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,830
however...

337
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,630
What is it you wish to say?

338
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,980
Allow me to make you...

339
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,780
a pair of shaded glasses.

340
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,970
Goodness.

341
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,640
How dare you...

342
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,510
give His Majesty a sales pitch?

343
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,580
Should I call you fearless or gutsy?

344
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,480
I apologize.

345
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,150
His Majesty gave his permission...

346
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,220
because he favours Yoon Gap.

347
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,290
Do not act rashly.

348
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,660
I will not.

349
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,860
Hey. You!

350
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,600
Oh, Head Eunuch,

351
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,569
What brings you here?

352
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,110
Give this child room to work in for a few days.

353
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,940
Sure.

354
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,110
- Oh, come this way. - Wait.

355
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,980
May I purchase the materials I need...

356
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,420
and start the work tomorrow?

357
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,020
You may.

358
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,840
His Majesty will be pleased to see you.

359
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,539
He complained of eye pressure...

360
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,070
and said he was in need of new glasses.

361
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,140
That is why...

362
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,240
I do not need new glasses.

363
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,280
The King did not need new glasses.

364
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,480
Why did Scribe Yoon...

365
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,550
bring me here?

366
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,490
And what is my grandmother's female warding stone...

367
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,220
doing here?

368
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,800
My cherished subject was attacked.

369
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,270
The scene of his murder was well-cleaned,

370
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,100
so it was not the work of bandits.

371
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,770
Should we not find out who it was?

372
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,310
Do you have an idea...

373
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,180
who was behind it?

374
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,950
It would be someone who draws a sword before he speaks.

375
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,220
I expected...

376
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,650
my resolve would cause bloodshed,

377
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,860
but I did not want Yoon Gap to be the first victim.

378
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,760
Then why...

379
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,960
was that glasses-maker summoned?

380
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,530
The fact that...

381
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,529
Yoon Gap brought her here at this timing...

382
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,200
makes me feel uneasy for some reason.

383
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,850
Who goes there?

384
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,690
I have not seen you before.

385
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,190
How dare you come here to spy?

386
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,330
I am...

387
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,430
She is someone of high standing.

388
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,270
Why do I smell a Vengeful Spirit?

389
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,570
Is it because of the Drowned Spirit?

390
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,700
It looks like...

391
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
you will not explain yourself.

392
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,010
Do not just stand there. Drag her away.

393
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,340
- Yes, my Queen. - Yes, my Queen.

394
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,420
I am a glasses-maker.

395
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,919
It is my first time here, and I got lost.

396
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,350
Do forgive me.

397
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,060
Stop.

398
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,930
Did Royal Scribe Yoon Gap...

399
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,270
bring you here?

400
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,040
Yes. That is true.

401
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,140
You may leave.

402
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,850
Thank you.

403
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,720
Your Highness. Why did you let her go?

404
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,360
If Scribe Yoon brought her here,

405
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,930
she must be that girl.

406
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,800
We cannot act rashly.

407
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,740
Yoon Gap is awake.

408
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,500
I will speak with him myself...

409
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,310
and then call upon her.

410
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,620
That was the Queen's back garden.

411
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,790
I might never find the soul,

412
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,220
let alone approach it.

413
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,160
Was she a court maid?

414
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,800
She held a deep grudge.

415
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,470
What happened to her?

416
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,040
Is Scribe Yoon Gap that nasty?

417
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,840
He is causing such a fuss.

418
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,309
He jumps into a burning furnace,

419
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,239
hops off a roof,

420
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,940
and runs around with a knife in his mouth.

421
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,910
What if it is not amnesia...

422
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,650
but a mental illness?

423
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,090
That is what everyone at Hyeminseo thinks.

424
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,619
He did not look that bad when we saw him.

425
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,390
Exactly. How does someone change overnight?

426
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,659
- My gosh. - Scribe Yoon!

427
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,359
What are you doing up there?

428
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,129
- You are still young. - Come down.

429
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,569
- Come down. - What is wrong?

430
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,040
- Get back down here! - Listen to us.

431
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,000
I jumped three times already, and it did not work.

432
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,739
Must I jump from a higher point?

433
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,180
Should I jump with my eyes closed?

434
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,010
- Oh, no. - Do not jump!

435
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
Royal Scribe Yoon.

436
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,190
- Come down. - Come down.

437
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,050
Who are those fools?

438
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,560
That makes no sense at all!

439
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,830
A gisaeng house?

440
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,300
He is a timid fool with no such urges...

441
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,439
and a mind as stiff and upright as a board,

442
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,500
and he went where?

443
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,940
Listen.

444
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:49,769
He almost died yesterday from a stab wound,

445
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,870
and he went to a gisaeng house?

446
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,979
Would you believe that if you were me?

447
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,309
That is what I do not get myself!

448
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,780
He had a gaping wound,

449
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,880
but when he heard there would be delicacies and endless wine,

450
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,749
he ran off without any shoes on.

451
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,820
What do you want me to do about it?

452
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,820
He did what?

453
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,489
My Gap...

454
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,989
rushed off to drink in broad daylight?

455
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,260
In stockinged feet?

456
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,130
- Yes. His shoes... - My gosh.

457
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,530
Here are his shoes.

458
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,740
Oh, my gosh. Gap.

459
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,539
He even ate all the food...

460
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,310
we had stocked up for the patients.

461
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,179
The number of tiles he shattered...

462
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,680
by jumping on the roof?

463
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,150
Exactly 15.

464
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,550
What?

465
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,650
Can you pay for it all?

466
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,920
Will this cover it?

467
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,490
Where is that gisaeng house?

468
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,940
The thin rice gruel is nothing compared to this.

469
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,369
Grilled abalone, marinated raw crab, tangpyeongchae, salted mackerel,

470
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,839
cucumber kimchi, corvina, pajeon, shinseonro,

471
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,140
braised ribs, chrysanthemum wine, pine needle wine, and yukjeon.

472
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,280
What a grand feast this is!

473
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,880
Oh, yes. Give me one more plate of this.

474
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,920
And that as well. Do remember to bring more of these dishes too.

475
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,789
What about liquor? What other liquor do you have?

476
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,220
We have lotus leaf wine and pear blossom wine.

477
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,689
Oh, we also have more azalea wine.

478
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,929
Just hearing their names makes my heart beat.

479
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,499
Fetch one bottle of each wine.

480
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,200
- Make haste. - Yes, my lord.

481
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,309
Are you sure the Minister of War...

482
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,410
will foot the bill?

483
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,480
We will not be able to pay for this with our salary.

484
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,509
Should we bolt?

485
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,180
Your brain seems to be working well today.

486
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,120
Hey, Yeo Ri.

487
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,260
You are here, Yeo Ri.

488
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,200
Who are you, wench?

489
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,170
Why are you hurting me?

490
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,140
Yeo Ri. Who is this woman? Tell me.

491
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,010
I will make her pay for this.

492
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,140
Darn it.

493
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,890
No, stop it.

494
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,230
You brat.

495
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,200
I, your mother,

496
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:06,840
was so scared that you might die. You have no idea.

497
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,740
Good grief.

498
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,480
Thank you for staying alive, Gap.

499
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,180
Thank you so much, my son. Oh, my.

500
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,010
Thank you so much.

501
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,020
Thank you.

502
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,070
Bring me one more drink.

503
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,890
- Please. Let me do it. - No, I am done anyway.

504
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,089
You are an important guest. I must ensure the room is clean.

505
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,490
Gosh, I am no guest here.

506
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,560
Goodness. I know this room looks old.

507
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,070
This room is the warmest since its fire is the strongest.

508
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,539
If it is not an inconvenience, I would like to stay for a while.

509
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,540
Gosh, it is not an inconvenience. Do not say such a thing.

510
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,769
It has been a while since I met anyone from Yongdam Village.

511
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,540
You have no idea how happy it makes me to see you.

512
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,180
My gosh.

513
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,690
Life must not have been easy for you.

514
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,320
But you became an excellent glasses-maker.

515
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,390
Well done, Yeo Ri.

516
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,560
Well, after going through the recent event,

517
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,300
I cannot stop thinking about what the great shaman said.

518
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,270
My grandmother?

519
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,670
Yes.

520
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,610
Was it...

521
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,810
just after Gap's first birthday?

522
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:00,080
This boy will not make it past 30.

523
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,559
Hang myeongdari.

524
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,329
(Myeongdari: A piece of cloth as a spiritual offering...)

525
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,130
(to wish for a child's good health and longevity)

526
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,010
The shaman who was to pray for my son passed away.

527
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,310
All these years, that had bothered me.

528
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,980
He survived a close brush with death.

529
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,190
I believe it is you I must thank.

530
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,119
My gosh, no. I did not do anything.

531
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,660
Yes, you did. Because you were with him,

532
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,790
my son, Gap, could come back alive.

533
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,000
Thank you, Yeo Ri.

534
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,130
Your room will be ready soon. I am almost done.

535
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,540
I am sorry.

536
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,710
He is not Young Master Yoon Gap.

537
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,210
- You are bad luck. - This is all your fault.

538
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,980
- How will you fix this? - You wretched girl!

539
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,880
What are you doing?

540
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,850
Stop beating her at this instant!

541
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,680
My children are on the brink of starvation...

542
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,989
because of Kang Chul whom she is to blame...

543
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,190
for bringing into our lives!

544
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,190
You all know that you are unfairly taking it out on her.

545
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,260
Even before Kang Chul appeared in our town,

546
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,129
we always suffered from floods, drought,

547
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,260
and swarms of insects.

548
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,900
Natural disasters that are beyond our control...

549
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,470
had always been around us!

550
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,040
But...

551
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,570
why are you all blaming everything on this girl?

552
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,850
I am going to Hanyang with my mother.

553
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,420
I see. When?

554
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,520
In a few days once my bones heal.

555
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,960
That brings me to my question.

556
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,930
Would you like to come with us?

557
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,530
With you?

558
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,200
Yes.

559
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,000
Come with us.

560
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,670
You must be sick of this town too.

561
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,880
No. Why would I follow you to Hanyang?

562
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,310
Then what if the townspeople bully you again?

563
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,409
Will you continue to put up with this life?

564
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,319
Was a broken leg not enough for you?

565
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,680
I'm cursed by Kang Chul,

566
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,289
and I lost favour with the Dragon King.

567
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,549
What more misfortune do you wish to face because of me?

568
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,120
There is no such thing in this world.

569
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,590
I hurt my leg...

570
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,930
because I climbed up the tree recklessly.

571
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,960
It was not your fault.

572
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,240
Come with me, Yeo Ri.

573
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,960
Did he truly cross over the Samdo Stream?

574
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,290
No. It has not been 49 days yet. That cannot be.

575
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,630
I wondered if he would be around his mother.

576
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,270
Your effort is for naught.

577
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,240
I did not see his spirit...

578
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,140
around the Palace or this vicinity.

579
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,210
I cannot do anything if you do not believe me.

580
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,650
You would not believe me even if I only spoke of the truth.

581
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,660
What?

582
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,790
Have you no fear?

583
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,430
What is it?

584
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,530
Do you wish me to be your guardian spirit now?

585
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,000
Try it...

586
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:18,900
if you can.

587
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,370
- What? - You cannot do it, can you?

588
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,770
You cannot do a thing as you are trapped in his body.

589
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,209
You jumped off the roof and dove into a fire...

590
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,510
to escape from his body.

591
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,110
You even went around with a knife in your mouth.

592
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,850
Am I wrong?

593
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,260
Yes. You are right.

594
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,390
I will never believe anything that comes out of your mouth.

595
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,790
But...

596
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,200
this heart...

597
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,440
is still beating.

598
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,439
What are you doing?

599
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,840
You pretended to be honourable in front of Yoon Gap,

600
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,580
how dare you touch my body as you please?

601
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,150
I was not touching your body.

602
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,250
I was touching Scribe Yoon's body.

603
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,050
His warm body, still warm with blood coursing through it.

604
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,620
What are you planning to do?

605
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:17,730
You're right.

606
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,500
It is what you are thinking.

607
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,100
You want to find his spirit and put it back in this body?

608
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,839
Nonsense! His fate is already sealed with death.

609
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,899
Does it make any sense that you are occupying his body...

610
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,970
whose fate is sealed with death?

611
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,210
The longing for him is unbearable.

612
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,450
And I am staring right at his face and body.

613
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
But it is not him.

614
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,950
It is the face I treasure the most.

615
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,560
But you, whom I loathe the most, have taken over his face.

616
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:51,390
This is...

617
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,000
the most wretched nightmare.

618
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,600
I cannot...

619
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,300
stand you.

620
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,510
Stop tarnishing his reputation any further...

621
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,110
when you are carrying his face and voice...

622
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,580
until you return his body to him unharmed.

623
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,550
I cannot tolerate you making him look like a lunatic.

624
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,350
Fine.

625
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,220
Keep throwing your harsh words at me all you want.

626
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,770
Yeo Ri.

627
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,130
I had never come across a human like her.

628
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,170
The most harmonious being...

629
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,700
in the sky and on earth.

630
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,250
She possessed enough goodness...

631
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,890
to wash away the misfortune caused by humans.

632
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:38,870
Considering that,

633
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,870
never...

634
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,510
will I give you up.

635
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,619
His Majesty has ordered...

636
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,949
Royal Scribe Yoon Gap's immediate presence...

637
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:32,960
in the Palace.

638
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,920
I understand my son is at His Majesty's beck and call.

639
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,729
He was stabbed and resting to recover.

640
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,830
Is it not too early to demand my son to resume work? Good grief.

641
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,200
How dare you?

642
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,860
Do not be insolent.

643
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,670
Good gracious, your ears are keen. I was talking to myself.

644
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,770
I must go and wake him up. I am on my way now.

645
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,670
Gap, wake up.

646
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,910
His Majesty is asking for you.

647
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,810
How delighted I am to hear such news.

648
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:00,280
The physician tells me he has lost his memories.

649
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,150
I want you to observe him while you fetch him for me.

650
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,360
So this is what they call ondol.

651
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,489
Yes.

652
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,599
I ought to appreciate all five senses,

653
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,230
not just the sense of taste.

654
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,330
The warmth is engulfing my entire body.

655
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,300
It is as if my body is melting.

656
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,840
What a delight this is.

657
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:28,980
Get up.

658
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,780
No.

659
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,720
Did you not hear them?

660
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,390
The King wants you to come to the Palace now.

661
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,490
He is not my king.

662
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,260
Must I go just because he calls on me?

663
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,300
Are you going to refuse a royal command?

664
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,299
He will not even be able to live to 100.

665
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,370
Why do you fear him so much?

666
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,970
To me, it is more important to stay right here and enjoy...

667
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,840
this lovely ondol.

668
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,880
I said I could not tolerate you further disgracing his reputation.

669
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,920
How your heartfelt care for him moves me!

670
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,989
He brought you here under pretences.

671
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,090
Why do you care so much about him?

672
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,859
Do you think he brought you here just to make glasses?

673
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,890
He...

674
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,630
Go on.

675
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,130
My gosh, never mind. I am going to get some more sleep.

676
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,530
What are you hiding from me?

677
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,269
I found your behaviour suspicious...

678
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:28,740
since you showed up in Yongdam Village.

679
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,210
You must know...

680
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,540
why Scribe Yoon brought me to the Palace.

681
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,380
Even if I knew,

682
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,350
why would I tell you?

683
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:41,350
You will not believe anything I say even if I tell the truth.

684
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,690
Forget it. I had no expectations from you.

685
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,850
I was the fool for asking you.

686
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,990
I will get to the bottom of it myself.

687
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:08,379
That was easy.

688
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,480
Darn it.

689
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:11,910
There is a naive side to him which is unexpected.

690
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,380
Good grief.

691
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,950
I do not intend to do your bidding even in the slightest.

692
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,659
I am merely accompanying you...

693
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,860
to ensure random spirits do not cling onto you.

694
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,459
I have singled you out to be mine 13 years ago.

695
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,460
My gosh.

696
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,770
I got it. So stop that.

697
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,139
Everyone is staring at us.

698
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,270
How do humans put up with uncomfortable clothing every day?

699
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,880
And this hat...

700
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,140
As I am sweaty, this keeps getting sticky.

701
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,380
Yes. And let us talk about this belt.

702
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,549
It is such a hassle as it gets in the way.

703
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,580
That little...

704
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,399
You can go to Sanguiwon now.

705
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,429
Pardon?

706
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,430
(Sanguiwon: A bureau in charge of royal attire)

707
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,129
Yes, my lord.

708
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,370
What? Yeo Ri, where are you going?

709
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,840
- Let me come with you. - Not so fast.

710
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,410
Come on. Stop him.

711
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,240
Yes, my lord.

712
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,980
How dare you put your hands on me?

713
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,780
Let go.

714
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,589
- Let go! - My gosh.

715
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,760
- He will be fine. - Oh, no.

716
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,590
Use your strength!

717
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,060
Use your strength.

718
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,430
Put me down this instant!

719
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,260
- Bring him in. - Put me down.

720
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,030
Get your hands off me!

721
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,169
That grilled-abalone-looking man...

722
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,769
- Come here. - I shall fling him...

723
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,570
all the way to the ocean in Jeju.

724
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,840
That little...

725
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,010
Hey, put him down.

726
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,280
What is going on?

727
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,780
Your Majesty.

728
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,820
- Scribe Yoon has... - Later.

729
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,490
What is this?

730
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,489
I am here because that jerk wanted to see me.

731
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,759
- That jerk? - How dare he ignore me?

732
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,530
How rude!

733
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,430
How dare you address His Majesty...

734
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,100
Was it that way?

735
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,340
Wait right here!

736
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,769
I do not want to. Why must I?

737
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,340
- How dare he? - Right.

738
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,980
So the place she was headed to...

739
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,209
was called Sanguiwon or something.

740
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,050
Has he gone mad?

741
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,690
That punk...

742
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:35,990
Listen to me.

743
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,030
You must go after him.

744
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:21,129
I seek to summon the spirit of a woman...

745
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,630
on the Day of the White Sheep in the Month of the Fire Rooster...

746
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,870
and in the Year of the Red Monkey.

747
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,070
Please grant me your permission.

748
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,279
Dear Great Taeseong who resides in the sky,

749
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,850
please answer my prayer wherever or whenever it may be.

750
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,810
I ask that you protect my body and mind...

751
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,720
from wrongful and evil spirits.

752
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,320
Please protect...

753
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,690
I got you.

754
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,680
Great Taeseong does not stay in one place

755
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,110
But chases away wickedness, goblins, and evil spirits

756
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,610
Great Taeseong enlightens us

757
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:36,270
She is out.

758
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,320
Great King of Paradise, Great King of Yeongpoong

759
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,790
And Great King of the World hastily go to the great mountain

760
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,290
Please guide the living who remains here

761
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:05,130
To the right path

762
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,770
Tell me where Scribe Yoon is.

763
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,970
Then I shall rescue the rest of your spirit.

764
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,100
She is not at Sanguiwon. Where on earth did she go?

765
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,669
No.

766
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,470
You cannot go until you tell me where he is.

767
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,310
Even if you know where he is, you will not be able to see him.

768
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,580
Why is that?

769
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:29,080
Being able to see him would mean your death.

770
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,580
What do you mean?

771
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:02,550
Answer me. Explain what you said.

772
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,190
It already...

773
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:06,990
swallowed him up.

774
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,490
"It?"

775
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,500
The Eight-feet Spirit.

776
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,620
Gwang.

777
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,250
Gwang.

778
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,020
The Eight-feet Spirit?

779
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:55,840
It is him.

780
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:58,910
The Eight-feet Spirit.

781
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,900
(Special thanks to Kim Young Kwang and Kim Ki Ri)

782
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,020
(The Haunted Palace)

783
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,820
I cannot give up on Scribe Yoon.

784
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:48,919
My lord.

785
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,329
He deceived you.

786
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:51,929
He used you.

787
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:54,160
I will never believe you.

788
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,059
After I save him,

789
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,270
I will ask him to explain.

790
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:00,300
Do you not wish to avenge the one responsible for your death?

791
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,770
I will help you.

792
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,570
In return, you must help me.

793
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,640
The Eight-feet Spirit's resentment did not start with him.

794
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,580
Yoon Gap knows too much.

795
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,810
Keep a close eye on him.

796
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,050
What is this? What is going on?

797
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:17,090
I will use myself as bait to lure out the Eight-feet Spirit.
