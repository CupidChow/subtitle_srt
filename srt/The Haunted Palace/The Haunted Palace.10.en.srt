(Kim Ji Yeon)

(Kim Ji Hoon)

00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,339
(The Haunted Palace)

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,009
(All places, organizations, characters,)

6
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,719
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,340
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,390
Do not do this.

9
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,020
I told you to stay still.

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,520
You cannot even clean it properly because it hurts.

11
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,150
My goodness.

12
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,900
I told you not to do this!

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,190
Do you know what is tormenting me?

14
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,490
My grandmother...

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,819
must be in agony even now...

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,120
for she is trapped by the Eight-feet Spirit.

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,490
My heart breaks at the thought of her dying in vain.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,870
Despite my grief,

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,290
deep down in my heart,

20
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,840
I was relieved...

21
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,510
because you did not kill my grandmother.

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,550
A sense of relief...

23
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,560
came to me first.

24
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,310
I was greatly relieved...

25
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,440
for I did not need to bear the guilt of being drawn to you this much.

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,530
Only that thought consumed me.

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,780
- You... - How could this be?

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,370
No granddaughter could be as awful as me.

29
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,550
Wait.

30
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,339
It sounds like she is up.

31
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,380
What?

32
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,510
Yes.

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,890
Go inside.

34
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,810
Call me if you need me.

35
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,980
Oh, you mean me?

36
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,110
You want me to go inside now?

37
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,940
Yes. You should.

38
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,980
- Go inside. - I will.

39
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Here I go.

40
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,240
- I will go inside. - Yes.

41
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,790
All right.

42
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,010
My gosh.

43
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,890
My son, are you all right?

44
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,270
I am all right.

45
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:22,309
It seemed you were hurt badly earlier.

46
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,560
- Let me see you. - Gosh, I told you I was all right.

47
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,770
That is a relief then.

48
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,530
Do you know how scared I was?

49
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,400
Why on earth did he do such a thing to you?

50
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,069
What kind of resentment does he have against you?

51
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,990
Why did he abduct me to put you in danger like that?

52
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,660
But is he all right?

53
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,330
If you cross a man of such rank,

54
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,370
it may bring downfall on people like us.

55
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,380
Do not worry.

56
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,750
He will never come after me ever again.

57
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,670
Gap.

58
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,010
Say you caught a disease or something.

59
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,640
Could you make up some excuse to quit?

60
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,889
I want you to quit everything,

61
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,310
so you, Yeo Ri, and I could go back...

62
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,640
to Yongdam Village together.

63
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,650
Your life was in danger once again.

64
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,610
Life does not need to be grand.

65
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,650
Time flies.

66
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,780
So...

67
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,370
to be with the one you hold dear...

68
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,330
and to love one another in return...

69
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,790
is the finest way to live. Understood?

70
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,420
(Episode 10)

71
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,220
Did you say...

72
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,640
the Master from the Bureau of the Blind made this talisman?

73
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,140
Yes.

74
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,800
The talisman has brought him...

75
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,970
a steady flow of customers lately.

76
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,779
It is none other than the mighty Minister of War.

77
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,159
I am deeply honoured by your presence in this modest place.

78
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,790
Unlike the others,

79
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,870
I have not come to ask you for a favour.

80
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,789
- I am here... - Are you not here...

81
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,920
because of Royal Scribe Yoon?

82
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,799
You must wonder how this talisman, Haeilbu,

83
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,170
could subdue his strength...

84
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,840
that was once so formidable.

85
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,760
How did you know?

86
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,010
He is...

87
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,010
a serpent.

88
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,640
What? A serpent?

89
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,479
There is something called the glowing pearl within him.

90
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,569
The glowing pearl possesses a mystical force.

91
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,190
Hurling a man away with a mere gust is nothing for him.

92
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,410
He came back to life from the brink of death too.

93
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,700
You must keep the talisman with you at all times.

94
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,740
And...

95
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,830
if you find yourself up against him, use that.

96
00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:00,050
(Episode 10: There Is No Evil Spirit)

97
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,520
What is it?

98
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,150
Why are you blushing like a newlywed bride?

99
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,480
What is it, seriously?

100
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,820
Yeo Ri said...

101
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,070
she liked me.

102
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,870
What?

103
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,250
Are you that dense? Are you a fool?

104
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,419
Do you not know that humans are...

105
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,500
easily swayed by what lies before their eyes?

106
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,000
Do you honestly believe she has feelings for you?

107
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,209
She likes the flesh of Yoon Gap,

108
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,720
so she is confused too.

109
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,390
What do you expect from a human?

110
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,390
Can you not see that you will be the one getting hurt?

111
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,640
You may be right. However,

112
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,860
she expressed affection for me for the first time.

113
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,230
For now, I will only think about that.

114
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,860
And I have a reliable brother like you.

115
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,700
I will never get hurt.

116
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,660
Do not worry.

117
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,120
I shall find someone whose belly is steep in malice...

118
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,870
just for you.

119
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,080
My gosh, you ought to take today off,

120
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,790
considering the awful thing you went through yesterday.

121
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,380
You never know what might happen.

122
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,210
He might try to harm Yeo Ri.

123
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,670
So starting today, you two ought to stay together.

124
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,260
My goodness.

125
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,850
Take good care of Yeo Ri. All right?

126
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,100
My gosh.

127
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,520
- We should go. - Yes.

128
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,020
Why are you still here? Go after her.

129
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,280
Yes.

130
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,900
Do not leave each other's side.

131
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,780
Gosh, they make a nice couple.

132
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,830
What a cute couple.

133
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,259
Oh, right. She said that...

134
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,009
you seemed to know...

135
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,350
about the man who abducted her quite well. Is that true?

136
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,270
Things were hectic. So she was mistaken.

137
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,810
I did not recognize him.

138
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,519
Then why did a man you do not even know...

139
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,060
abduct her and try to harm you?

140
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,779
It must mean the Eight-feet Spirit is not the only enemy...

141
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,360
we must worry about.

142
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,069
It means that...

143
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,530
the King's political enemies know about us now.

144
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,120
Do not worry.

145
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,330
As long as you are by my side,

146
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,120
no one can lay a finger on you.

147
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,170
So never leave my side.

148
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,750
Understood?

149
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,510
Yes.

150
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,590
Those are local chrysanthemums.

151
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,260
Chrysanthemums?

152
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,110
We will have to wait a few more days for them to be in full bloom.

153
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,420
They are already in full bloom.

154
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,090
What?

155
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,320
His Majesty told you to wait here.

156
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
I see.

157
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,830
What? What is it?

158
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,330
This must be...

159
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,710
Young Master Yoon's brush.

160
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,169
(Yoon Gap)

161
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,210
Yes.

162
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,999
It was the brush...

163
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,300
Royal Scribe Yoon Gap used in this library.

164
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,510
Your Majesty.

165
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,730
Have you been praying for the peace of his spirit?

166
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,940
No one in the world knows about his death.

167
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,610
So I thought the least I could do was praying for him.

168
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,990
I have no doubt that Royal Scribe Yoon is grateful...

169
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,240
for your prayers.

170
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,370
Is it safe to assume that...

171
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,210
you will continue to help me...

172
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,790
given your presence here today?

173
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,500
Now, the Eight-feet Spirit is...

174
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,840
my grandmother's foe as well.

175
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,760
My grandmother's spirit must be held by the Eight-feet Spirit.

176
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,219
To bring peace to my grandmother's spirit,

177
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,799
I will make sure...

178
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,390
the Eight-feet Spirit leaves this world.

179
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,390
Yes.

180
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,730
Officer Seo informed me that...

181
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,810
you were also in harm's way yesterday.

182
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,940
Yes. I was, Your Majesty.

183
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,450
What?

184
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,070
"Your Majesty?"

185
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,030
Did you just say, "Your Majesty?"

186
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,330
Yes, Your Majesty. That is what I said.

187
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,380
I indeed heard him say so.

188
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,430
You are a deity.

189
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,009
And I am a mere king.

190
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,550
But you are addressing me with honorifics?

191
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,850
You are a mere king indeed.

192
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,270
But you did well by saving Yeo Ri's life.

193
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,639
Seeing how you are a king who treasures his people,

194
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,480
I ought to treat you with the respect you deserve.

195
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,360
- What are you doing? - What?

196
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,780
Forget it.

197
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,320
If that is your attitude, you can just stop.

198
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,620
The decision did not come easily. Fine, suit yourself.

199
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,460
So did you see the faces of the men...

200
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,420
who attacked you?

201
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,460
I did see their faces, but I had never seen them before.

202
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,590
When they were trying to abduct Yeo Ri,

203
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,379
another group of men also took Yoon Gap's mother,

204
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,840
so they could keep me occupied.

205
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,890
It must have been a trick to separate her from me.

206
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,510
So they were conspiring together?

207
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,600
The man who came for me...

208
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,230
definitely told me Premier Kim Bong In had sent for me.

209
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,480
But the premier told me he did not send out anyone.

210
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,490
All he had to do was deny it.

211
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,699
Are you protecting him because he is your grandfather?

212
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,530
I also confirmed that he was in the Palace at that time.

213
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,750
Like your implication, the premier could have done so.

214
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,080
But it could be the contrary. As they know he is loyal to me,

215
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,580
someone could have used his name to cause confusion.

216
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,320
My lord, he has arrived.

217
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,990
Yes, let him in.

218
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,420
I am from Onsu Village of Chungju. My name is Lee Hwa Sung.

219
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,760
You are the premier, second only to the King.

220
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,760
May I ask the purpose of your summons?

221
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,640
Raise your head.

222
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,270
Your great-great grandfather was Prince Hopyung, a younger brother...

223
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,190
of Yeonjong the Great. Was he not?

224
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,560
You are a royal heir.

225
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,900
But why are you dressed so poorly?

226
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,690
A royal heir? I could never be one.

227
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,780
I am no lineal descendant of the royal family.

228
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,830
Your single mother is working as a seamstress to provide for you.

229
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,160
But I am aware that...

230
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,999
you have failed to pass the first state exam...

231
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,710
despite several years of trying.

232
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,460
How do you know that?

233
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,960
If you listen to me and do as I say,

234
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,840
you may be able to avoid being a disgrace to your family.

235
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,550
What do you say?

236
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,050
Will you do as I say?

237
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,229
There is...

238
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,849
no evil spirit in this land?

239
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,939
Yes. My grandmother...

240
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,230
often said so when she was alive.

241
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,990
What do you mean?

242
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,360
The Eight-feet Spirit is an evil spirit.

243
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,990
The evil spirit is to blame for the tragedy of the royal family.

244
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,290
What do you mean there is no evil spirit?

245
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,039
She means that there is no spirit who commits evil deeds...

246
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,330
without just cause.

247
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,040
Spirits only hold grudges...

248
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,590
and to settle the grudges, they commit evil deeds.

249
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,710
So there are only Vengeful Spirits.

250
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,459
Vengeful Spirits?

251
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,010
Then by that logic, if we were to settle...

252
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,930
the Eight-feet Spirit's grudge, will we be able to send him off?

253
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,970
Precisely.

254
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,430
We have utilized several methods to eliminate the Eight-feet Spirit.

255
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,520
But they were all temporary fixes...

256
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,690
because our approach had been wrong.

257
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,020
Our approach?

258
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,900
There is only one approach we can take now.

259
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,990
We must uncover the identity of the Eight-feet Spirit...

260
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,030
and settle the spirit's grudge.

261
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,660
However,

262
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,700
how can we uncover the spirit's identity?

263
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,869
All we know about the Eight-feet Spirit is...

264
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,459
that it is a fire spirit...

265
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,080
of one who burned to death.

266
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
If I may,

267
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,880
could it be possible that the Eight-feet Spirit was...

268
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,800
a military officer?

269
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,880
A military officer?

270
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,970
Why do you think so?

271
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,349
When the Eight-feet Spirit...

272
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,100
possessed your body, it showed impressive techniques...

273
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,140
of martial arts.

274
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,490
A military officer?

275
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,080
Uncovering the identity of the Eight-feet Spirit...

276
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,080
will be the first step in eliminating the Eight-feet Spirit.

277
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,289
I will see if there are...

278
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,379
any other clues to identify the Eight-feet Spirit,

279
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,670
no matter how small the clues may be.

280
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,760
Yes, go ahead.

281
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,840
If there is anything you need, I will gladly support you.

282
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,100
That darn monk told me I had to use up my glowing pearl...

283
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,470
to guide the Eight-feet Spirit out of this world.

284
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,980
Even if we manage to identify the Eight-feet Spirit,

285
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,190
without the glowing pearl, it will be pointless.

286
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,610
All right then. We shall take our leave now.

287
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,000
Hello? You.

288
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,590
My gosh. Why are they holding hands?

289
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,250
- We must go. - Yes.

290
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Right.

291
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,090
Your hands...

292
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,760
Good grief. What a strange sight to behold.

293
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,010
Oh, my.

294
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,120
(Yoon Gap)

295
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,110
My lord, is everything all right with you?

296
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,030
Did he perhaps cross you again?

297
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,170
That scoundrel, Yoon Gap.

298
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,170
What on earth are you plotting?

299
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,880
This is for the departed spirit of the prince

300
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,349
I ask ten wisdom kings to help his spirit

301
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,059
Guide him to paradise

302
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,940
Grant him a joyful life in the world beyond

303
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,989
I ask the great king of the underworld

304
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,399
To guide the departed spirit

305
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,869
I ask the great king of the first gate

306
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,279
To guide the departed spirit

307
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,619
I ask the great king of the punishment

308
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,959
To guide the departed spirit

309
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,289
I ask the great king of the punishment

310
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,540
To guide the departed spirit

311
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,879
I ask the great king of the punishment

312
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,010
To guide the departed spirit

313
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,339
I ask the great king of the punishment

314
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,589
To guide the departed spirit

315
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,679
I ask the great king of the punishment

316
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,680
To guide the departed spirit

317
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,350
Your Highness.

318
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,520
Today marks the end of cheondojae.

319
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,559
Surely, Prince Young In...

320
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,570
peacefully crossed the Samdo Stream.

321
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,450
Thank you for everything.

322
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,330
By the way, who was that young man?

323
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,580
I mean the young man who prayed for my son's spirit wholeheartedly.

324
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,000
I had never seen him before.

325
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,999
His name is Lee Hwa Sung.

326
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,510
He is Prince Hopyung's fifth-generation descendant.

327
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,680
The death of Prince Young In brought him profound grief.

328
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,259
He reached out to me and personally asked...

329
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,010
to be invited to the cheondojae.

330
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,720
- Is that so? - Yes.

331
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,400
He is pure-hearted and righteous.

332
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,769
Prince Young In departed without leaving an heir.

333
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,189
It appears he is the perfect candidate...

334
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,650
to hold ceremonies for the prince.

335
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,990
Have him come to the Palace and read me a book.

336
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,700
I would like a proper chance to get to know him personally.

337
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,960
Yes, I will do as you command.

338
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,720
Myeongdu reflects spirits.

339
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Yeo Ri used this myeongdu...

340
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,730
to nullify the power of the talisman.

341
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,620
What are you doing here?

342
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,040
Nothing.

343
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,320
For unknown reasons, Yoon Gap has remained silent...

344
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,780
about the incident that occurred yesterday.

345
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,070
Things seem oddly quiet.

346
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,080
It seemed he had not reported me to the King either.

347
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,000
If he did,

348
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,539
the King would not have remained this quiet.

349
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,210
I strengthened the security just in case.

350
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,840
Well done.

351
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,960
Continue to keep an eye on him.

352
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,510
If you see any suspicious movement,

353
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,180
report to me immediately.

354
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,430
Yes, my lord.

355
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,730
Is anyone out there?

356
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,410
Who are you?

357
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,760
How dare you come here?

358
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,370
You little rat! Die!

359
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,010
Spare my life.

360
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,100
I will do all you ask.

361
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,810
Please...

362
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
There is only one thing I want of you.

363
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,110
What is that?

364
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,240
Your life.

365
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,660
- What? - Oh, there is one more thing.

366
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,240
Should you not apologize to Yoon Gap...

367
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,330
who died by your sword in an instant?

368
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,500
You were not...

369
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,170
Yoon Gap.

370
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,050
That is why you...

371
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,940
What?

372
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:48,940
The Minister of War suddenly died last night?

373
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,860
- Yes. - That is impossible.

374
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,569
How did a healthy man...

375
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,660
die so abruptly?

376
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,620
It seems he died in his sleep.

377
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,249
- My lord. - A servant went to him...

378
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,750
- My lord. - and found he had already passed.

379
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,460
The Minister of War...

380
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,630
lost his life just like that?

381
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,090
Similar things have been happening recently.

382
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,590
Old officials...

383
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,310
have been dying abruptly overnight.

384
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,430
Well...

385
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,690
Oh, Your Majesty, actually...

386
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,020
Speak up, Head Eunuch.

387
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,110
According to a rumour I heard,

388
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,909
people say a serpent or other eats old nobles...

389
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,950
to claim their souls.

390
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,990
Was it...

391
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,080
Kang Chul's doing?

392
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,710
Yoon Gap.

393
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,540
Did he kill the Minister of War?

394
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,759
What kind of nonsense is that?

395
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,930
Who would believe such a story?

396
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,300
I am not saying I believe it.

397
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,389
But many nobles within the capital...

398
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,890
have been visiting...

399
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,060
the Master of the Bureau of the Blind to ward off evil.

400
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,019
They do so because they believe...

401
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,569
wearing a talisman he made keeps them safe.

402
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,990
It is him again.

403
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,650
The Master of the Bureau of the Blind.

404
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,540
I feel so very strange.

405
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,000
I thought of the revolt he started 13 years ago,

406
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,170
and swore to myself that one day I would...

407
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,260
hold him accountable myself.

408
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,720
But to think he died so suddenly.

409
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,470
Your Majesty.

410
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,060
Provide what is necessary for a funeral...

411
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,640
and handle it appropriately.

412
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

413
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,690
I will follow your command.

414
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,250
Who on earth are you that you left the Dowager Queen's chambers?

415
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,630
Your Majesty. I am...

416
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,920
Prince Hopyung's fifth-generation descendant Lee Hwa Sung.

417
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,260
Prince Hopyung?

418
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,219
The younger brother of Yeonjong the Great?

419
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,300
Yes.

420
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,310
I entered the Palace at the Dowager Queen's invitation.

421
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,230
I see. You may leave.

422
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,739
That fool of a man must be the Dowager Queen's pick...

423
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,080
to replace Prince Young In.

424
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,670
What is it, Your Majesty?

425
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,450
Did I leave this like this?

426
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,380
Oh, dear. Silly old me.

427
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,130
We are out of rice. Goodness me.

428
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,469
I will go and buy some polished barley.

429
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,089
Leave it, Yeo Ri.

430
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,350
You must save the money you earn by making glasses.

431
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,139
Today is the day Gap gets paid...

432
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,099
for the first time in three months.

433
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,349
He does not make much, but it will support us three.

434
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,390
Do not worry.

435
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,900
Okay.

436
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,150
Why is this fool not back yet?

437
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,989
I have no idea.

438
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,820
He told me to go ahead because he had to go somewhere.

439
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Did he?

440
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,080
I shall make porridge for dinner.

441
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,620
Thank you.

442
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,800
Come on over. I will give you a good deal.

443
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,549
- Hello. - Give me one more.

444
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,010
Oh, sure thing.

445
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,310
How much is a piece of pumpkin taffy?

446
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,809
Hello, sir. One poon per piece.

447
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,190
- One poon? A penny? - Yes.

448
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,690
I thought the pay was tiny,

449
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,610
but 15 nyang is 1,500 poon.

450
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,240
I can afford 1,500 pieces of pumpkin taffy?

451
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,580
I had to beg and plead...

452
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,660
to get a small chunk of it.

453
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,170
Now I can eat ten big pieces a day.

454
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,420
This is why humans are crazy about money.

455
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,840
How many do you want?

456
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,430
I will come back soon. Wait here.

457
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,260
- Do not sell everything. - Okay.

458
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,520
Welcome.

459
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,190
Take a look.

460
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,690
Let me see that pair.

461
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,779
Do you mean this pair?

462
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,780
No.

463
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,489
The pair with embroidered symbols of longevity.

464
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,199
(Shoes made with embroidered silk)

465
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,370
Okay...

466
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,330
This pair is quite expensive.

467
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,539
I got paid today.

468
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,379
How much could a pair of shoes cost?

469
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,050
Yes, of course. You must buy what you want.

470
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,030
This is nicely made.

471
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
Give me this too.

472
00:35:08,401 --> 00:35:10,950
Are you sure about that?

473
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,580
Come on. I said I got paid today.

474
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,330
I can afford to buy 1,500 pieces of taffy.

475
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,370
Okay?

476
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,210
Very well.

477
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,040
That was daylight robbery.

478
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,800
How come I am left...

479
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,460
with enough to buy just five pieces of taffy?

480
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,590
Why are a woman's shoes and binyeo this expensive?

481
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,969
No, Master.

482
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,479
- We must go that way. - No.

483
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,979
- We came from there. - Who is that?

484
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,310
That is Gaseop.

485
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,650
- Why is he here? - Please.

486
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,230
We must...

487
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,660
- Master! - Darn it.

488
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,740
Hey, you... You...

489
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,290
Oh, darn it.

490
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,840
When did that monk get here?

491
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,420
Oh, my gosh.

492
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,210
Why are you alone?

493
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,090
Where is the big guy?

494
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,010
Give me some of that.

495
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,760
No way.

496
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,220
How did you know I had this?

497
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,020
Keep quiet.

498
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,950
- I got you! - Gosh!

499
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,410
Where did you fly in from?

500
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,700
Put me down, you crazy quack.

501
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,170
I am pleased to see you.

502
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,049
I circled the capital so many times looking for your house.

503
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:55,470
Master. It looks like we can sleep under a roof tonight.

504
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,760
What?

505
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,220
It is so good to see you.

506
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,230
Do not laugh! Darn you!

507
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,820
We are here at last.

508
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,109
- Monk Gaseop. - Hello.

509
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,399
What brings you here?

510
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,989
When did you reach the capital?

511
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,450
I came to give you something.

512
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,159
You have no idea how rough the past few days was...

513
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,619
because we could not find this house.

514
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,329
I see. Come inside.

515
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,629
Oh, my goodness. Who is this? Monk Gaseop.

516
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,840
I hope you have been well.

517
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,969
Seeing familiar faces makes it feel like a holiday.

518
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,139
We must intrude upon your hospitality.

519
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,719
Do not say that.

520
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,599
My son Gap got paid today,

521
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
so we can treat you to a feast.

522
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,349
Master. Let us get you inside.

523
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,600
- Come with me. - Go on.

524
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,070
So...

525
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,650
you spent your salary...

526
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,370
from the past three months to buy these?

527
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,410
Because...

528
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,249
yours is an eyesore.

529
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,420
How dare you say that?

530
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,000
Why you...

531
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,419
There are things you should not say!

532
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,840
How dare you?

533
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,049
You will be the death of me!

534
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,890
Ma'am. Calm down.

535
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,139
Master.

536
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,769
I think we visited on the wrong day.

537
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,479
Yes. Calm down.

538
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,559
Do not dare touch me.

539
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,059
"Calm down?"

540
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,560
Why can I not touch you?

541
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,270
Oh, my gosh!

542
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,570
Oh, dear. Goodness.

543
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,779
What is it? What is wrong?

544
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,659
Oh, right.

545
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,370
I came all the way here to give you this.

546
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,670
Silly me forgot all about it.

547
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,839
- Here. - That is...

548
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,920
A warding stone.

549
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,880
That is my warding stone.

550
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,850
No!

551
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,269
I lost it.

552
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,850
How do you have it?

553
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,310
Well, you see...

554
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,360
Come along.

555
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,070
- Stop! - Okay.

556
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Master?

557
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,330
What monk craves meat?

558
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,750
Master. We must go.

559
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,799
- Take it. - What?

560
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,299
This one burst and is not good to sell.

561
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,339
Goodness, no.

562
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,970
We do not eat fish.

563
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,050
Master. Let us...

564
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,670
Your grandmother Neop Deok...

565
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,499
found a couple of warding stones,

566
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,170
a male and a female, under a rock by the sea.

567
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,380
As she told that story, she said to me...

568
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,759
that the warding stones...

569
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,930
had a mysterious power and would find its owner.

570
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,649
All that happened was this stone's efforts...

571
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,440
to find its way back to you.

572
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,610
Goodness. That piece of stone is that special?

573
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,240
What is it?

574
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,910
It is called a warding stone.

575
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,700
It wards off spirit.

576
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,660
It keeps spirits away?

577
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,419
What a fantastic object it is.

578
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,249
Hey, this chases away spirits.

579
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,550
Darn you. Keep that away from me.

580
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,800
- Handle it with care. - With care.

581
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,220
Goodness.

582
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,510
- Is it not... - Keep it away from me.

583
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,520
Monk Gaseop.

584
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,900
You knew all along that my grandmother...

585
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,980
was killed by the Eight-feet Spirit?

586
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,700
The thing is, Yeo Ri...

587
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,200
Now that I look back, nothing made sense.

588
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,120
I went to you to ask you to rid me of Kang Chul,

589
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,080
but you taught me a chant to ward off evil spirits.

590
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,670
And you made me learn and memorize...

591
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,670
the spells my grandmother used...

592
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,800
to chase spirits away.

593
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,840
I could have understood if I had thought about it.

594
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,810
I was so stupid.

595
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,930
Thirteen years ago,

596
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,439
the Queen Mother...

597
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,820
summoned me to chase away the Eight-feet Spirit.

598
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:05,820
But I was not powerful enough.

599
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,450
So I went to Neop Deok and asked her...

600
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,540
to come to the capital with me.

601
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,250
I am greatly responsible...

602
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,500
for what happened to her.

603
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,209
I was unable to tell you sooner...

604
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,670
Because you were afraid I would be brazen enough...

605
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,630
to challenge the Eight-feet Spirit.

606
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,470
- Yeo Ri. - Monk Gaseop.

607
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,720
I am not that little girl anymore.

608
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,310
The Eight-feet Spirit has Grandma's soul.

609
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,020
I will take down...

610
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,940
the Eight-feet Spirit.

611
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
"Bureau of the Blind?"

612
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,530
The pig spell talisman.

613
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,989
The master of that bureau...

614
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,369
called Pung San made the talisman for the nobles.

615
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:57,829
A blind shaman...

616
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,330
made a talisman that powerful?

617
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,789
Did you see that man?

618
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,090
I tried to get as close as I could,

619
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,260
but the strong fires kept me away.

620
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,380
Fires?

621
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,430
That myeongdu.

622
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,559
It was quite useful.

623
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,220
I would have no problem setting a feast if I had that.

624
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,850
I will be greatly pleased the day you ascend.

625
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,690
Your ascension will give me hope.

626
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,780
I will continue to assist you.

627
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,570
Kang Chul.

628
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,490
However,

629
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,780
do not tell Yeo Ri.

630
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,410
Why?

631
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,700
She will not understand.

632
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,460
She is human.

633
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,040
Darn it.

634
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,680
Seriously...

635
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,940
Why did you come out? You should sleep.

636
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,990
I wish to sleep but cannot.

637
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,530
Because of that loud snoring.

638
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,870
They must be tired.

639
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,289
It must have been an exhausting journey coming all the way here.

640
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:00,330
And what about you?

641
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,450
Why are you not in bed?

642
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,120
Me? Just because...

643
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,840
Yoon Gap's mother grinds her teeth in her sleep, does she not?

644
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,220
And once every two hours, she puts her legs on you.

645
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,470
Hey, she will hear you.

646
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,429
I got you these so you could wear them.

647
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,140
Why are you holding them like some precious jewels?

648
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,270
I was just looking at them because they are so pretty.

649
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,110
How could someone like me wear such expensive shoes?

650
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,570
I should return these and get a refund.

651
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,700
You will return my gift and ask for a refund?

652
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,990
What am I supposed to do?

653
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,580
We have mouths to feed.

654
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,159
I saw you admire those shoes...

655
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,580
embroidered with the ten symbols of longevity,

656
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,210
so I got you those.

657
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,170
What do you mean?

658
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,920
When did you see me admire shoes like these?

659
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,210
Last summer,

660
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,880
when you visited Lord Park in that village to sell eyeglasses.

661
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:57,929
You admired the ten symbols of longevity...

662
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,600
embroidered on his daughter's shoes in complete awe.

663
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,510
You thought I did not notice it?

664
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,180
That was just...

665
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,059
I was simply admiring the beauty and the harmony between...

666
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,690
the sun, the moon, the mountains, and the trees on those tiny shoes.

667
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,530
You truly were...

668
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,990
with me all along.

669
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,330
For so many years, I thought I was completely alone.

670
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,250
What a fool I was.

671
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,880
Yes, you were a fool.

672
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,049
I wish to find out the true identity of the Eight-feet Spirit...

673
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,930
and help it ascend as soon as possible.

674
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,060
Only then can I save...

675
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,060
my grandma's soul...

676
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,650
and Royal Scribe Yoon's soul as well.

677
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,610
Once Yoon Gap...

678
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,860
is saved...

679
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,740
Then you might have to...

680
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,280
leave the body.

681
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,250
However,

682
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,580
you will always be Kang Chul even without a body,

683
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,630
and I will continue to serve you faithfully as my guardian spirit.

684
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,670
That is how I can repay you...

685
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,300
for protecting me for so many years.

686
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,390
And it is how I can show you...

687
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,560
my affection for you.

688
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,130
- It is hot! - What is wrong?

689
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,380
Could it be the warding stone?

690
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,050
Oh, right. This stone can hurt you too.

691
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,930
Should I keep it away for a moment?

692
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,770
Keep it away? To do what?

693
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:13,770
Well, I am not going to do anything. You were going to do something...

694
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,070
Why, you...

695
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,230
Goodness!

696
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,360
Oh, no! The warding stone!

697
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,830
That man is the blind shaman I saw the other day.

698
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,840
If you go this way, you would reach the Dowager Queen's chambers.

699
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:41,130
Then could he be the master of the Bureau of the Blind?

700
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,050
We meet again.

701
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,220
Oh, who might you be?

702
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,430
We met the other day. I am the glasses-maker from Sanguiwon.

703
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,720
I see!

704
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,650
You are that young lady. I recognize your great energy.

705
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,280
He seems like an ordinary blind shaman.

706
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,240
I will be going, then.

707
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,910
So, you make eyeglasses that help people see better.

708
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,290
Can you not make something to help the blind like me see again?

709
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,460
My apologies. I do not have such skills yet.

710
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,629
I do not know his name.

711
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,890
It was a eunuch with scary-looking eyes.

712
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,060
His fingertips were black.

713
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:34,770
It is this man.

714
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,770
He is Aguji.

715
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,060
I must let His Majesty know now.

716
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,570
Please excuse me. I must go.

717
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:46,570
Se Won.

718
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,620
Do you see anyone around?

719
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:52,950
No, not a single soul.

720
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,250
Great.

721
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,250
Your Majesty!

722
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,380
You were right!

723
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,050
You were right, Your Majesty.

724
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:10,549
As you ordered, I compiled a list of the royal relatives...

725
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,810
who passed away in the past 13 years,

726
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,519
including the distant royal relatives.

727
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,650
Here, you must see this.

728
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,530
Did you call me here at this early hour...

729
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:33,579
to see a mere piece of paper?

730
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,290
Goodness. Such insolence.

731
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,920
A mere piece of paper? No.

732
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,920
It is the royal family tree.

733
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:42,960
The royal family tree?

734
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,629
Many royal relatives died unexpectedly...

735
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,670
in the past decade or so.

736
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,509
Only after I came to believe that the Eight-feet Spirit truly existed,

737
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,180
thanks to you and Yeo Ri,

738
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:55,520
I became convinced that it was behind those deaths too.

739
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,020
- And? - Yesterday, I saw...

740
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,020
a man named Lee Hwa Sung, a distant royal relative.

741
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,320
It means the Eight-feet Spirit...

742
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:09,490
did not kill off anyone and everyone with the royal blood.

743
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,910
- Correct. - Then,

744
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:13,159
going through the list of those...

745
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,910
killed by the Eight-feet Spirit in the past 13 years...

746
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,159
will help us determine who instilled such an extreme grudge...

747
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,960
in that spirit.

748
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,130
Your Majesty.

749
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,880
It is I, Sang Deuk.

750
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,050
Yes, you may enter.

751
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,600
Why did you come back alone?

752
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,560
I told you to go and fetch Yeo Ri.

753
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:42,060
Yeo Ri, the glasses-maker, was not at Sanguiwon.

754
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,190
They said she had just left Sanguiwon.

755
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,070
I searched for her near Sanguiwon but could not find her.

756
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:50,150
- What? - Did you not see anyone suspicious?

757
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,070
- No, Your Majesty. - Nothing suspicious was seen...

758
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,330
around the Dowager Queen's chambers?

759
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:58,119
A shaman from the Bureau of the Blind...

760
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,000
is chanting some scriptures at the Dowager Queen's Palace now.

761
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,810
What are you doing?

762
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,840
I tried to get as close as I could,

763
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,010
but the strong fires kept me away.

764
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,180
Yeo Ri.

765
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,639
I summon the pure spirit within me

766
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,809
To govern the three souls and seven spirits

767
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:03,729
And to purify my body and mind

768
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,809
So that I can help shift your energy

769
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,689
And strengthen you through and through

770
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:08,860
- To have your wishes - Your Highness.

771
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,440
His Majesty wishes to see you.

772
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,820
What?

773
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:25,170
Welcome, Your Majesty.

774
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,380
You are dismissed.

775
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,460
Yes, Your Highness.

776
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,470
No, you may sit down too.

777
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,840
Pardon me?

778
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,719
I heard you conducted...

779
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,560
Prince Young In's cheondojae yourself.

780
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,270
I am deeply grateful.

781
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,270
Thanks to you, we were able to relieve Prince Young In's sorrow,

782
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,400
and the Dowager Queen can now stop crying too.

783
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,200
Your Majesty, I am much obliged.

784
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,280
Dowager Queen.

785
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,530
I wish to bestow a big reward upon this man.

786
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,540
What do you think?

787
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,120
He is a lowborn man.

788
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,670
His talents are quite useful,

789
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,710
but he is not worthy of Your Majesty's attention.

790
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,210
That is not true.

791
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:16,050
I feel terrible that I misunderstood his intentions in the past.

792
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,640
And seeing how he has been comforting you,

793
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,890
I am deeply grateful to him.

794
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,310
Your Majesty.

795
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,730
Why are you doing this?

796
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,600
Yes, I have an idea.

797
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:30,770
Very soon, I shall visit the Bureau of the Blind myself...

798
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:35,110
to formally commend you and your contributions in front of everyone.

799
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:38,319
The Bureau of the Blind is too shabby a place...

800
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,030
to be graced with Your Majesty's presence.

801
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:42,530
No.

802
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,540
The Bureau of the Blind...

803
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,040
does such an important work of taking care of the blind.

804
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,330
By the way,

805
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,340
if you cannot see,

806
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,550
how did you come all this way alone?

807
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,720
Did your servant not come with you?

808
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,970
Is this about that girl? Has he caught on?

809
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,060
Pung San is no ordinary blind man.

810
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,730
Walking here on his own is a piece of cake for him.

811
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,400
That is why I so highly value his talents.

812
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:18,110
I see.

813
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:55,820
What is that?

814
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,530
Fine sand.

815
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,280
It is used to polish crystals.

816
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,860
This is Yeo Ri's.

817
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,330
The Sugumun Gate is this way.

818
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:12,580
The Bureau of the Blind is right outside the Sugumun Gate.

819
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,710
Someone...

820
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,260
dragged Yeo Ri out of the Palace.

821
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,340
Yeo Ri!

822
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,180
Yeo Ri.

823
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,220
My goodness. You cannot come in here.

824
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,140
Master Pung San is not here at the moment.

825
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,770
Where is she? What did you do to her?

826
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,310
Why are you doing this?

827
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,520
Goodness.

828
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,610
I have no idea what you are talking about.

829
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,860
What is happening here?

830
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,700
You!

831
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,320
What is the matter?

832
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:51,160
We are blind, but that does not mean you can do this to us!

833
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,870
- Goodness. - Where is Yeo Ri?

834
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,750
Who is Yeo Ri?

835
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,420
There is no one else here other than us and that lowly fool.

836
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,460
That is enough.

837
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,550
The Dowager Queen has his back.

838
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,520
We thoroughly searched this place last time.

839
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:14,810
There was not a spot where you could hide someone.

840
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,400
So, that is enough.

841
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,560
Why...

842
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,920
- Yeo Ri! - Oh, no.

843
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:29,180
Yeo Ri. Where are you?

844
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,100
- My goodness. - What did you do to her?

845
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:36,939
- What did you do to that girl? - Please spare me.

846
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,059
I am a blind man who knows nothing.

847
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,230
Please spare me.

848
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,900
Oh, gosh.

849
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,859
A blind man who knows nothing?

850
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:45,860
Yes.

851
00:58:45,861 --> 00:58:48,910
Then what is this shrine filled with such malicious fire energy?

852
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,370
You must be Aguji.

853
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,450
The Eight-feet Spirit is behind you. Am I wrong?

854
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,630
You.

855
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,070
Go and tell the king.

856
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,830
Now!

857
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:39,660
You.

858
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,920
Why are you attacking me?

859
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,300
I saw you.

860
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,880
A hundred years ago, the day I was born.

861
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,050
I saw you fall to the ground.

862
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:56,600
So, how come you are attacking me and not them?

863
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,060
What is this nonsense you are spewing?

864
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,980
I am not your enemy.

865
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,360
The royal family is your enemy.

866
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,860
So, why would you...

867
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:10,820
attack me?

868
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:06,129
(The Haunted Palace)

869
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,959
It is odd that the Eight-feet Spirit disappeared like that.

870
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,549
Where is Pung San's shrine?

871
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:13,300
Show yourself at once!

872
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:15,469
Is it true that he was born...

873
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:16,760
the day you fell to the ground?

874
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,350
This man must be the Eight-feet Spirit's nemesis.

875
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:21,429
I will visit Yongdam Village in ten days.

876
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:24,140
I will be sure to reveal who the Eight-feet Spirit truly is.

877
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,479
I no longer need the warding stone.

878
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,569
You are my warding stone who protects me.

879
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:30,979
Kang Chul the Serpent has gone too far.

880
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,360
Because of that girl, Yeo Ri.

881
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,739
Just hand over that wench named Yeo Ri.

882
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,530
I am sorry, but I need you to die.
