1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,421
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,270
<i>Originally, Gangcheori was a dragon</i>

4
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,355
<i>on his way to ascend</i>

5
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>after 1,000 years of ascetic practice</i>
<i>deep under the pond.</i>

6
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,535
<i>However,</i>

7
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,997
<i>he was blighted by relentless misfortune.</i>

8
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,761
<i>When an ascending dragon is jinxed</i>

9
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,971
<i>after being spotted by human eyes,</i>

10
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,225
<i>he is bound to become</i>
<i>a mere Imugi once more.</i>

11
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,437
<i>The mighty divine will of the heavens</i>
<i>showed no mercy.</i>

12
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,988
<i>The 1,000 years</i>
<i>of its ascetic practice was undone</i>

13
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,907
<i>and he fell to the ground</i>

14
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,410
<i>after a cruel kismet led</i>
<i>a child to spot him.</i>

15
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,251
<i>That is why</i>

16
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,753
<i>Gangcheori fervently detests</i>

17
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,923
<i>the human race.</i>

18
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,191
They say where Gangcheori passes through

19
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:16,070
becomes barren early spring even if it is
the season of harvest for a reason.

20
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,700
Gangcheori is truly
a terrible malevolent deity.

21
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,161
He just had terrible luck.

22
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,038
Why torture innocent people?

23
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,707
When I become a great shaman,

24
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,792
I will be sure to teach him a lesson

25
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,086
and make sure he never
sets foot in our village.

26
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,254
Shush.

27
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,715
You will do no such thing.

28
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,426
That is not how you deal with him.

29
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,638
If you ever cross paths with him,

30
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,308
you must run away and never look back.

31
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,811
Gangcheori is known to target
shamans of great character

32
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,231
and pure spirit like yourself.

33
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,025
Thus, you must run.

34
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,486
Promise me you will.

35
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,696
Go on.

36
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,815
13 YEARS LATER

37
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,531
Get away…

38
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,116
Get away from me!

39
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,286
- You cannot, Your Highness.
- Your Highness, please stop.

40
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,127
My goodness…

41
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:15,148
Are you actually suggesting that I summon
a shaman to the palace to perform a ritual

42
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,525
to drive away evil spirits?

43
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,485
Please forgive my impertinence,

44
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,571
but this is a matter
of Your Majesty's noble duty.

45
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,157
The royal physician is doing his best.

46
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,160
They are secretly
and tirelessly working to find a cure.

47
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,620
Even the top physician in the nation

48
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,497
failed to find a remedy after months.

49
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,582
That only leaves

50
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,335
an affliction caused by spirits.

51
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,008
Spirits are nothing more
than the ebb and flow of yin and yang!

52
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,092
Your Majesty!

53
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,813
What are you staring at?

54
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,274
Something up there?

55
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,235
I do not see anything.
What is the matter with you?

56
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,238
His Excellency is waiting. Follow me.

57
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,129
Can you read this character?

58
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,423
It is too blurry for me to make out.

59
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,610
Please see if you can see better
with that eyeglass.

60
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,992
Goodness, that is "<i>hwan</i>,"
the character for luminous.

61
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,745
I can see it. I can see it quite clearly.

62
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,581
Let me see here…

63
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,043
I have been desperate to read this,

64
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,839
but I have been saving it,
due to my blurry vision.

65
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,966
But now…

66
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,096
I will be able to read it by myself.

67
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:14,225
This girl is renowned in this area
for her spectacles.

68
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,730
I have tried every pair of glasses
known to be decent,

69
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,442
but they pale in comparison to this.

70
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,404
Exquisite clarity has been restored
in my once blurry life.

71
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,490
You have quite a talent.

72
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,587
By chance, is there a child in this family

73
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,256
who is sick?

74
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,552
My poor child.

75
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,471
Just hang in there.

76
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,640
Do you see something?

77
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,810
Is there a way to cure Her Lady?

78
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,145
What are you talking about?

79
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,397
A cure for In-seon?

80
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,523
Your Excellency,

81
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,193
this child is a descendant of Neop-deok.

82
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,987
Neop-deok? Who is that?

83
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,282
You know, she was the shaman who healed

84
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,826
the late great mistress of the house.

85
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,913
Then, are you a shaman as well?

86
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,832
I am not a practitioner
of the spiritual arts.

87
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,917
I just detected

88
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,962
the scent of a herbal tonic brewing
in the household.

89
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,101
Secretly deliver this to Lord Song,
the Gyeonggi governor.

90
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,062
Also, visit Lord Choi Won-u

91
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,272
and persuade him to join our cause.

92
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,484
All of this must be kept

93
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,278
a secret from the world.

94
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,489
Yes, Your Majesty.

95
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,700
I am merely visiting
my hometown to take care

96
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,203
of my grandparents' graves.

97
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,043
<i>It may be weak,</i>

98
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,379
<i>but that is undeniably a vengeful ghost.</i>

99
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,757
<i>It must be responsible</i>
<i>for the mysterious illness</i>

100
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,342
<i>plaguing the young lady of this house.</i>

101
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,637
My dear child. No…

102
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,390
My goodness! In-seon!

103
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,142
No, this cannot be.

104
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:05,354
<i>The poor young lady</i>
<i>will inevitably end up losing her life.</i>

105
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,023
My poor child…

106
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,983
<i>It is ancestral karma.</i>

107
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,116
<i>If people knew that the consequences</i>

108
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,702
<i>of the choices they make in life</i>
<i>did not end with their deaths</i>

109
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:24,707
<i>but that their children would</i>
<i>inherit the vicious cycle of retribution,</i>

110
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,169
<i>would the world look a little different?</i>

111
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,380
What are we going to do?
Now, Her Lady is even coughing up blood!

112
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,007
Where is the physician?

113
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,016
Give me

114
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,184
water.

115
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,019
Water?

116
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,067
Just hang in there. I will be right back.

117
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,045
Step back from her at once.

118
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,214
I refuse.

119
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,383
Her father did this to my legs

120
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,843
and even took my life.

121
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,054
At the very least, she shall accompany me

122
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,473
to the afterlife!

123
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,286
You even gladly eat that coarse millet.

124
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,832
You are a pauper ghost indeed.

125
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,924
Who are you?

126
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,008
I pity you.

127
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,177
Spirit,

128
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,014
you have my condolences
and my deep sympathy.

129
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,522
You are not even a shaman.
How dare you pity me!

130
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,149
Do you not understand?

131
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,569
I am not looking to save
this esteemed daughter of a nobleman

132
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,863
who grew up wrapped in silk.

133
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,407
It is you

134
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,075
who I wish to save.

135
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,494
What?

136
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,163
Accumulate more bad karma,

137
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,582
and you will irrevocably turn
into an evil spirit.

138
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,460
An evil deed will latch on like a leech
and torment you,

139
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,920
pushing you to commit another.

140
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,424
Furthermore, you will be unable
to cross over to the afterlife

141
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,843
and be forced to wander
the nine heavens forever.

142
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,345
Is that

143
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,347
what you truly desire?

144
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,099
Is it?

145
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,565
It is not too late.

146
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,277
I shall help you.

147
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,072
Let me.

148
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,450
Do not lie to me.

149
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,496
You have even forsaken your shaman fate.
How could a wench like you help me?

150
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,248
<i>He possessed her in an instant.</i>

151
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,501
<i>How did this weak lesser spirit</i>
<i>manage that so quickly?</i>

152
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,794
<i>It cannot be…</i>

153
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,295
I shall kill this wench

154
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,923
and make my way to hell with her!

155
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,310
Stop right there!

156
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,600
What is that?

157
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,061
What could that be to cause such…

158
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,516
Get away from me! Go!

159
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,103
It must burn.

160
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,105
Come out of that body at once.

161
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,523
Do not anger me further.

162
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,024
Come out now!

163
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,135
What is going on here?

164
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,387
My heart goes out to you.

165
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,556
Would you like my help?

166
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,103
Just say the word.

167
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,647
I would be happy to help.

168
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,904
Yes.

169
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,656
Just say the word.

170
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,744
Go on. Say it.

171
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,668
Get lost.

172
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,435
So close…

173
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,373
Why is my stomach so upset today?

174
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,209
How strange…

175
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,964
What happened here?

176
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,091
My goodness. Wait.

177
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,678
Who is this lady?

178
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,848
Excuse me.

179
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,269
My goodness.

180
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,771
It's no other than Lady Choi In-seon.

181
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,150
My lady, please wake up.

182
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,404
And why are you dressed like so? My lady!

183
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,406
My lady!

184
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,784
Are you all right?

185
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,371
What are you talking about?

186
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,583
She can barely walk by herself.

187
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,792
Where could she have gone?

188
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,377
Do not just stand there.

189
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,505
Dispatch the men
to search the vicinity. Now!

190
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,673
Yes, my lord.

191
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,309
My lady…

192
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,313
Your Excellency.

193
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,025
- In-seon!
- My lady!

194
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,114
What happened?

195
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,118
Why are you bringing back my In-seon?

196
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,079
His Lord helped me.

197
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,082
You helped my daughter?

198
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,918
It was not I.

199
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,419
The one who saved her…

200
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:20,177
I just escorted her back here
after I discovered her unconscious.

201
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,221
Yeo-ri.

202
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,764
Yeo-ri…

203
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,391
Is your neck all right?

204
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,395
It must hurt a lot.

205
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:35,025
A vengeful ghost can pack quite a punch.

206
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,111
Do you want me to take a look?

207
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,698
Though I usually abhor humans,

208
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,535
I would gladly make an exception for you.

209
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,758
But, you really are something else.

210
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:04,096
With just a peach tree switch
and no other proper weapon,

211
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,682
you took care
of that vengeful ghost with ease.

212
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,684
Of course, I was right.

213
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,185
I am never wrong.

214
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,855
Simply remarkable spiritual essence
and commendable character…

215
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,649
Just say the word.

216
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,318
I will become your patron deity
to make you a great shaman,

217
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,238
one capable of performing
state shamanic rites.

218
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,368
Scared?

219
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,912
I guess you know enough
to fear the Ghostbane Stone.

220
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,373
Your tone is beyond insolent.
How dare you--

221
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,500
Cut the act already.

222
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,877
I know you empowered
that one-legged ghost.

223
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,672
Do you think I do not know
you were deviously planning

224
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:42,426
to use him to steal the Ghostbane Stone
and possess my body?

225
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,439
If you know that so well,

226
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,525
then just let me do it already.

227
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,864
They say ten years are enough
for rivers and mountains to change.

228
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,118
It has already been 13 years, Yeo-ri.

229
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:14,416
I was close to coaxing
that one-legged Ghost.

230
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,252
After all his years
of wandering the nine heavens,

231
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,755
I could have eased his festering sorrow.

232
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,715
But you ruined it.

233
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,842
That is why I hate you.

234
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,511
You are shameless and disgraceful.

235
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,848
You have not the slightest regard
for the heavens, earth, and mankind.

236
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,267
The despicable malevolent deity,

237
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,227
Gangcheori.

238
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,444
<i>I first met Gangcheori</i>

239
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,613
<i>when I was 13 years old.</i>

240
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,885
Halt!

241
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,807
My goodness.

242
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,481
Yeo-ri.

243
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,442
Grandma.

244
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,652
What is wrong?

245
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,695
A black Imugi…

246
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,783
keeps following me around.

247
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,786
A black Imugi?

248
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,508
Gangcheori!

249
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,969
Gangcheori?

250
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,971
Did you hear that? Gangcheori is here!

251
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,640
Gangcheori, the malevolent deity
is chasing after Yeo-ri!

252
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,643
My goodness. Our village will be in ruins.

253
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,353
Oh no!

254
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,108
<i>A jinx that originates from mankind</i>

255
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,319
<i>must be cleansed through</i>
<i>a human with great spiritual energy.</i>

256
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:11,324
<i>There is a legend that states if someone</i>
<i>pure and of great character like you</i>

257
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,744
<i>accepts the Imugi as your patron deity</i>

258
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,872
and offers a devout prayer to the heavens,

259
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,459
the Imugi will be able to become
a dragon once more and ascend.

260
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,299
This is a Ghostbane Stone.

261
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,092
It is the stone of the Dragon King.

262
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:33,430
Consider it an extension of yourself
and keep it with you at all times.

263
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,056
The Ghostbane Stone

264
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,893
wards off spirits.

265
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,229
It will not only keep Gangcheori at bay,

266
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,523
but most wandering spirits as well.

267
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,861
That stone will keep you safe.

268
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,656
<i>Cleanse the soul</i>

269
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,243
<i>And purify the spirit</i>

270
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,331
<i>Stand on top of the untouchable caste</i>

271
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,709
<i>And raise the Dragon King</i>

272
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:12,010
<i>Watch over the prince with favor</i>

273
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,222
<i>Our hope grows with every word</i>

274
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,306
Grandma.

275
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,028
Grandma!

276
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,501
Grandma!

277
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,019
<i>After that incident,</i>

278
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,729
<i>they called me an</i> indari.

279
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,523
"Indari,"

280
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,900
<i>as in "a bridge of human corpses."</i>

281
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:14,155
<i>It is how the deities punished</i>
<i>the shamans who refused them.</i>

282
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,950
No! Stop!

283
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,118
Stop it!

284
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,661
Move!

285
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,329
This is all because of you!

286
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:26,209
You brought Gangcheori to our village,
and it is now plagued by misfortune.

287
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,586
That is why Neop-deok ended up like this.

288
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,797
No.

289
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,757
No. No, it isn't!

290
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,762
<i>That is how Gangcheori</i>
<i>managed to take away my grandmother,</i>

291
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,639
<i>the only family I had left.</i>

292
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,021
Now, do you understand?

293
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,774
No human can win against a deity.

294
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,446
How nice it would have been
if you had listened to me sooner.

295
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,741
You should toss
that wretched Ghostbane Stone.

296
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,118
And take my hand, instead.

297
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,691
Why you little…

298
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,535
How dare you.

299
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,788
I…

300
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,375
am merely a helpless mortal.

301
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:54,047
However, I will never serve
a terrible malevolent deity like you.

302
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,175
Even if I collapse and become dust…

303
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,388
it will never happen.

304
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,976
This is how I get revenge on you.

305
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,574
<i>Grandma.</i>

306
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,787
<i>Are you resting in such a nice place</i>

307
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,874
<i>that you do not even once</i>
<i>visit your own granddaughter?</i>

308
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,382
How could you…

309
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,512
never come see me?

310
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,192
Your Grace, you cannot.

311
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,528
Queen. Move aside.

312
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,612
Your Grace.

313
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:03,074
It has already been over three months
since I have seen my grandson.

314
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,410
Palace etiquette remains strict.

315
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:09,831
Just imagine how heavy his heart must be,
unable to carry out his duties.

316
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,210
Hence, I, his grandmother,
decided to come to him.

317
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,048
Mother was deeply distressed to hear
about her nephew's serious ailment.

318
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,052
This medicine from a renowned,
private physician should help him.

319
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,181
A cold…

320
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,477
He suffers from a serious cold.

321
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,813
I worry he may pass on
the illness to Your Grace.

322
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,148
- So please--
- A cold?

323
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,072
My sweet, innocent queen.

324
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,909
How will you ever survive the cruel palace

325
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,369
when you remain so inept at lying?

326
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,123
Do not just stand there.
The tonic will grow cold!

327
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,545
Open it.

328
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,382
Your Grace, but--

329
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,467
Now!

330
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,392
Announcing His Majesty!

331
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,979
Your Grace.

332
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,590
Your Majesty,
how delighted I am to see you.

333
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:48,096
You have stepped away from state affairs
to lovingly look after your sick son.

334
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,559
I am beyond touched to see
you care so much about him, Your Grace.

335
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,602
Well…

336
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,902
What was that sound?

337
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:25,008
On the days his symptoms worsen,
he finds it difficult to endure the pain.

338
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,927
It does not seem right to have you
witness such a terrible sight--

339
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,053
Stop!

340
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,166
- Mother.
- Your Grace, are you all right?

341
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,552
Your Majesty is right.

342
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,554
I believe

343
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,891
it would be best I take my leave.

344
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,693
My goodness.

345
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,875
Are you all right?

346
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,627
Forgive me.

347
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,755
You have done well.

348
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,799
Go and get that treated.

349
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,897
If the Queen Dowager figured it out,

350
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,317
what do we do?

351
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,986
She did not witness it herself.

352
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,905
She will remain uncertain.

353
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,076
Do not worry so, Queen.

354
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,055
You are leaving? So soon?

355
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,514
I have yet to give

356
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,143
my response to His Majesty's letter.

357
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,730
You already have, my lord.

358
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,192
Have I?

359
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,319
Despite you having been
the Left State Councilor,

360
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,404
your hospitality towards me,

361
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,740
a mere text examiner
of books at the palace,

362
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,658
was wholeheartedly sincere.

363
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,787
That could not have been for my sake.

364
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,872
It was for His Majesty's sake.

365
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,001
Yes. You are right.

366
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,173
However, that does not mean
I will lend my support to His Majesty.

367
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,008
You do find yourself swayed, do you not?

368
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,302
This will affect the foundation
of this nation.

369
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,888
This may turn
the scholar-officials on him.

370
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,309
Why is His Majesty
so ardently pursuing this impossible feat?

371
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,393
His Majesty…

372
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,690
believes that it will be possible
if he has your support.

373
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,417
I hear you were looking for this, my lord.

374
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:36,134
I did not see anything of value
besides the few corrective lenses.

375
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,512
Why were you looking for this?

376
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,180
- Did you look inside?
- What?

377
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:47,687
I mean, everyone was talking about
how feisty that eyeglass artisan was.

378
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,689
Things could go awry

379
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,650
if I hand over her belongings to you.

380
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,652
There is no need for concern.

381
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,867
Yeo-ri and I grew up in the same village.

382
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,328
She is like a sister to me.

383
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,205
<i>A sister?</i>

384
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,675
Excuse me.

385
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,516
It is you, is it not?
Yoon Gap of Yongdam Village?

386
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,521
Gosh. How man years has it been?

387
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,607
You have the wrong person.

388
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,864
Why is that lowly bastard

389
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,825
coming out of Lord Choi Won-u's residence?

390
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,794
Come now.

391
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,129
Take a look.

392
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,049
Ma'am, are you kidding me right now?

393
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,301
You want a whole nyang for this ox horn?

394
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:05,181
I heard the village blacksmith bought it
for three jeons yesterday.

395
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,184
That is for the seller to decide!

396
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,811
Damn shaman rolling in here
with misfortune in the morning…

397
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,609
Ma'am, shall I educate you
on what true misfortune is?

398
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,530
Listen carefully. Summoning every spirit,
evil, wandering, and vengeful,

399
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:25,493
throughout the eight provinces to linger
on the main pillar of your house

400
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,662
so that they cause you
to grow deathly ill,

401
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,455
before ending your life

402
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,290
and your bloodline with one swoop.

403
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,125
That is true misfortune.

404
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,418
What did you say?

405
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,254
How dare you threaten me!

406
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,758
Or maybe that spirit
over there glaring at you…

407
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,053
You know, your mother-in-law
who drowned to death a few years ago.

408
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:50,518
You would at least need a drowned ghost
settling in your outhouse

409
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,520
for it to actually be a misfortune, no?

410
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,897
Forget it.

411
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,316
Even if they offer me ritual rice there,
I would not want it!

412
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,235
You would not?

413
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,904
This is so damn ridiculous.

414
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,991
Here, take it for three jeons or don't.
Whatever.

415
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,499
- And complimentary fine abrasive sand?
- What?

416
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,918
You know I am a regular here.

417
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,086
See you next time.

418
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,754
Hey. Why you…

419
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,717
Hey, spray some salt where she was.

420
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,848
I see that ironwood-like grit
has not changed one bit

421
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,599
after all these years.

422
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,950
Do not tell me
you forgot about me already.

423
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,121
Young Master Gap.

424
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,875
It has been a while, Yeo-ri.

425
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,418
Have you been well?

426
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,465
A little to the side.

427
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,634
- To the right. Good. There you go.
- Yeah, right there!

428
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,303
- Over there.
- Twist it.

429
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,763
A bit to the side.

430
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,389
- Turn it.
- Just a bit more.

431
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,141
- You got it.
- Yes, there.

432
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,768
Yes, right there.

433
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,812
Why are you by yourself again?

434
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,647
That is it. There.

435
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,775
- There. That is it.
- Turn it.

436
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,278
Are they excluding you again?

437
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,072
That is not it.

438
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,369
Stay here.

439
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,706
I will pick you the biggest,
plumpest persimmon from that tree.

440
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:45,174
Why does he always look at me
with a smile on his face?

441
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,636
Just a bit more.

442
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,555
- Hurry up.
- No, not over there…

443
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,266
Just a bit to the side.

444
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,606
Over here. No, not that side.

445
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,776
Young Master, just come down from there!
Hurry up!

446
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,612
- What?
- I do not want a persimmon.

447
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,989
Just forget it!

448
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,324
Do not worry.

449
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,868
This is nothing.

450
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,995
See.

451
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,379
- Oh, no.
- Is he okay?

452
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,686
Did you see?

453
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,938
I am perfectly fine.

454
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,951
You appear to be doing well.

455
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,828
A civil servant now, I presume?

456
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,080
Yes, that is right.

457
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,332
Your prophecy back then was true.

458
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,752
That hopeless bastard somehow managed
to become a civil servant.

459
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,841
Then, you must believe
in the Dragon King and spirits now.

460
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,472
But I hear you became
an eyeglass artisan and not a shaman.

461
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,266
How did you find that out?

462
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,935
Lord Choi Won-u mentioned you.

463
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,854
I resided in his home for a few days.

464
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,649
Here. This is yours, is it not?

465
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,944
I have been meaning to pick that up.

466
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,325
Lord Choi was quite pleased
with the glasses you made him.

467
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,078
Speaking of…

468
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,293
Would you make me
a pair of glasses as well?

469
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,463
It does not appear you need them.

470
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,923
Who would they be for?

471
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,427
His Majesty.

472
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,809
Yes, you are right.

473
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,687
I am sure there are plenty
of skilled eyeglass artisans.

474
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,316
However, we cannot just have
any artisan present to the king.

475
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:12,029
I will be praised
for recommending a talented artisan.

476
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:15,616
And you will be honored
as the king's eyeglass artisan.

477
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,493
Two birds, one stone.

478
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,665
But still, a sudden trip to Hanyang…

479
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,792
Hanyang?

480
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,669
Hanyang?

481
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,962
Unbelievable.

482
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,926
You cannot.

483
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,929
Do you even know
what a scary place Hanyang is?

484
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,723
People get swindled
even with their eyes wide open.

485
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,769
They rob people blind
from right under their noses.

486
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:47,022
The rogue thugs there will gobble up

487
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,525
a naive country girl like you in a flash.

488
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,527
That is how scary Hanyang can be--

489
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,449
Is something the matter?

490
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,285
No, not at all.

491
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,745
I thought I heard a dog barking somewhere.

492
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:04,748
Dog?

493
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,293
A dog?

494
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,878
As if evil spirit was not bad enough,
now, I'm a dog?

495
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,547
A dog barking?

496
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,299
I do not hear anything.

497
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,553
I assure you it is in your best interest
to not hear such barking.

498
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,265
Why you… You big dummy!

499
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,934
He is deceiving you right now!

500
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,818
I forgot I had to complete
an urgent order for glasses.

501
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,278
Must you do it now?

502
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,865
Yes. It is quite urgent. So, please…

503
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,160
excuse me.

504
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,412
Yeo-ri.

505
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,834
I hope

506
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,629
you will accompany me this time.

507
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,798
I am not asking for an answer now.

508
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,759
I will be staying
at the tavern for a few days.

509
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,093
Let me know when you decide.

510
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,598
Will you?

511
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,156
What an obnoxious jerk.

512
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,207
Tell me.

513
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,417
Do not even think
about trying to deceive me.

514
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,002
No tricks.

515
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,799
Why are you throwing this fit?

516
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,718
What is His Lord lying to me about?

517
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:40,969
Tell me.

518
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,224
Where did all that clairvoyant
spiritual energy of yours go?

519
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,142
Do you really not know?

520
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:51,146
He does not desire to bring you
to the palace as an eyeglass artisan.

521
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,483
He could not care less
if you lived or died.

522
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,570
He is just looking to use you
to fulfill his ambitions.

523
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:03,659
His Lord would never do that.

524
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,120
How naive.

525
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,705
How could you
have such blind faith in him?

526
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,626
So brazen, when you do not even know
what is at the palace.

527
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,086
What is at the palace?

528
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,512
What could there be?

529
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,557
The palace is known
to be full of yin energy.

530
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,726
Vicious evil spirits are…

531
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,481
What? What do you want?

532
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,775
I cannot figure out why,

533
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,527
but you

534
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,613
are afraid.

535
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,658
That is why you are
suddenly throwing this fit.

536
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:46,743
No, I am not.

537
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,037
Then, there is no reason for me to not go.

538
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,457
If it is something you fear so,

539
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,543
it cannot be something that would harm me.

540
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,965
That little…

541
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,929
I mean,

542
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,475
it is not like I particularly want to go.

543
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,518
It's just that

544
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,104
His Lord was so earnest in his plea

545
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:18,275
and I do owe him for that past incident.

546
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,239
Not to mention,

547
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,452
I am sick and tired
of being alone all the time.

548
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,335
<i>A vision?</i>

549
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,338
Gosh.

550
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,507
What is this?

551
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,361
Why are your eyes closed?

552
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,450
My lord.

553
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,578
Your intensity

554
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,871
almost made me wet my pants.

555
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,624
So dramatic you are.

556
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,636
Uncle.

557
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,892
Gyun, what are you doing here?

558
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:20,480
I am here because I have
an urgent matter to discuss with you.

559
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,045
What are you doing here, my lord?

560
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,339
Everything has changed,

561
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,550
but that tree seems to be the same.

562
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,053
That must be the spot.

563
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,846
The spot where you always sat.

564
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,475
How do you remember such things?

565
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,068
Do you remember that promise?

566
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,031
I promised I would be back for you.

567
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:17,245
Come with me, Yeo-ri.

568
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,378
<i>My visions have never been wrong.</i>

569
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,464
<i>His Lord will be fine.</i>

570
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:32,302
<i>I will not lose anyone else</i>
<i>to Gangcheori again.</i>

571
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,596
<i>So…</i>

572
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,250
My lord!

573
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,045
- Are you all right?
- I am all right.

574
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,307
I am sorry for putting you
through all this.

575
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,481
But…

576
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,734
is it not strange?

577
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,613
The capital is a three-day walk
from Yongdam Village.

578
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:01,284
However, we have been making circles
in the same spot for the past two days.

579
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,954
The capital is just past that mountain.

580
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,832
It is almost as if…

581
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,378
As if what?

582
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:15,048
It feels like someone is trying
to stop us from going to the palace.

583
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,884
Why would anyone do that?

584
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,679
We must have taken the wrong path.

585
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,521
I shall survey the area and search
for some medicinal herbs too.

586
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,481
No. Do not exert yourself.

587
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,942
I will be back in no time. Stay here.

588
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,536
Come out.

589
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,620
Reveal yourself!

590
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,582
I know you are behind this, Gangcheori!

591
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,961
How much longer
are you going to torture me?

592
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,338
Come out. Come out now!

593
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,300
It has been 13 years.

594
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:01,052
You have tortured me for 13 years.
Is that not enough?

595
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:05,098
Just let me go now,
you rotten malevolent deity!

596
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,895
Keep going. Scream all you want.

597
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,022
No matter what you do,

598
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,441
you will never be able
to leave this mountain.

599
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,444
Come out. Come out this instant!

600
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,696
Hey!

601
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,586
What is this now?

602
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,725
I am sorry, Yeo-ri.

603
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,313
I have deceived you.

604
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,025
<i>I have done this</i>
<i>in the name of noble duty.</i>

605
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,570
<i>Do not forgive me, Yeo-ri.</i>

606
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,367
Are you back already?

607
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,810
Come out.

608
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:35,647
Come out, you rotten malevolent deity!

609
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,190
Hey!

610
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,874
Lily turf.

611
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:13,643
Tell me what you discussed
with Choi Won-u.

612
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,312
Why did the king send you there?

613
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,650
Wretched scoundrel!

614
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,652
Answer him now!

615
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:31,411
<i>Yeo-ri will be back soon.</i>

616
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:35,582
<i>She will also be in danger at this rate.</i>

617
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,755
What a stubborn scoundrel you are.

618
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,798
Start talking if you do not want to die.

619
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,677
Kill me.

620
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,388
If my death could serve

621
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,558
as poison to you, Kwak Sang-chung,

622
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,978
and become a stepping stone

623
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,065
for His Majesty's noble ambitions…

624
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,777
Then, I do not fear

625
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,404
my death at all.

626
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:18,416
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

627
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,003
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

628
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,051
My lord.

629
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,511
How could you kill him?

630
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:34,349
I have always wanted
to shut this bastard's trap up

631
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,976
for eternity.

632
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,898
I feel absolutely refreshed.

633
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,401
Collect his body

634
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,988
and secretly make it look like
Choi Won-u killed him.

635
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,451
Yes, my lord.

636
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,237
<i>It is my first time</i>
<i>possessing a human body.</i>

637
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,285
<i>I feel suffocated and incredibly inept.</i>

638
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,322
This should be enough
to stop the bleeding.

639
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,789
<i>Something feels off.</i>

640
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,922
<i>I do not sense anyone's energy right now.</i>

641
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,466
<i>Where in the world did Gangcheori go?</i>

642
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,343
<i>Could he…</i>

643
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:16,761
Lord Gap?

644
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,605
My lord.

645
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:36,739
What in the world happened to you?

646
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,993
Yeo-ri…

647
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,441
Gangcheori.

648
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:22,785
<i>Gangcheori has</i>
<i>possessed Lord Yoon Gap's body.</i>

649
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,693
<i>The Ghostbane Stone!</i>

650
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,077
Yeo-ri,

651
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,288
you are mine now.

652
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,208
It was you!

653
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,793
You did it.

654
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,921
You killed His Lord.

655
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,507
As if that was not enough,
you even stole his body!

656
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,176
No, that is not true.

657
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,637
I did not kill that rascal.

658
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:28,101
Hey, speak up. Did I kill you?

659
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:32,021
You ended up dead for acting out
in the palace without knowing your place.

660
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:42,281
How is there someone
who looks exactly like me?

661
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,702
How is this--

662
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,120
No point in feeling wronged.

663
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,415
I, too, decline
this impossibly suffocating

664
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,583
and feeble body.

665
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,461
I am just borrowing it briefly
before it rots.

666
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,463
Who are you?

667
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,841
Why have you taken hold of my body?

668
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,759
Give it back this instant!

669
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,108
Yeo-ri.

670
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:27,034
How is this possible?

671
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,120
My lord.

672
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,461
That wretched Ghostbane Stone is gone.

673
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,174
It does not matter one bit

674
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,717
if you believe me or not.

675
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,306
When I become your patron deity,

676
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,308
you will have to do as I say anyway.

677
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:53,019
Let go. Let go of me, you scoundrel!

678
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,854
Now, you have no choice

679
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,398
but to loyally serve me

680
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,359
as my disciple…

681
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,116
As my disciple…

682
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,253
As my disciple!

683
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,799
<i>Why is it not working?</i>

684
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,051
<i>I have waited 13 years for this moment.</i>

685
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,804
<i>I must become her patron deity</i>
<i>to turn into a dragon.</i>

686
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,430
<i>But why?</i>

687
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,975
<i>Why can I not escape this body?</i>

688
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,899
<i>The Ghostbane Stone.</i>

689
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:13,599
No!

690
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,815
How unfortunate.

691
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,609
What are you to do?

692
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,779
You will never be able to find it now.

693
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,198
That wretched Ghostbane Stone.

694
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,492
Darn you…

695
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:50,928
Yeo-ri!

696
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,394
Yeo-ri…

697
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,069
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM YOUNG-KWANG

698
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,842
- <i>Where am I?</i>
- <i>You are in the palace.</i>

699
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,761
<i>What happened to Examiner Yoon?</i>

700
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:32,845
<i>That is amnesia.</i>

701
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,057
<i>But its five senses,</i>
<i>an exquisite attribute.</i>

702
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,393
<i>But this wondrous gadget</i>
<i>even provides clarity of the mind.</i>

703
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,478
<i>Ghostbane Stone?</i>

704
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:42,229
<i>Why did you summon that eyeglass artisan?</i>

705
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,274
Yoon Gap must have brought her here
at this very moment for a reason.

706
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,693
<i>I miss His Lord so much it kills me.</i>

707
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,821
- <i>But, it is not him.</i>
- Find his spirit and return it?

708
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:52,031
His life thread has already been cut.

709
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,115
<i>That is absurd.</i>

710
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,200
<i>This way, Yeo-ri.</i>

711
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,161
- <i>His Lord's spirit is inside the palace.</i>
- <i>Please save me.</i>

712
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,287
My lord!

713
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,373
<i>I have been tricked.</i>

714
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,708
<i>Why is this body so damn slow?</i>

715
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,460
<i>It is him.</i>

716
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:09,548
