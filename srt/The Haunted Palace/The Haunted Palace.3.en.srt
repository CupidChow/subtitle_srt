(Episode 3)

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,270
My lord.

10
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,470
Is that truly where you are?

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Scribe Yoon.

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,119
My lord.

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,680
Please answer me.

14
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,850
Scribe Yoon, please.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,800
Gwang. What is wrong?

16
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,440
Gwang!

17
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,420
Why are you just standing there?

18
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,050
Make haste...

19
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,959
Make haste and bring back the physician this instant!

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,570
My lord, it is me.

22
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,170
It is Yeo Ri.

23
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,340
Yeo Ri?

24
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,250
What is this?

25
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,490
Gwang, are you all right?

26
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,600
Your Majesty.

27
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,100
Your Majesty!

28
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,140
Gwang.

29
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,980
What is troubling you?

30
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,290
Hurry. This way.

31
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,910
My lord.

32
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,780
Scribe Yoon.

33
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,310
Where are you?

34
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,220
The Eight-feet Spirit...

35
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,990
has swallowed him up?

36
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,160
Yes.

37
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,460
Where is it?

38
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,090
Where is this Eight-feet Spirit now?

39
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,720
Could Scribe Yoon...

40
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,290
truly be in there?

41
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,760
Scribe Yoon?

42
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,830
Scribe Yoon.

43
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,980
The stench of resentment...

44
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,320
is too vile.

45
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,690
Never have I encountered a stench so vile.

46
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,650
Scribe Yoon.

47
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,000
(Episode 3: The Eight-feet Spirit)

48
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,610
Stay still.

49
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,520
Let go of me, you evil one.

50
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,789
Do you want it...

51
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,830
to swallow your spirit, so you are trapped just like Yoon Gap?

52
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,630
What did you say?

53
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,729
He managed to escape only briefly thanks to your prayer.

54
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,070
The Eight-feet Spirit has already swallowed Yoon Gap up.

55
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,970
There is nothing you can do right now.

56
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,840
Your Highness.

57
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,479
The spirit has taken firm root...

58
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,680
within the prince's body now.

59
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,280
Unless the prince's life is taken,

60
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,750
the spirit will never...

61
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,720
depart his body.

62
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,660
Are you certain?

63
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,330
The prince...

64
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,400
will...

65
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,870
meet his end because of the spirit?

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,540
Why do you sound so shocked?

67
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,110
Is that fear I hear in your voice?

68
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,240
Deep down, this was...

69
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,850
what you truly wanted, Your Highness.

70
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,950
How dare you?

71
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,519
I kept you close all this time...

72
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,249
as I found your talent useful.

73
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,720
What audacity you have.

74
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,120
Do you truly have a death wish?

75
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,160
Oh, no. Please spare my life, Your Highness.

76
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,359
As I come from humble origins, no better than a beggar,

77
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,829
I behaved as such out of ignorance of court manners.

78
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,970
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

79
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,240
You can take your leave for today.

80
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,810
Yes, Your Highness.

81
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,280
I shall take my leave now.

82
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,930
Wait.

83
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,600
Once the spirit swallows up the prince,

84
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,230
will it leave the Palace?

85
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,400
Will Young In...

86
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,440
be safe from it?

87
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,270
Yes.

88
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,509
Of course.

89
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,910
There is no doubt about it.

90
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,429
Though it was brief, the General of Heaven and Earth...

91
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,760
was quite disturbed.

92
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,760
What on earth is going on?

93
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,220
He is merely sleeping now.

94
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,060
Your Majesty.

95
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,530
I shall stay by his side.

96
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,930
You should return to your chambers.

97
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,390
I never imagined that he would truly be claimed by the Eight-feet Spirit.

98
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,130
Knowing his naivety,

99
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,330
I am certain he was struck down when he attempted...

100
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,930
to help the King while being clueless of his place.

101
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,150
You knew, did you not?

102
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,410
That the Eight-feet Spirit was in the Palace.

103
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,450
That is why you pulled those tricks to prevent me from coming here.

104
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,090
Am I wrong?

105
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,290
Yes. I knew about it.

106
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,660
Therefore,

107
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,730
I wanted to stop you from coming here by all means.

108
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,500
What?

109
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,540
Yoon Gap also knew about the Eight-feet Spirit.

110
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,069
What do you mean?

111
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,710
Have you not put 2 and 2 together?

112
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,879
That he did not bring you here...

113
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,710
so you could make eyeglasses for the King.

114
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,220
Would you make a pair for me as well?

115
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,950
For His Majesty the King.

116
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,850
No.

117
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,560
- That cannot be. - Yoon Gap...

118
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,630
watched you chase away the One-legged Spirit.

119
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,890
Therefore, he brought you here.

120
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,060
To remove the Eight-feet Spirit...

121
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:06,330
that has possessed the prince's body.

122
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,230
No.

123
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,940
He deceived you.

124
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,970
He used you.

125
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,130
My goodness.

126
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,740
My gosh.

127
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,040
Did you two have a fight?

128
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,840
Oh, no. We did not have a fight.

129
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,780
What is that?

130
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,350
These are the clothes we failed to collect the other day.

131
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,810
Someone from Hyeminseo came by to drop them off.

132
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,280
Give them to me. I can wash them.

133
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,150
Why? I ought to do it.

134
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,950
Staying idle is only causing my mind to drift.

135
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
This is...

136
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,620
From all those years ago...

137
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,300
Young Master!

138
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,830
- Young Master Gap! - Oh, my.

139
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,300
It is Yeo Ri, the granddaughter of the shaman, is she not?

140
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,110
Yeo Ri.

141
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,820
I wanted to give this to you.

142
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,420
This is a five-colored bracelet.

143
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,920
A mother is supposed to make it for her child on Dano...

144
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,560
to wish good health and longevity.

145
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,660
But that is the only thing I can give you.

146
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,440
If you hate it, you can give it back.

147
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,970
I can just sell it.

148
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,870
I do not hate it.

149
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,540
I will always keep it with me.

150
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,350
I will come back for you.

151
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,150
I promise.

152
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,520
Let us both live long in good health,

153
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,730
so we could meet again.

154
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,630
Live long in good health? How ridiculous.

155
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,770
What a useless thing.

156
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,320
I warned her enough.

157
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,090
She would not be so reckless to go after the Eight-feet Spirit.

158
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,300
I wished that...

159
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,200
you would never find out about the Eight-feet Spirit.

160
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,540
But you did in the end.

161
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,480
Gap, let us have breakfast.

162
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,960
Darn it.

163
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,570
Where is Yeo Ri?

164
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,400
Not even a good morning to your mother?

165
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,270
Where did Yeo Ri go?

166
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,269
Where do you think? She went back to the Palace.

167
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,069
She had a lot of work, so she left early in the morning.

168
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,710
Then you should have woken me up!

169
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,810
- What? - This is all your fault.

170
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,810
I overslept because you heated the stone slabs too much.

171
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,050
That stings.

172
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,320
How dare you?

173
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,789
What do you think you are doing?

174
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,919
The other day, you upset me...

175
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,390
for treating me so formally like a stranger.

176
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,819
I must have been too lenient on you.

177
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,230
There is just no end to your misbehavior.

178
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,560
Your mother has cooked you breakfast.

179
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,600
How dare you be so rude and glare at me?

180
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,530
You little...

181
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,900
My goodness.

182
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,770
I will not let this slide.

183
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,340
Forget it. I do not have time to bicker with you.

184
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,840
Oh, no. Gap. Hold on.

185
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,370
Take this with you.

186
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,310
I packed seasoned bracken and chive jeon.

187
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,680
I did not punish you for you are a good cook.

188
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,150
If you are rude to me again, I will not let it slide that time.

189
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,020
I packed a generous amount.

190
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,860
Share it with other people.

191
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,130
Oh, dear.

192
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,540
We should have lived like this a long time ago,

193
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,710
bickering, yet by each other's side.

194
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,680
You agree, do you not?

195
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,060
Come here.

196
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,689
- You come here. - My lord.

197
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,289
Where is that girl's station?

198
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,030
- Is it over there? Yes. - My gosh.

199
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,630
Yes, it is that way.

200
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,340
Where is Royal Scribe Yoon?

201
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,700
Kang Chul... I mean...

202
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,570
Why are you looking for Scribe Yoon here?

203
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,939
Because he was so busy following you around yesterday,

204
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,980
he failed to see His Majesty before leaving the Palace.

205
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,780
- Where is he? - He is not here today.

206
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,620
Did you not see him?

207
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,860
My gosh, no.

208
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,230
Good grief.

209
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,300
What kind of excuse will I give His Majesty this time?

210
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
Here.

211
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,740
His Majesty said that the chain was too loose.

212
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,709
I will come by this evening to collect it.

213
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,810
Be sure to fix it by then.

214
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,310
Yes, my lord.

215
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:08,709
It is His Majesty's cherished pair of eyeglasses.

216
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,880
Handle it with care.

217
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,650
I will keep that in mind.

218
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Goodness.

219
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,500
No pair of glasses has satisfied me as much as these.

220
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,210
Why have you summoned me again?

221
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,980
Do you not wish to avenge the one responsible for your death?

222
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,850
I will help you.

223
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,590
In return,

224
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,490
you must help me.

225
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,060
I was told the training field was around here.

226
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,999
- Over here. - There.

227
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,840
- Over there. - Go.

228
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,169
- Keep moving. - Hurry.

229
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,209
- Over here. - There.

230
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,309
- Come on. - Kick it up.

231
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,339
- Kick it. - Kick it up.

232
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,579
- Great. - You can take your time.

233
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,180
Over here.

234
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
Darn it.

235
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,980
Who are you?

236
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,120
Please forgive me. It appears I have taken the wrong path.

237
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,790
You dreadful girl!

238
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,089
I failed to get the ball because of you!

239
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,630
What is taking so long?

240
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,560
At this rate, we might end up winning.

241
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,530
Here is the ball.

242
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,570
At least, you are easy on the eye.

243
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,270
Stay here. Do not go anywhere.

244
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,440
I shall teach you a lesson later.

245
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,480
Let us play.

246
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,980
- Go! - This way.

247
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,050
It must be him.

248
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,620
Yeo Ri is not here?

249
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,120
Where did she go?

250
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,660
I do not know.

251
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,860
I swear she was here only a moment ago.

252
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,570
- Where on earth did she go? - That girl...

253
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,370
has been sneaking out when she thinks no one is watching.

254
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,240
When I see her again, I will scold her properly, my lord.

255
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,050
I will scold her.

256
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,360
Scold her?

257
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,810
Why are you doing this to me, my lord?

258
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,540
You better not lay a finger on Yeo Ri.

259
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,779
If you so much as try, I shall strike thunder upon each step...

260
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,719
taken by you and your bloodline of many generations...

261
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,920
and drown the earth with enough rain for an ocean.

262
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,060
Please forgive me, my lord.

263
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,930
I will not lay a finger on her.

264
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Oh, dear.

265
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,540
She could not have.

266
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,370
Did she try to approach the Eight-feet Spirit again?

267
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,939
I will hold him here.

268
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,480
- Go! - Stop him.

269
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,580
- Stop him. - How could you fail to score that?

270
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,690
- Over here. - Let us try again.

271
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,349
- This way. - Over there.

272
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,559
- Here! - Over here!

273
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,760
- Go for it. - Go!

274
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,789
- Over here. - Hurry up.

275
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,390
- Here! - Stay focused!

276
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,640
Darn it. Come on.

277
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,440
- Darn it. - Your Highness!

278
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,340
Hey!

279
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,410
Your servant, Ggot Boon is mine now.

280
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,519
Darn it.

281
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
She must be ready to blossom as she is 15 years old.

282
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,950
Make sure she is presentable for me.

283
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,630
How could she...

284
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,729
I was told she threw herself into the well...

285
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,330
and took her own life.

286
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,470
No, this cannot be.

287
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,310
No, it cannot be.

288
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,020
No. I must have been mistaken.

289
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,060
I was mistaken.

290
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,349
I saw you laugh like a madman...

291
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,080
out of joy that I took my own life.

292
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,549
Did you celebrate...

293
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,520
because your trouble disappeared on its own?

294
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,920
Why did you do it?

295
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,460
Why did you do that to me?

296
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,330
How dare you?

297
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,900
Come here.

298
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,740
Come on.

299
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:08,569
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

300
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,770
Be quiet.

301
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,140
Your Highness.

302
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,840
Stay still!

303
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,320
Come here.

304
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,430
Why did you do that to me?

305
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,399
Did you deem me lower than a beggar...

306
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,030
because I was a mere servant and dishonor me?

307
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,200
Even though my parents were poor, I meant the world for them.

308
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,299
You may have thought my life amounted to nothing,

309
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,240
but it was a precious one to me!

310
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,380
You will pay for this.

311
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,350
Come with me.

312
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,650
Come with me!

313
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,150
Your Highness!

314
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,889
Over here!

315
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,590
What on earth... Your Highness.

316
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,690
What?

317
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,860
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

318
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,460
You must remove your head from the jar.

319
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,760
Your Highness!

320
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,560
- Keep pulling him. - Keep pulling.

321
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,760
Your Highness!

322
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,470
Pull him out!

323
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,039
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

324
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,209
- Are you all right? - Your Highness.

325
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,310
- Are you all right? - Your Highness.

326
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,290
Thank you.

327
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,260
The horrified look on his face...

328
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,800
somewhat eased my resentment.

329
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,640
Look in the basket made with blue string...

330
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,470
hidden in the back of the Queen's launderette.

331
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:53,740
Inside, you will find Prince Gwang's undershirt.

332
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,150
That is what you wanted, right?

333
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,980
Yes.

334
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,550
I actually...

335
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,950
did not think you would do so much to help.

336
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,190
It is dangerous for you too...

337
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,430
to threaten someone with royal blood.

338
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,760
I hate scum like that just as much.

339
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,900
I like you more and more.

340
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,930
I am in a charitable mood.

341
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,340
Do you need anything else?

342
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,240
I may be a low-level Vengeful Spirit,

343
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,170
but I will do all I can to help.

344
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,580
There is nothing more you need to do.

345
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,710
But I must tell you one thing very clearly.

346
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,920
Do not approach that fool again.

347
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,850
- You must not do anything. - What?

348
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,550
If you gain more bad karma by harming a human,

349
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,460
you will become an evil spirit,

350
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,020
and there will be no going back.

351
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,230
Remember this.

352
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,930
Getting involved with humans...

353
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,830
must end here.

354
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,880
Where on earth is she?

355
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,880
Should I hang a bell from her neck?

356
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,510
Look in the basket made with blue string...

357
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,310
in the back of the Queen's launderette.

358
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,950
My gosh.

359
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,990
Where did you come from?

360
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,030
You smell of a Vengeful Spirit.

361
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,500
Did you go near the Eight-feet Spirit?

362
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,660
I did not.

363
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,199
By the way, you abuse Young Master Yoon's body...

364
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,770
just because it is not yours.

365
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,770
You jump over walls...

366
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,340
with his frail ankles.

367
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,180
- What? - Let me see.

368
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,010
What are you doing?

369
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,679
See?

370
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,180
Your ankles are swollen.

371
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,250
This is so upsetting.

372
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,420
Gosh.

373
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,620
Why is your face so red?

374
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,530
Are you hot too?

375
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,530
It is not a fever.

376
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,800
Why are you turning redder?

377
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,640
It is because you make me angry.

378
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,110
My precious body is tired.

379
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,910
- I must go home. - Wait.

380
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,309
"Home?"

381
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,520
Why will you not come?

382
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,920
Well...

383
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,090
I have some work left to do.

384
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,560
This is why I left without him.

385
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,660
How should I get rid of him now?

386
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,699
Where could he be?

387
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,660
Where did he get to?

388
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,670
Scribe Yoon!

389
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,339
I will get back to my work.

390
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,399
Do not worry.

391
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,169
Scribe Yoon! Go on your way.

392
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,240
Over there.

393
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,980
Is that not Royal Scribe Yoon?

394
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,380
It is not.

395
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,609
What are you doing?

396
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,279
That grilled abalone of a man.

397
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,720
Do you know how clingy and troublesome he is?

398
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,950
It is you.

399
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,390
Royal Scribe Yoon.

400
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,060
I looked for you everywhere,

401
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,560
not knowing you were here.

402
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,260
His Majesty asked for you. Come with me quickly.

403
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,760
His Majesty? The King?

404
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,530
What...

405
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,630
You should go. I will wait at Sanguiwon.

406
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,100
You will wait? For me?

407
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,370
Yes. We must go home together.

408
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,780
Very well, then.

409
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,909
I was wondering why...

410
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,450
the evil spirit was wreaking havoc in the Palace.

411
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,820
I should see the man of the house to find out.

412
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,220
Hey.

413
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,590
What? Man of the what?

414
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,019
I should not be long.

415
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,890
Wait for me at Sanguiwon.

416
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,760
Fine. Get going already.

417
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,430
Where is the King?

418
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,370
- That darn... - Do I go this way?

419
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,140
Is it that way?

420
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,740
It is this way, you fool!

421
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,670
What the...

422
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,740
Where is the King?

423
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,110
You deserve to die for that.

424
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,710
How dare you...

425
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,380
- Will he be okay? - You fool!

426
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,640
Your Majesty.

427
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,400
Why would you give such a command?

428
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,510
So a royal scribe...

429
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,740
was attacked by a group of thieves.

430
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,250
I am not that low or leisurely to be involved in such a case.

431
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,579
You are Minister of War, and I am well aware...

432
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,920
of your burden of duties.

433
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,419
But what if Yoon Gap was not attacked...

434
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,860
by a group of thieves,

435
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,689
but by a highly skilled man...

436
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,490
who had military training?

437
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,200
Is there proof of that?

438
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,840
Proof?

439
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,280
There is.

440
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,509
Come along. Walk faster.

441
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,650
Get out of the way.

442
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,250
Come on.

443
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,920
Your Majesty. Royal Scribe Yoon Gap is here.

444
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,520
Here is...

445
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,190
the proof.

446
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,020
Let him in.

447
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,450
Why that... Hey, you.

448
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,950
You must go.

449
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,619
I would love to just...

450
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,850
Get over here right now.

451
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,120
- My gosh. - Come here.

452
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,290
Come here.

453
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,890
Right now.

454
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,540
Shoot.

455
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,960
A robe of red embroidered with dragons.

456
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,260
That fool is the King.

457
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:05,480
I am greatly pleased to see you have recovered.

458
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,210
The physician said you lost your memory.

459
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:14,180
Do you remember nothing that happened that day?

460
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,150
Who attacked you?

461
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,260
Do you really not know anything?

462
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,300
The Minister of War here...

463
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,430
will reveal your attacker...

464
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,900
so no one is left with any doubts.

465
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,000
So tell everything you know.

466
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
I remember...

467
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,420
nothing.

468
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,830
Your Majesty.

469
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,730
It looks like your proof did not lose his memory.

470
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,540
It seems the rumor is right and he has lost his mind.

471
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,510
You will gain nothing...

472
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,670
from questioning him.

473
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,590
What are you doing?

474
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,560
Keep still.

475
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,830
This wound is proof.

476
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,970
You trained in swordsmanship yourself.

477
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,870
Does this look like the work of a robber?

478
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,849
Royal Scribe Yoon was attacked...

479
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,280
while carrying out my command.

480
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,590
Stabbing him equals stabbing me.

481
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,090
Minister of War. I need you...

482
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,330
to investigate this case and reveal the truth clearly.

483
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

484
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,519
Now I see why humans are so crazy...

485
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,850
about gaining titles.

486
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,050
This exquisite snack called taraekwa...

487
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,590
and the blindingly flashy painted wooden dancheong.

488
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,459
These silk cushions cannot be compared to...

489
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,460
the straw-like things I slept in at Yoon Gap's home.

490
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,799
So he enjoys this every day...

491
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,170
just for being a king?

492
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,210
Scribe Yoon will show some decorum.

493
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,480
Leave it.

494
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,259
You may have lost your memory,

495
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,559
but I hope you did not lose...

496
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,890
the smart mind that was full of knowledge.

497
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,900
The Public Slave Reform Bill was completed in your absence.

498
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,430
Read it through and voice your opinion.

499
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,690
Yoon Gap watched you chase away the One-legged Spirit.

500
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,829
Therefore, he brought you here.

501
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,830
To remove the Eight-feet Spirit...

502
00:39:51,831 --> 00:39:53,230
that has possessed the prince's body.

503
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,830
The scumbag.

504
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,570
He is a mean evil deity.

505
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,870
He deceived you.

506
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,940
He used you.

507
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,740
How dare he badmouth Young Master Yoon?

508
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,110
No way.

509
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,710
I will not believe a word you say.

510
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,220
After I save Young Master Yoon...

511
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,160
And then,

512
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,660
I will ask him to explain.

513
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,350
Why that...

514
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,920
Is this a joke?

515
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,750
It is as if your head is in the clouds.

516
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,619
Royal Scribe Yoon.

517
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,390
You will abolish the public slave system?

518
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,790
Does that even make sense?

519
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,330
Humans are like that.

520
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,969
To me, they are all the same.

521
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,740
They do not live to be a hundred,

522
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,839
but they divide themselves by class.

523
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,609
Some die of a full belly,

524
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,440
and the rest die of starvation.

525
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,980
It was like that for a thousand years.

526
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,880
What on earth... Do you have a death wish?

527
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,320
That is what humans are like.

528
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,790
Just because you are King...

529
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,130
and you say, "Do not do that. That is bad,"

530
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,800
do you think they would obey and say, "Yes, Your Majesty?"

531
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,430
Why waste your energy when life is short?

532
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,800
That fool...

533
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,410
Yes. You are right.

534
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,480
That is human nature.

535
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,880
That is why I exist as King.

536
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,979
If I teach the people the correct ways of living...

537
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,149
and govern them by putting them first,

538
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,020
I can suppress the greedy side of human nature,

539
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,320
and one day, bring about peace...

540
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,160
Do you think...

541
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,030
that can be done?

542
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,999
Humans were never meant to be like that.

543
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,199
I have not seen a society like that in over a thousand years.

544
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,210
That is why...

545
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,840
it is called an ideal that does not exist.

546
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,250
How dare that fool...

547
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,160
- That crazy... - That punk.

548
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,660
Hey, you. How dare you?

549
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,960
My gosh.

550
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,740
The Eight-feet Spirit's resentment...

551
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,280
did not start with him.

552
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,810
It is even older.

553
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,620
How come...

554
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,620
he was able to be...

555
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,290
so unscathed?

556
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,960
What did you think?

557
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,970
About Yoon Gap.

558
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

559
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,969
From what I saw,

560
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,140
it is as the Minister of War said.

561
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,580
He did not lose his memory.

562
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,180
He has lost his mind.

563
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,650
The brain you coveted is long gone.

564
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,589
He has become an imbecile...

565
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,590
who knows no manners or decorum.

566
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,560
He is not an imbecile.

567
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,560
Pardon?

568
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,430
He carried himself...

569
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,100
in a way that was far from proper.

570
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,170
But he knew the exact nature...

571
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,210
of us humans that never changes.

572
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,840
That is why what I am...

573
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,680
trying to accomplish...

574
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,549
has become so dangerous...

575
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,620
some would kill others to stop it.

576
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,660
What I do not understand...

577
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,460
is whether amnesia...

578
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,300
can alter someone's personality.

579
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,170
Your Majesty.

580
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,240
This is...

581
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,309
I have decided to abolish slavery...

582
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,310
within all government offices.

583
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,849
I will start with public slaves,

584
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:42,990
but in time,

585
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,790
perhaps even personal slaves will be freed too.

586
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,200
What is it? Do you also think...

587
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,270
this is preposterous?

588
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,240
Will you say I am daydreaming?

589
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,080
Are you crying?

590
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,020
I was born of a concubine...

591
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,660
and should have lived a simple, ordinary life.

592
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,330
You raised me from that.

593
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,100
I am a nobody, but I will become kindling...

594
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,200
and offer what little assistance I can.

595
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,280
Who could say they are the same person?

596
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:44,180
Yoon Gap knows too much...

597
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,850
to just let him be.

598
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,550
Keep a close eye on him.

599
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,049
I see that the General of Heaven and Earth...

600
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,220
is coiled up inside the prince's body.

601
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,920
This means the prince could lose his life at any minute now.

602
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,060
By the way, what was that yesterday?

603
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,830
What is the problem?

604
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,400
Since that day 13 years ago,

605
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,900
I have never seen him so shaken up.

606
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,200
I have a bad feeling about this.

607
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:46,180
Is there someone in the palace?

608
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,760
I do not know whether or not...

609
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,700
this will work.

610
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,840
However, I cannot just give up on Royal Scribe Yoon.

611
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:35,050
I will use myself as bait and summon the Eight-feet Spirit.

612
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,099
This! I cannot believe this.

613
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,510
What on earth happened?

614
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,440
What happened here?

615
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,210
Why is this missing one lens?

616
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,250
Where is Yeo Ri, the glasses-maker?

617
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,580
I cannot believe she did this to these precious glasses!

618
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,320
Where has she gone?

619
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,450
Bring her to me at once!

620
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,560
Well, that wench...

621
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,860
What?

622
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,230
I have not seen her in a while.

623
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:19,760
What?

624
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,070
That wench was giving me such a big headache.

625
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,999
She kept slacking off,

626
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,399
and there is this royal scribe, who behaves like a roughneck.

627
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,710
He kept coming here, looking for her.

628
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:35,079
Goodness. Why are you whispering?

629
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,180
Speak loud and clear!

630
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:40,550
Are you saying you have not seen her here all day?

631
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,720
Why, this little...

632
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,090
That means...

633
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,360
- What? - Yeo Ri is not back yet.

634
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,159
Why, that...

635
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,130
She was all sweet to me, which was very unlike her.

636
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,400
How dare she deceive me?

637
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,309
My lord, about what I said earlier...

638
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,710
- You, move aside. - My goodness.

639
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,480
You. Did you just...

640
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,479
kick open...

641
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,580
His Majesty's palanquin? How dare you!

642
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,250
I have reached the end of my patience.

643
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,859
I do not care if you have amnesia or have simply lost your mind.

644
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,160
I must teach you a lesson, or I will be on my way to an early grave.

645
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,190
Come here, you punk.

646
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,459
No, Head Eunuch. Please do not do this.

647
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,170
You stay out of this. I will teach you a lesson!

648
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,370
Head Eunuch!

649
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:36,870
You, Yeo Ri.

650
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:39,470
If I catch you,

651
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,280
I will be sure...

652
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,680
to stick to you like a leech at all times.

653
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,820
I told you not to do it.

654
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,720
My goodness.

655
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:09,340
This body of mine does not have a guardian spirit yet.

656
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,840
I offer myself to you.

657
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,700
I told you to get lost at once!

658
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,570
Your Highness! Please calm down.

659
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,970
Your Highness should change into fresh clothes.

660
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,640
You have been wearing the same clothes for days.

661
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,380
I told you all to stop being such a nuisance.

662
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,410
Must you keep this up?

663
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:54,580
Please, Your Highness...

664
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,150
The bell.

665
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,020
I heard it.

666
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,530
I hear the bell.

667
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Pardon me?

668
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,770
You fools.

669
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,940
Do you not hear this beautiful, clear sound of the bell?

670
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,770
It is calling me!

671
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,760
Yeo Ri?

672
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:48,670
I will faithfully serve you with all of my heart.

673
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,470
Please come to me.

674
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,210
I am right here.

675
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,810
- Your Highness, please... - Please, no.

676
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,550
Your Highness!

677
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:07,790
What is all this ruckus about?

678
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,560
What are you waiting for?

679
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,330
Escort the prince back to his room.

680
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,800
- Now. - Yes, my lady.

681
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,410
- No. - My gosh!

682
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,209
Gwang!

683
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,210
Your Highness.

684
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,320
Please take my life, Your Majesty.

685
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,659
How dare she steal a lens...

686
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,390
from the king's cherished glasses?

687
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,900
How brazen.

688
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,970
I apologize, Your Majesty.

689
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,870
A crystal lens, at that.

690
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,540
Your Majesty.

691
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:04,379
Your Majesty.

692
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,380
Court Lady Oh from the Queen's Palace is here.

693
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,180
What is the matter?

694
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,350
Did something else happen to the prince?

695
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,820
Your Majesty.

696
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,360
His Highness the Prince left the palace again.

697
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:18,859
What did you say?

698
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,700
What were you all doing?

699
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:38,880
It must be you.

700
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,040
Did you call me here?

701
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,110
A little child.

702
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,140
This evil spirit has no shame at all.

703
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,480
I asked you if you were the one who called me here.

704
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:16,850
Yes.

705
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,120
I have always desperately wished...

706
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,260
to serve a powerful deity like you.

707
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,960
Please be my guardian spirit,

708
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,430
and I will faithfully serve you with all of my heart.

709
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,450
A grand vessel like you is hard to come by.

710
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,750
Clearly, you are way better equipped spiritually...

711
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:56,160
to become my vessel than the lowly Aguji fool.

712
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,990
"Aguji?"

713
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,790
Who is Aguji?

714
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,870
Then would you accept me and be my guardian spirit?

715
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:07,840
Sure.

716
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,170
Let us...

717
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:12,710
have some fun.

718
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,890
To save Royal Scribe Yoon's soul,

719
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,260
I must first remove the Eight-feet Spirit from this body.

720
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:11,870
What are you doing?

721
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,170
He has caught on.

722
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,140
You wicked wench.

723
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,970
Who are you?

724
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,370
Who are you, really?

725
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,240
What is the reason behind your deep resentment?

726
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,820
It is over now.

727
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:19,970
Are you all right?

728
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,460
How dare you lay a hand on His Highness the Prince?

729
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:45,230
Back off at once!

730
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,029
You have truly lost your mind!

731
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,100
No!

732
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,740
You should not come in here.

733
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,740
Your Majesty, I am saying this for His Highness' sake.

734
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,340
Please.

735
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,260
Gwang!

736
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,929
You had better not try anything funny.

737
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,960
I do not know what I might do with this dagger.

738
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,730
- That mad fool! - Your Highness!

739
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:25,330
Do you think I cannot hurt him?

740
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,270
I do not care if he is of royal blood.

741
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,470
I will not even bat an eye once.

742
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:38,480
All of you!

743
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,420
Do not move.

744
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,690
Yeo Ri.

745
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,150
The Great Spirits do not stay in one place...

746
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:22,320
and answer and protect those who pray.

747
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,190
The Great Spirits do not stay in one place...

748
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,460
and answer and protect those who pray.

749
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,119
Give us the wisdom to find inner peace...

750
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,450
and purify our minds and souls.

751
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:54,020
Please keep all evil away from us and grant our wish.

752
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,580
Gwang!

753
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,980
Are you all right?

754
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,230
The Eight-feet Spirit has left his body.

755
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:10,730
Gwang!

756
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:41,660
But this is odd.

757
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,360
I see nothing.

758
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,570
Because of the sacred rope,

759
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:47,540
it cannot leave this spot.

760
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,140
The sacred rope...

761
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:58,610
It broke.

762
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,280
What?

763
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,490
Then where is the Eight-feet Spirit?

764
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:21,270
Your Majesty.

765
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,180
There it is.

766
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:30,950
The Eight-feet Spirit.

767
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,380
(The Haunted Palace)

768
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,180
Why is he so strong?

769
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,619
How did I look when I was dueling with him?

770
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,260
You did not look like your normal self.

771
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,889
You are not Yoon Gap.

772
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:16,960
Who are you?

773
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,260
You can have my body.

774
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,959
Please save Royal Scribe Yoon.

775
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,899
You want me to deal with him again?

776
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,869
Are you not afraid of the Eight-feet Spirit?

777
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:26,269
I need proper shamanic tools.

778
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:27,500
I will go to Monk Gaseop.

779
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,610
He is unbelievably charismatic.

780
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:33,070
You are not human.

781
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,810
That wench must have done another wicked thing.

782
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,510
The two of them are to be banished from the capital at once!
