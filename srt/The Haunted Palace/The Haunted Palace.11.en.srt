00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,760
(Yuk Seong Jae)

2
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,810
(Kim Ji Yeon)

3
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,030
(Kim Ji Hoon)

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,339
(The Haunted Palace)

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,009
(All places, organizations, characters, )

6
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,669
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,340
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,510
I am not your enemy.

9
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,930
The royal family is your enemy.

10
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,560
So, why would you...

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,480
attack me?

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,490
What nonsense are you talking about?

13
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,050
He suddenly ran away?

14
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,880
Stop right there!

15
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,270
The warding stone.

16
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,730
He could come back at any second.

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,480
We must get out of here now.

18
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,660
Kang Chul.

19
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,450
Always keep the warding stone with you.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,500
(Episode 11)

21
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,380
I found them where Yeo Ri was locked up.

22
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,090
(Fire)

23
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,639
They are the same, Your Majesty.

24
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,929
(Fire)

25
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,770
It is the same talisman, used to summon the Eight-feet Spirit.

26
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,520
Master Pung San.

27
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,060
I am certain he is Aguji.

28
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,110
The evidence is clear. What are we still doing here?

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,779
We must take him down now.

30
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,900
Because of him, Yeo Ri...

31
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,489
He had already dispatched the officers of the Royal Guard...

32
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,490
to find him.

33
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,200
They are also combing through the cave found in his shrine.

34
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,660
It is just that the cave is too deep and intricate.

35
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,620
The search will take some time.

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,629
What about the Bureau of the Blind?

37
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,000
It has already been shut down.

38
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,630
Any close shamans and servants of Master Pung San...

39
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,219
have been apprehended.

40
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,300
The premier is interrogating them as he is the current justice.

41
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,060
I am greatly relieved that you are unharmed.

42
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,650
Are you all right?

43
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,730
Yes. It is a relief that I am unharmed.

45
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,490
But this is odd.

46
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,780
Why did he spare my life?

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,240
What are you doing?

48
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,910
But we cannot let her go free.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,749
This wench knows everything.

50
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,540
We cannot kill our bait.

51
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,920
Quietly take her to Sugumun Gate.

52
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,670
He called me bait.

53
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,800
I am the bait.

54
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,470
But bait for what?

55
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,350
Darn it.

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,809
The military officers are all over the Palace.

57
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,350
What do I do now?

58
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Oh, no.

59
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,410
Master?

60
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,950
General of Heaven and Earth.

61
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,590
Your Majesty.

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,800
Where is Pung San's shrine?

63
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,550
This way, Your Majesty.

64
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,970
This is the place.

65
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,509
The secret path to Pung San's shrine...

66
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,050
was hidden here.

67
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,940
Oh, no.

68
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,070
Master.

69
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,530
Master!

70
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,280
Good grief.

71
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,659
What is going on now?

72
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,290
Oh, no.

73
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,290
Master, wake up. Please.

74
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,200
That...

75
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,490
I apologize.

76
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,819
We tried pouring water and scattering sand.

77
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,449
But it was only temporary.

78
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,910
The flames kept returning.

79
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,740
I want everyone...

80
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,580
to leave.

81
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,540
- Your Majesty. - I beg you not to order us to go.

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,419
We cannot remain here alone.

83
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,630
- I told you to leave! - Yes, Your Majesty.

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,340
I will remain close by.

85
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,290
I will kill all of you.

86
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,670
I will wipe out...

87
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,630
the royal bloodline.

88
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
You have been...

89
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,110
breathing down on my neck for far too long.

90
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,280
Where are you hiding?

91
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,950
You evil spirit!

92
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Come out now, and face me.

93
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,460
I have come down myself as I have something to tell you.

94
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,260
I have denied your existence time and again for so long.

95
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,130
I did not want to believe it.

96
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,760
I dismissed it as bad luck...

97
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,260
and told myself that it was a passing tragedy.

98
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,809
I tried to believe that it only happened...

99
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,890
because I was not benevolent enough...

100
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,890
as a king.

101
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,900
However, I know it clearly.

102
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,360
That you are trying to destroy me and my family.

103
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,450
And that you watched...

104
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,990
and took delight...

105
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,330
in my bottomless fear and unending rage.

106
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,170
Show yourself at once!

107
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,960
Go ahead and see if you can take me down.

108
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,550
I will never let you bring me down.

109
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,220
I will never succumb to you.

110
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,970
I will look you in the eye...

111
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,810
and take you on.

112
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,270
You will never...

113
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,650
defeat me.

114
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,390
I am not your enemy.

115
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,900
The royal family is your enemy.

116
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,490
So, why would you...

117
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,450
attack me?

118
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,840
Do not pay attention to it.

119
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,050
Do not let it bother you.

120
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,550
What do you mean?

121
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,430
What should I not worry about?

122
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,180
Spirits are known to speak in riddles...

123
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,980
and lies.

124
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,520
That is how they play with our mind.

125
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
What could have led you...

126
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:46,230
to forge a cursed connection with the royal family?

127
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,109
I know.

128
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,529
Then why are you sitting out here in a daze?

129
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,410
Th Eight-feet Spirit knew everything.

130
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,740
That a century ago during the war,

131
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,830
I fell to the ground while ascending to the sky.

132
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,500
It sounded as if...

133
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,630
he had watched me fall that day.

134
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,050
Then could he have been born on the day you fell...

135
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,550
to the ground?

136
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,640
The wind is chilly. Get back inside.

137
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,730
I...

138
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,580
It is him.

139
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,660
The feast I settled on.

140
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,790
Malice festers within him.

141
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,620
Does it not?

142
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,380
Yes.

143
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,800
The stink of his malice...

144
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,760
has made its way to me too.

145
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,360
What is going on?

146
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,240
My lord, it is nothing.

147
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,610
You over there.

148
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,200
Make way for Lord Hong Kwon Woo.

149
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,780
Clear the path now.

150
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,409
How dare he? I told you to move aside!

151
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,710
Just look at that.

152
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,630
He must think he owns the entire street.

153
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,840
He could easily have walked around me.

154
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,340
But he is forcing me to move.

155
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,180
He has no idea it will only hasten his end.

156
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,969
Why are you just standing there? Get rid of him.

157
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,970
Yes, my lord.

158
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,180
Move!

159
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,620
What is that?

160
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,210
No.

161
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,550
Yeo Ri.

162
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,510
I apologize.

163
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,180
Please forgive his rudeness.

164
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,770
Yeo Ri.

165
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,490
Gosh, that little wench.

166
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,620
Yeo Ri.

167
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Yeo Ri.

168
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,750
Explain what I just saw.

169
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,420
You saw everything. Why are you asking?

170
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,499
He was helping me feast on him.

171
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,300
But you ruined everything.

172
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,550
A recently deceased man named Kwak Sang Chung also had...

173
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,470
ripped talisman as well.

174
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,470
Were you behind his death too?

175
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,020
Is that so?

176
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,680
That...

177
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,480
Yes. I was behind it.

178
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,360
But he abducted Yoon Gap's mother and tried to kill her.

179
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,739
Offering an evil man like him to Bi Bi...

180
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,200
is not a big deal.

181
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,490
And the man from earlier is no different.

182
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,119
Without that darned talisman,

183
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,620
Bi Bi would have eaten him up a long time ago.

184
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,540
Did I not tell you?

185
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,460
For Bi Bi to devour noble men who commit evil deeds...

186
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,590
is regarded as a righteous act.

187
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,300
Why are you so angry at the work of a deity?

188
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,300
The work of a deity?

189
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,390
Fine.

190
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,719
For you deities, ending someone's life...

191
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,310
must be a trivial matter.

192
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,980
But you see,

193
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,770
when a deity ends someone's life, it is considered a punishment.

194
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,860
But when a man kills another,

195
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,280
it is only murder.

196
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,740
- Murder? - Yes, murder.

197
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,450
The one who stole my myeongdu and tore the talisman...

198
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,620
was not you, Kang Chul.

199
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,830
It was done by the human body of Young Master Gap.

200
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,710
My gosh.

201
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,690
Did I not tell you?

202
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,480
For Bi Bi to devour noble men who commit evil deeds...

203
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,740
is regarded as a righteous act.

204
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,660
Why are you so angry at the work of a deity?

205
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,120
The work of a deity...

206
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,470
My gosh.

207
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,350
The more I dwell on it, the more enraged I feel.

208
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,020
She is angry because I used Yoon Gap's precious body...

209
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,270
to kill a man?

210
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,060
It was only recently she professed her feelings.

211
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,730
Is she still troubled by the concerns for him?

212
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,740
You could not sleep either?

213
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:06,610
You startled me.

214
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,070
What about you? Why are you not asleep?

215
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,369
You usually snore loudly enough to shake the roof...

216
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,000
the moment you put your head down.

217
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,789
Yeo Ri told me what happened in the afternoon.

218
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,370
And that had me worried.

219
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,299
It is odd that the Eight-feet Spirit...

220
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,380
disappeared like that.

221
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,010
So listen.

222
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,770
Are you certain...

223
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,350
what you told me before is the only way?

224
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,020
I mean...

225
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,190
my glowing pearl.

226
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,740
Is using up the serpent's glowing pearl...

227
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,120
the only way to send off the Eight-feet Spirit?

228
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,370
Are you certain that is the only way?

229
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,960
I am sorry.

230
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,629
I do not know any other way...

231
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,630
since I am just a quack as you call me.

232
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,630
How useless you are.

233
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,150
(Episode 11: Bi Bi)

234
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Your Majesty.

235
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,490
We found a good number of letters and items...

236
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,080
from the Dowager Queen's Palace...

237
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,950
in the basement of Pung San's shrine.

238
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,829
Is it safe to assume that the Dowager Queen...

239
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,710
has been behind Pung San?

240
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,260
How interesting.

241
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,429
Just recently, you told me...

242
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,049
that even if someone...

243
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,300
had cast evil spells against the royal family,

244
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,390
the one who suffered the most and faced the biggest pain was...

245
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,140
the Dowager Queen. Did you not?

246
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,560
Do you actually believe that...

247
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,109
evil spells and shamans...

248
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,650
hold such power to end a life? Did I understand you correctly?

249
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,280
Unfortunately, Prince Young In...

250
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,370
passed away due to excessive drinking.

251
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,080
The Dowager Queen was heartbroken by her son's death.

252
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,290
So naturally, she was deceived...

253
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,540
by the wicked, blind shaman.

254
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,800
This is a set-up.

255
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,129
I have kept the blind shaman,

256
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,759
Pung San, by my side for a long time.

257
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,510
I know him better than anyone.

258
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,600
Someone is pinning everything on him.

259
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,100
And who might that be?

260
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,640
As for that,

261
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,359
you must know who it is better than anyone.

262
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,400
Your Highness.

263
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,650
Who recommended Pung San to you?

264
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,859
Who is behind Pung San?

265
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,660
- Your Majesty! - Please open your eyes!

266
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,790
You may not have been an affectionate mother.

267
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,000
But you were never a fool.

268
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,590
Can you still not see it?

269
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,050
That you offered your son as a sacrifice and caused his death.

270
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,220
What do you mean?

271
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,179
That is absurd.

272
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,270
Pung San is a shaman who serves an evil spirit.

273
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,480
Yes.

274
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,150
The same evil spirit that drove the late king to death.

275
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,880
It is Prince Young In's undershirt.

276
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,430
No.

277
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,060
No, it cannot be.

278
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,640
I do not think you are entirely blameless.

279
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,230
But I will not hold you responsible...

280
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,530
because...

281
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,320
you are already facing the cruelest punishment.

282
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,000
No. That cannot be.

283
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,540
No...

284
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,260
Say a chant to chase all spirits.

285
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,550
So that...

286
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,970
the spirit I summoned will stay away from him.

287
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,600
Remove this.

288
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,890
This cannot be true. No.

289
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,350
No.

290
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,770
No, it cannot be.

291
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,190
No...

292
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,360
No.

293
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,910
No.

294
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,420
You must have no shame to come back to me after everything.

295
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,590
You.

296
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,460
Do you know the trouble...

297
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,720
I must endure to clean up after your mess?

298
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,180
Please...

299
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,140
grant me one more chance.

300
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,390
Your existence itself...

301
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,269
has become a grave threat to me now. Understood?

302
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,769
- No, my lord master. - Darn.

303
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,770
Oh, please. My lord master.

304
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,789
Do you truly believe you can get your way...

305
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,000
and dethrone the King without my help?

306
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,670
What?

307
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,840
Prepare a place for this blind man to hide.

308
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:04,300
The world you seek is now within your grasp at last.

309
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,980
My goodness.

310
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,059
Oh, dear. Master.

311
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,270
Good grief.

312
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,110
Are you all right?

313
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,530
Master.

314
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,360
My gosh.

315
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,240
It was Lord Kim's family shrine a long time ago.

316
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,409
This place goes unnoticed by others.

317
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,749
Do not behave carelessly here.

318
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,790
My gosh.

319
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,960
I understand.

320
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,420
All right.

321
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,800
My gosh. Oh, my.

322
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,170
My goodness.

323
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,560
Master.

324
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,980
Oh, no. Master.

325
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,820
My goodness. Please wake up.

326
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,240
My goodness. What is going on?

327
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,569
Se Won.

328
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,450
Oh, dear. You are awake.

329
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,120
Yes.

330
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,740
There.

331
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,290
You saw it yourself, did you not?

332
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,710
I mean when the General of Heaven and Earth possessed my body.

333
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,210
The lord master could not do a thing.

334
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,470
Yes. I saw it clearly with my two eyes.

335
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,260
Do you understand now?

336
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,020
As long as we have the General on our side,

337
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,140
nothing in the world can scare us.

338
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,940
Yes. You are right.

339
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,150
Is there a brazier nearby?

340
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,700
"It is time to pluck and enjoy the ripe persimmon."

341
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,130
The General of Heaven and Earth has spoken thusly.

342
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,939
(Yeonjong the Great, Prince Young In)

343
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,940
Did you...

344
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:20,400
mark the ones killed by the Eight-feet Spirit?

345
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,150
Yes. You are spot on.

346
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,900
Remember what Yeo Ri said before?

347
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,149
The Eight-feet Spirit has...

348
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,450
a long-standing grudge against the royal family.

349
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,910
These are the royal relatives who met sudden and strange deaths...

350
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,330
in the past 13 years, following the passing of the late king.

351
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,790
However,

352
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,040
the spirit could not kill off every single member of the family.

353
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,089
(Lee Hwa Sung)

354
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,379
These must be the people the Eight-feet Spirit did not kill.

355
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,970
- Yes. - Then...

356
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,219
the one the Eight-feet Spirit holds a grudge against...

357
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,680
must have lost all of his offerings to it.

358
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,269
(Yeonjong the Great)

359
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,640
This must be its nemesis.

360
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,110
It seems to me the Eight-feet Spirit holds a grudge...

361
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,270
against my great-great-grandfather,

362
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,740
Yeonjong the Great. The king who ruled this land a century ago.

363
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,410
A century ago.

364
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,990
The Eight-feet Spirit said he was born a century ago too.

365
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,119
This cannot be a coincidence.

366
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,499
Considering how he knew Kang Chul fell to the ground...

367
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,159
while ascending to the sky on the same day,

368
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,670
he must have been in Yongdam Village...

369
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,960
when he faced his last moment.

370
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,590
Yongdam Village?

371
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,670
Yongdam Village is located in Ducheong County.

372
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,550
Around that time, a dreadful war hit the village.

373
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,049
The sight of dead bodies...

374
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,340
would not have come as a surprise that day.

375
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,510
All the secrets related to the Eight-feet Spirit...

376
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,060
were buried in Yongdam Village a century ago.

377
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,099
A century ago when the outlanders from the north...

378
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,860
invaded our land and waged war,

379
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,730
a man served Yeonjong the Great faithfully by his side.

380
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,030
He was named a meritorious servant for his service.

381
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,320
His family put down roots in Ducheong County...

382
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,030
and became a prestigious family for generations.

383
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,790
His descendant...

384
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,200
might know something about this.

385
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,290
Who is the descendant?

386
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,960
It is Lord Choi Won Woo.

387
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,760
- Pardon? - What?

388
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,920
I will visit Yongdam Village in ten days.

389
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,340
Once I arrive, I will be sure to reveal the true identity...

390
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,350
of the Eight-feet Spirit.

391
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,560
Please.

392
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,569
I am going to the council meeting.

393
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,610
Stop following me and go your own way.

394
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,330
I need to go this way too.

395
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,620
What is it this time?

396
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,290
What is the problem?

397
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,630
So... About that man.

398
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,130
That Yoon Gap.

399
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,260
What was he like?

400
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,880
Yoon Gap?

401
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,390
You could not have found a man more loyal.

402
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,430
He was a true scholar.

403
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,640
"A true scholar?"

404
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,650
The Yoon Gap I saw was a shallow coward.

405
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,520
He duped Yeo Ri...

406
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,110
to bring her here to catch the Eight-feet Spirit.

407
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,030
But you and Yeo Ri both.

408
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,819
Why do you like him so much...

409
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,659
that you never stop talking about him?

410
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,030
I am sick of it.

411
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,660
What is the matter?

412
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,120
Are you jealous?

413
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,670
You have one incredible skill...

414
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,750
that Yoon Gap never did or could possess.

415
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,960
What is that?

416
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,510
You turn the King of a nation...

417
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,760
into a man more childish than one you find in the marketplace.

418
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,510
Sure. And does that King know...

419
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,969
his nation has so many rotten nobles,

420
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,849
they are on every corner?

421
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,810
Do you think I do not?

422
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,480
I will fight them with all the power I have,

423
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,779
and in the end, I will sentence them...

424
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,650
by law to a punishment that suits their crimes.

425
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,660
Leave the worldly issues to a human king...

426
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,450
and just stay aside and watch as a deity does.

427
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,080
For example,

428
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,040
do not punish the rotten nobles yourself.

429
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,790
If you know what I mean.

430
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,750
Yes?

431
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,640
Yes?

432
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,200
That will protect you from the Eight-feet Spirit.

433
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,120
Thank you for gifting him something so precious.

434
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,620
This is a warding stone, is it not?

435
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,710
How do you know that?

436
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,749
My father showed me his glasses made with...

437
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,840
a warding stone.

438
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,049
Yes. You must keep that warding stone...

439
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,090
with you at all times, Your Highness.

440
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,350
What did that King mean?

441
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,020
Does he know what we were doing?

442
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,610
- Know what? - My goodness.

443
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,650
I told you not to appear like that.

444
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,580
Bi Bi?

445
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,370
Are those two...

446
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,260
I saw...

447
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,260
where Yeo Ri hid the myeongdu.

448
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,589
I also found the noble...

449
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,300
I did not get to eat that night.

450
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,600
Right now,

451
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,440
he is at a gisaeng house getting drunk.

452
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,020
Come with me.

453
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,770
Help me set up a feast while Yeo Ri is busy in the Palace.

454
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,110
Bi Bi.

455
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,070
I will not go with you.

456
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,530
- What? - Yeo Ri was right.

457
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,199
Now that I possess a human body,

458
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,290
I should not do what a deity does.

459
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,750
- Kang Chul. - Pung San has fled.

460
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,500
He cannot write the nobles any more Haeilbu.

461
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,960
Humans never fail to age each year,

462
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,669
so each year,

463
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,300
you will find more greedy men over 60 to eat.

464
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,640
I am sorry the pig spell talisman delayed your ascension,

465
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,850
but it is just a few years.

466
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,849
In just a few years, your feast...

467
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,060
Enough of that!

468
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,060
- Bi Bi. - You do not want to do...

469
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,110
anything that girl does not like.

470
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,320
At this rate, you might even offer up your glowing pearl...

471
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,950
to send the Eight-feet Spirit to the afterlife.

472
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,200
How...

473
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,290
- do you know... - I heard everything!

474
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,250
To fight the Eight-feet Spirit,

475
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,750
you must use up the energy of your glowing pearl.

476
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,550
That means you must die.

477
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,840
At first you said...

478
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,590
you were...

479
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,010
just using Yeo Ri to ascend.

480
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,180
Look at you now.

481
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,060
Take a good look at yourself.

482
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,770
You have not possessed a human body.

483
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,110
That body has swallowed you whole!

484
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,690
Kang Chul the Serpent...

485
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,240
has gone too far.

486
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,240
Because of that girl, Yeo Ri.

487
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,050
That idiot.

488
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,680
That moron.

489
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,140
He let down a brother for a girl...

490
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,350
who will not even live a century?

491
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,190
Will he...

492
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,570
actually give up his glowing pearl?

493
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,610
He does not have a Haeilbu to stop me.

494
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:55,970
Show yourself.

495
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,570
So you noticed.

496
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,609
Did you enjoy your meal,

497
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,819
my lord serpent?

498
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,030
No wonder.

499
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,159
This explains the disgusting, fiery stench.

500
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,990
Oh, you are so scary.

501
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,829
My servant had a terrible time catching...

502
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,249
and tying up your prey.

503
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,709
Do not glare...

504
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,329
when we went to such lengths to serve you.

505
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,499
What are you up to?

506
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,549
Nothing much.

507
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,090
Just hand over that wench named Yeo Ri.

508
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,260
What?

509
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,550
The shrine room in the Bureau of the Blind.

510
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,009
Bring the girl there,

511
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,259
and I will offer up some nobles...

512
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,220
for you to eat just like this.

513
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,309
I wrote the pig spell talismans.

514
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,599
I know...

515
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,649
who has one and who does not.

516
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,440
Catching them for you is no problem at all.

517
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,860
Was this...

518
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,530
why you sold the Haeilbu talisman?

519
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,320
Neither I nor the General of Heaven and Earth...

520
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,790
have anything against you serpents.

521
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,830
But because of that girl Yeo Ri,

522
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,209
Kang Chul the serpent...

523
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,459
keeps getting involved.

524
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,000
It has become a great headache.

525
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,260
If you just get that girl and bring her to the shrine room,

526
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,840
I will offer her to the General of Heaven and Earth.

527
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,300
Then Kang Chul will no longer get in our way,

528
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,970
which would benefit us, and you get to ascend as you wish.

529
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,690
Would that not be a deal that would work for both sides?

530
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,160
I will use the paper talisman to confine the Eight-feet Spirit.

531
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,950
Then you will stab it...

532
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,580
with the crescent dagger,

533
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,710
using the power of the glowing pearl.

534
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,300
That was why that time...

535
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,140
What have I demanded of Kang Chul?

536
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,449
Look at you now.

537
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,079
Take a good look at yourself.

538
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,330
You have not possessed a human body.

539
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,420
That body has swallowed you whole!

540
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,710
Kang Chul the Serpent...

541
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,630
has gone too far.

542
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,010
Because of that girl, Yeo Ri.

543
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,890
Bi Bi...

544
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,930
seemed extremely angry.

545
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,520
How do I appease him?

546
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,270
So...

547
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,320
Yes? What is it?

548
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,159
I am sorry for touching your belongings.

549
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,160
Oh, that. Sure.

550
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,880
Your warding stone. Where is it?

551
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,090
- Oh... - Where is it?

552
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,720
Well...

553
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,469
- I gave it to the young prince. - What?

554
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,469
We will go to Yongdam Village in a few days.

555
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,139
What if the Eight-feet Spirit were to harm...

556
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,729
the Queen or her son while we are away?

557
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,850
What about you, then?

558
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,769
I could finally relax knowing you had...

559
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,400
the warding stone.

560
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,069
I cannot have it. I will go to the Palace...

561
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,609
and get it back from that boy.

562
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,620
Wait.

563
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,490
What are you doing?

564
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,370
Let go of my robe.

565
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,210
You are smiling?

566
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,749
You hated my warding stone so much, just a few months ago,

567
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,670
you did all sorts of things to get rid of it.

568
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,260
Yes. You took over Young Master Gap's body...

569
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,760
to keep me away from my warding stone.

570
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,720
Things have changed since then.

571
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,520
Kang Chul.

572
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,650
I no longer need the warding stone.

573
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,270
You do not need it?

574
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,450
- What nonsense... - You are my warding stone.

575
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,040
Back in Yongdam Village and here in the capital.

576
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,500
It was always you.

577
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,000
When I was left alone, you watched over and protected me.

578
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,750
It was always you.

579
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
You are...

580
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,050
my warding stone who protects me.

581
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,510
So...

582
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,890
I do not confuse you...

583
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,850
with Young Master Gap.

584
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,440
And...

585
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,820
And?

586
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,780
I can only do this without my warding stone.

587
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,959
- Hey, you. - Goodness.

588
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,540
Why are you grinning at the table?

589
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,250
I was not grinning.

590
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,220
I was looking for something to pick up with my chopsticks.

591
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,469
Stop it. Barley porridge has a lovely flavor on its own.

592
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,010
Yes.

593
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,929
I enjoyed the porridge so much,

594
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,350
I was done in three spoonfuls... No, I was done in three gulps.

595
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,440
This is all we have to eat because you wasted your salary.

596
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,860
We have no choice.

597
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,319
I am sorry to say this,

598
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,530
but from today, barley porridge is all we eat.

599
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,619
- Ma'am. - Yes?

600
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,750
What about the money I gave you last time?

601
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,880
I dare not spend that.

602
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,459
I will keep it all and return it on your wedding day.

603
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,960
Do not worry.

604
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,129
Stop complaining about my darn pay.

605
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,179
I will ask the King to pay me once more...

606
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,969
when we meet tomorrow.

607
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,639
Will you cook something nice...

608
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,599
That is just nonsense.

609
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,850
Do you think the King is your friend?

610
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,690
Can we talk, Monk Gaseop?

611
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,490
Yeo Ri. How do you know that?

612
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,080
You knew, then.

613
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,040
That the serpent's glowing pearl...

614
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,290
can send the Eight-feet Spirit to the afterlife.

615
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,090
Is there another way?

616
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,090
His Majesty once said...

617
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,469
Neop Deok was the only shaman...

618
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,930
to silence the Eight-feet Spirit.

619
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,560
What did Grandma do?

620
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,139
She used all the methods and spells she knew,

621
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,149
and also tried to identify...

622
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,900
the Eight-feet Spirit but could not.

623
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,150
In the end,

624
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,110
she summoned the Spirit of Death.

625
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,070
That could cause the shaman's sudden death.

626
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,120
Yes.

627
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,080
Neop Deok was one of the few who could pull it off.

628
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,289
But you know as well...

629
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,880
that it did not work in the end.

630
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,960
But Grandma...

631
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,170
did not know...

632
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,130
who the Eight-feet Spirit was or about the blind shaman Aguji.

633
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,300
When we visit Yongdam Village and identify the Eight-feet Spirit,

634
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,220
summoning the Hwadeok Chasa might be enough to do it.

635
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,850
Hwadeok Chasa?

636
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,689
One of the Spirits of Death...

637
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,520
that takes souls who were burned to death?

638
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,120
What is it?

639
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:48,300
You need one more thing to summon the Hwadeok Chasa.

640
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,880
Did you hear what we talked about?

641
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,470
That is not the point right now.

642
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:57,390
The Eight-feet Spirit's identification tag.

643
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,560
Do you not need that?

644
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:00,810
The identification tag?

645
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:04,940
Having it would be ideal, but how could we ever find it?

646
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,900
No.

647
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,359
Aguji might have the identification tag.

648
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,820
That was how he was able to summon it.

649
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:17,410
I saw it in the shrine room he used to use.

650
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,040
- Is that true? - I am telling you.

651
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,290
If you do not believe me, leave it.

652
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,920
Wait.

653
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,590
What?

654
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,380
Do you want me to come with you?

655
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,350
- Shoot. - Come with me.

656
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,270
Do not tell Kang Chul...

657
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,230
that I know about the glowing pearl.

658
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,480
He cannot know.

659
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,360
I will make sure Kang Chul is not sacrificed...

660
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,360
to eliminate the Eight-feet Spirit.

661
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,160
This girl...

662
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,950
cares deeply about Kang Chul.

663
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,290
That is why...

664
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:07,000
you are an even bigger threat to him.

665
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:11,090
If Kang Chul accepts the feelings you have for him,

666
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,760
he will never allow you...

667
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,220
to be in danger.

668
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,310
Even if he does not forgive me for a thousand years,

669
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,180
I cannot help it.

670
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,910
Tomorrow night, I will bring Yeo Ri...

671
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,989
to the Bureau's shrine room.

672
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,330
Good, good.

673
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,410
Very well.

674
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,370
That said,

675
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,380
I am sorry, but I need you to die.

676
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,200
What brings him here?

677
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,320
It is none of my business.

678
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,290
I just need to separate her from Kang Chul...

679
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,700
and enjoy the feast.

680
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,290
That is how I can save Kang Chul.

681
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:43,140
(Do not enter)

682
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,730
(Do not enter)

683
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,160
You scared me.

684
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,209
Must you always show up like that?

685
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,290
Why are you so late?

686
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,750
What about the Eight-feet Spirit's identification tag?

687
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,670
Come with me.

688
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,320
I could not take a good look last time.

689
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,490
I must say, this shrine...

690
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,950
It is truly impressive.

691
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,450
It collected the energy of the fire spirit...

692
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,410
and made sure its powers could be used to the fullest.

693
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:54,750
The identification tag must be inside.

694
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,750
Where is it?

695
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:43,010
- We meet again. - How is this...

696
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,260
Why is he here?

697
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,200
Bi Bi.

698
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,250
You tricked me?

699
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,039
But why?

700
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,920
Kang Chul changed because of you.

701
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,340
If I do not intervene now,

702
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,630
he will give up everything he worked so hard for all those years.

703
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,970
I will not let him do that.

704
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,890
I will never let Kang Chul make such a sacrifice.

705
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,720
You heard it too.

706
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,849
I came here today to look for a way to...

707
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:32,850
Right.

708
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,099
You must feel that way now.

709
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,270
But because of the way you feel,

710
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,020
he will not stay out of it.

711
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,450
It is fine even if he hates me forever after this.

712
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,450
If only I could save him...

713
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,230
You are...

714
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,010
Bring that serpent to the shrine safe and sound.

715
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:50,150
(Do not enter)

716
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,600
(Do not enter)

717
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:29,530
Yeo Ri.

718
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,280
You truly are asking to get killed.

719
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
Bi Bi?

720
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,010
This time, you cannot get in my way.

721
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:01,140
Bi Bi the Serpent has kindly agreed to help me.

722
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,020
You. What do you think you are doing now?

723
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,060
Bi Bi!

724
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,440
What is this?

725
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:11,860
Blame yourself.

726
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,450
I am doing this for you have changed!

727
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,240
- What did you say? - This is actually good.

728
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,870
Today, I will kill that wench right here...

729
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,750
and free you from that darned body.

730
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,080
That is enough, Bi Bi.

731
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,289
I do not want to have to fight you.

732
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,380
Neither do I.

733
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,260
However, this is how I am going to protect you.

734
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,430
Bi Bi!

735
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,930
Bi Bi, that is enough.

736
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,390
No.

737
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,390
I must free you from that body.

738
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,650
That body is not yours!

739
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,030
This entire shrine is filled with this intense fire energy.

740
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:24,779
If they keep this up,

741
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,910
they will soon be completely drained for they use the energy of water.

742
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,480
Good. We are almost there now.

743
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:51,560
So, I was not the one he was after.

744
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,980
Now,

745
00:55:58,860 --> 00:55:59,990
please leave...

746
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,860
that body!

747
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,240
No, Bi Bi! Please stop.

748
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,990
The two of you should not be fighting now.

749
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,750
That scoundrel is waiting for one of you to die!

750
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,300
- What? - What do you mean?

751
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,260
The glowing pearl.

752
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,720
He is after the glowing pearl!

753
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:27,100
The glowing pearl.

754
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,680
What?

755
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,000
Bi Bi.

756
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,340
Bi Bi!

757
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,800
Bi Bi, it is okay.

758
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,060
No. Bi Bi, no!

759
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,480
Something is wrong with me.

760
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,940
You will be all right.

761
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,450
No.

762
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,160
The glowing pearl...

763
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:47,860
No!

764
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,050
Kang Chul, we must get out of here.

765
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,220
We do not know what might happen now that he has swallowed the pearl.

766
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:11,590
We must hurry.

767
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:41,170
The General of Heaven and Earth has swallowed the glowing pearl!

768
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:56,850
Bi Bi, hang in there.

769
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:11,570
Kang Chul.

770
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,740
Can you put me down?

771
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,500
Sit down.

772
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,880
Bi Bi.

773
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,170
Bi Bi, you will be okay. All right?

774
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,180
I made a complete fool of myself.

775
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:34,840
I foolishly let that blind scoundrel...

776
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,810
trick me.

777
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,100
The King's maternal grandfather...

778
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,480
He has been backing the blind man all this time.

779
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,030
Stop talking.

780
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,030
The glowing pearl... I will be sure to retrieve it,

781
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,530
so please hang in there until then.

782
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,080
Have you ever seen a serpent...

783
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:03,870
without the glowing pearl?

784
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,380
Bi Bi.

785
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,460
I was simply...

786
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,460
trying to protect you.

787
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,550
You were going too far.

788
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,060
It made me sad and scared.

789
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,640
You know, right?

790
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,650
Yes. I know, Bi Bi.

791
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:37,910
Bi Bi.

792
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,700
Bi Bi.

793
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,250
Bi Bi.

794
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,090
Bi Bi!

795
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,170
Bi Bi!

796
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:40,050
Bi Bi!

797
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:01,700
(Special thanks to Song Jae Hee)

798
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,760
(The Haunted Palace)

799
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,639
My heart aches so much.

800
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,560
What is wrong with me?

801
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,770
We finally figured out who is behind the Eight-feet Spirit.

802
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,520
It is Lord Kim Bong In.

803
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,269
That cannot be possible.

804
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:34,690
Yeo Ri must be mistaken.

805
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,860
The General of Heaven and Earth became more powerful.

806
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:40,569
We must hurry.

807
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,990
We will set out as soon as the sun rises tomorrow.

808
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,490
Have that ghost...

809
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,910
kill the king at once!

810
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,709
Once His Majesty goes to sleep,

811
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:50,500
make them leave in secret.

812
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,880
Choi Won Woo was hiding something.
