(Kim Ji Hoon)

00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,300
(The Haunted Palace)

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,129
(All places, organizations, characters,)

6
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,879
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,340
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,390
(Episode 9: 13 Years Ago)

9
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,770
Oh, no.

10
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,190
Oh, please.

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,610
My gosh, please spare me. Oh, no.

12
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,780
No...

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,290
Grandfather, please stop them.

14
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,959
The man might die if they continue.

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,160
No.

16
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,420
He is involved in a vile act of summoning spirits.

17
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,669
He kidnaps young children, starves them to death,

18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,000
and turns them into spirits.

19
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,920
Then he uses those spirits to extort money from people.

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,009
He is the most despicable man there is.

21
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,470
He did it out of desperation to feed himself as he is blind.

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,220
Please stop them now.

23
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,180
You ought to go inside.

24
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,389
You left the Palace to recuperate from an illness.

25
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,980
This is not a good sight for you.

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,150
But...

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,400
I urge you to go inside now.

28
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,740
No...

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,740
My gosh.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,520
A spirit with a heart full of vengeance...

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,060
The Vengeful Spirit...

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,650
My lord!

33
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,110
My lord.

34
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,900
A nasty Vengeful Spirit...

35
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,280
with deep resentment is haunting the royal family.

36
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,490
Wait.

37
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,160
Halt.

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,960
- What did you say? - There is...

39
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,300
a nasty Vengeful Spirit with deep resentment,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,460
haunting the royal family.

41
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,130
You must escape it.

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,010
Or everyone will perish.

43
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,800
You must escape it.

44
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,810
Did you say a spirit is harbouring vengeance...

45
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,860
against the royal family?

46
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,230
Yes.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,689
If you do not drive it away, the young man from earlier...

48
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,820
I mean, every royal heir...

49
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,570
will face peril.

50
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,660
My lord, if you spare my life,

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,289
I will do everything I can to stop the spirit.

52
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,540
That alone...

53
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,830
will not be enough to spare your life.

54
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh, no. Then...

55
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,050
what would move your heart to pardon a lowly shaman like me?

56
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,130
Please tell me what to do.

57
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,300
I hear that your shamanistic skills...

58
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,180
are quite useful.

59
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,430
Never...

60
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,390
Never will I commit such a wretched act again.

61
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,360
So I beg of you. Please spare me.

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,610
Do you think you can...

63
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,110
control the spirit?

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,320
Pardon?

65
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,160
(Episode 9)

66
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,450
Neop Deok?

67
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,330
Yes. Do you remember the abominable shaman?

68
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,499
The old shaman subdued the General of Heaven and Earth...

69
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,920
when the General possessed the late king.

70
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,210
That girl, Yeo Ri, is the granddaughter of the shaman.

71
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,050
I had someone travel to Yongdam Village and confirm it.

72
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,050
Are you telling me...

73
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,760
a mere girl is responsible for ruining our plan?

74
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,980
It should be no trouble...

75
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,979
to eliminate the girl as you did the old shaman.

76
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,400
Yes. Back then, I could.

77
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,149
Please look after the departed

78
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,240
Please put dry clothes on the departed

79
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,779
- My gosh. - What is going on?

80
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,830
No!

81
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,829
Back then, I guided the General to the ocean...

82
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,000
and helped the General swallow the shaman.

83
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,050
But this time around, things will not be so easy.

84
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,930
A serpent...

85
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
who possessed the royal scribe, Yoon Gap,

86
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,600
is by her side.

87
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,810
- A serpent? - Yes.

88
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,690
I have no clue why the serpent is helping the girl.

89
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,270
But because of the serpent, going after her will be difficult.

90
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,740
The Eight-feet Spirit...

91
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,410
killed Shaman Neop Deok too?

92
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,840
How did I miss it?

93
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,670
What a fool I was.

94
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,170
How did I fail to see that?

95
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,890
The fire spread from the candle on the altar.

96
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,220
The flames pushed Grandmother to the ocean.

97
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,930
Grandma!

98
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,100
It was obvious the fire spirit was behind it.

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,650
You were already aware of it, were you not?

100
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,319
This afternoon,

101
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,819
you were shocked to hear...

102
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,280
my grandmother passed away in the Year of the Black Rabbit...

103
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,490
because you had already...

104
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,259
figured it out by then.

105
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,960
I had hoped my speculation would be wrong.

106
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,420
Neop Deok was...

107
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,590
the only shaman who could alleviate the madness...

108
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,390
that tortured my father even if it was temporary.

109
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,170
I...

110
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,970
will kill all of you.

111
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,220
I will wipe out...

112
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,270
the royal bloodline.

113
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,110
Let us go.

114
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
Father.

115
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,410
I thought it was all over.

116
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,240
I did not believe in shamanism.

117
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,160
After that day,

118
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,160
my father returned to the man...

119
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,830
he was once before.

120
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,170
However...

121
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,530
Father.

122
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,600
I denied it for a long time.

123
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,650
But it is clear to me now.

124
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:23,175
That man from that night...

125
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,860
was not my father.

126
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,660
In the end, my father passed away.

127
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,910
So I thought everything was over.

128
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,050
Then my son began...

129
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,470
showing the same symptoms.

130
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,970
What kind of vengeance could be driving the Eight-feet Spirit...

131
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,770
to commit such a monstrous act as this one?

132
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,230
Why...

133
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,570
did you keep this a secret from me all this time?

134
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,070
The bizarre behaviour of the spirit-possessed king...

135
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,450
unsettled the Palace back then.

136
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,620
Even those in power...

137
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,790
showed signs of rising up.

138
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,170
Hence, bringing up the incident from all those years ago...

139
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,170
would cast doubt on the legitimacy of my reign.

140
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,670
Moreover,

141
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,800
a king...

142
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,180
must not trust anyone.

143
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
So my grandmother...

144
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,940
fought for a man who did not trust her...

145
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,100
and ultimately died in vain.

146
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,280
Yeo Ri.

147
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,530
I am the King.

148
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,040
I bear responsibility for everything that happens in this kingdom.

149
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,410
And I shall intervene in every matter.

150
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,290
Come what may,

151
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,170
I will withstand anything...

152
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,340
for the kingdom I long to build.

153
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,630
However,

154
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,930
I cannot speak for the matters...

155
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,970
relating to life and death.

156
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,640
I am ashamed...

157
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,270
and heartbroken to say this.

158
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,780
But I need your help.

159
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,500
I am sorry.

160
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,790
Please excuse me.

161
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,900
I get it now.

162
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,940
The Eight-feet Spirit...

163
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,860
also devoured my grandmother's spirit.

164
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,490
That is why...

165
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,370
she was not able to come to me...

166
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,580
all these years.

167
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,040
I was such a fool.

168
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,710
I was clueless.

169
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,630
Why will you not answer me?

170
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,840
You lied to her and said you killed her grandmother.

171
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,969
Do you regret it?

172
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,349
I do not.

173
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,059
Right? Remember what I told you then?

174
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,729
A snobby girl like her...

175
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,520
ought to get a taste of our power...

176
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,560
and fear us.

177
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,360
My regret lies elsewhere.

178
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,150
All those years ago,

179
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,199
I noticed early on that...

180
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,280
the reeking Eight-feet Spirit had followed...

181
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,910
Neop Deok from the capital.

182
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,910
I wanted to warn Yeo Ri about the Eight-feet Spirit,

183
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,540
but I resented her as she continued to turn me down.

184
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,050
So I did not do so.

185
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,300
I regret not telling her about the Eight-feet Spirit...

186
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,589
when I had the chance.

187
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,719
So what if you did? Do you think she would have...

188
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,679
willingly accepted you as the guardian spirit?

189
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,760
At the very least,

190
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,600
Neop Deok might not have died in vain like that.

191
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,019
And if she did not, Yeo Ri wouldn't need...

192
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,190
to take down the Eight-feet Spirit now.

193
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,940
But...

194
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,070
Kang Chul!

195
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,380
What are you doing here?

196
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,090
It is late. Have you no fear?

197
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,760
Oh, right.

198
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,930
Worrying about each other like this is not allowed between us.

199
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,600
I will go in front of you.

200
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,520
You can follow me.

201
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,900
- Or not. - Why did you not tell me?

202
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,320
- What do you mean? - Why have you kept it a secret?

203
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,410
The Eight-feet Spirit killed my grandma.

204
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,280
It was not you. Why did you not tell me?

205
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,740
You knew everything.

206
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,410
It was not your doing.

207
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,960
How did you find out?

208
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,130
I made it clear he was not to tell you.

209
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,999
Darn that king.

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,670
Why did you not explain it?

211
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,260
You tolerated my resentment, anger, and hatred.

212
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,800
Why did you not say anything?

213
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,180
Because...

214
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,430
I would benefit more from it.

215
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,020
What?

216
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,820
You were only 13 years old back then.

217
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,440
You were too young to even take care of yourself.

218
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,239
But if you irrationally challenged the Eight-feet Spirit...

219
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,740
to save your grandmother after he claimed her spirit,

220
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,280
what do you think would have happened to you?

221
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,739
You would have been eaten by the Eight-feet Spirit too.

222
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,620
And I, who planned to ascend to the skies by using you,

223
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,410
would have lost my chance...

224
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,340
Well, let me finish. I...

225
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,080
You are leaving already?

226
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,750
You got in late last night.

227
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,919
Even my son does not get paid a lot.

228
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,000
I doubt they pay you generously.

229
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,050
Why are you up already?

230
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,419
- I do not need to sleep longer. - I see.

231
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,840
But why are we whispering?

232
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,680
Not to wake my son up?

233
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,800
No.

234
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,310
I have a busy day ahead of me. Bye.

235
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,430
But still. You ought to stay for breakfast.

236
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
Oh, my.

237
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,190
One needs a filling meal to work.

238
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,150
Gap, I did not know you were up.

239
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,410
Then you should have let me know that you were up.

240
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,030
Oh, my.

241
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,700
Look at you.

242
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,870
Are you sleeping with your eyes open?

243
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,170
Oh, dear. Something must have happened between them.

244
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,380
No!

245
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,760
I am not her nanny. Why must I shadow her?

246
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,090
No way.

247
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,100
Yeo Ri found out everything.

248
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,680
She is already willing to do anything.

249
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,479
Now that she knows...

250
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,770
the Eight-feet Spirit killed her grandmother,

251
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,190
I do not know what she might do.

252
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,439
Stay by her side.

253
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,440
If she is in danger, just let me know.

254
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,280
Do you think you can afford to worry about her right now?

255
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,659
I saw clearly...

256
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,120
when you were taking down the evil water spirit, Bang Mak Dol.

257
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,950
That you are not as powerful as you once were.

258
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
What?

259
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,579
Were you watching me?

260
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,880
I am worried sick about you! Come on.

261
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,800
What if you cannot ascend to the skies because of her?

262
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,220
No. I do not want that.

263
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,760
Wait.

264
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,720
If I shadow her, it will be easier to separate them.

265
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,600
Would you truly hate to do it?

266
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,100
Well, yes. I would hate it.

267
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,729
But it will be troublesome for you...

268
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,030
to drag that heavy body of yours to follow her around.

269
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,400
That leaves me with no choice.

270
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
As the younger brother,

271
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,870
I ought to help out my big brother.

272
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,409
Thank you.

273
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,370
Thank you, Bi Bi.

274
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,580
I will count on you.

275
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,960
You are the best serpent.

276
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,260
Had you not come today,

277
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,639
I was prepared to hold you accountable...

278
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,350
for defying a royal order.

279
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,849
Your Majesty.

280
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,390
Have you made up your mind?

281
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,310
I fear that...

282
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,060
I may stand in the way...

283
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,650
of your noble cause.

284
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,650
It troubles me greatly.

285
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,490
I am also held by fear.

286
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,450
I fear that all of my vassals...

287
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,830
may turn their backs on me due to my noble cause.

288
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,209
I also fear I may end up making...

289
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,960
the lives of my people more miserable.

290
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,880
I fear that my people...

291
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,010
may end up getting hurt.

292
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,010
Your Majesty.

293
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,470
Despite my fear, I shall not stop.

294
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,020
So I am asking you to help me.

295
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,910
What are you doing?

296
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,120
Are you upset with me?

297
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,750
What choice did I have?

298
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,550
I am nothing...

299
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,510
but a lowly, pathetic water spirit, dwelling in a well.

300
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,219
Even the mighty serpent, Kang Chul,

301
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,310
struggled to handle the evil water spirit.

302
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,770
Imagine if I had stood up to him.

303
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,480
What do you think would have happened?

304
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,690
Were you there that day?

305
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,480
Well, I was...

306
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,990
because I was worried.

307
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,150
You made me worry!

308
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,490
So what is the matter this time?

309
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,699
- What do you mean? - You are not at Sanguiwon.

310
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,410
Why are you sitting here with a long face?

311
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,750
Come on.

312
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,800
Where is she?

313
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,140
What? Who is that?

314
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,430
So you left the house as if you were being chased?

315
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,390
Because you were scared of facing Kang Chul?

316
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,480
Gosh, not at all.

317
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,150
It is just awkward between us. That is why.

318
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,940
Think about it.

319
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,689
For the past 13 years,

320
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,030
I have lived despising Kang Chul with every fibre of my being.

321
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,570
I never stopped.

322
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,910
I despised him with every breath I took.

323
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,659
I thought he ruined my life...

324
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,250
and was my foe for having killed my grandmother.

325
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,750
But...

326
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,250
he was not the one who killed my grandmother.

327
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,090
Then what am I to do now?

328
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,590
Is it not obvious?

329
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,300
You can stop hating him.

330
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,970
But still.

331
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,990
Are you having second thoughts?

332
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,320
Are you afraid you might fancy Kang Chul?

333
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,830
Second thoughts? As if.

334
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,790
Do not be absurd.

335
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,920
Then why are you blushing?

336
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,339
I am not!

337
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,219
Yes. You are blushing. Your cheeks are red.

338
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,380
No, they are not.

339
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,850
"Soninligi jongsijahae."

340
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,310
It means when one gains by causing harm to another,

341
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,980
they will ultimately bring harm upon themselves.

342
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,150
Excellent job, Your Highness.

343
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,239
Ever since your recovery,

344
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,910
your studies have shown much improvement.

345
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,740
I have been hearing that Royal Scribe Yoon Gap...

346
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,950
has been visiting you in your chambers occasionally.

347
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,170
He must have helped you advance your learning.

348
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,589
Father told me I would find him useful...

349
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,510
as he devoted many years to his studies.

350
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,670
I see.

351
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,970
And the glasses-maker too?

352
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,890
Well,

353
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,760
she is...

354
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,520
As it so happens,

355
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,270
I was curious about how glasses were made.

356
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,230
- I see. - I was...

357
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,810
also fascinated by her crystal stones.

358
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,150
- And... - That is enough.

359
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,740
I take it that His Majesty...

360
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,780
must have told you not to tell anyone about it.

361
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,570
So please do not strain yourself to explain it to me.

362
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,290
What I hate most is...

363
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,830
to see you burdened, Your Highness.

364
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,000
So Aguji was right.

365
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,130
Your Highness, Eunuch Song from the King's Palace has arrived.

366
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,300
Let him in.

367
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,020
What brings you here?

368
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,189
Did Father send you?

369
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,440
Yes, Your Highness.

370
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,320
I was sent to fetch the premier for His Majesty.

371
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,069
You intend to appoint...

372
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,240
Lord Choi Won Woo as First Vice-Premier?

373
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,859
Yes, I do.

374
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,080
What do you think about the idea?

375
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,579
You once said as well...

376
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,750
that he was too great a scholar to spend his days...

377
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,590
in the mountains with only books for company.

378
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,500
Yes, I did.

379
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,050
However, to the royal court, his appointment...

380
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,969
will be interpreted...

381
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,930
as your attempt to advance the slave reform.

382
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,180
Moreover, we have yet to apprehend the individual who committed...

383
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,020
the despicable act against Her Highness, the Queen.

384
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,389
Considering the current state,

385
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,020
if you keep Lord Choi by your side,

386
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,190
those will harbour...

387
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,530
even darker intentions.

388
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,320
I am ready to face them.

389
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,200
I am sure you know it as well as I do.

390
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,039
That my father...

391
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,580
accepted his end to keep me safe.

392
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,840
That day, his mind was sharp which was a rare thing.

393
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,670
He noticed the signs of an uprising.

394
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,920
For my sake,

395
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,890
he willingly ended his life.

396
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,429
Your Majesty.

397
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,020
The slave reform was one of his projects as well.

398
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,190
This is my attempt...

399
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,190
to be a noble king for his sake too.

400
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,900
I need your help.

401
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,400
Your Majesty.

402
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,370
If that is truly your intention,

403
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,830
I, your humble servant, will fully devote myself to this cause.

404
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,040
Your Majesty, Royal Scribe Yoon Gap has arrived.

405
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,420
Yes, let him in.

406
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,250
That is all for you.

407
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,710
I see.

408
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,729
- Hey. - My gosh, what are you doing?

409
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,190
A serpent...

410
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,350
who possessed the royal scribe, Yoon Gap,

411
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,230
is by her side.

412
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,899
- Darn it. - My goodness.

413
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,980
What do you think you are doing?

414
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,530
- Let go of me. - Hey.

415
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,570
I told you to let go of me, Grilled Abalone.

416
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,780
Stop calling me Grilled Abalone!

417
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,380
I told you to keep your lips sealed.

418
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,720
Why did you tell Yeo Ri everything?

419
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,680
I did no such thing.

420
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,089
- What? - I did not know...

421
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,599
that Neop Deok was killed by the Eight-feet Spirit,

422
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,060
to begin with.

423
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,680
But it appears you already knew about it.

424
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,560
That is because...

425
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,189
I am a deity, far more powerful than those of mortal flesh.

426
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,730
But you kept it from Yeo Ri,

427
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,490
so you could protect her.

428
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
You have been worried about her.

429
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,580
That is because...

430
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,079
I need her to ascend to the skies.

431
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,370
You have feelings for her.

432
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,010
Even the mighty serpent...

433
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,260
blushes when speaking of the woman he fancies.

434
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,600
Do not laugh.

435
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,310
Fancy her? As if.

436
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,389
My emotions have been in great disarray.

437
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,310
When thinking about her, I become furious.

438
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,560
I have no idea what she is thinking.

439
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,860
Fine.

440
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,229
Now that she knows...

441
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,439
the Eight-feet Spirit killed her grandmother,

442
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,490
I can see why she is in distress.

443
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,159
But if she were to wail in a way that crushes my heart,

444
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,870
what am I to do about that?

445
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,790
My goodness.

446
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,620
Nothing in this world...

447
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,960
is as fearsome as a woman's tears.

448
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,040
That is the truth.

449
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,130
I used to get very flustered when the Queen cried.

450
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,670
But now I know clearly...

451
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,090
what a man must do at such a time.

452
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,600
What...

453
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,730
is that?

454
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,350
What is it?

455
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,990
Hold her gently...

456
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,950
and listen to her with an open heart and mind.

457
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,300
Hold her gently and listen to her with an open heart and mind?

458
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,550
How can I do that when she will not even look at me?

459
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,619
Goodness. They are still up to it.

460
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,869
What did that fool Gap do...

461
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,000
to upset Yeo Ri?

462
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,170
My brother did nothing wrong.

463
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,460
Yeo Ri is like that because she has a nasty temper.

464
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,840
Darn it.

465
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,220
I was hoping to marry them off this year.

466
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,380
I guess I cannot.

467
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,840
Right?

468
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,510
I think so too.

469
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,009
The love humans feel...

470
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,479
is a momentary thing caused by lust to ensure the species survives.

471
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,609
That means emotions change as easily as you can flip a hand.

472
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,650
No.

473
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,319
Even if human emotions change as easily as you can flip a hand,

474
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,860
there has to be something if it is to change at all.

475
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,280
What is happening?

476
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,330
Does this woman hear me?

477
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,660
I am sure they like each other.

478
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,130
Goodness.

479
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,360
You pricked yourself because you were distracted.

480
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,570
Are you all right?

481
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,240
What are you up to?

482
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,489
Why do you follow me around?

483
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,580
You make it sound like I want to.

484
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,290
Shall I tell you something?

485
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,049
Why Kang Chul lied and told you...

486
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,880
he had killed your grandmother.

487
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,840
Listen.

488
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,430
Kang Chul had always...

489
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,849
looked down on you humans...

490
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,430
and never felt the need to tell them the truth.

491
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,850
How much of the things he said were actually a lie.

492
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,020
Do you not want to know?

493
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,070
For example,

494
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,859
when he said he would vanquish the Eight-feet Spirit.

495
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,990
Why are you telling me this?

496
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,070
What?

497
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,200
Well... Because...

498
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,540
I feel sorry for how you are...

499
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,750
always being deceived.

500
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,460
You do not like me.

501
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,749
Should you be telling me...

502
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,510
what Kang Chul tried to hide?

503
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,130
Does he know too?

504
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,630
You are doing this...

505
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,350
because you want to separate us, right?

506
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,730
Leave.

507
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,900
I hate her. I hate them.

508
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,900
I hate humans so darn much.

509
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,489
And smart ones like her,

510
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,700
I hate so, so, so much more.

511
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,490
Goodness.

512
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,210
I should ascend as soon as possible and stay away from humans.

513
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,300
A feast has set itself before me.

514
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,470
It has been a long time since we met like this.

515
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,220
What made you...

516
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,389
want to see me when you were...

517
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,850
wary of prying eyes?

518
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,519
His Majesty wants to make Lord Choi Won Woo...

519
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,570
the first vice-premier.

520
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,650
Is he insistent...

521
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,570
on reforming the slave bill?

522
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,699
Why did you not do something...

523
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,330
before things got this bad?

524
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,920
When we revolted 13 years ago,

525
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,210
we should have killed him then, when he was Crown Prince.

526
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,840
You are too aggressively enthusiastic.

527
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,299
It was rash of you to try to kill...

528
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,970
Royal Scribe Yoon Gap.

529
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,639
How do you know...

530
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,600
Your clumsy actions...

531
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,900
will come back to hinder us.

532
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,190
You must handle the matter soon.

533
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,370
He is not the Yoon Gap from before.

534
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,409
He acts strangely, as if he is not human.

535
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,410
There is always a way.

536
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,210
From what I heard,

537
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,380
he is a devoted son with great love for his mother.

538
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,730
How did you find...

539
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,980
that man's energy?

540
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,150
It is as weak as a candle in the wind.

541
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,950
Nothing the Minister of War can do...

542
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,780
is strong enough to beat the serpent.

543
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,660
I did not expect that of him.

544
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,709
If we could tie that serpent down...

545
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,459
for a brief moment,

546
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,750
we would be able to...

547
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,340
get rid of Yeo Ri very easily.

548
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Yes.

549
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,760
I need you to influence the Dowager Queen.

550
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,140
For now,

551
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,350
I must stop Choi Won Woo first.

552
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,520
The King will bring someone new into the Palace?

553
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,899
Who is that?

554
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,609
I do not know.

555
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:24,400
However, you will soon find out.

556
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,650
It must be stopped.

557
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:30,659
If that person enters the Palace, the King will gain even more power,

558
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,910
and then you will get no chance...

559
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,210
to avenge poor Prince Young In.

560
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,740
Did you change your mind, then?

561
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,989
Did you not say last time...

562
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,200
that you had no intention of serving the King?

563
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,790
I would prefer to live far away...

564
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:21,079
and spend the rest of my life teaching scholars.

565
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,170
However...

566
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,460
His Majesty is about to start a lonely battle.

567
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,930
I wish to be of some assistance.

568
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,510
- Your Highness. - I was born into a family...

569
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,929
that was noble by birth but had no money at all.

570
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,900
We often visited you to ask for financial aid.

571
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,360
I was embarrassed to be there to ask for help,

572
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,069
so I would walk around the large mansion...

573
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,240
and once, I got lost and found myself in the library.

574
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,990
There, I found a very interesting book.

575
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,120
"Gwangam Chronicles," was it?

576
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,370
Yes.

577
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,629
Your great-great grandfather Lord Choi Gil Sang...

578
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,839
wrote it during the war...

579
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,339
a century ago when he was on the King's entourage.

580
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,129
What are you trying to say?

581
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,220
(Hojong: To guard the King's procession)

582
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,980
I have...

583
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,980
nothing more to lose.

584
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,770
I am left with nothing but the determination...

585
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,940
to ruin the King.

586
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,529
I am saying I do not fear...

587
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,820
the contents of that book coming to light.

588
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,790
But you have a lot to lose, do you not?

589
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,040
If you want to prevent that,

590
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,130
return to Yongdam Village.

591
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,800
That is where...

592
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,050
you are to remain.

593
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,680
(Tongmyeongjeon)

594
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,240
- Is this everything? - Yes.

595
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,030
- Move faster. - Yes, sir.

596
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,330
Hello, my lady.

597
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,119
Is something happening?

598
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,630
Why is everyone packing?

599
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,210
Lord Choi announced he will return to Yongdam Village.

600
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,800
What?

601
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,300
Do not just stand there. Help her pack too.

602
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,720
My lady.

603
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,070
Your Majesty.

604
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,820
Lord Choi just sent this letter.

605
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,820
Lord Choi Won Woo?

606
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,669
My heart is filled with the wish and want to serve...

607
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,590
the greater cause,

608
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,220
but I do not qualify to bear the burden...

609
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,599
of your grand expectations...

610
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,480
and accept your summons.

611
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,980
Send someone...

612
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,819
to bring Lord Choi in.

613
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

614
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,360
No.

615
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,910
I will go myself.

616
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,590
She should be back by now.

617
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,000
Why is she so late?

618
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,860
Lord Choi's daughter, Lady In Seon?

619
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,399
What brings you here, my lady?

620
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,490
Were you...

621
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,530
staying here all this while?

622
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,869
- A paper talisman? - Yes.

623
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,659
The noblemen in the capital...

624
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,450
over the age of 60 all had that talisman.

625
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,540
What talisman was it?

626
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,170
A Haeilbu.

627
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,760
A Haeilbu? With the pig spell?

628
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,670
What is going on?

629
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,219
What lunatic considers us a snake and is using...

630
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,850
a pig spell to ward us off?

631
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,470
Because of something like that,

632
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,939
the great Bi Bi was unable to eat a single noble?

633
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,060
It was not a shoddy piece of work.

634
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,520
I had never felt one like it.

635
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,440
The talisman contained great powers.

636
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,660
You have a visitor.

637
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,660
A visitor?

638
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,210
Young Master.

639
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,670
We meet again after a long while.

640
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,969
My lady thinks it would not be right as a human being...

641
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,219
to go without thanking the person...

642
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,019
who saved her life twice,

643
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,020
and that is why she is here.

644
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,940
You owe me your life?

645
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,110
I saved you?

646
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,110
Back in Yongdam Village, you helped her...

647
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,450
when she had fainted in a fabric store.

648
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,160
And last time, you bumped into her and she fell...

649
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,920
I mean, she almost fell,

650
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,210
but you caught her and saved her then too.

651
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,550
That makes it twice,

652
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,630
she says.

653
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,300
That is not my logic. It is hers.

654
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,760
Yes.

655
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,970
Not to mention...

656
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,389
you even gifted me...

657
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,350
a pretty potted plant.

658
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,020
A potted plant? The one Monk Gaseop gave me?

659
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,900
You know about the plant?

660
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,950
I do not know if you mean the plant I mean,

661
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,490
or if that young master found another and gave it to you.

662
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,750
- Go on, Mak Geum. - Yes, my lady.

663
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,849
I bought them all from the most famed stores...

664
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,270
in the capital.

665
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,310
It is a small token of my gratitude.

666
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,330
Try this as well.

667
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:10,550
Why is that girl living here with you?

668
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,840
"That girl?"

669
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,140
I see.

670
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,440
You took her in out of pity.

671
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,770
You said she was like a sister to you...

672
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,570
whom you grew up with in the same village.

673
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,280
Well, you could call her that.

674
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,450
We are like siblings who grew up together.

675
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,200
That is the extent of our relationship.

676
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,460
You are so kind and generous.

677
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,419
You never know what a person is truly like.

678
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,169
A neighbourhood friend...

679
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,209
can become your baby's daddy.

680
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,250
Stop it.

681
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,420
What a racket.

682
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,180
Girl.

683
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:57,100
If you are not pressed for time to finish that chore,

684
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,019
could you excuse us?

685
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,310
I have something important to discuss with the young master.

686
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,779
Sure.

687
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,070
His mother is taking too long, and I was about to look for her.

688
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,660
Were you? You can go ahead, then.

689
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,800
Taste this now.

690
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,929
What is a rich young lady doing...

691
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,560
in this corner of town?

692
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,810
He saved her life twice?

693
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,650
They seem to know each other well.

694
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,270
But since when?

695
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:48,649
Did he know her as Royal Scribe Yoon Gap?

696
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,990
Or since when Kang Chul took over his body?

697
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,120
Are you Yeo Ri, the glasses-maker?

698
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,580
Yes, I am.

699
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:03,870
I see.

700
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,250
Premier Kim Bong In would like to see you.

701
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:10,090
He needs you to make a pair of glasses for him.

702
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:35,150
I came to get something.

703
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,830
What was that? Why did I have to give such an excuse?

704
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,340
Oh, my.

705
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,100
I really am leaving now.

706
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,180
Make yourself at home and do what you need to do.

707
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,560
Very well. Get going.

708
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,320
Goodness.

709
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,160
This is good too.

710
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:28,789
I will pass.

711
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,670
I am thirsty from eating all the sweets.

712
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,970
My gosh.

713
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,020
Your mother's life lies in my hands.

714
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,019
If you wish to save her,

715
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,610
come to the abandoned house near the slaughterhouse by Seosomun.

716
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,730
They have Yoon Gap's mother?

717
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,700
What does the letter say?

718
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,860
Nothing important.

719
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,580
Right, it is nothing important.

720
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,710
That woman is just Yoon Gap's mother.

721
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,580
She was quite useful, for she was a good cook.

722
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,340
That was all. Nothing more or less.

723
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,130
But why do I feel so uneasy about this?

724
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,350
Right.

725
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,390
The chive jeon that woman made...

726
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,350
was way better than this dashik.

727
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,899
Wait, where are you going?

728
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,610
Something urgent has come up, so I must go.

729
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,690
Wait, my lord.

730
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,690
I am leaving the capital today.

731
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,610
I will return to Yongdam Village.

732
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,870
But before I leave,

733
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,449
there is something I must tell you.

734
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,540
Do not say it.

735
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,710
Why would you say that when you do not even know what it is about?

736
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:55,380
You may seem a little dense, but I know you are quite smart.

737
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:58,260
You must know very well how your life will unfold from now on.

738
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,629
You will marry the man...

739
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,340
your parents choose and have children with him.

740
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,300
Just like your mother and sisters,

741
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,559
you will not be allowed to leave the house on your own.

742
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,480
You will live the life of a decent noblewoman.

743
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,650
Knowing all of that must have deeply frustrated you.

744
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,809
You probably wanted to rebel too.

745
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,530
However, I am not the kind of man you want,

746
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,780
nor am I interested in giving you what you want.

747
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,740
- My lord, I was simply... - Also,

748
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,700
if you think you can boss Yeo Ri around again,

749
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,370
do not show yourself before me again.

750
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,340
My lord.

751
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,410
Where is Lord Choi Won Woo?

752
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,620
Oh, yes.

753
00:49:09,621 --> 00:49:14,119
Lord Choi left with everyone about two hours ago.

754
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,830
Did he say he would go straight to Yongdam Village?

755
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,500
Yes, he did.

756
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:22,590
He left with his entire family, so he cannot have gone too far.

757
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,620
Are you sure Lord Kim Bong In's residence is this way?

758
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:50,580
Yes, I am sure.

759
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,330
Lord Kim is waiting for you.

760
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,499
From what I have heard, Lord Kim Bong In is the premier...

761
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,130
and His Majesty's maternal grandfather.

762
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,500
A man of such stature lives in this remote area?

763
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,760
What is this about?

764
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,560
My goodness.

765
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:04,480
You have got some nerve.

766
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,690
Should I use my palm blast again to blow you away?

767
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,570
You may try, if you think you can do it.

768
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,239
But before that, you will see your mother's blood...

769
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,030
all over the ground here.

770
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:14,580
Will you be okay with that?

771
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,040
You are like a ghost,

772
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,380
but even you are afraid when your mother's life is at stake.

773
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,840
I could not stop thinking how strange it was.

774
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,010
I swear, I stabbed you in the stomach.

775
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,140
I even checked and made sure you were not breathing.

776
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,980
Who are you, really?

777
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,650
Did you cause all this mess because you were curious about that?

778
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,440
If you were that curious, you should have just asked me.

779
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,240
I would have kindly answered your question.

780
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,410
I am...

781
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,580
- Darn it. - Get him!

782
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,570
That ghost jerk.

783
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,360
Behind you!

784
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,710
It was not a shoddy piece of work.

785
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,340
I had never felt one like it.

786
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,890
The talisman contained great powers.

787
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,280
Goodness. What a nuisance.

788
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,679
What are you doing?

789
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,690
Hurry up and run away before these scoundrels wake up.

790
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,510
You lowborn wench!

791
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,650
I cannot summon the wind...

792
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,490
any longer?

793
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,620
It is burning hot!

794
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,170
Bi Bi?

795
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,180
My lord!

796
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,600
Help me!

797
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:06,030
Save me, Kang Chul.

798
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:07,870
Please.

799
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,040
Stop!

800
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:14,750
Your Majesty!

801
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,760
What do you think you are doing?

802
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:25,390
Yeo Ri, are you all right?

803
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,600
Who are you guys?

804
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:49,330
Your Majesty!

805
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:04,130
Your Majesty, are you all right?

806
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,220
Your Majesty, you got hurt because of me.

807
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,850
It is just a minor graze, nothing serious.

808
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,980
Who do you think sent them?

809
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,520
They were skilled swordsmen.

810
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,860
Someone must have found out who she truly is.

811
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,820
We ought to return to the Palace.

812
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,200
Your Majesty.

813
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,490
Then what do you wish to do about Lord Choi Won Woo?

814
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,040
Now that someone else knows her true identity,

815
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,620
I must return to the Palace soon.

816
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,830
We do not know what those scoundrels might do again,

817
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,250
so take Yeo Ri home.

818
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

819
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,720
His Majesty will be okay, right?

820
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,390
He lost quite a bit of blood.

821
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,100
His Majesty will be all right.

822
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,810
But someone is clearly after you and Royal Scribe Yoon Gap.

823
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,020
You should be even more careful from now on.

824
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,190
Yes, I will.

825
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,450
Where did everyone go?

826
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,370
Ma'am?

827
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,630
Kang Chul.

828
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,180
Kang Chul!

829
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:41,400
What on earth happened?

830
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,270
What happened to her?

831
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,320
Should we not go and get a physician?

832
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,280
It is nothing. She is just asleep now.

833
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,200
She is not seriously hurt.

834
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,910
This is not "nothing."

835
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,500
What in the world happened...

836
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,790
You tell me first. What happened to you?

837
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,040
I am fine.

838
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,380
Some stuff happened,

839
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,010
but His Majesty saved me.

840
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:10,720
And he got hurt in the process.

841
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:14,430
The king got hurt while trying to save you?

842
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,540
Where did you go so late at night...

843
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:41,670
You went out to get this? At this hour?

844
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:48,670
- Give me that. - No, I got this.

845
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,180
Stay still.

846
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:57,850
Do not do this.

847
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:59,480
I told you to stay still.

848
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,850
You cannot even clean it properly because it hurts.

849
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,610
My goodness.

850
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,360
I told you not to do this!

851
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:11,490
Do you know what is tormenting me?

852
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:13,870
My grandmother...

853
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,279
must be in agony even now...

854
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,490
for she is trapped by the Eight-feet Spirit.

855
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,790
My heart breaks at the thought of her dying in vain.

856
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,290
Despite my grief,

857
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,540
deep down in my heart,

858
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,210
I was relieved...

859
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,720
because you did not kill my grandmother.

860
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:36,850
A sense of relief...

861
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:40,810
came to me first.

862
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,690
I was greatly relieved...

863
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,650
for I did not need to bear the guilt of being drawn to you this much.

864
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:51,900
Only that thought consumed me.

865
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,070
- You... - How could this be?

866
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,540
No granddaughter could be as awful as me.

867
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,950
(Special thanks to Song Jae Hee)

868
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,970
(The Haunted Palace)

869
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,009
She expressed affection for me for the first time.

870
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,430
For now, I will only think about that.

871
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:02,220
What do you expect from a human?

872
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,429
Is it safe to assume that...

873
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,980
you will continue to help me given your presence here today?

874
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,309
Things seem oddly quiet.

875
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:13,070
Yoon Gap, what on earth are you cooking up?

876
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:14,569
Yeo Ri must never find out.

877
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:17,320
You knew from the very beginning, did you not?

878
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,660
Yeo Ri, the glasses-maker, was not at Sanguiwon.

879
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:24,000
Someone dragged Yeo Ri out of the Palace.

880
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,710
Hey!
