00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,470
(Yuk Seong Jae)

2
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,860
(Kim Ji Yeon)

3
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,990
(Kim Ji Hoon)

4
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,299
(The Haunted Palace)

5
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,009
(All places, organizations, characters, )

6
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,669
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,380
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,259
(100 years ago)

9
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,760
It was the first month in the Year of the Red Rooster.

10
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,680
That winter,

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,190
especially cruel chills swept through our land.

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,360
A biting wind trailed us that day.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,860
The King left the Palace, dressed in a military uniform,

14
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,900
because our enemy had gotten close to our capital...

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,950
and our capital was expected to be seized.

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,790
This was a royal flight of the King.

17
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,260
However, our enemy's pursuit was relentless.

18
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,230
The King's safety was as fragile as the candle flame before the wind.

19
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,480
In this predicament,

20
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,020
a military officer stepped forward.

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,529
Your Majesty.

22
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,939
I am Guard Chun Geum Hwi of the Royal Guard Command.

23
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,240
Please allow me to speak.

24
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,359
There is a village a day's journey to the south.

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,950
It is called Yongdam Village.

26
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,490
It is my hometown.

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,199
It is known as the village where dragons ascend to the sky.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,709
With tall mountains surrounding the village,

29
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,790
the village offers a perfect refuge.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,460
Yongdam Village.

31
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,920
Yes. I must go there.

32
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,560
Halt!

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,680
Easy.

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,019
Your Majesty. I beg you to seek shelter this instant.

35
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,820
The enemy is camped out at the foot of Mount Paltae.

36
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,199
Your Majesty, Mount Paltae stands...

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,280
to the north of Yongdam Village, does it not?

38
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,489
That is correct.

39
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,620
It appears they have figured out our route.

40
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,620
We must change our direction.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,080
But...

42
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,460
where could we possibly go when we have come this far?

43
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,260
Where must I go to save my life?

44
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,549
We must make haste and find a route heading south.

45
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,679
Say that I do.

46
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,100
But what if they follow us? What will I do then?

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Yes.

48
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,520
Send someone...

49
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,400
to hoist the ceremonial flags high over Yongdam Village.

50
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,280
So the enemy thinks that I am heading to that village.

51
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,439
This ruse should give me a chance...

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,070
to slip away unnoticed.

53
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

54
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,120
That is a brilliant idea. We ought to do exactly that.

55
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,250
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

56
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,370
This trickery will put the people of Yongdam Village in danger.

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,590
Please allow me two hours.

58
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,669
I will have them evacuate the village.

59
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,800
Please give me your permission to do so.

60
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,090
You brainless fool.

61
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,969
If they evacuate,

62
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,260
the enemy will get wind of our plan.

63
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,470
A noble cause demands sacrifice.

64
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,270
Your Majesty.

65
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,560
My elderly mother and young son...

66
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,980
live in Yongdam Village.

67
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,650
Please...

68
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,710
Give him a good beating and tie him up,

69
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,500
so he cannot ruin our plan.

70
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,130
Let us go.

71
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,240
- Run! - Over there.

72
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,960
That night,

73
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,960
we lived on,

74
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,130
but they perished in our place.

75
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,460
How shall we atone...

76
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,380
for this cruel sin?

77
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,640
(Episode 13)

78
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,190
Is everything written in this book...

79
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,980
true?

80
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,650
Did Yeonjong the Great...

81
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,700
sacrifice everyone in this village...

82
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,780
to flee from the enemy?

83
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,170
So this man named Chun Geum Hwi...

84
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,420
harbored deep-rooted resentment toward the royal family,

85
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
became the Eight-feet Spirit,

86
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,299
and sought revenge against the royal family.

87
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,390
Your Majesty.

88
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,059
My great-great-grandfather,

89
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,390
in his folly, left behind records of the royal family's shameful act.

90
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,480
I will not seek...

91
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,940
your forgiveness regarding my ancestor's disrespect.

92
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,200
Your punishment will be decided in due time.

93
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,160
You are dismissed.

94
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

95
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,720
("Gwangam Chronicles")

96
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,520
("Gwangam Chronicles")

97
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Yeo Ri.

98
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,320
I apologize.

99
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,110
All of a sudden,

100
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,320
unbearable sadness came over me.

101
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,030
Was Chun Geum Hwi the source of the sadness?

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes,

103
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,580
I believe so.

104
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,920
Chun Geum Hwi...

105
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,800
blames himself...

106
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,840
for the deaths of his family and the people of the village.

107
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,090
The sorrow and guilt...

108
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,140
must have tormented him and broken his heart beyond repair.

109
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,980
Thus, that must have driven him to become a formidable evil spirit.

110
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,400
But the sadness did not originate just from one man.

111
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,650
Dozens of people... No.

112
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,410
It felt like the sadness of many more...

113
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,030
had washed over me all at once.

114
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,870
I finally understand why his energy was so muddled.

115
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,670
The Eight-feet Spirit...

116
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,130
was not alone.

117
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,960
The Spirit was not alone?

118
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,380
What do you mean by that?

119
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,720
The resentment of Chun Geum Hwi...

120
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,180
and the people of Yongdam Village from 100 years ago...

121
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,220
had all been entwined together.

122
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,430
Have you forgotten?

123
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
He is a fire spirit who burned to death.

124
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,400
But it was not mentioned in the book.

125
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,980
It means something more must have happened afterward.

126
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,210
I cannot believe this.

127
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,120
How could a king sacrifice his people...

128
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,210
just to save his own life?

129
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,670
Not all former kings were like the current king.

130
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,640
It gets worse in times of war.

131
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,890
You must have watched everything here...

132
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,430
a century ago.

133
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,150
I did not know the details of his story.

134
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,560
But back then, it was like being trapped in purgatory here.

135
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,069
The people of the village writhed in agony...

136
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,940
as they burned to death.

137
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,070
But those who fled just to save themselves...

138
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,740
were nothing but a vile, dishonorable lot.

139
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,250
That is why...

140
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,460
you loathed humans.

141
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,250
Do you still...

142
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,170
harbor deep hatred against us?

143
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Wait...

144
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,860
Yeo Ri.

145
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,910
Young Master.

146
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,920
Young Master Gap?

147
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,110
What is going on?

148
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,949
What is the matter?

149
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,950
I just saw...

150
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,290
the spirit of Young Master Gap.

151
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,370
- What? - I am certain it was him.

152
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,500
He must have gotten away from the Eight-feet Spirit.

153
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,750
That does not make sense.

154
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,169
He has become more powerful...

155
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,250
after swallowing Bi Bi's glowing pearl.

156
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,880
He would not let go of a spirit he claimed this easily.

157
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,550
Unless he spat it out on purpose.

158
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,390
On purpose?

159
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,390
Why on earth?

160
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,440
(Episode 13: The Return of the Spirit)

161
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,100
The fire energy is particularly strong tonight.

162
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,650
If the Eight-feet Spirit plans to make a move, it would be tonight.

163
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,120
The prince's chambers.

164
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,720
Your Highness.

165
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,139
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

166
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,009
- Oh, no. Your Highness. - Your Highness.

167
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,099
Is it the evil spirit?

168
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,560
Is it here again?

169
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,980
Your Highness.

170
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,860
Do not come near me.

171
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,950
Your Highness.

172
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,580
Your...

173
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
No!

174
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,540
You...

175
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,300
Your Highness.

176
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,060
It is over now.

177
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,850
You are safe.

178
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,660
You are all right now.

179
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,750
Yes.

180
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,400
I have already been praying for half a day.

181
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Young Master Gap will not appear.

182
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,280
Was I mistaken?

183
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,780
That does not make sense.

184
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,989
He has become more powerful...

185
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,070
after swallowing Bi Bi's glowing pearl.

186
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,570
He would not let go of a spirit he claimed this easily.

187
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,330
Unless he spat it out on purpose.

188
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,500
I am certain it was the spirit of the young master.

189
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,249
First, I must find the young master's spirit.

190
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,920
Then I will ask him what happened.

191
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,130
After that, I will help him...

192
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,550
Yeo Ri.

193
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,970
I should help him reclaim his body, but...

194
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,480
Let us go.

195
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,070
My gosh, let us go.

196
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,660
Go where?

197
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,910
Lord Choi's daughter prepared some refreshments for us.

198
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,630
I was told it was you who saved me again.

199
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,550
I am truly grateful.

200
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,850
Oh, no. Yeo Ri was the one who saved you, not me.

201
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,560
Without her help, you could have been in big trouble.

202
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,349
I know.

203
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,940
Mak Geum informed me of that too.

204
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,860
Thank you.

205
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,030
My pleasure.

206
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,199
I requested this meeting...

207
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,110
because there was something I wanted to ask.

208
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,410
I have been cured.

209
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,410
But something does not feel right at home.

210
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,210
My father has not uttered a word with his face all grave.

211
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,710
And my servants have not told me anything.

212
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,670
What on earth happened yesterday?

213
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,630
Oh, that? Your father...

214
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,219
How could we possibly know?

215
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,050
He and I do not know anything.

216
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Why?

217
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,439
By the way, I understand that you grew up in the same village...

218
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,349
and became like good siblings.

219
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,560
But how is it that you are always together?

220
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,570
There are still boundaries between men and women.

221
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,569
What are you doing?

222
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,949
This should make it clear that he and I are more than...

223
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,330
just good siblings.

224
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,540
Did he give you...

225
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,750
the ring?

226
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,710
Then...

227
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,510
Young Master?

228
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,930
The caragana roots are...

229
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,270
beginning to bud.

230
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,610
Oh, yes. Is it not just fascinating?

231
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,319
They are known to bud in spring.

232
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,820
But it seems they are going to bloom even in winter.

233
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,580
Your Majesty. It is me, the Head Eunuch.

234
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,540
Come in.

235
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,180
Your Majesty.

236
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,180
An urgent report has arrived from the Palace.

237
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,990
What is the nature of the report?

238
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Lord Kim Bong In made his escape in the midst of his exile.

239
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,670
But he was found murdered...

240
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,759
on a mountain not far from the capital.

241
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,509
What...

242
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,680
How could that happen?

243
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,349
I can explain why I showed her the ring.

244
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,270
It was not because I had an ulterior motive.

245
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,360
She asked us about the nature of our relationship.

246
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,569
I could not tell her that...

247
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,729
you were my guardian spirit and I, your disciple.

248
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,860
That is why.

249
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,650
All right then.

250
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,660
By the way,

251
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,490
why are you so irritated?

252
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,239
Irritated? No.

253
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,790
I am not irritated.

254
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,410
Do not be angry.

255
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,920
I do not have any interest in Lord Choi's daughter.

256
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,290
None whatsoever.

257
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,669
You say that you are not interested in her.

258
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,510
Yet, you brought the roots to bloom.

259
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
What?

260
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,140
I was not going to bring it up because I did not want to be petty.

261
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,759
You stirred up a warm breeze the other day...

262
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,599
and made the chrysanthemums bloom.

263
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,979
How could you pull the same move with another woman?

264
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,230
And while I am in the room with you?

265
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,650
It was not my doing.

266
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,820
Then how could the caragana roots bloom in the middle of winter?

267
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,650
Actually,

268
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,360
I wish it was my doing too.

269
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,870
What?

270
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,620
This has always been bothering me.

271
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,540
Why did you give me the plant pot?

272
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,420
Why do you think? It is because I adore you.

273
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,329
I am not stupid.

274
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,460
Judging by the auspicious energy it exudes,

275
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,590
it cannot be an ordinary plant.

276
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,309
The energy of a glowing pearl must be...

277
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,599
used up completely...

278
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,729
to settle the resentment of a powerful Vengeful Spirit...

279
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,480
like the Eight-feet Spirit.

280
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,810
But if things go wrong,

281
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,480
there is a chance of losing the glowing pearl to him.

282
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,859
You also saw yourself how your brother...

283
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,950
lost his glowing pearl to him.

284
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,029
The flowers of caragana root are favorable to water.

285
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,119
In other words, they are thought to possess abundant water energy.

286
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,910
By consuming the flowers,

287
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,829
you will be able to endure the battle...

288
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,709
against the Eight-feet Spirit...

289
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,669
without losing your glowing pearl...

290
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,670
until your glowing pearl is fully used up.

291
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,550
But the problem is,

292
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,969
it has been decades since the caragana root...

293
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,850
yielded any flowers. Not even one flower.

294
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,680
But...

295
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,480
that darned caragana root is about to bloom now...

296
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,230
of all times just as the identity of the Eight-feet Spirit...

297
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,020
is revealed.

298
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,740
Hey.

299
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,990
Let us go.

300
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,250
Hey, Grilled Abalone.

301
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,790
Shush.

302
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,580
Good grief. Stop calling me that.

303
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,129
This is not a good time. Come back later.

304
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,629
- Why are you stopping me? - Oh, no.

305
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,510
What distressing words do you intend to speak to His Majesty now?

306
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,759
Go and have a plate of grilled abalones.

307
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,550
Wait. Is something troubling His Majesty?

308
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,140
My gosh.

309
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,310
Lord Kim Bong In was found dead.

310
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,690
What?

311
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,020
His Majesty must be in agony.

312
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,270
Take this serpent somewhere else. Understood?

313
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,620
The Eight-feet Spirit...

314
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,990
got rid of him once he outlived his usefulness.

315
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,889
Have you still not found him?

316
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,180
I apologize, my lord.

317
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,310
Pung San vanished into thin air without leaving a trace.

318
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,649
Even dozens of military officers failed to find him.

319
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,480
You must find him before the military officers do.

320
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,780
After the death of Lord Kwak,

321
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,569
when you had no one else to turn to,

322
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,070
I was the one who took you in.

323
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,739
But if you cannot make yourself useful,

324
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,829
there is no reward in taking you in.

325
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,460
Please calm your anger, my lord.

326
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,130
I will dispatch more men...

327
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,420
and try harder to find him.

328
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,840
Pung San.

329
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,760
Even Lord Kim whose power was said...

330
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,390
to reach the sky was found dead because of him.

331
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,470
Should it become known...

332
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,140
that I was close to him,

333
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,730
I stand no chance of being appointed premier, a vacant position now.

334
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,150
It could even jeopardize my current position.

335
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,280
I will return to the Palace as soon as the morning breaks tomorrow.

336
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,870
I will decide...

337
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,910
on your punishment at the Palace.

338
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,659
Yes, Your Majesty.

339
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,159
However, the punishment would be...

340
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,750
for murdering the book broker, Jang Eon Soo.

341
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,540
It will have nothing to do with "Gwangam Chronicles."

342
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,800
Your Majesty. My great-great-grandfather...

343
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,139
left behind records of the royal family's shameful act.

344
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,310
He committed a disrespectful crime.

345
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,850
Am I to understand that...

346
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,440
you truly do not intend to hold me responsible for his action?

347
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,150
You are right. It is a grievously disrespectful crime.

348
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,990
However,

349
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,240
your great-great-grandfather was truly a loyal subject.

350
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,950
If it were not for Lord Choi Gil Sang,

351
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,540
I would have never known...

352
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,750
that such sorrow and resentment...

353
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,500
lay buried in this village.

354
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,420
- Your Majesty. - Your crime was that...

355
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,220
you neither had any understanding about my nature...

356
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,850
nor trusted me.

357
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,520
Because of that,

358
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,520
you committed a needless act by taking a man's life.

359
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,980
Your Majesty...

360
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,370
If I may,

361
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,790
will you allow me to speak?

362
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,210
Go ahead.

363
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,000
Please allow me to hold a ceremony...

364
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,840
to send off the spirit of Book Broker Jang Eon Soo...

365
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,710
who has become a Vengeful Spirit.

366
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,090
Lord Choi,

367
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,640
you must personally send him off...

368
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,430
to ensure no further troubles arise.

369
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,350
(Jang Eon Soo)

370
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,330
I am fully aware of the injustice done to you.

371
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,040
Therefore, I am comforting you with your favorite food...

372
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,790
and offering prayers on your behalf.

373
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,670
Now, I have softened some karma from your evil deeds.

374
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,290
I pray that you let go of your resentment...

375
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,210
and pass on to a place of solace.

376
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,600
So you understand the injustice done to me?

377
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,980
Do not fool yourself.

378
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,360
You cannot possibly understand it.

379
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,570
Do you honestly believe he will be punished fairly...

380
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,950
for taking the life of a lowly man like me?

381
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,740
I will not go anywhere.

382
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,449
I will make him endure a death...

383
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,330
as painful as my own.

384
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,499
My lord, apologize to him.

385
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,009
Without your apology,

386
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,170
his resentment will not be relieved.

387
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,640
Look at him.

388
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,150
He has no intention of apologizing to me.

389
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,230
Why do you think that is?

390
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,570
Such a noble lord...

391
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,610
would never kneel...

392
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,370
and ask forgiveness from a lowly man.

393
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,080
Then...

394
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,540
speak to him yourself.

395
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,330
What? Again?

396
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,790
No way.

397
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,690
You fool!

398
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:43,690
That girl Yeo Ri grabbed Lord Choi by the throat, Your Majesty.

399
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,780
That is not Yeo Ri.

400
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,940
The Vengeful Spirit took over.

401
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,160
You must die too.

402
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,660
You must die for taking my life!

403
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,539
What do you think you are doing?

404
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,580
Do you know...

405
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,540
how much I suffered in pain and despair?

406
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,460
I cannot leave...

407
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,380
until I crush you myself.

408
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,510
I cannot leave!

409
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,490
I am sorry.

410
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,280
I am sorry.

411
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,000
I am so sorry...

412
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,170
for taking your life.

413
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,310
What...

414
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,770
Father.

415
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,370
I never intended to kill you.

416
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,330
I was afraid.

417
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,540
I was scared.

418
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,830
That is what happened.

419
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,590
For the past five years, living was worse than dying for me.

420
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,340
I will look after your remaining family.

421
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,510
I will make up for what I did for the rest of my life.

422
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,470
Please...

423
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,190
Please forgive me for my wrongdoing.

424
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,150
I beg of you.

425
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,410
Please forgive me.

426
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,390
Wait.

427
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,770
That fool. Get that fool.

428
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,189
Go right now.

429
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,649
Catch him. I want that fool.

430
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,659
That darn...

431
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,740
Get him!

432
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,600
This lowly fool...

433
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,269
is honored to be in the audience...

434
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,900
of the leader of all, the great premier himself.

435
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,900
What are you talking about?

436
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,780
Come on.

437
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,239
Behead this fool.

438
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,870
Yes, my lord.

439
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,490
No, wait.

440
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,170
Did you just call me "the premier?"

441
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,050
Yes, because that is what you will soon become.

442
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,430
This blind fool...

443
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,260
was pretty good at what he did.

444
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,760
Is that true?

445
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:30,849
However, your luck is still as rotten,

446
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,810
and I see a flood coming your way.

447
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,859
What did you say?

448
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,939
Do you know why Lord Kwak died even though he had...

449
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,280
the Haeilbu talisman I wrote?

450
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,870
It was because of the serpent in Royal Scribe Yoon's body.

451
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,739
The serpent has no reason to let you off,

452
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,080
does it?

453
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,500
Do you mean...

454
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,170
I will end up like Lord Kwak?

455
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,290
Listen.

456
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,470
I appeared at the risk of being captured...

457
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,680
to protect you, my lord.

458
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,760
I am saying...

459
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,060
I showed myself before you to make you...

460
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,560
the premier.

461
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,990
Ma'am!

462
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,779
Oh, my goodness. My babies are back.

463
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,789
My gosh.

464
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,409
Have you been well?

465
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,909
Monk Gaseop moved closer to the Palace,

466
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,459
and I was worried you were alone.

467
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,249
Why would you worry about me?

468
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,040
I hope the trip was not too arduous.

469
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,130
Is Yongdam Village still the same?

470
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,420
Yes.

471
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,879
Oh, my gosh. Look at the state you are in.

472
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,549
Tell the King not to give you too much work.

473
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,309
He had a horse and carriage...

474
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,769
and traveled in comfort,

475
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,099
but you must have walked all the way.

476
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,389
Not so loud.

477
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,439
Right.

478
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,980
Right. That fool of a King rode a horse.

479
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,519
Do you know how stingy he is?

480
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,479
He did not buy me a drink after all that work.

481
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,359
Did he not? He is stingy, then.

482
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,989
Did you cook something tasty?

483
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,449
Oh, you must be hungry.

484
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,739
Unpack your things. I will bring you food.

485
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,370
- Let me help. - No, forget it.

486
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,580
Come here.

487
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,540
Let me see...

488
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,550
What?

489
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,550
Why...

490
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,820
Father!

491
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
Gwang.

492
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,870
Did you have a safe trip?

493
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,370
Yes. Have you been well?

494
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,630
Welcome back, Your Majesty.

495
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,390
My Queen.

496
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,020
The Eight-feet Spirit appeared in the prince's chambers?

497
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,309
Yes. I rushed over as soon as I heard...

498
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,190
you had returned because I thought you should know.

499
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,360
Is the prince all right?

500
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,490
The warding stone protected him from the worst,

501
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,949
but the safety measures...

502
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,030
we had put up meant nothing at all.

503
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,450
The Eight-feet Spirit...

504
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,959
has become even more powerful...

505
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,210
since it swallowed the serpent's glowing pearl.

506
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,450
I am even weaker.

507
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,740
I am almost no different from a human.

508
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,830
At this rate,

509
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,710
I may not be able to protect Yeo Ri.

510
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,129
There are laws that dictate how to deal with murderers,

511
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,630
so they cannot be forgiven easily.

512
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,800
Choi Won Woo should be decapitated,

513
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,349
but he accidentally killed the book broker Jang Eon Soo...

514
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,640
who was blackmailing him.

515
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,810
And I also acknowledge...

516
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,310
his loyalty as a subject...

517
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,519
who descended from a man who also...

518
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,320
loyally served his King.

519
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,490
I will reduce his sentence.

520
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,660
He shall be flogged 50 times...

521
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,159
and fined ten nyang.

522
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,239
(Maejang: A fine a murderer had to pay...)

523
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,950
(that was used to pay for the victim's funeral)

524
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,500
What is the matter?

525
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,750
Is the punishment too heavy?

526
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,960
No, Your Majesty.

527
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,800
Compared to the despicable crimes I committed,

528
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,720
the punishment is too light.

529
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,560
Thank you for your immeasurable grace.

530
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,200
Father.

531
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,660
Father.

532
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,790
I am all right.

533
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,330
Do not worry about me and go home.

534
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,289
Take her ladyship home.

535
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,550
I will. My lady...

536
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,420
Let us go.

537
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,220
My lord...

538
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,150
Scribe Yoon?

539
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,950
The caragana root plant?

540
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,659
I did bring it with me to the capital.

541
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,040
Your energy must feed that plant.

542
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,500
It very rarely blooms, but it did so...

543
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,250
in your presence.

544
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,920
That is because...

545
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,419
I watered it with care, made sure it saw sunlight,

546
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,680
and looked after it with love.

547
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,550
It was a gift from you, after all.

548
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,560
The day the flowers fully bloom,

549
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,810
you must alert me.

550
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,180
Why is that?

551
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,230
The thing is,

552
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,230
the flower buds appeared many days ago,

553
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,650
but they have not bloomed.

554
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,820
Yet, they did not wither either.

555
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,160
It is as if they froze.

556
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,830
Why would you ask me about it?

557
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,330
What does that plant mean to you?

558
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,430
(Chun Geum Hwi)

559
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,390
Your Majesty. This identification tag...

560
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,650
belongs to the Eight-feet Spirit.

561
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,280
Chun Geum Hwi is the Eight-feet Spirit's name.

562
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,860
He was on the list of newly appointed...

563
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,360
military officers during Yeonjong the Great's time.

564
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,580
You will host a ritual to send the spirit to the afterlife?

565
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,950
Yes.

566
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,159
I saw how you sent off the spirit...

567
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,580
of book broker Jang Eon Soo.

568
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,460
I thought you would need an identification tag,

569
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,789
so I had a new one made.

570
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,549
(King's bodyguard)

571
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,920
I learned a lot from Choi Won Woo's experience...

572
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,430
and what happened afterward.

573
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,390
My ancestor...

574
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,640
brought upon the death...

575
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,599
of Chun Geum Hwi, his family,

576
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
and the innocent villagers.

577
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,109
I wish to hold a ritual for them.

578
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,319
(Cheondojae: A ritual to send spirits over)

579
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,360
I will also...

580
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,610
ask for forgiveness...

581
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,780
from the bottom of my heart for what happened.

582
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,330
Can you do that for me?

583
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,830
I am too young and inexperienced to do it alone.

584
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,630
Monk Gaseop must lead the ritual.

585
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,090
Very well. Arrange that for me.

586
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,920
The cheondojae's purpose...

587
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,510
is to console the spirits so they can move on.

588
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,430
It would be better if serpent Kang Chul were absent.

589
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,560
What?

590
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,890
What do you mean by that, Yeo Ri?

591
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,650
What if the Eight-feet Spirit causes trouble during the ritual?

592
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,780
Is he not the only being who can take on the evil thing?

593
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,820
That is true.

594
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,370
For His Majesty's sake at least,

595
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,910
Kang Chul the serpent must be present.

596
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,370
But...

597
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,710
Nothing will go as planned without me.

598
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,460
Do not worry.

599
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,289
I insist on seeing...

600
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,840
how the despicable spirit ends up.

601
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,970
I will be present.

602
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,680
Ten days from now...

603
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,470
is the 100th anniversary of the Eight-feet Spirit's death.

604
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,640
All purging rituals are banned within the capital,

605
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,440
so it shall be carried out...

606
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,520
at Jinseung Temple that is beyond the capital.

607
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,070
Prepare everything you need.

608
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

609
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,660
Ten days from now is the 100th anniversary?

610
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,660
Darn it.

611
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,540
Why is everything going so perfectly?

612
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,250
The Eight-feet Spirit will be banished soon...

613
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,710
now that the King is so determined.

614
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,670
It will really work this time.

615
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,260
My grandmother failed to send the spirit over...

616
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,640
because she did not know its identity.

617
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,010
You saw for yourself...

618
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,519
that when Lord Choi apologized sincerely,

619
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
the One-legged Spirit was cleansed.

620
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,730
The King himself of all people is willing...

621
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,230
to apologize to the Eight-feet Spirit.

622
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,110
Even his anger and vengefulness will dissipate.

623
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,780
What are you trying to say?

624
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,240
I am saying...

625
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,490
you do not need to try so hard too.

626
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
What?

627
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,540
You did not...

628
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,450
want to come here at all.

629
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,920
You did only because I came.

630
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,540
I am grateful for everything...

631
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,130
you did for me already.

632
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,880
You went on your knees to ask me to help catch the Eight-feet Spirit.

633
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,509
Now you want me out?

634
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,930
And let you...

635
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,600
face the Eight-feet Spirit alone without your warding stone?

636
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,020
Do you even think that is possible?

637
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:55,890
Well...

638
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:57,850
I mean...

639
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,270
Yeo Ri.

640
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,320
What are you planning?

641
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,960
Glasses-maker Yeo Ri.

642
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,500
The Dowager Queen asked for you.

643
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,090
The Dowager Queen?

644
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,430
I called you here because I wanted to ask you something.

645
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,800
You accompanied the King on his recent excursion.

646
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,430
Yes, Your Highness.

647
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,390
The Eight-feet Spirit, is it?

648
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,810
Did you identify the evil spirit?

649
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,980
That is...

650
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,740
That is not for me to say.

651
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,360
Forgive me.

652
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,160
Then...

653
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,080
can you answer me this?

654
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,260
My son Young In.

655
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,800
Where is his spirit?

656
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,180
Did he cross Samdo Stream and into the other world?

657
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,560
His Highness Prince Young In...

658
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,240
was swallowed by the Eight-feet Spirit.

659
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:38,950
My dear Young In.

660
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,840
Because of me, he cannot even rest in peace after death.

661
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,630
That evil spirit...

662
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,860
Your Highness.

663
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,030
I am a glasses-maker,

664
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,200
but I can see spirits.

665
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,080
A spirit who has been frequenting the Queen's Palace...

666
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,620
for years tells me...

667
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,580
that Prince Young In's belonging he cherished very much...

668
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,920
still remains in his chambers.

669
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,760
Something he cherished?

670
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,050
Yes.

671
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,220
If you pray for his soul...

672
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,560
with all your heart in front of that thing,

673
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,890
it will help him break free from the Eight-feet Spirit.

674
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:57,200
Your Highness, we will look for it.

675
00:44:58,410 --> 00:44:59,950
I am afraid you might hurt yourself.

676
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,450
- You should search the room. - Yes, my lady.

677
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,250
We already got rid of His Highness' belongings.

678
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:36,570
Your Highness.

679
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,320
They are...

680
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,450
They are the pouches...

681
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,460
you made and gifted him every January.

682
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,960
Yes.

683
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,630
They are.

684
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,260
I was concerned evil ghosts might cause him harm,

685
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:58,510
so I gave him these.

686
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,470
His Highness truly cherished them.

687
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,520
He said he could feel your warmth from them.

688
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,710
I cannot believe you told such a lie.

689
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,579
If it were possible...

690
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,750
to break free from the Eight-feet Spirit by praying,

691
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,050
all the souls eaten by that jerk would be free by now.

692
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,930
I said that because I thought...

693
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,220
she might fall into a bottomless pit if she did not pray.

694
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Also,

695
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,430
there is nothing more powerful...

696
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,890
than a mother's earnest prayer.

697
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,610
We cannot say it will not be effective at all.

698
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,740
Hey, why are you crying? What did I do?

699
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,490
Do you think my mother...

700
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,660
earnestly prayed for me as well?

701
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:08,790
I truly wished to see my mother before I died,

702
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,040
but the chief medical officer did not let me.

703
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,260
He said he could not send every eunuch home...

704
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,800
because of a mere cold.

705
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,440
You miss your mother.

706
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,310
That is why you have been hovering around the Dowager Queen.

707
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:35,690
Yes.

708
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,360
I have to go to Sanguiwon.

709
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,320
Would you wait by the well?

710
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,810
I bought these a while ago. I can finally give you these.

711
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,100
They are yours. Try them on.

712
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,320
They fit me perfectly!

713
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,910
You could not go because you were shoeless. Am I right?

714
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,500
Wear those shoes and go to your mother.

715
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,580
She must be waiting for you.

716
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,970
("Gwangam Chronicles")

717
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,810
You have a depressing face to begin with.

718
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:57,560
Now, it looks even more depressing. What an eyesore.

719
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,440
Goodness. When did you come back?

720
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:02,900
More importantly, what did you say just now?

721
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,609
How dare you say such a thing...

722
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:09,079
about His Majesty's radiant face? Such insolence.

723
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,700
He has been looking that depressed for days.

724
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,910
- Should I keep ignoring it? - Goodness.

725
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:15,870
Hey, Kang Chul.

726
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,000
It did not surprise me at all.

727
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,710
Did you think a spirit with such deep resentment...

728
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,840
would not have a story like that?

729
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,800
All my life,

730
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,850
I have been proud of my roots and my royal blood.

731
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,390
And I understood the grave weight I had to bear,

732
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,690
so I tried my very best...

733
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,740
to become a king who befits that.

734
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:46,660
But it turns out...

735
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,240
that I built a tower on top of a sand castle.

736
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,630
Now that I have tried living inside a human body,

737
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:02,500
I realized that a human body is a sinful ground in and of itself.

738
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,640
To satisfy their bodily desires,

739
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:10,680
they get greedy for good food,

740
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:14,559
nicer clothes, and a better home.

741
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,390
They obsess over success.

742
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,690
They become obsessed with money.

743
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,610
What are you saying, all of a sudden?

744
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,730
However,

745
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,610
not all humans are like that.

746
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,620
There are some humans who value other things more...

747
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,870
than such trifling bodily desires,

748
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,330
although I have only come across a few of them.

749
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:40,170
That is why a king exists.

750
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,210
If I teach my people what is right and what they should truly value...

751
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,260
while putting people first,

752
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,090
they will learn to curb their greed...

753
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,220
and eventually enjoy peace...

754
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,180
I hear you, but do you truly think that will work?

755
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,480
About the Public Slave Reform Bill you showed me.

756
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,860
You said, "Why waste your energy when life is short?"

757
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,070
You criticized me like that.

758
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,530
I trust that you will achieve that great goal of yours...

759
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:14,830
for you are one of those rare humans...

760
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,960
I have met from time to time.

761
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,380
Says...

762
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,510
this great and mighty Kang Chul, so you can believe it.

763
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,080
I lost everything.

764
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,420
My body,

765
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:09,670
my life,

766
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,180
and everyone around me.

767
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,640
I lost everything.

768
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:20,350
Yes.

769
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,690
You must be sad and resentful.

770
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:27,480
Let your resentment build up.

771
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,190
That is the way it should be.

772
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:33,240
This way, you will obediently listen to me.

773
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:57,600
I hid from the soldiers and came here...

774
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,810
to protect you, my lord.

775
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:06,440
To make sure you can become the next premier.

776
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,270
Then,

777
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,610
what do you need me to do?

778
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,910
Just take down Royal Scribe Yoon Gap.

779
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:22,120
Then I, Pung San, will take care of the rest.

780
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,080
I followed along as you said you would treat me to a delicious meal.

781
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,250
Why did you call me here?

782
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,050
As you know, this country is in a crisis.

783
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,680
You are His Majesty's most trusted subject.

784
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,100
So, I wished to get to know you better,

785
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:43,600
and I thought we could discuss politics too.

786
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,020
So, in other words,

787
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,690
you are fawning over me so that...

788
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,940
I would put in a good word for you with the king?

789
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,399
The premier position is vacant now.

790
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,530
That must be what you are after.

791
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,320
How dare you!

792
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,490
You truly are testing my patience.

793
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:06,830
That serpent will not go easy on you.

794
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:11,630
I should hold my tongue. He said he was a serpent.

795
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,550
Let me see.

796
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,970
Oh, I know.

797
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,759
You are that punk who was always glued to Kwak Sang Chung...

798
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,890
like fish sludge.

799
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,850
Even if this might send me to an early grave,

800
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,520
I cannot hold back any longer!

801
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,530
Where do you think you are going in the middle of drinking together?

802
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:41,450
Pung San asked me to buy him as much time as possible.

803
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,790
Why did you bring me here?

804
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,960
Well...

805
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:48,620
That is because...

806
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,329
He is not home yet?

807
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,330
That is right.

808
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,540
Do you think the two of you perhaps missed each other on the way?

809
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,620
Yes, I guess so.

810
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
What is going on?

811
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:17,920
He was nowhere to be seen, so I assumed he went home.

812
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,300
Who...

813
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,340
My goodness. Hold on.

814
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,010
My gosh. What happened?

815
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:26,850
I believe he drank a little too much.

816
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,890
This happens very often at our gisaeng house.

817
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,440
Goodness. He does not even reek of alcohol.

818
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:37,650
What does he mean he drank too much?

819
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,900
My poor child.

820
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,370
My gosh.

821
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,830
He is burning up.

822
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:51,660
Stay here and keep an eye on Gap.

823
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,710
- I will go and get a physician. - Sure.

824
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,819
That serpent's powers must have become weak...

825
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,400
now that the energy of water is gone.

826
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,360
The General of Heaven and Earth has swallowed the glowing pearl,

827
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:28,660
so he can now easily subdue that serpent.

828
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,700
You woke up. Are you all right?

829
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:11,660
You were burning up all night.

830
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:13,410
You must be thirsty.

831
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,040
Here, have some water.

832
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,050
Yeo Ri.

833
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,340
Yes.

834
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,680
It is I.

835
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:34,890
Young Master Gap.

836
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,350
My gosh, Gap.

837
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,440
You woke up.

838
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,360
So? Is your fever gone?

839
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,240
Oh, boy.

840
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,240
Mother.

841
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,710
What did you say?

842
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,620
Yes, Mother.

843
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,290
It is I.

844
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,340
It is I, Gap.

845
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,970
Oh, gosh.

846
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:11,430
My goodness.

847
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:13,560
Gap.

848
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,520
My gosh. Gap, is it really you?

849
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:18,890
Oh, my!

850
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,150
My goodness!

851
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,110
Oh, my.

852
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:29,199
My dear child!

853
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,120
You are back! My dear child, Gap.

854
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,619
I am so proud of you. My goodness.

855
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,660
His soul is back.

856
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,710
His soul...

857
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,880
- has returned to his body. - Thank you...

858
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,709
- He is back. - Thank goodness.

859
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:46,050
Thank you!

860
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,050
Then what about Kang Chul?

861
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:53,010
Where has Kang Chul gone?

862
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,560
(Special thanks to Lee Kyu Han and Song Young Kyu)

863
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,739
(The Haunted Palace)

864
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,910
Something must have happened.

865
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,580
What if Kang Chul ends up like Bi Bi? I am terrified.

866
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,039
I have returned...

867
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,880
because there is something I failed to tell you before.

868
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,920
How about we live happily ever after together?

869
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,010
My treasured subject, Yoon Gap, has returned.

870
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,179
The moment my body touched your royal body,

871
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,299
a sharp pang of unbearable pain...

872
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,970
- Yeo Ri. - Kang Chul?

873
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:39,099
You will not be able to continue to stay in that body.

874
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,060
Pour this over the warding stone the king has.

875
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,939
Your Majesty, please forgive this disloyal subject of yours.

876
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:46,820
Young Master, no.
