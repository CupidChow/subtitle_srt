(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,300
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,650
He is not here.

9
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,690
There is no trace of him in the house.

10
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,820
Where on earth...

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,280
did Kang Chul go?

12
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,160
You were burning with a high fever last night.

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,000
I wish you would take a day off. Must you go back to the Palace?

14
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,380
Our country will not collapse simply because you took a day off.

15
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,920
Could you stay with your mother a little longer?

16
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,880
I must meet with His Majesty.

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,299
Let us go, Yeo Ri.

18
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,890
Yes.

19
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,430
I am off to work, Mother.

20
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,520
All right.

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,860
Oh, my. That is my son, Gap.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,650
It is him indeed.

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,410
(Episode 14)

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,790
I cannot believe this.

25
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,710
It truly is Young Master Gap.

26
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,750
His gaze has changed.

27
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,340
Just like I had hoped,

28
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,170
Young Master Gap...

29
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,760
has returned.

30
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,060
Yeo Ri.

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,140
Thank you.

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,600
Pardon? What do you mean?

33
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,400
You looked after my mother.

34
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,190
You also kept my body safe.

35
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,820
I do not...

36
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,240
deserve the credit.

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,700
Yes. He was the one.

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,700
Was it an evil deity named Kang Chul?

39
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,540
Young Master, what happened?

40
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,500
The Eight-feet Spirit had claimed your spirit.

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,079
How...

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,330
I do not know either.

43
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,460
The realm beyond the living was nothing but a hazy, uncertain place.

44
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,090
So clarity remained clouded.

45
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,510
However,

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,310
there is one thing I know for sure.

47
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,810
What is it?

48
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,350
I have returned...

49
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,150
because there is something I failed to tell you before.

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,359
When I sought you out,

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,240
the royal family stood on the brink of a calamity,

52
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,620
and seeing His Majesty in such torment...

53
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,080
stirred a great sense of urgency in me.

54
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,039
Once we arrived in the capital,

55
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,250
I was going to tell you everything.

56
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,460
But I deceived you.

57
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,420
I put you in harm's way into the Eight-feet Spirit's grasp.

58
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,880
I am sorry, Yeo Ri.

59
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,510
Perhaps,

60
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,640
I fought so hard to save you...

61
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,520
to hear this apology from you.

62
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,730
I am truly happy that...

63
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,990
you have returned.

64
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,130
This...

65
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,340
does not belong to me.

66
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,350
Oh, that...

67
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,930
I gave it to someone else.

68
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,480
I see.

69
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,770
Your Majesty.

70
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,230
I, your unworthy subject, seek your forgiveness.

71
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,690
I failed to complete the task you had given me.

72
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,860
Forgive me for this late return.

73
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,529
This is Royal Scribe Yoon Gap.

74
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,199
What do you mean?

75
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,119
Then Kang Chul the serpent no longer holds his body?

76
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,159
Am I to understand that this is truly Scribe Yoon?

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,250
And that he switched out?

78
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
Yes.

79
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,550
Yoon Gap...

80
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,510
has returned?

81
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,760
Your Majesty.

82
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,720
I am a nobody,

83
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,850
but I wanted to become kindling...

84
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,270
and offer what little assistance I could.

85
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,020
But I failed to do so.

86
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,320
It really is...

87
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,820
you, Yoon Gap.

88
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,120
My treasured subject, Yoon Gap,

89
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,789
has returned.

90
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

91
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,920
It is me.

92
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,300
Your unworthy subject...

93
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,550
has finally returned.

94
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,970
Gap.

95
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,850
Your Majesty, are you all right?

96
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,020
Oh, no. Your Majesty.

97
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,900
- Gosh. - Oh, my goodness.

98
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,319
I saw him behave disrespectfully toward you so many times that...

99
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,950
I did not react fast enough.

100
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,570
How dare you?

101
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,570
I apologize, Your Majesty.

102
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,740
The moment my body touched your royal body,

103
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,080
a sharp pang of unbearable pain shot through me. So...

104
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,710
How could that be?

105
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,290
Your Majesty, it is because of the warding stone.

106
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,920
The warding stone?

107
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,970
Here it is.

108
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,060
This stone drives off spirits.

109
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,850
I found out about this stone thanks to Yeo Ri.

110
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,859
Thanks to this warding stone,

111
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,110
also known as the Dragon King's stone,

112
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,570
the Eight-feet Spirit...

113
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,820
was incapable of attacking me all this time.

114
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,660
The warding stone?

115
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,990
The Dragon King's stone?

116
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,540
That was the reason.

117
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,210
(Episode 14: The Warding Stone)

118
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,130
But you told me this stone warded off spirits.

119
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,720
Why is he reacting to this stone when he is alive?

120
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,550
The dead spirit has returned to his body,

121
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,890
but his lifeline was already severed once.

122
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,190
Thus, he cannot get close to the warding stone.

123
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,610
Anyway, your return truly pleases me.

124
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,370
You were killed while carrying out my command.

125
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,580
Imagine the sorrow I must have felt for you.

126
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,670
I was genuinely sorry.

127
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,790
I could not stop feeling so.

128
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,460
Your Majesty.

129
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,360
What do you think of the completed Public Slave Reform Bill?

130
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,690
Your Majesty.

131
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,200
This is truly impressive.

132
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,160
By filling the ranks of village slaves with commoners,

133
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,489
you eliminated the distinction between those two groups.

134
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,620
So...

135
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,210
you considered the trouble of the people and reformed justly.

136
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,500
The faction against the reform has been dissolved.

137
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,670
I wholeheartedly believe your reform will be achieved.

138
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,380
Do you truly think so?

139
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

140
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,980
I trust that you will achieve that great goal of yours...

141
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,230
for you are one of those rare humans...

142
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,820
I have met from time to time.

143
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,570
My gosh.

144
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,700
That darn serpent.

145
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,040
While you were away,

146
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,220
His Majesty was greatly burdened.

147
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,640
You might find the stares of the people uncomfortable.

148
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,060
Rumours that you lost your mind spread all over the Palace.

149
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,940
My gosh.

150
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,560
By the way, are you sure you will be all right?

151
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,399
The owner of the body changed overnight.

152
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,820
I heard you had a high fever throughout the night.

153
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,030
His Majesty also said that...

154
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,990
you should not overdo yourself.

155
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,660
I am all right.

156
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,700
Thank you, Head Eunuch.

157
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,120
What?

158
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,710
All right.

159
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,540
Yes. That is right.

160
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,010
I am the Head Eunuch indeed.

161
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,379
Oh, my. Hold on.

162
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,970
Should I go to a gisaeng house and eat grilled abalones for dinner?

163
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,469
If he was going to leave, he ought to have said goodbye.

164
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,020
That darned serpent.

165
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,310
He is not listening, is he?

166
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,150
Go ahead, and call me Grilled Abalone.

167
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,040
Eight-feet Spirit.

168
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,550
It was your doing.

169
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,900
I pray to seek your help and summon him.

170
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,700
Let there be peace.

171
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,460
The pain is gone, is it not?

172
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,390
I called you here, so I could get rid of your pain.

173
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,930
You are...

174
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,810
the evil spirit's henchman.

175
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,390
I have nothing to say to you.

176
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,810
How does it feel to reclaim your body?

177
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,270
Are you not upset...

178
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,070
about everything you have lost to him?

179
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,070
You will not be able to continue to stay in that body.

180
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,580
It will not last long.

181
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,420
Pour this over the warding stone the King has.

182
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,959
Then the General of Heaven and Earth...

183
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,630
will help you claim your body for good.

184
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,670
What...

185
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,300
happens if I pour this over the warding stone?

186
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,050
What will happen to His Majesty?

187
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,010
Why are you asking me such useless questions?

188
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,640
Do what I say, and you can forever possess that body.

189
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,840
Do you think I will fall for your trick?

190
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,050
I would rather choose...

191
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,600
to turn into ashes than harm His Majesty.

192
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,440
You still have not been able to find him?

193
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,990
No.

194
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,990
I thought Kang Chul would be at the valley he frequented.

195
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,780
He was not there either.

196
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,829
It is bizarre enough...

197
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,119
for the spirit of a dead man to return to his body...

198
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,750
and come back to life.

199
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,459
It is even more peculiar...

200
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,500
for someone so self-assuring like him would suddenly vanish.

201
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,590
Something must have happened to him.

202
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,970
Kang Chul is not the type to back down this easily.

203
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,640
His affection for you was profoundly deep.

204
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,020
I am scared that...

205
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,180
Kang Chul would end up like Bi Bi.

206
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,560
I am deeply scared.

207
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,750
- Mother. - Yes.

208
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,829
You must be exhausted. You ought to go to your room.

209
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,830
I am not exhausted.

210
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:31,460
I had so much energy all day long. I am not even sleepy.

211
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,090
Mother.

212
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,340
I should go.

213
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,050
I will.

214
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,470
I just worry that...

215
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,010
you might be gone while I sleep.

216
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,969
Get some sleep.

217
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,850
I will leave after I look at you a little bit longer. Lie down now.

218
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,860
You will not be able to continue to stay in that body.

219
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,530
It will not last long.

220
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,370
Go to sleep.

221
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,480
What kind of guardian spirit is this?

222
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,530
How could he abandon his disciple...

223
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,650
and disappear without telling me?

224
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,610
Darn you, you evil deity.

225
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,120
Yes. I will do whatever I want now.

226
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,870
So show yourself now and get angry at me.

227
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,620
Yell at me and lecture me...

228
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,290
how I ought not to say such things to my guardian spirit.

229
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,259
Even if you manage to save Yoon Gap's spirit...

230
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,840
and bring him back to life,

231
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,679
nothing will change until I ascend to the sky...

232
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,880
as a dragon.

233
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,850
No matter how deeply you care for him,

234
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,680
I will never...

235
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,520
let go of you.

236
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,400
You said you would never let go of me.

237
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,230
How could you disappear without so much as a word?

238
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
I...

239
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,850
Yeo Ri.

240
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,490
Yeo Ri. I am right here.

241
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,330
Oh, how I curse you, Yoon Gap.

242
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,410
Let go.

243
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,580
Let go.

244
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,720
No. You cannot go.

245
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,550
I cannot let you go to Yeo Ri.

246
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,050
I cannot lose Yeo Ri to you for good.

247
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,810
Come on, let go.

248
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,560
Yeo Ri is calling for me.

249
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,900
Kang Chul?

250
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,030
I cannot let you go.

251
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,860
Darn it. I must go.

252
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,110
No.

253
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,740
What do you mean no?

254
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,660
Yeo Ri.

255
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,200
Kang Chul?

256
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,540
No, Yeo Ri.

257
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,580
It is me.

258
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,670
Young Master.

259
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:03,920
Come on. This jerk is unbelievable.

260
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,550
What?

261
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,140
What?

262
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
Oh, my.

263
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
My goodness.

264
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,940
It is my body. It belongs to me.

265
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,310
Do not move it as you please.

266
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,900
Kang Chul...

267
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,070
was in the young master's body with him?

268
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,900
How could this happen?

269
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,650
How dare you claim someone else's body?

270
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,990
Get out...

271
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,910
of my body at this instant.

272
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,660
Come on. If I could, I would have done it long ago.

273
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,040
Do you think I am staying...

274
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,830
in your fragile body because I want to?

275
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,750
Did you think I did not know you grabbed Yeo Ri's hand...

276
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,460
with this hand?

277
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,170
My gosh. It is not like I can grab her hand with my foot.

278
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,970
A scholar must always keep a neat appearance.

279
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,390
But you turned my garment into rags.

280
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,310
You must have eaten so many sweets.

281
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,970
Many of my teeth have rotted away within a few months.

282
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,560
The first step of being a good child is taking good care of one's body.

283
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,020
You defiled the body my mother bestowed upon me at birth.

284
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,810
How dare you be so brazen?

285
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,939
Did you hear that?

286
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,650
He failed to see that I prevented his body from rotting away.

287
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,279
He keeps prattling on like a petty scribe that he is.

288
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,739
All you do is just nag...

289
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,080
- and nag. - Stop it.

290
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,420
Yeo Ri.

291
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,420
That was not intended for you, Young Master.

292
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,000
Anyway, you must stop fighting him too.

293
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,550
This is not the time for you two to bicker like this.

294
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,140
Yeo Ri is right.

295
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,770
That tenacious evil spirit must have released you for a reason.

296
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,430
Why on earth did he let you go? What is he plotting?

297
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,820
Young Master?

298
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,490
You could not keep your mouth shut earlier.

299
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,040
Why will you not say anything? Has the wind stolen your words?

300
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,410
You...

301
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,460
What on earth are you plotting?

302
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,220
My gosh.

303
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,640
That darn serpent.

304
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,810
I thought he would be gone for a few days.

305
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,600
Why did he wake up so soon? Oh, darn.

306
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,609
I offer my prayers to invoke the spirit of fire

307
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,030
I offer my prayers to invoke the spirit of fire

308
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,030
Kang Chul.

309
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,450
Kang Chul!

310
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,180
Kang Chul and Young Master Gap are sharing the same body.

311
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,430
How could this be?

312
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,060
I have no doubt this is the Eight-feet Spirit's doing.

313
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,440
It seems he is using...

314
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,440
the young master to scheme something.

315
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,650
What must I do?

316
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,400
That darn serpent.

317
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,080
Stop.

318
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,090
Stop it.

319
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,920
This does not belong to me.

320
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,930
Oh, that...

321
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,010
I gave it to someone else.

322
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,140
No...

323
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,770
No.

324
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,490
Surely, nothing happened overnight, right?

325
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,260
My gosh.

326
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,310
I reckon Gap is indeed back to his old self.

327
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,270
Look at this. He neatly folded the blankets.

328
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,770
Gap has always been this tidy.

329
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,689
He was only messy when he was not himself.

330
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,230
By nature, he is neat and tidy.

331
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,739
The warding stone.

332
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,030
Yeo Ri, what is wrong?

333
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,870
You look pale.

334
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,910
Young Master Gap is after the warding stone?

335
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,000
No, is it the Eight-feet Spirit?

336
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,540
My goodness. Yeo Ri.

337
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,020
(Sinbu: A pass to enter and exit the Palace)

338
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,190
Young Master, no.

339
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,279
- My goodness. - I am sorry.

340
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,659
Watch where you are going. It is too early for this nonsense.

341
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,699
Young Master.

342
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,740
Gosh, what will I do with this now? Good grief.

343
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,920
Your Majesty, may I ask what you are writing?

344
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,090
I thought of a great idea...

345
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,340
after hearing your opinion about the slave reform yesterday.

346
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,470
Come to my desk.

347
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,190
Here. Take a look.

348
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,000
You valued my trivial opinion and included it in the bill.

349
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,420
I am honoured.

350
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,630
You gave me a great idea.

351
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,510
Good grief. How bothersome this is.

352
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,560
Yeo Ri pleaded with me to carry this at all times.

353
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,600
So I always keep it with me.

354
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,310
But it surely gets in the way...

355
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,350
when I write.

356
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,490
Young Master. Please.

357
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,250
Yes.

358
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:22,460
That means the people will not be involved with the slaves,

359
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,210
and we will...

360
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,970
no longer lose any labourers.

361
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,430
It will benefit both sides.

362
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,900
No!

363
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,269
Be careful, Your Majesty.

364
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,979
There is a broken bottle.

365
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,230
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

366
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,030
Are you all right?

367
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,160
Oh, darn it.

368
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,990
Oh, dear.

369
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,290
Goodness.

370
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,760
What is this?

371
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,480
Is it wine?

372
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,439
Sang Deuk! Hurry and clean the broken shards.

373
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
I will do so.

374
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,950
Stop!

375
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,490
I will clean it up.

376
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,120
- Goodness. - What...

377
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,590
Young Master.

378
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,420
Kang Chul!

379
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,480
- Young Master. - Do not come closer, Yeo Ri.

380
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,690
Do not look at me.

381
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,150
Out of anger that I had lost everything,

382
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,360
I entertained evil thoughts.

383
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,990
I fell for the lie that I could...

384
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,080
regain my body if I poured wine on the warding stone.

385
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,330
I turned into a monster.

386
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,090
You are wrong.

387
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,220
It was not I that grabbed your arm at the last moment.

388
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,720
It was you.

389
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,680
No!

390
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,850
You...

391
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,060
did not become evil.

392
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,059
It does not change the fact...

393
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,900
that I considered pouring wine...

394
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,690
on the King's warding stone.

395
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,690
I tried to...

396
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,870
harm the King.

397
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,410
If this continues,

398
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,660
I will betray my King...

399
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,710
and go down in history as a traitor.

400
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,130
I am under the Eight-feet Spirit's control.

401
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,170
He might use me to do something else.

402
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,090
Before...

403
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,010
I become a dreadful evil spirit,

404
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,680
send me over.

405
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,060
Yeo Ri.

406
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,900
Send me to the afterlife.

407
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,030
Young Master...

408
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,500
What a fool.

409
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,629
I gave him the chance to regain his body,

410
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,630
and he failed.

411
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,340
That does not matter.

412
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,970
It has become slightly more complicated,

413
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,679
but now I know a warding stone...

414
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,430
is in the Eight-feet Spirit's way.

415
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,690
Getting rid of it is not a problem at all.

416
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,490
You came home early today.

417
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,160
Dinner is ready. Go wash your hands.

418
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,620
Gap.

419
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,840
Why...

420
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,210
is it you?

421
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,920
Where is my Gap?

422
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,180
Why are you back?

423
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,350
Yeo Ri.

424
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,140
He is not Gap.

425
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,060
He is not my son!

426
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,440
Where is he, and why is it you instead?

427
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Why did you come back and not my poor son?

428
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,580
My Gap...

429
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,960
I want Gap back.

430
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,090
Please give me back my son.

431
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,680
Please return my Gap to me.

432
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,219
I am sorry, Mother.

433
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,019
Send my son, my Gap back to me.

434
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,180
I am sorry.

435
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,400
I want my son back. I want my Gap.

436
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,240
Give me back my dear son.

437
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:31,410
(For the spirit of Yoon Gap)

438
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,910
Gwanyok.

439
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,200
A ritual to bathe the spirit.

440
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,290
Through this ritual, Young Master Gap...

441
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,340
will be washed clean...

442
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,010
of all his past karma.

443
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,840
We are here to send Yoon Gap's spirit to the afterlife.

444
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,510
The best way to cleanse one's body, mouth, and purpose...

445
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,980
is to first have a clean and clear spirit.

446
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,479
The one thing that cleanses all...

447
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,570
is clean water that flows from high to low.

448
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,539
We follow Buddha's teachings...

449
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,869
and prepared a spirit cleansing ritual.

450
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,830
Spirit of Yoon Gap.

451
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,049
Cleanse yourself in one go...

452
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,670
of all the dirt you accumulated.

453
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:10,090
May you gain everlasting cleanliness...

454
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,390
and cross the river into paradise.

455
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,520
May you move on in peace.

456
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,160
And now...

457
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,660
Young Master Gap...

458
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,850
Young Master.

459
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,400
I am sorry.

460
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,700
Yeo Ri.

461
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,540
My death is not on you.

462
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,790
To blame it on you...

463
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,750
would diminish my purpose that was to fight...

464
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,210
for the King's dream.

465
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,510
Although I am sad,

466
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,470
I have no regrets.

467
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,270
Yeo Ri.

468
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,230
Is my Gap there?

469
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,320
He is, is he not?

470
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,320
Gap.

471
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,070
Gap!

472
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,120
Do not go.

473
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,750
Do not leave your mother all alone.

474
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,920
Gap...

475
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,800
Mother.

476
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,430
Gap. Do not go.

477
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,890
Mother.

478
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,060
Thank you for giving me life.

479
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,480
I was incredibly happy...

480
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,240
to be your son.

481
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,210
(Yoon Gap)

482
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,230
Yoon Gap...

483
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,690
has gone for good.

484
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,660
(Yoon Gap)

485
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,970
Why did you not tell her...

486
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,640
you also loved her?

487
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,139
She already gave her heart to another.

488
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,270
Telling her how I feel out of my own selfishness...

489
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,980
would only make her uncomfortable.

490
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,150
You are so annoyingly cool.

491
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,940
Goodbye.

492
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,700
You were as upright and noble in your lifetime,

493
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,070
so you will go to a good place.

494
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,240
Look after my mother...

495
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,370
and Yeo Ri for me.

496
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,180
Are you insane?

497
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,140
You cannot ask this of me.

498
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,469
I could lose my head for treason...

499
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,599
before that serpent...

500
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,100
were to even get to me.

501
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,190
You mean...

502
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,730
you cannot do it?

503
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,609
No sane man...

504
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,439
would think of doing that to the King and the prince.

505
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,660
Se Won. Take the bottles of wine.

506
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,030
We are leaving.

507
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,579
What do you think you are doing?

508
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,130
I may be blind, but I believed I was a good judge of character.

509
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,420
I was mistaken.

510
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,220
I should look for someone...

511
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,260
with more guts.

512
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,350
Our country might be small,

513
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,980
but there must be one more person worthy of becoming the premier.

514
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,690
Wait. Stop right there.

515
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,950
Oh, dear.

516
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,250
Your hands are calloused.

517
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,050
Can you wield a sword?

518
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,169
- Pardon? - The General of Heaven and Earth...

519
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,920
is greatly pleased with you.

520
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,140
Your Majesty.

521
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:14,810
Your Highness!

522
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
Take the shot.

523
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,180
Gwang's legs...

524
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,969
are much stronger...

525
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,220
compared to the last time we played together.

526
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,770
I was barely able to...

527
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,650
keep up with him.

528
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,650
It has been just months,

529
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,280
and he has grown already.

530
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,280
It was a whole year, not just a few months.

531
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,370
What?

532
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,280
It has been over a year since you spent time...

533
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,290
to play with your son.

534
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,910
Oh, dear.

535
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,210
Has it been that long already?

536
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,750
Yes.

537
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,970
I was such a heartless father.

538
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,480
Ma'am.

539
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,730
We are ready to leave.

540
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,690
Do not skip your meals.

541
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,820
Be sure to eat well.

542
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,580
We should get going now.

543
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,960
Come on.

544
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:51,380
She now knows that you are not Royal Scribe Yoon Gap.

545
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,850
If we stay here,

546
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,930
it will be too cruel for her.

547
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,200
Pardon? You only have one room left?

548
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,949
The market opens tomorrow,

549
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,120
so the peddlers already took up all the other rooms.

550
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,670
It is the smallest room in the corner.

551
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,670
Do you want to take the room?

552
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,050
Yes?

553
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,980
I am worried about tomorrow.

554
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,940
We cannot keep staying at inns.

555
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,770
Ask the king to buy you a house.

556
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,400
How many times have you saved him and his family?

557
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,200
All he does is work you like a dog, for free.

558
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,280
You deserve to get a few nice mansions and more.

559
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,490
Then you should ask His Majesty.

560
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,200
It does not have to be a mansion.

561
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,870
Even just a thatched house with two rooms would do.

562
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,690
So about Yoon Gap,

563
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,150
he must have crossed the River of Oblivion by now.

564
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,360
Yes.

565
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,610
It means the reason you were after the Eight-feet Spirit is gone.

566
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,200
That is right.

567
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:38,910
And even so,

568
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,370
will you continue to chase the Eight-feet Spirit?

569
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,920
As you said,

570
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,340
it all started because of Young Master Gap.

571
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,500
However,

572
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,340
that scoundrel still has my grandma trapped with him.

573
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,130
And regardless of that,

574
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,600
I now know...

575
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,640
that this is something I ought to do.

576
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,190
And knowing the pain the Eight-feet Spirit must have endured...

577
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,270
while accumulating all that resentment for so long,

578
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,320
I truly pity him.

579
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,820
The depth of Chun Geum Hwi's pain and heartache.

580
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,110
And the countless spirits...

581
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:22,330
from Yongdam Village who are still trapped with him.

582
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:25,540
I wish to comfort them...

583
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,000
and free them.

584
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,380
Why are you sitting right by the door?

585
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,090
Come on in. You will catch a cold.

586
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,640
No.

587
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,300
I like it here.

588
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:42,890
What?

589
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,430
Ask no more. Just trust me.

590
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,020
What? Are you afraid I might eat you up alive?

591
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,780
You should sleep over there.

592
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,450
I bet you do not realize how naive you are.

593
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,089
I am your guardian spirit.

594
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,630
How dare you call me naive?

595
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,630
What about me do you find naive?

596
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:21,590
Shall we find out?

597
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,100
Forget it.

598
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,640
If I told you to forget everything...

599
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,690
and run away with me,

600
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:38,190
would you do that?

601
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,450
I can no longer return this body to Yoon Gap,

602
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,290
and I still cannot find a way to leave this body.

603
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,620
So maybe I should just...

604
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,960
tell myself that it cannot be helped...

605
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:57,130
and put off my plan to ascend...

606
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,380
so that I can just...

607
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,800
live as an ordinary human for now.

608
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,340
How about we live happily ever after together?

609
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,870
The Eight-feet Spirit is still roaming free, so I cannot run away.

610
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,830
Wherever we go,

611
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,080
the Eight-feet Spirit will continue to chase us as he resents us.

612
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,250
I was just joking, okay?

613
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:36,880
Kang Chul.

614
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,960
I...

615
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,680
You two.

616
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:46,760
You are not even married yet.

617
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,850
You cannot sleep in the same room.

618
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:51,980
Come with me, now.

619
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,280
The sun will rise at this rate.

620
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,660
Let us hurry.

621
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,410
Yes, ma'am.

622
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,000
If she was going to drag us back at this late hour,

623
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:20,420
- she should have just... - Stop.

624
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,260
So, why did you come to an inn so far away from home?

625
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:29,680
You made me check every inn in the capital at this late hour.

626
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,140
- What is she saying? - Hush! Be quiet.

627
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:34,810
Goodness me.

628
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,620
- Did you find out? - Yes.

629
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,660
His Majesty is planning an outing outside of the capital.

630
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,420
Outside of the capital?

631
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
- Where is he going? - That I do not know.

632
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,460
They are keeping it on the hush.

633
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,800
However, I heard the Dowager Queen, the Queen,

634
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,970
and Prince Gwang would be tagging along as well.

635
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,560
The Royal Guard and I will accompany His Majesty as well.

636
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,430
I will fill you in on the details once I return.

637
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:16,940
All right.

638
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,990
(Chun Geum Hwi)

639
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,050
So? Are Yeo Ri and Kang Chul back?

640
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,129
Well, they said they would come straight...

641
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,390
to the Jinseung Temple with Monk Gaseop.

642
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,680
Then we should leave now too.

643
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,110
Your Highness, His Majesty is entering.

644
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:10,530
Your Majesty.

645
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:13,030
What brings Your Majesty to the Queen's Palace?

646
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,160
After long consideration, I have concluded...

647
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,750
that this is the right thing to do.

648
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,800
Your Majesty, it is the warding stone.

649
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,880
Why would you give me this?

650
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,630
You are...

651
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,640
carrying royal blood in your womb.

652
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,640
Besides, I know the Eight-feet Spirit was after you too.

653
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:39,850
So, you should keep this.

654
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:41,730
No, do not do this.

655
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,730
Your safety matters more than that of me and the child in my womb.

656
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,860
At the cheondojae today,

657
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:53,620
I will be apologizing to the Eight-feet Spirit...

658
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,740
on behalf of my ancestors who deeply wronged him.

659
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,870
If I apologize to him while keeping the warding stone on me,

660
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,460
he will feel deceived.

661
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:19,640
(Chun Geum Hwi)

662
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,030
Grandma.

663
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,280
Are you getting ready for an exorcism?

664
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:37,950
Yes.

665
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,750
Lord Choi's family across the bridge...

666
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,790
is battling a persistent evil spirit.

667
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,419
Then what is with the talisman and the identification tag...

668
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,000
inside your robe?

669
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,140
This allows...

670
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,760
the shaman to summon the Grim Reaper...

671
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:01,310
and take the evil spirit to the registry.

672
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:05,900
The Grim Reaper must know the deceased's exact name...

673
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,020
and the date when they died.

674
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,900
However,

675
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:12,740
this method...

676
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,200
cannot help relieve the spirit's resentment.

677
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,280
Moreover,

678
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,830
if things go wrong,

679
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,920
a deadly spell could be cast on the shaman,

680
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:29,420
so it should be reserved as a last resort.

681
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:32,260
What if you have the deadly spell cast on you?

682
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,550
I know who that evil spirit is,

683
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,470
so I will be fine.

684
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:51,729
Look, flowers!

685
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,610
Flowers have bloomed on the caragana root.

686
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,949
Up until last night,

687
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,530
the flower buds did not look like they would open anytime soon.

688
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:01,490
But this morning, I saw that they had fully bloomed like this.

689
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,330
Since you had asked me to let you know,

690
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,039
I ran here as soon as I saw these.

691
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,080
My lady!

692
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,380
If you run by yourself like that,

693
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:13,670
I will be scolded later, big time.

694
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:17,180
What do you mean I ran? I did not.

695
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,220
You walk too slowly.

696
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:20,550
Darn it.

697
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,310
Pardon?

698
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,560
Thanks for this.

699
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,640
My lord.

700
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,650
I told you to stop thinking of that jerk...

701
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,440
I told you so.

702
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,240
As if this was all planned,

703
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,490
the flowers bloomed...

704
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,500
exactly 100 years after the birth of the Eight-feet Spirit.

705
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,000
You did not want to come here at all.

706
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,540
You did only because I came.

707
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:57,090
I am grateful for everything you did for me already.

708
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,510
Yeo Ri knows that...

709
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:01,970
in order to help the Eight-feet Spirit ascend,

710
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,020
we ought to exhaust the powers of the glowing pearl.

711
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,490
Knowing her personality,

712
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,870
she will do something reckless to keep me from harm.

713
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,120
Hence, this is...

714
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,630
just to be prepared in case Yeo Ri endangers herself.

715
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,490
(Chun Geum Hwi)

716
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:06,159
Dear spirit

717
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:12,040
We pray from the bottom of our hearts

718
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:17,210
That you will clear

719
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,170
Your karma

720
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,350
And reach enlightenment

721
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:49,910
We wish you would be reincarnated in paradise

722
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,830
Everyone here today.

723
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:57,880
May you attain enlightenment.

724
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,730
The Eight-feet Spirit, come to me.

725
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,070
I will comfort you and help you relieve your resentment.

726
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,380
He is here.

727
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,380
The Eight-feet Spirit.

728
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:52,930
Yeo Ri.

729
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
What on earth...

730
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:02,530
This is strange. Something has gone wrong.

731
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:20,750
Stay back.

732
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,170
- Stop him! - Protect His Majesty!

733
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:55,290
Stay away.

734
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,750
- No! - Your Majesty.

735
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,730
No!

736
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,290
Mother!

737
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:38,830
Your Highness!

738
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:13,450
(The Haunted Palace)

739
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,029
Nothing happens when I touch it.

740
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:16,620
The King's and the Prince's too.

741
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,580
Perhaps, it was done by those he trusted the most.

742
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,370
Was it truly your doing?

743
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,629
They caught those who did that to Her Highness the Queen!

744
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,250
Do you not fear the punishment that will befall you?

745
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:28,300
Both you and that wench will be finished soon.

746
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,009
Is this the only way?

747
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:31,800
Then I might die.

748
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,759
You are still the most beautiful human I know.

749
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,600
Hence, my heart aches.

750
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:40,100
You wait and see how they all die.

751
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,139
Arrest Royal Scribe Yoon Gap...

752
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,059
and Yeo Ri, the glasses-maker.

753
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,730
They are to be decapitated at once!
