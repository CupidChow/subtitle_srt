00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,580
Mister Point

2
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,420
intertwining couple

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,040
Episode 27

4
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,940
I express my bow and arrow to you!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In the Western Regions.

6
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,440
In the sudden incident,

7
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,800
she committed suicide on the way in the capital.

8
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,480
She was at greatadhtr.

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,680
The

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,760
Powder of Heretic testifies as cake is made of

11
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,080
Son's Conference cookies.

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,340
Howbandir leopard

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,640
was used as final

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,400
match to forgo the death of 3rd Prince.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't see anything.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How could this be?

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Jiang Yisheng.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's go and look.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
How could His Majesty treat me like this?

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Your Highness, if you keep crying,

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
your eyes will be broken.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Just a little bit of money.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He treats me and Hao Bai like this.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He's so disgusting.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
After His Majesty leaves,

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
he will come to see you.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Your Majesty, you mean His Majesty

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
will come to see me, right?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He will.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He just wants me to think about it.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Your Highness, let's heal the wound on your face first.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Otherwise, it won't be beautiful.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's still the Crown Prince.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He even took the underground money houses

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
in the capital city.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I heard that the shopkeeper of Dongjiezhen Temple

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
is the big boss of the underground money house.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He even took away the property of the money house.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He even got the result of a family destruction.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The shopkeeper himself is crazy.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
When the news of the underground money house being destroyed

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
was spread,

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
his life was half cured.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now the Crown Prince's life is cured.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is the destiny.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to the capital city.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll see you there.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Take care.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Take care.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I won't see you again.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Take care.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Take care.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Take care.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Take care.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Take care.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Take care.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Take care.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Take care.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Take care.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What you said today

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
will be a big discount.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you know it,

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
please think twice before you do it next time.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Are you angry?

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can't bear to see the child

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
can't get out of the cage.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
At worst, next time,

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll be a little more modest next time.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You want to have a next time?

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let me see.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This time, the Emperor

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
just ordered the noble consort's family

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to be imprisoned by Jiang Yuehao.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's not like before.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He ordered the family to be destroyed so easily.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No matter how much you love your children,

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
as long as you can influence his royal power,

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
he can throw them away at any time.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He can throw them away at any time.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Fortunately, now the adult prince

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
only has you.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're too young to be threatened, right?

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can finally take a breath.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Who told you I can take a breath?

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Who told you I can take a breath?

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Isn't it?

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Who else will threaten your position as the Crown Prince?

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You shouldn't have come to kill me.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You know martial arts?

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Death...

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank Uncle Liu for me.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The incense he used to make the Chinese medicine

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
is very useful.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's so late. Don't let him worry.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes.

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Drink some tea.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
After Xue Ping cleans up the bed,

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
we'll go to sleep.

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Here.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Here.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Will the assassin tonight

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
be sent by Noble Consort Shu?

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Although Jiang Yuehao has been imprisoned,

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Noble Consort Shu is just a lowly person.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We let her son fall to such a low level.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He must hate us so much.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's not her.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why are you so sure?

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Noble Consort Shu will hate us.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But now,

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the most important thing in front of her is her father.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
She shouldn't have done anything to us.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The assassin tonight

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
is more like a test.

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You mean

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the Emperor?

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Your Highness, the food is here.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Eat it while it's hot.

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Your Highness, the food is here.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Eat it while it's hot.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Your Highness, the food is here.

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Eat it while it's hot.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Your Highness,

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
please eat it while it's hot.

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Your Highness,

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
please eat it while it's hot.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
These damn servants!

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I've been imprisoned.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
How could they do this to me?

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,960
Your Highness, I've tried my best.

135
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,160
But they only gave me these cold dishes.

136
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,200
How could they do this?

137
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,920
Your Majesty, when Your Majesty sees them,

138
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,720
I'll feel so sorry for you.

139
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,640
Yunxiu.

140
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,120
Your Highness.

141
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,760
Yunxiu.

142
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,840
I did something wrong.

143
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,240
I'm not a good mother.

144
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,480
Your Majesty, you're angry with me.

145
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,640
But it's also right.

146
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,040
I can take it.

147
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,840
But I never thought I'd never see you again.

148
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm so sorry.

149
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,760
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,640
I'm so sad.

153
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,360
Yunxiu.

154
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
Your Majesty.

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
Your Majesty.

156
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,560
It's only been a few days, and someone is so careless.

157
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,680
Why didn't you let someone tell me?

158
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,000
Your Majesty.

159
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,240
I know I'm sorry.

160
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,000
How could I let you do these things?

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,560
How could I let you be so angry?

162
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Don't cry, my dear. I've never blamed you.

163
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,600
But this time, I'm really too much.

164
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,680
I can't let the officials see my attitude.

165
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,120
Your Majesty, I understand.

166
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,760
You don't need to explain.

167
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,640
I promise you,

168
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,200
no one will dare to bully you or humiliate you again.

169
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Your Majesty.

170
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,880
The cultivation of imperial schools in the capital has begun.

171
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,000
It's expected to be completed by next spring.

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,560
The officials sent by the Ministry of Works and Ministry of Revenue

173
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,520
will also be there to supervise.

174
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,720
Although it's a little slower than the progress in the capital,

175
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,040
everything will go as you wish.

176
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,920
I'm relieved to hear that.

177
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

178
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Your Majesty.

179
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Your Majesty.

180
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,640
Today's meeting has been a little too long.

181
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,400
Thank you for your hard work.

182
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Why don't you stay and have some food in the palace?

183
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
We'll continue.

184
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,800
His Majesty has sent the officials to serve the officials.

185
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

186
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I'm afraid that His Majesty is busy with work and is tired.

187
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,200
So I made some cakes.

188
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Are you happy, Your Majesty?

189
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,600
I want to share it with you.

190
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
That's it.

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,520
Your Highness.

192
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Your Majesty, this is my letter.

193
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
My letter?

194
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,320
Your Highness, please read it.

195
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,320
I'll go to the kitchen to see how the dinner is prepared.

196
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Miss, whose letter is it?

197
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
It's my father's.

198
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
It's my father's.

199
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,920
Miss, what's wrong?

200
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,720
What did His Lordship say in the letter?

201
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,920
Nothing.

202
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,720
He just cares about my safety.

203
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,320
Suzhu, go and see if there are any fruits to bring here.

204
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
I want to eat.

205
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,920
Okay.

206
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,920
I know that my son is now being conferred as Crown Princess.

207
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,120
But I'm worried about my son.

208
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
I hope that my son can think clearly.

209
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,120
The Jiang clan has a natural bias in the blood of men.

210
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,920
It's not twice as bad as being a husband.

211
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,720
His Majesty must have heard about how His Majesty treats his wife.

212
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,920
The late emperor is also like that.

213
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,320
The Crown Prince also has the blood of the Jiang clan.

214
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,720
It's hard to guarantee that he won't hurt my son in the future.

215
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,320
Although the Xu family is working with the Crown Prince,

216
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,320
I once asked for his permission.

217
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,320
If I want to leave, the Crown Prince can't stop me.

218
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,520
But when the day of the selection of the Xu family comes,

219
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,320
I hope that my son can be with his father and live happily ever after.

220
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,920
Your Majesty.

221
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,520
Your Highness.

222
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:38,840
I notice that you have been making some inaccurate

223
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,640
statements about the Sui family after the testing.

224
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:49,360
Your Highness, it isn't until right now that we are able to

225
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,080
see this Chillies
