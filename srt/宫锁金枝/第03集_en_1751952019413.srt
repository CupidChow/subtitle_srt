1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,800
Secret.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I just never thought that

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
since I was in a rush to take revenge,

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
why would my beloved consort be so diligent

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and rush to get rid of the innocent?

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
My beloved consort's behavior

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
had to be thought over by me.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Do you have some other schemes?

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Your Highness, you have changed your clothes.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Your Highness,

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
you are in such a hurry.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is it because the crown princess found out something wrong?

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, it's the palace's servant

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
who suddenly called the crown princess into the palace.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
On the day of the wedding,

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the crown princess wrote that the crown princess came into the palace to thank the emperor.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's just right.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's the point?

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Your Highness, it's just to call the crown princess into the palace.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not to thank the emperor,

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
it's to listen to the emperor's message.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But based on what you said,

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I actually have no special training in the register office.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You are so fewer.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Seriously.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:49,120
Go get them real Mas Heyan and

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,000
get them no Mas Heyan in the palace?

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But they actually want me to do this.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's go!

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will give you the service you deserve.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Your Highness!

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Are you all right?

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Get up quickly.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Be careful.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're going to get a fever.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Get up quickly.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Get up quickly.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Are you all right?

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Get up quickly.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Get up quickly.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Get up quickly.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Slowly.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Seriously.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Your Highness,

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
what did I do wrong?

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Xu Chuyun,

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
the Crown Prince's Mansion was attacked by assassins yesterday.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Those assassins are from unknown sources.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's the palace's rule to let you in and listen to the news.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're a family member.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How dare you let the Crown Princess's Consort take the throne?

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Even His Majesty said it himself.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
My family is loyal.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
They even appointed me as their concubine.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They even appointed me as their concubine to marry the Crown Prince.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You mean...

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
His Majesty is wrong?

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You...

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
His Majesty only wants you to marry him.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
How could he be wrong?

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But the Eastern Palace is the foundation of the country.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There can't be any mistakes.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
These assassins are strange.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
According to the rules in the palace,

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you should ask them.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Your Highness,

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I grew up on the border.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't know the rules.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't understand the palace rules.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But I know that

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
if I make a mistake,

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll be punished by my family.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's the most important thing.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But I can't let anyone else do it.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How dare you disrespect the Noble Consort!

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're the one who disrespects her.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're a lowly servant who doesn't know the rules.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No matter how weak I am,

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
you can't touch me.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Your Highness,

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I really don't know what I did wrong.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But for the sake of the Tian family,

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
for the sake of the Xu family,

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and for the sake of the palace rules,

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
please teach me.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Your Highness.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Your Highness.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm here to supervise the palace rules.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm here to supervise the palace rules.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is the palace rules.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't disrespect the Crown Princess.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't disrespect the Crown Princess.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't disrespect the Crown Princess.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What does the Noble Consort mean?

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Am I more noble

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
than Her Highness in this palace?

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The Crown Princess is the legitimate wife of the Crown Prince.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Now, the palace is empty.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The Crown Princess is the most noble woman.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I shouldn't have...

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I shouldn't have...

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's fine.

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Your Highness.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Your Highness,

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Your Highness.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Your Highness,

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't understand.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Your Highness,

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Your Highness,

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,600
The Imperial Consort just went to the Hualin Hall to see the Imperial Consort.

117
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,800
His Majesty only let the Third Prince stay for a while longer.

118
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
But you...

119
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Without the Crown Princess Consort, how can I report to His Majesty?

120
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
You...

121
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
You...

122
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Your Highness, you're here.

123
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm here to congratulate you on your wedding.

124
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,800
Didn't the Third Prince get married on the day after tomorrow?

125
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
The same day?

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

127
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,200
Where's the Crown Princess Consort? Why didn't you see her?

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,200
I heard that an assassin entered yesterday. Are you all right?

129
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Your Highness, please forgive me.

130
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,200
I was late at the Hualin Hall to listen to the news.

131
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,600
Your Highness, I'm here to congratulate Your Highness fell out with Che Khong.

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Your Highness, please get up.

133
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,880
I'm afraid you're not used to the rules of the palace.

134
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,120
The new wife and the old maid of the palace are all going to receive a gift.

135
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,000
So I asked someone to prepare some things.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,720
Just do as you like.

137
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
There's also gold and silver.

138
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,840
If you have something you like, it's good to buy it yourself.

139
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,200
Thank you, Father, for your gift.

140
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,800
Yun Sheng,

141
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,440
you're already married.

142
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
If your mother knows,

143
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,760
isn't that making you very happy?

144
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,800
Who should I be with?

145
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,360
Don't be greedy.

146
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,960
Don't be blind.

147
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,240
Conceal my

148
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,040
most hard-hearted yearning.

149
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:42,320
When the regret of the past is locked in the palace,

150
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,520
Only true love can return the years of the past.

151
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,000
How can I hide the mask?

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,400
You are in love with me.

153
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:04,320
The moon and the wind are together, it's never far away.

154
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,320
The moon and the wind are together, it's never far away.
