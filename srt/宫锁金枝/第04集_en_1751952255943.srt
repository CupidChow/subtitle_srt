1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,860
and in the martial arts field still

2
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,340
and Hammond

3
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,240
Countlist Remove

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yun Sheng, you are already married.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If your mother knows, wouldn't she be very happy?

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Father, I was planning to go to pay my respects to mother

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
after I have finished greeting you.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Tell her about this happy event.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I should go see her.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It would be great if your mother were still alive.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I remember that when you were born, she kept thinking about you.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In the future, she wanted to see you succeed in your family.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
She wanted to see you and your beloved consort wear the wedding gown and wear the crown.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's a pity that she left too early.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Father, don't be sad.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't want to see you sad either.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You are a sensible child.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I also know that you were a little scared last night.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Those bandits outside of the city of Gong City

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
were so desperate that they wanted to harm Chu Yun.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's really despicable.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes, it was all done by the bandits.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You don't need to be too relieved

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
about the situation in the capital.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You go and pay your respects to your mother first.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Come and have lunch with me later.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I take my leave.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How could this be a small matter?

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I wanted to use the interrogation to kill the Crown Princess Consort

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
to show off your third prince consort.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I didn't expect that the scoundrel to look innocent

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
but he said that I was not the Empress and I didn't have the right to teach him a lesson.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Instead, he made a mistake.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If he made a mistake, then he should have made a mistake.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mother, what's wrong with him being so proud?

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Moreover, this hearing was ordered by father.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It was he who wanted to suppress the crown princess consort

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
who was holding the military power.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Your father is very thoughtful.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I think he must have thought about this matter a long time ago.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He adored me and loved you a lot.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
During your wedding, the court officials were all right.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
In this way,

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
our eyes should be a little longer.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Mother, you are right.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Moreover, the crown prince was assassinated

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and was also taken over by father for the reason of robbing the crown princess.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You mustn't mention it again.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's clear that he is not favored by father.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The court affairs are more difficult to talk about and make no use of.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's great.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Then you should behave well in court.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
As for the bow and spear ceremony,

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have informed Yuan Yuan

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
that I will not let the crown prince live in peace.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mother, I am no longer alone.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I am not alone.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Without mother's protection,

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I am indeed alone in this palace.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I, who took the initiative to enter this imperial city,

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
am also alone.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Come.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What do you want to tell me?

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You came and loved me.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It sounds cold.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
How about we call it as the common folk?

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You are my wife.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I am your husband.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How about it?

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Husband.

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wife.

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
My lady, I touched it yesterday.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There are several spies in the Eastern Palace.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The identity of those assassins is really hard to say.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He is so soft.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think what they said is right.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They said the crown prince is a useless person.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
My lady suffered so much in the palace today.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He didn't even think of helping you and helping you out.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If he really is a useless person,

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
how could he live until now?

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:27,840
Besides, I think he is not as

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He looks like he is guarding against me.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Did I make any mistake yesterday?

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't think so.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I was outside the window yesterday.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I saw you fell down after drinking.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Then the crown prince fell asleep.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He didn't do anything else.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Where is the medicine?

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Here.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
My lady was summoned to the palace this morning.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But the crown prince left late.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He gave me the medicine.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Did he find anything wrong?

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No medicine.

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I saw that the crown prince was fine.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He said that the medicine has the effect of medicine.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's not good to use too much.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He told me to use less.

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
My lady, the crown prince wants you to go there.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Slow down.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Put it here.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Be gentle.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Everyone, slow down.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
These are the favorite music and instruments of the lady.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Don't make any mistakes.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Slow down.

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
My lady, the crown prince will prepare a private room for you.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You...

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What are you thinking about?

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Suzhu, look.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's winter.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The wind is blowing.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's still cold.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
My lady,

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
My lady,

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
My lady,

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
My lady,

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The wind is as good as blood.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The crown princess is using the next yard.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I can hear the sound of her from here.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The crown princess asked someone to bring many musical instruments.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
She said she would use the room you prepared for her as a piano room.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Musical instruments?

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
She is arranging the music room.

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I thought she would make it into a embroidery workshop.

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I asked.

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Suzhu said the crown princess is more willing to study musical instruments.

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
My lady, you are the most beautiful when you are practicing martial arts.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Even if there is a soul,

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
you are the one who found me.

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
In order to avenge the Xu family,

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I had to be a cruel rabbit.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
My eyes are full of hatred.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The Xu family's revenge is one and the same.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You are not worthy of me.

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
My lady, you suffered.

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Put away my musical instruments.

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
In case you scare the crown prince who is so weak.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Your highness.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Your highness.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
She was in Hualien Hall today.

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
She looked innocent.

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But in fact,

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Shu Hui was beaten up.

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Do you think she is playing the tiger or the real Chunliang Jiao?

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Your highness, I don't know.

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How about we go see for ourselves?

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Is she acting for us?

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Is she really a Xianliang or a Jiao Shu?

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Legs. Legs. Legs. Your highness.

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay. Let's go.

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Let's go.

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Suzhu.

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes.

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
How about hanging the musical instruments there?

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There is a pair of knives behind.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Use a screen to block them.

168
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
How about putting the red-?

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And the medicine?

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
My lady.

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Your highness.

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Why are you here?

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Are you satisfied with the yard?

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I like it. I'm very satisfied.

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Good.

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If you don't like it,

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:18,920
I'll give you the

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I thought you only liked books.

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I never thought you would like musical instruments so much.

180
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I just don't know what's in it.

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Can I see your hand?

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm sorry.

186
