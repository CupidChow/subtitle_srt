Episode 16

7
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,660
Not only that.

8
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,660
Your Highness, your leg.

9
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,660
Your Highness, please spare me.

10
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,660
I really can't go to see you.

11
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,660
Is this how the Shu Gui Army taught you?

12
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,660
As expected, your real master is the Shu family.

13
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,660
You stole his words from me.

14
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,660
I know.

15
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,660
Find someone to dress him up and send him back to the big brother.

16
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,660
I'm still useful.

17
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,660
No power, no power.

18
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,660
There is no prince.

19
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,660
Marrying such a useless and unmovable prince.

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,660
I have the power.

21
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,660
The dragon pattern on the masked man's face is exactly the same as the crown prince's.

22
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,660
Tell me, why would such a useless person do such a thing to the Xu family?

23
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,660
That day, I investigated it according to the lady's will.

24
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,660
The princes in the palace all have similar patterns.

25
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,660
I think that either the person is hidden deep enough,

26
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,660
or someone used his name to do it, and then he was framed.

27
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,660
I married into the Eastern Palace for one purpose.

28
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,660
Whether he is framed or a murderer.

29
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,660
In short, I will get rid of all the people in the Xu family one by one.

30
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,660
It's a mission.

31
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,660
Father, the crown prince suddenly appeared that day.

32
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
It was really just an accident.

33
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,660
Whether it's an accident or not, I will stop it.

34
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,660
His Majesty had no choice but to get married.

35
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,660
It was the Shu Gui Consort who immediately asked for a favor.

36
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,660
That's why she got married to you and the third prince.

37
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,660
Please rest assured, father.

38
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
After I get married, I will do my best

39
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,660
to help father and the third prince.

40
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,660
You are too kind.

41
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
These people who are so stubborn

42
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,660
just gave up the Eastern Palace and went to the Third Prince's mansion.

43
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,660
I told you before that my brother wouldn't sit around and wait.

44
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,660
If he wants to fight, he wouldn't dare to stand under me.

45
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,660
This is just a third emperor.

46
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,660
Such a good opportunity.

47
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,660
My big brother, won't he fight?

48
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,660
First, let me raze that king ofside rockets for the aan.

49
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,660
Who are you?

50
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Don't come any closer.

51
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,660
Or else, I will kill you.

52
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,660
Just you save the lives of those who saved your life?

53
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,660
I would rather not be

54
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
You will know who I am.

55
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,660
As for what I want to do...

56
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Let's talk about history first.

57
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,660
We will have more time to get along in the future.

58
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,660
Miss, are you okay?

59
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,660
I'm fine.

60
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,660
I'm late to escort you.

61
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,660
Please forgive me.

62
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,660
How could there be an assassin on the day of the Crown Princess's wedding?

63
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,660
If I hadn't learned a few moves from Xu's,

64
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Miss would have been in trouble.

65
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,660
Please rest assured, Crown Princess.

66
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
We have already added more guards.

67
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,660
May I ask if the Crown Prince is safe?

68
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
He...

69
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,660
The Crown Prince...

70
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,660
The Crown Prince is fine.

71
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,660
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

72
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,660
We will wait for a while.

73
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,660
The Crown Prince will be here soon.

74
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,660
You think it's a cat with a sharp claw?

75
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,660
I didn't expect it to be a newbie.

76
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,660
There are six of us.

77
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
One person is alive.

78
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,660
The Crown Prince has already sent the confession.

79
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,660
He wants to be a Crown Princess who hates the royal family.

80
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,660
He wants to turn the court into a prison.

81
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,660
He wants to put you in the most criminal position.

82
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,660
It seems that my big brother can't stand it anymore.

83
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,660
He gave me such a big gift.

84
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,660
My Lady, the Crown Prince is here.

85
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,660
Little...

86
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,660
You don't need to stay here.

87
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,660
You can leave.

88
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,660
Lady Suzhou, let's go.

89
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
I'm sorry that you married me.

90
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
Tonight,

91
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,660
I was so worried that you were scared.

92
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,660
I'm relieved to see that you are safe.

93
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Do you need my help?

94
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
Come.

95
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,660
Four years ago,

96
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,660
my father changed his mind for me.

97
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,660
He didn't get any better.

98
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,660
Now,

99
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,660
I don't want to ask for anything anymore.

100
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,660
I just think that

101
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,660
it's a shame for you to marry such a good woman.

102
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,660
It's a shame for you to marry me.

103
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,660
You are so considerate.

104
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,660
I don't know what to do with you.

105
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
What is this?

106
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,660
It's just a medicine for pregnancy.

107
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Even if it's discovered, it's nothing.

108
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,660
A useless Crown Prince

109
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,660
is his biggest contribution.

110
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,660
When I have his child,

111
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,660
and I have the power of the Eastern Palace,

112
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,660
for me,

113
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,660
it's just a waste of time.

114
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Since the accident at home,

115
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,660
Chu Yun has been unable to sleep at night.

116
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Now, he is marrying the Crown Prince.

117
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
He is afraid that he will disturb your dream.

118
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
That's why the doctor

119
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,660
prescribed the medicine for pregnancy.

120
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Don't cry.

121
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,660
You can't cry on a happy day.

122
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,660
Drink this He Jin wine.

123
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,660
We are going to spend the rest of our lives together.

124
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:42,660
I will take responsibility for everything.

125
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,660
Are you drunk?

126
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,660
No.

127
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
I only had one glass.

128
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
How could I be drunk?

129
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,660
How could you be drunk with just one glass?

130
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,660
What do you mean by one glass?

131
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,660
How could I be drunk with just one glass?

132
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Miss Suzhu, please go to rest.

133
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,660
I will guard this place.

134
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,660
How could I let you guard it alone?

135
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
As the Crown Princess's personal maid,

136
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
how could I leave without permission?

137
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,660
My dear,

138
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
are you still thinking of me?

139
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
Don't force yourself.

140
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,660
I am not.

141
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
I am not.

142
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,660
I am not.

143
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,660
I am not.

144
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
I am not.

145
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,660
I am not.

146
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,660
I am not.

147
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
Don't force yourself.

148
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
You can sleep peacefully

149
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,660
in my place.

150
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
How can I be peaceful

151
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,660
when I haven't been able to protect you?

152
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
There will be a day when...

153
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:09,660
the moon will be able to see the shadow of the tree.

154
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,660
The light is flickering.

155
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,660
It seems that blood is dripping from my shoulder.

156
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,660
I am awake in that moment.

157
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,660
I am looking back at you.

158
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,660
The clouds are full of shadows.

159
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:50,660
Is it the moonlight or the moon in your heart?

160
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,660
The old stone sea is trapped in the clouds and doesn't dare to retreat.

161
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,660
The wind and moon are like two birds.

162
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,660
Who are you talking to?

163
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:11,660
Don't talk about it.

164
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,660
I am the most suitable one.

165
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:25,660
When the regret of the past is locked in the palace,

166
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:32,660
only true love can return the years of the past.

167
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,660
The mask has seen the past.

168
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,660
The star in your eyes is like the wind and moon.

169
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,660
It is never different from the night.

170
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,660
The moon is full of shadows.

171
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,660
The moon is like the wind and moon is not afraid of the wind.

172
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,660
The moon is full of shadows.

173
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,660
The moon is full of shadows.
