1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
ease your worries

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
Are you waiting for me?

3
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,800
You're back late today.

4
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,600
His Majesty came to the court with a lot of effort.

5
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,880
He gave me the Wolf's Nest Stone.

6
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,240
Why do you suddenly think of the Wolf's Nest Stone?

7
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,680
Of course I want to tell everyone

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,000
that Noble Consort Shu is pregnant.

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,800
Noble Consort Shu?

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,040
It's only been a few days. How could she...

11
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,640
That's how she is.

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,800
Everything must be done according to her will.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,240
Just like how she didn't like my mother's family growing up

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,840
and framed the Zhao family.

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,160
She even looked at my mother coldly.

16
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,960
All right. Let's not talk about this.

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,480
Is Lady Rong Le still in the manor?

18
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,920
Manor?

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,840
I still have to say...

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,840
Your Highness, what's going on?

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Someone!

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,680
Someone, come here!

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,440
How is Crown Prince?

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
Why is he suddenly coughing up blood?

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,240
Your Highness,

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,520
I saw Crown Prince's pulse.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,560
It seems like he's infected with a cold.

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,440
Crown Prince is weak.

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,360
He has been running around

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
because of the Hubei case.

31
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,240
There are indeed cold cases

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,160
in some villages in the capital.

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
He might have been infected.

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
Can he be cured?

35
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,640
He can be cured.

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,680
But his symptoms are extremely serious.

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,640
I'll make a prescription.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,120
I don't know if it can be cured.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,400
You may leave now.

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Yes.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,800
Go and get Uncle Liu.

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,360
Uncle Liu, how is he?

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
His pulse is indeed serious.

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,800
But as Lady Rong Le said,

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,040
Crown Prince coughed up blood before he passed out.

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,440
This is different from the symptoms of the cold.

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,000
And Crown Prince is not seriously ill.

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,640
If the cold is really infected,

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,880
half of the Eastern Palace will be affected,

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,840
including you.

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,040
It's not the cold.

52
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,160
What should we do?

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,120
The imperial physician's prescription is for Crown Prince.

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,240
It can be taken as a medicine.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,880
I'll investigate it later.

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,000
I think there's something wrong with this.

57
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Okay.

58
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,920
If you need anything,

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,760
just tell me.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,360
Why is it like this?

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,040
Jiang Yusheng,

62
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,360
the man you Jiang family...

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,160
I really don't understand.

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,520
If you want to trick me,

65
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,880
it's really...

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,080
Jiang Yusheng.

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,600
Jiang Yusheng.

68
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
Jiang Yusheng.

69
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,280
Jiang Yusheng.

70
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,480
Jiang Yusheng.

71
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,720
Jiang Yusheng.

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,200
Jiang Yusheng.

73
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,600
Jiang Yusheng.

74
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,800
Jiang Yusheng.

75
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,360
It's really...

76
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,520
not hard at all.

77
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,800
But you took me seriously.

78
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,640
Jiang Yusheng.

79
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
I'm so envious of you.

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,760
Are the imperial physicians sent there clean?

81
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,120
Your Majesty,

82
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,360
these physicians are not the Third Prince's men.

83
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,840
My two sons are really good at it.

84
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,840
They can rely on their own

85
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,720
and the Muzu clan.

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
Keep an eye on them.

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
But don't interfere.

88
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,800
I want to see

89
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,480
what good luck they'll bring

90
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,720
under the cover of the eye.

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,280
Your Highness, how is he?

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,720
Can he be cured?

93
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Just tell me what you want to say.

94
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
Your Majesty and Your Highness

95
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,320
are very concerned about his illness.

96
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,040
I've tried my best.

97
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,520
His Highness is really

98
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,720
very powerful.

99
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,880
In that case,

100
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,680
I'll go back to report to Your Majesty and Your Highness.

101
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,720
No one is stopping you now.

102
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,640
Just say what you want to say.

103
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,560
Your Highness,

104
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,960
I've seen the same symptoms before.

105
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,880
I think the Crown Prince's symptoms are not a fever,

106
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,200
but a severe cough.

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,840
The poison is called Bilu.

108
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,040
Bilu?

109
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,440
When did you see it?

110
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,760
Before the late empress died.

111
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,000
I wonder when I can send this good news in.

112
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,280
Even the God has seen me.

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,800
You can't go in.

114
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,160
You can't go in.

115
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,320
You can't go in.

116
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,640
You can't go in.

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
You...

118
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,320
Yunxiu, go and see

119
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,920
who dares to

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,720
act in my palace.

121
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Yes.

122
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,160
Xu Chuyun, what do you mean?

123
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,000
You broke into the palace with a bow and arrow.

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,320
Don't you want to live?

125
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,080
Your Highness,

126
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,400
give me the antidote.

127
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,600
What...what antidote?

128
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,480
Bilu's antidote.

129
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,920
How dare you!

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
Your Majesty.

131
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,200
Crown Princess Consort,

132
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,800
what are you doing?

133
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,480
Father, you're here at the right time.

134
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,360
Please persuade the Noble Consort

135
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,120
to give me the antidote.

136
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,520
What antidote?

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,120
What did you do?

138
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,640
Your Majesty, I did nothing.

139
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,320
Your Majesty, please help me.

140
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,480
Crown Prince didn't get any food

141
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,000
but was poisoned by Bilu.

142
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,560
In the palace,

143
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,880
except for the Noble Consort,

144
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,880
who else would do such a thing?

145
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
You're talking nonsense.

146
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
How could I do such a thing?

147
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,840
Crown Prince was poisoned

148
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,320
after the Wolf's Claw.

149
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,560
Who else would do such a thing?

150
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,120
Your Majesty, you're wronged.

151
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,080
I did send the food there.

152
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,960
But it wasn't just the Crown Prince who ate it.

153
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,400
His Majesty and all the ministers were also poisoned.

154
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,160
How could it be only the Crown Prince?

155
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,520
What's wrong?

156
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,040
Crown Princess Consort,

157
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,640
no matter what,

158
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,960
you shouldn't have entered the palace

159
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,400
and kidnapped the Noble Consort.

160
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,120
You're being insolent.

161
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,560
As long as we can get a way for the Crown Prince,

162
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,000
we can have a sword and a temple.

163
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,640
Your Majesty, you don't know yet, right?

164
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,880
A few days ago, the Eastern Palace broke into the assassin's house.

165
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,120
If it wasn't for Chu Yun,

166
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
he would have been in a lot of trouble.

167
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm afraid that the Crown Prince

168
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,040
would have been gone long ago.

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,440
This matter

170
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,040
was also done by the Noble Consort Shu.

171
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,520
No, no, no.

172
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,840
It wasn't me.

173
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,000
I was just removed from the Jin Clan.

174
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,520
How could it be me?

175
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Your Majesty,

176
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,440
Your Majesty.

177
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,080
Father, look.

178
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,560
The pulse of the late Empress

179
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,320
is no different from the pulse of the current Crown Prince.

180
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,360
Are you going to watch

181
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,000
the late Empress's only blood

182
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,680
die in the netherworld?

183
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,400
Noble Consort Shu,

184
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,560
are you guilty?

185
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,280
Your Majesty,

186
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,040
I didn't do anything.

187
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,000
What crime did I commit?

188
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320
I didn't know that the Crown Prince was poisoned.

189
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,440
The late Empress was poisoned.

190
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,320
Do you want to blame it on me?

191
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,600
Shut up!

192
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,280
You killed the royal heir.

193
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,840
You will be punished for this!

194
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,400
Crown Princess Consort,

195
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,920
let go of Noble Consort Shu first.

196
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,480
I will definitely

197
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
give her the antidote for the illness.

198
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,600
You worried about the Crown Prince and lost your mind.

199
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,400
I won't blame you today

200
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,640
for breaking into the palace late at night.

201
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
You may leave.

202
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,840
Noble Consort Shu killed the Crown Prince

203
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,480
to shake the country

204
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,840
and break into the Cold Palace.

205
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,000
Noble Consort Shu,

206
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,480
you are not going out?

207
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,960
Thank you, Father.

208
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,320
I will wait outside the palace for the antidote.

209
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,920
You all may leave.

210
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,080
I will wait outside the palace for the antidote.

211
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,920
I will wait outside the palace for the antidote.

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,120
What should I say and what shouldn't I say?

213
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,920
My beloved consort, do you know?

214
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,600
I hope you can tell me the truth.

215
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,080
I hope you can tell me the truth.

216
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,880
Please tell me the truth, Father.

217
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,160
I was reckless today.

218
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,440
It's good that you know the truth.

219
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,240
I will tell His Majesty.

220
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Go!

221
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,680
You gave yourself the stimulus.

222
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,000
Even if you are slow to kill the poison,

223
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,360
you will still hurt yourself.

224
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
Are you going to kill yourself?

225
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
It's fine.

226
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,880
As long as that woman

227
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,760
has no chance to turn around,

228
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,320
it's worth it.

229
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
You can't just sit there and do nothing.

230
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,960
There must be someone

231
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,600
who can help you out.

232
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,880
The more you know, the less people you will have.

233
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,080
The others will believe you.

234
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,360
By the way, where is Chu Yun?

235
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,120
On my way here,

236
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,480
I heard that he broke into the palace for you.

237
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,120
He kidnapped Noble Consort Shu and asked her to hand over the antidote.

238
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,560
I wonder what's going on in the palace now.

239
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,360
I thought that she was just a part of your plan.

240
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,240
I didn't expect you didn't tell me about her.

241
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,240
She is too reckless.

242
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,800
You must help me out.

243
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,240
I will protect her.

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,400
Yes.

245
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,320
Go.

246
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,240
Thank you, Lord Jiang.

247
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,200
The way you look after me

248
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,600
makes the world spin un 뭘

249
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,800
As the heat gets weaker and weaker

250
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,160
Colors humorously lie on the pale

251
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:48,680
On that

252
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,680
The clouds are full of shadows.

253
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,680
Is it the moonlight that illuminates the spring?

254
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:03,680
Or is it the moon that you hold in your heart?

255
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,680
The old world is trapped in the abyss, it doesn't dare to retreat.

256
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,680
The wind and moon are like the changes in the seasons, who is it that the heart is talking to?

257
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Don't try it, don't be blinded by it.

258
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:31,680
This is my most hard-working yearning.

259
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,680
When the regrets of the past are locked in the palace,

260
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,680
Only true love can return the years of the past.

261
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,680
How can the past be hidden?

262
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,680
The star in your eyes is the moon.

263
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,680
The clouds and wind are full of shadows.
