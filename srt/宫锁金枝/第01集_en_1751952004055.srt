00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,480
Episode 21

3
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,600
Since she multiplied over seven times,

4
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,320
she has been more部分 than otherubis.

5
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,560
Is she finally able to

6
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,000
control her barrier Officel Then?

7
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,400
How dare you shortcuts to the crown prince.

8
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,360
You want to be pair with me?

9
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,080
You are the Crown Prince?

10
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,480
From that day on, I had torelive about this little girl.

11
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,180
I'm not sure why she aged that late.

12
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,080
It was probably because she was going exhausted to not move around.

13
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,600
It must be because someone else else always kept my would.

14
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,280
It's best to let her stay for now.

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,520
She might ask who she is if she chose someone else to marry!

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,480
I'll be fine as long as my child is here!

17
00:01:51,480 --> 00:02:00,820
Dear Miss

18
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,820
The person is right here.

19
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,340
Remember, move faster.

20
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,340
Sister, don't worry.

21
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,300
Take care of them.

22
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,540
After one hour,

23
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,740
you must bring His Majesty here.

24
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,340
т

25
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,340
intervention

26
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,940
and tea 마지막.

27
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:27,700
And is also very engaged

28
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
Why don't you look at me?

29
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,060
The Lady looks wrong.

30
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,820
I'll call for a doctor.

31
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,320
I like you.

32
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,480
You strands of shit!

33
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
What are you going to do?!

34
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,660
What?

35
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,940
Call the imperial physician.

36
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,900
Yes.

37
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,660
Don't make any noise.

38
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
Let them see us.

39
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,180
Yes.

40
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,500
Your Majesty,

41
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,980
Miss Xu is indeed poisoned.

42
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,980
You may leave.

43
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,620
Yes.

44
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
I'll go and check.

45
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,380
Yes.

46
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,900
Yes.

47
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,500
Yes.

48
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,100
Yes.

49
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,700
Yes.

50
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,300
Yes.

51
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,900
Yes.

52
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,500
Yes.

53
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,100
Yes.

54
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,980
It's so rude to

55
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,660
break the engagement before the marriage.

56
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,260
Your Majesty, look.

57
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,580
What's the point of

58
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,380
discussing the engagement?

59
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,500
Since the crown prince is so anxious,

60
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,500
I can only grant him the marriage.

61
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,300
Your Highness,

62
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,260
you grant the engagement so hastily.

63
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,020
Are you satisfied with the imperial decree?

64
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,500
It's my parents' order.

65
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,020
I dare not to grant it.

66
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,500
Then you're willing to marry

67
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,900
a woman who is so ridiculous.

68
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,820
It's not a good idea to grant the engagement

69
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,820
after a feast.

70
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,980
Miss Shen of Xianghu

71
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,940
knew that Concubine Shu

72
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,740
wanted to marry Xu Chuyun.

73
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,380
She would definitely kill Xu Chuyun.

74
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,540
But I didn't expect

75
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,220
this princess

76
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,820
knew about Shen Yunyuan's plan

77
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,380
and she had a relative with me.

78
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,420
She used my crown prince's affair

79
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,980
to push the engagement.

80
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,100
I knew about her plan.

81
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,740
But I didn't expect she would be so cruel to herself.

82
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,700
Since she gave me the step,

83
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,900
if I didn't go along with it,

84
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,540
I would waste her plan.

85
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,820
That's the truth.

86
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,820
She is the most suitable

87
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,500
and weak

88
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,660
crown prince's wife.

89
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,420
So,

90
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,260
you decided to marry her?

91
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,260
Yes.

92
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,260
That's good.

93
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,780
Once the wedding is held,

94
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,540
the crown prince has the right to be the regent.

95
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,740
He can also make a public decision

96
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,820
and plan for many years

97
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,620
to start the wedding.

98
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,460
Mr. Qiang,

99
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,820
the time has not come yet.

100
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,260
At least,

101
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,980
after the wedding,

102
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,020
you should know that

103
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,500
the wedding in the Eastern Palace

104
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,740
will not be as simple as we think.

105
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,100
Three months ago,

106
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,260
the man in the mask

107
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,900
disguised as a bandit

108
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,820
and put our Xu family in danger.

109
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,940
How could this happen?

110
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,220
Goddess of Mercy, Uncle Zhang!

111
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,820
How could this happen?

112
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,940
My lady,

113
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,180
Master is so powerful.

114
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,380
He will be fine.

115
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,860
Don't worry.

116
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,940
My lady!

117
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,180
Who is it?

118
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,980
Go!

119
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,340
Stop!

120
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,380
How could a bandit

121
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,780
with such a mask and skill?

122
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,820
He is a bandit.

123
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,020
So,

124
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,780
it's just an excuse.

125
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,380
The real enemy

126
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,940
is in this imperial city.

127
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,180
My lady,

128
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,380
this is the life bottle of the crown prince, Jiang Yingsheng.

129
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,300
I haven't seen such a strict man for a long time.

130
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,260
Be careful.

131
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,860
Don't kill him.

132
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,420
He is useful.

133
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,820
Uncle!

134
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,700
It's... It's Guo.

135
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,220
Back then,

136
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,060
he was the uncle of the prince, Guo Heng.

137
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,820
I just

138
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,620
hid the evidence of the treason

139
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,980
in the Zhao's mansion.

140
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,780
Guo Heng pointed it at me.

141
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,060
Guo Heng.

142
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,020
Your Highness, your leg...

143
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,380
Your Majesty.

144
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
You must stop hurting her.

145
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,260
Your Majesty,

146
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,540
there must be something wrong with Liu Sh wake up.

147
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,260
She is out of control.

148
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,300
Delay is human nature.

149
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,500
She just is me who should follow this code.

150
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,140
The keyword

151
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,460
should be hiding.

152
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,460
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

153
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,460
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

154
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,460
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

155
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,460
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

156
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,460
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

157
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,460
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

158
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,460
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

159
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,460
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

160
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,460
I'm afraid I can't be with you.
