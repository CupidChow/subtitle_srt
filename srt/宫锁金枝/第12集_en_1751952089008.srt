1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,760
One more son ofì°©

2
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:54,760
durch

3
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,280
I heard that the Eldest Prince

4
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
is just fine

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
and like you.

6
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,400
For you.

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,840
sell the paper with the state

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,440
If the crown prince is not well-informed

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,400
Find out the truth

10
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,480
I don't know how many corrupt officials are there

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,680
No, this paper is so funny

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,760
Can you count on these people

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,880
Really do things for the people

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,480
Yes, this time

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,520
Really angry

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,840
Not only deprived all

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,320
The workers who participated in the paper

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,920
Also ordered their family within three generations

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,320
Not allowed to participate in the examination

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,440
Officials who participated

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
All are interrogated

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,440
And the family's paper

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,480
Have been left a thousand miles away

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,920
We have the crown prince

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,440
Such a good crown prince for the country and the people

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,840
Have a good life in the future

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,280
Yes

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,720
Right

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,600
Let's go

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,080
Go

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,440
The crown prince is now clear

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,520
The eldest prince is now cornered

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,000
It seems that there is no big deal

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,440
But how did the third prince take the money himself

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,720
He also bought officials

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,360
I actually only punished him for three years

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,320
As long as the noble consort Shu is still in favor

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,280
The third prince will be fine

39
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
Just buying and selling official positions

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,400
If this matter is not too big

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,240
The emperor can't cover it

42
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,120
Even the eldest prince will be fine

43
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,920
why

44
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,360
Listen to my dad

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,920
Our emperor

46
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,320
Likes to play with the quq

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,680
The more the quq is played

48
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,000
The happier he is

49
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,280
You say

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,280
Now there is no reason to be poor

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,360
One quq

52
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,160
How can he not

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,760
In his eyes

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,520
Now the crown prince

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,480
Even more rich

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,560
Lucky or not

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
It depends on fate

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
Husband is back

59
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,400
Thank you for your care these days

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,920
Husband is the one

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,600
You can have a good meal these days

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,480
If I don't let the kitchen

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,000
Prepare some food for the mountain

64
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,400
Later

65
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,400
Let Uncle Liu come to massage your husband

66
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,400
These are not a big deal

67
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,760
Come

68
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,200
Let me take a good look at the lady

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,880
Have you missed me these days

70
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,240
Madam

71
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,760
I naturally miss my husband

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,200
You are the one in this world

73
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,720
Most precious person

74
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,800
Husband is naturally also me in this world

75
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,320
Most caring person

76
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
Husband has been working hard these days

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,600
I have already prepared

78
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,880
Hot water soft soup

79
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
After dinner

80
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,600
Just rest early

81
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll go to the kitchen again

82
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,880
it is good

83
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,920
Then the lady also rest well

84
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,920
I'll come to you later

85
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,200
The lady has been looking different these days

86
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,760
How different

87
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,920
Much calmer

88
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,120
Since the accident at home

89
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
The lady has always been in a state of shock

90
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,320
Although I also joke with others

91
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,120
But I can see

92
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,760
The anger on the lady is not gone

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,240
These days are much calmer

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
I don't have a heart now

95
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,120
I don't have a heart now

96
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,960
I can't calm down at a moment

97
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,520
If I don't forget the hatred

98
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
But lady

99
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,200
You calm down

100
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,240
This is a good thing

101
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,000
Calm down

102
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,920
To find out everything

103
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,080
You are right

104
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,880
Calm down

105
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
To find out everything

106
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,680
Your Highness

107
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Madam, why are you here

108
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,480
Did I bother you

109
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,800
Not bad

110
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,200
Sit down quickly

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,160
I have read almost all the books I brought

112
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,840
Want to find from your husband

113
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,880
A few books

114
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,520
The second book on the left of the book

115
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,000
All kinds of travel

116
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,240
Look, do you like it

117
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,200
This Eastern Palace

118
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,080
Nothing is impossible for you to touch

119
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,160
I have found one

120
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,640
Can find something you like

121
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
Did I scare you

122
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,480
No

123
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,800
I read too weak?

124
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I was too weak, right?

125
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,400
These notes...

126
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,920
Mother, you've grown used to it.

127
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,760
Every time you read the book,

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,960
you write down your thoughts and thoughts.

129
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,160
This way,

130
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,560
it helps to deepen my memory.

131
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,520
You're so brilliant.

132
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,320
You've opened up Chu Yun's eyes.

133
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,720
It's just some notes.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,800
What's wrong?

135
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,440
Are you surprised?

136
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,760
My Lady,

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,920
you mean

138
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,360
the Crown Prince is not the so-called grass bag?

139
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,520
In a letter,

140
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,000
you can find the method of implementation of the national policy

141
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,320
and the analysis.

142
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,720
How can such a person be a grass bag?

143
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,320
But everyone says so.

144
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,000
The Crown Prince is not in good health.

145
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,200
He's not well-educated.

146
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,360
Either everyone has misunderstandings about him,

147
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,840
or he's been trying to get the good news.

148
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,040
If he's trying to get the good news,

149
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,320
why is he not hiding anything from me?

150
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,560
Be careful.

151
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,320
Isn't...

152
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,720
Isn't he the cleaner of the garden?

153
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,120
Why...

154
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,120
Su Zhu,

155
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,280
do you think the Eastern Palace we see now

156
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,880
is the real him?

157
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,720
How many secrets

158
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,800
is hidden in this palace?

159
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,400
It's really him.

160
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,960
Your Highness.

161
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,600
Your Highness.

162
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,360
Your Highness.

163
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Your Highness.

164
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,000
Your Highness.

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,800
Your Highness.

166
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,640
Your Highness.

167
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,560
Your Highness.

168
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,400
Your Highness.

169
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,280
Your Highness.

170
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Your Highness.

171
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Your Highness.

172
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Your Highness.

173
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Your Highness.

174
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
Your Highness.

175
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Your Highness.

176
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Your Highness.

177
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Your Highness.

178
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Your Highness.

179
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Your Highness.

180
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Your Highness.

181
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Your Highness.

182
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Your Highness.

183
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Your Highness.

184
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Your Highness.

185
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Your Highness.

186
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Your Highness.

187
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Your Highness.

188
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Your Highness.

189
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Your Highness.

190
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Your Highness.

191
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Your Highness.

192
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Your Highness.

193
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Your Highness.

194
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Your Highness.

195
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Your Highness.

196
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Your Highness.

197
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
