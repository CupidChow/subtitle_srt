00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,020
Charging

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,740
Wiring

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In the Name of People

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Episode 17

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,000
Show yourself.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,320
which could make a Arabic politics

7
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,760
more effective.

8
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,720
I was too年前

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,060
to think about what Jewish party

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,400
used it to do and what looks like to seem a burden.

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,460
That is why

12
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,360
I am willing to accept that as my hand Ram一些

13
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,960
I thank you for the warm welcome

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,280
which I'm glad to have.

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,180
Venice

16
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,720
What an

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,560
She was so friendly.

18
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,120
She never want to see the crown prince in death.

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,740
Choose Yang Jian sacr highness as his wife.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,300
Princess.

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,220
You want to meet my highness?

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,740
Highness.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,700
Crown princess is here.

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,700
I wanted to keep going,

25
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,700
but I think I scared someone.

26
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Where is Suzhou?

27
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,700
I had a talk with my wife.

28
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,700
I asked Xue Ping to take her to the market.

29
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,700
Jiang Yusheng, you are so good.

30
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,700
I can't beat you.

31
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,700
You are wrong.

32
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,700
When did I fight with you?

33
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,700
You are not in any problem.

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Your legs are fine.

35
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,700
You know I have seen it.

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,700
But you still sit on the wheelchair to see me.

37
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,700
You just play me with the mask.

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,700
It's not enough for you to be humble.

39
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,700
The Eastern Palace is under my control.

40
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,700
But there are some parts left.

41
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,700
I didn't mean to lie to you.

42
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,700
You didn't lie to me?

43
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Jiang Yusheng,

44
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,700
do you think I am a girl who is being bullied by you?

45
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
Xuan Jiawei?

46
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,700
I said why you hate me so much.

47
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,700
You killed me and poisoned me.

48
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,700
It's because of the dragon door on the mask.

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,700
What?

50
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
You admit it?

51
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,700
Zhou Ying,

52
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,700
you are so cruel.

53
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
You are so cruel.

54
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,700
I don't want to be a woman.

55
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
You admit it?

56
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
The dragon door is mine.

57
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,700
Sure.

58
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,700
But I am not your enemy.

59
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
The Xu family is dead.

60
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,700
Of course you can say whatever you want.

61
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,700
Jiang Yusheng,

62
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
today here,

63
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
it's not you who die,

64
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,700
but me.

65
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
Jiang Yusheng, let me go.

66
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,700
If you can, kill me.

67
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,700
Otherwise, I will not die or die with you.

68
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,700
Madam,

69
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,700
if I say I am not your enemy,

70
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,700
but the savior.

71
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,700
You are a savior.

72
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
You...

73
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
My jade pendant.

74
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Because I saved them,

75
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,700
I have the letter from your father.

76
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
Don't cry.

77
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,700
I only had time to save the Xu family.

78
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
I only had time to frame their body.

79
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
But I was wronged.

80
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Don't touch me.

81
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,700
Qianci.

82
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Why are you still arguing with me?

83
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,700
I have proved it to you.

84
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,700
Your parents' love letter,

85
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,700
and the letter your father wrote to you.

86
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,700
You are a mother.

87
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700
You know who is the culprit.

88
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,700
But you keep lying to me.

89
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,700
You think I am crazy.

90
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,700
Is it interesting?

91
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,700
I admit that the method is indeed wrong.

92
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
But if I told you at the beginning,

93
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,700
you would be suspicious.

94
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,700
I tried to get you into the Eastern Palace,

95
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
just to protect you.

96
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
But I never thought that

97
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
you would get this mask

98
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
and misunderstand me.

99
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
Why do you misunderstand me?

100
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,700
You are suspicious when you see it.

101
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Wait.

102
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,700
You tried to get me into the Eastern Palace.

103
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,700
It's not my plan.

104
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
You...

105
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
If I don't cooperate,

106
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Shen Yuanyuan's plan won't work.

107
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,700
We are even.

108
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
I want to see my parents.

109
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,700
Not now.

110
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Your parents and other relatives

111
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
are in a different place.

112
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
My father has many children.

113
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
If he finds out,

114
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
he will definitely harm them.

115
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Then...

116
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
This letter

117
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,700
may be forged by you.

118
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
I don't know.

119
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,700
I made it.

120
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
No matter how much your husband knows,

121
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
he won't know

122
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
that you are a bird

123
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
and fell into a pit.

124
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,700
Stop talking.

125
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,700
I...

126
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
I believe you for now.

127
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,700
If you lie to me,

128
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,700
I will kill you.

129
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
We are the same.

130
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
We should work together.

131
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
Do you understand?

132
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
Who wants to work together with you?

133
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
You can't do that.

134
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
There will be a feast in the palace.

135
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
You should go, too.

136
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Don't show up.

137
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Are you pretending?

138
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,700
I am good at it.

139
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Okay.

140
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Let's drink with the children.

141
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Cheers, father.

142
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
The eldest brother was still there

143
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
at the last feast.

144
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
But now,

145
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,700
don't show your face

146
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
to the royal family

147
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
like the eldest brother.

148
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Yes.

149
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,700
I remember

150
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,700
your mother

151
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,700
suggested this feast.

152
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,700
We should

153
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,700
have a feast together

154
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
and leave the officials

155
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
and the common people

156
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,700
to have a meal together.

157
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
It's been so many years.

158
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
Although the feast is here,

159
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,700
your mother

160
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
has left us for a long time.

161
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,700
Father,

162
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
we can't chase the dead.

163
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,700
The past is in the past.

164
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,700
It's not a good idea.

165
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,700
We should take care of ourselves

166
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
and cherish the people in front of us.

167
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

168
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
Now,

169
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
the Imperial Concubine is with you.

170
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,700
We are a family, too.

171
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,700
We are harmonious and happy.

172
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Well said.

173
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
Well said.

174
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Father,

175
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
I'll propose a toast to you.

176
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
My sister is right.

177
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
Every time the festival is over,

178
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
you will think of your old friends

179
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
and think of the good old days.

180
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
I'm the blood

181
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
left by the late queen.

182
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
And the Imperial Concubine

183
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
is the one

184
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
who serves the late queen.

185
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
It's all the memories

186
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
left by my mother.

187
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Father is right.

188
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
It would be great

189
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,700
if mother were still here.

190
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
I'll propose a toast to you.

191
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Yes.

192
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
If my sister could see it,

193
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
she wouldn't want

194
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
His Majesty and Sheng'er

195
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
to be so sad.

196
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
In my opinion,

197
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
next time,

198
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
we should add more people

199
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
to our family.

200
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
My dear, you're right.

201
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
You two are married.

202
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,700
You should try to get me

203
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
to marry my grandson soon.

204
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
I know.

205
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,700
I know.

206
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,700
Father.

207
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Shut up.

208
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Say one more word.

209
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
You don't have to come to the palace.

210
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Drink slowly.

211
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,700
To get my grandson back soon,

212
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,700
I'll propose a toast.

213
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Come on.

214
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
You're so clumsy.

215
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,700
You hurt me.

216
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,700
Go away.

217
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
I'm just being gentle.

218
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,700
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

219
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
You can continue

220
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,700
to make your dumplings.

221
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Go and make a bowl of bird's nest for your lady.

222
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,700
Don't be a troublemaker.

223
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
What are you going to do next?

224
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
Are you going to help me with this?

225
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,700
I'll help you achieve your goal

226
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,700
by meeting my parents and relatives soon.

227
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
Now, I'm in the eyes of the public.

228
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,700
For the sake of the matter

229
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,700
of Imperial Concubine Shu and Jiang Yuanhao,

230
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,700
His Majesty will choose to support me.

231
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
First,

232
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
I can't be a useless woman anymore.

233
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,700
It's time to stand up.

234
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
His Majesty is killing people

235
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,700
because of the outsiders.

236
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,700
I can understand that.

237
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
But I don't understand

238
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,700
why he treats you like that.

239
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
He even said that

240
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,700
he loved the late Empress.

241
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
He only loves himself.

242
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,700
We are princes.

243
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
We are not his sons.

244
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
We are his pawns.

245
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,700
Everything

246
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
should go according to his will.

247
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
Insolent.

248
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,700
Jiang Yuanhao

249
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
is a lunatic.

250
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Including me.

251
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
Are you afraid?

252
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
Am I not crazy?

253
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
At worst,

254
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
I'll die in vain.

255
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,700
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,700
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,700
I'm sorry.

263
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
I'm sorry.

264
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,700
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,700
I'm sorry.

267
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,700
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,700
I'm sorry.

272
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,700
I'm sorry.

273
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
I'm sorry.

274
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,700
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,700
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
I'm sorry.

278
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
I'm sorry.

279
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
I'm sorry.

280
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,700
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,700
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
I'm sorry.

285
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,700
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,700
I'm sorry.

287
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
I'm sorry.

289
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
I'm sorry.

290
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,700
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,700
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,700
I'm sorry.

295
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
I'm sorry.

296
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
I'm sorry.

297
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
I'm sorry.

298
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,700
I'm sorry.

299
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
I'm sorry.
