5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Your Highness,

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
the invitation from the Third Prince

7
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
is for the Crown Princess.

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
For me?

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Yes.

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Shen Yuanyuan

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
actually asked me to go to her mansion

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
to attend the feast of the Shouyue Festival.

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Not to mention

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
that we are already friends.

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Jiang Yunhao didn't stop me.

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I've told you

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
that she only keeps the house.

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Madam,

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
it's time to go.

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Suzhu,

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
go to the mansion

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
and find me a nice face.

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Yes.

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Greetings, Third Princess.

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Please rise.

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Although I'm the Princess,

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm not as close as

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
my sisters.

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Sisters,

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
don't be jealous of me.

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Why don't you see the Crown Princess?

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
She hasn't come yet.

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
The Third Princess is inviting you.

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Why don't I come?

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Greetings, Your Highness.

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Please rise.

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Third Sister,

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
it's been a long time.

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
This is the first time

40
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
that you've seen me

41
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,200
as the Third Princess.

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Greetings, Crown Princess.

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Third Sister, please rise.

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Please rise.

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
It's really lively today.

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Where is the gold?

47
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
How is the arrangement

48
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
of the things I ordered?

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Don't worry, Your Highness.

50
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
That's good.

51
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
I must catch

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
that beautiful little horse today

53
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
and lock it up for a few times.

54
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Is that okay?

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Yes.

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Good.

57
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
So beautiful.

58
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Third Sister,

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
you're really a great singer.

60
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Mother, please forgive me

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
for being the Princess.

62
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
I should keep my attitude

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
at all times.

64
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm the one who's being ignorant.

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
It's normal for the Crown Princess

66
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
to come to the capital

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
for a short time

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
and enter the Eastern Palace.

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
It's normal

70
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
to not know much.

71
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
It's not embarrassing

72
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
to ask the Third Princess

73
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
for advice.

74
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Guo Cai,

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
you...

76
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
What?

77
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
You're just like a humble lady.

78
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
You're just like a humble lady.

79
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
What are you proud of?

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
When the Crown Prince is fired,

81
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
you're just a Crown Princess

82
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
who's going to be fired soon.

83
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Are you okay?

84
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Are you okay?

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Are you okay?

86
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Look.

87
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
What's wrong with you?

88
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
You're just a Crown Prince.

89
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
How many brains do you have?

90
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Crown Princess, she...

91
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
You let her go

92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
and she's so fierce.

93
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Is that the Third Prince's benefit?

94
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Does the Third Prince

95
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
have any ulterior motives?

96
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
You're the daughter

97
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
of the House of Qiao, right?

98
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Is that how your father

99
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
raised you?

100
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Please show me

101
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
your way.

102
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
My clothes are wet.

103
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I'm going to change.

104
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Yin Zhu,

105
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
take the Crown Princess to the room.

106
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
The Crown Princess's power

107
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
is really different from the one in the Palace of Pure Emotion.

108
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
The Crown Princess

109
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
is...

110
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
You're trying to pretend to be the Crown Princess

111
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
and the Crown Prince.

112
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Guards!

113
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Take her away.

114
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
No, let me go.

115
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Zi Fen.

116
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
No, you can't.

117
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
You can't go.

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Useless.

119
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
You don't want to see me

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
just like that?

121
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Why is the Third Brother here?

122
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Third Brother?

123
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
You're so cunning

124
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
to follow that useless person.

125
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Please be kind, Third Brother.

126
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
That's the Crown Prince,

127
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
your brother.

128
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Brother?

129
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
I never

130
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
let that useless person

131
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
in my sight.

132
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I never let that useless person

133
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
in my sight.

134
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I never let that useless person

135
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
in my sight.

136
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
This time, the Ministry of Revenue

137
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
lost the official position.

138
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
He will be punished by his father.

139
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
I wonder

140
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
if I can still

141
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
keep his position as Crown Prince.

142
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
The Thunder and the Fall of the Fallen

143
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
are all military affairs.

144
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
Interesting.

145
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
You're just following

146
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
that useless person.

147
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
What can you do?

148
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Don't worry.

149
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
By then, I will definitely

150
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
take you to my side

151
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
and be your concubine.

152
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
One day, when you

153
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
ascend to the throne,

154
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
you will be the one to be the concubine.

155
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Jiang Yun Hao, you're so arrogant.

156
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Let go of me.

157
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Your Highness.

158
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Why are you here

159
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
instead of hosting the banquet outside?

160
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
I'm just here to see

161
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
how the Crown Princess' clothes are changing.

162
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
But why is Your Highness

163
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
in the room

164
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
prepared for the female guest?

165
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Do what you should do.

166
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Xu Chu Yun.

167
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
What are you doing?

168
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
You're bullying me.

169
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
I advise you

170
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
not to be too arrogant.

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Let's talk.

172
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Okay.

173
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
What's wrong with her?

174
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
The Crown Princess and the Third Prince

175
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
haven't come back yet.

176
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Let's go and see them.

177
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
The Crown Princess is missing.

178
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Help me find the Crown Princess.

179
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Why isn't she here?

180
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
I'm begging you.

181
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Help me find her.

182
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Okay.

183
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Your Highness.

184
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Your Highness.

185
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Your Highness.

186
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Your Highness.

187
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Your Highness.

188
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Your Highness.

189
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Your Highness.

190
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Your Highness.

191
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Hurry.

192
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
This...

193
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
What's going on?

194
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
What's going on?

195
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Your Highness.

196
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Your Highness.

197
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
There's blood.

198
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
There's blood.

199
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
How could there be blood?

200
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
What's going on?

201
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
This is the hairpin of Her Highness.

202
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Father.

203
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
You must help me

204
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
to get the Third Emperor

205
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
to hand over the Crown Princess.

206
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
What does this have to do with me?

207
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
My Princess Consort is missing too.

208
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Third Brother.

209
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
We're brothers.

210
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Why are you being so rude?

211
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Even if I was the one who

212
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
got you into trouble

213
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
you can't do anything to Chu Yun.

214
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
She's innocent.

215
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
You're deaf.

216
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
I said I didn't do it.

217
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
She disappeared from your mansion.

218
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
The Third Prince's mansion is heavily guarded.

219
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
How could she disappear without a reason?

220
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Are you a dog?

221
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Father.

222
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Enough.

223
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Speak.

224
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
The Crown Prince and my family

225
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
are saved.

226
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm grateful for this.

227
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
I'm sure that the Crown Prince

228
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
will be able to save the Crown Princess.

229
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
What I want you to do is simple.

230
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
It's just that

231
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
you can do whatever

232
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
the Third Prince wants you to do.

233
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
It's just that

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
at the critical moment

235
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
don't forget who you're with.

236
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Yes.

237
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
I don't know either.

238
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
It's just that

239
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
the Third Princess ordered me

240
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
to

241
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,200
put the Crown Princess in the dark

242
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
and destroy her reputation.

243
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I didn't mean to do that.

244
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
I just followed

245
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
the Third Princess's orders.

246
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I think you want to die.

247
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Shut up.

248
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
The Third Prince is currently

249
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
confined in the palace.

250
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
The Crown Prince investigated the case

251
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
of the Third Princess and the Third Princess missing.

252
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I'm allowing you to search the Third Prince's mansion.

253
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Father.

254
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
I accept the decree.

255
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
The light is flickering.

256
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
It's as if snow is falling on my shoulder.

257
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
I'm awake in that world

258
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,200
and looking back at you.

259
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,200
The clouds are cloudy

260
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
and the moon is still in the sky.

261
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Is it the moonlight

262
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:24,200
or the moon in your heart?

263
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,200
The old world is still in my eyes.

264
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
The clouds and the moon are like the stars.

265
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Who are you talking to?

266
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Don't be greedy.

267
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Don't be a playboy.

268
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I'm a little greedy.

269
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,200
When the regret of the past is locked in the palace

270
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Only true love can return the years of the past.

271
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,200
I once saw the past

272
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,200
and you saw the past.

273
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:22,200
The clouds and the moon are like the stars.

274
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,200
The old world is still in my eyes.

275
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,200
The clouds and the moon are like the stars.

276
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,200
The old world is still in my eyes.
