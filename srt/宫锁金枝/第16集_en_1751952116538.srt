1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Here's a Japanese knife from smile irons

2
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:47,920
This less valuable hàng

3
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Its attraction seems really personified

4
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,560
team members of Dalong 부장

5
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,080
must support him.

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,800
Jerk.

7
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,880
Tea.

8
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,560
Okay.

9
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,320
Dragons.

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,240
What?

11
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,720
What's wrong?

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Your Highness, you're dressed like a woman.

13
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,920
You really have the face of a sword.

14
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,320
Just this once.

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,920
I won't listen to you.

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Okay.

17
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,120
Queen, you're useless.

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,320
All right.

19
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:44,840
Between

20
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,560
Opposite

21
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,440
Opposite

22
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,560
Opposite

23
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:49,960
Opposite

24
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,360
Opposite

25
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,560
Let's put her down

26
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
What do you use to make a bet?

27
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
There's a deed.

28
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
Okay.

29
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,920
But the ugly part is in front of you.

30
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
If you can't pay it back,

31
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
the deed will be ours.

32
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
I understand.

33
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
I understand the rules.

34
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,920
If you're in a hurry,

35
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
we have a lot of money.

36
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
If we can't pay it back,

37
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,920
As long as we can solve the current problem,

38
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
we can do anything.

39
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
That's great.

40
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
I'll write a receipt for you.

41
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Why are you still standing here?

42
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Let's get a lady to pour some water.

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
This way.

44
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
This is a good place to get some energy.

45
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
This way.

46
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
This way.

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Take your medicine.

48
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Take your medicine.

49
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Let me go.

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Let me go.

51
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Let me go.

52
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Let me go.

53
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Let me go.

54
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
I beg you, shopkeeper.

55
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Please give me back the land.

56
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
That's my family's life.

57
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
If you let me go,

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
I'll pay you back.

59
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Get out of here.

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,920
You've been dragging me for so long.

61
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
You still want to drag me?

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Dream on.

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Shopkeeper,

64
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
give me some time.

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
If my family doesn't have land,

66
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
how can I live?

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,920
You can't let our family be destroyed.

68
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
Shopkeeper, I beg you.

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Shopkeeper.

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Let go of me.

71
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Are you looking for death?

72
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
You...

73
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Beat him out.

74
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Shopkeeper.

75
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Yes.

76
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Let's go.

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Shopkeeper.

78
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Shut up.

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Money.

80
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Take it.

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Enough.

82
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Let's go.

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
You poor guys.

84
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
You!

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Chu Yun, are you okay?

86
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
I'm fine.

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm fine.

88
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm fine.

89
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
I'm fine.

90
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Are you okay?

91
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm fine.

92
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Where are you?

93
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Here.

94
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Over there.

95
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Over there.

96
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Uncle.

97
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
Uncle.

98
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
Uncle.

99
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm dead.

100
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm dead.

101
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Uncle, are you okay?

102
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Why did you save me?

103
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Why?

104
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Let me die.

105
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Why?

106
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
What's on your mind?

107
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Didn't you get into a fight because you didn't have money?

108
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Answer me a few questions.

109
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
We'll give you money.

110
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
You have to give me money?

111
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
There's more.

112
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I have money.

113
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
I finally have money.

114
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
I won't starve to death.

115
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
I can buy food for my dad.

116
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Thank you.

117
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
You're welcome.

118
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Uncle, get up.

119
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Uncle, what happened?

120
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,920
It's a long story.

121
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,920
I was sick a few days ago.

122
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
I didn't go to see a doctor.

123
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
I didn't expect the illness to be so serious.

124
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,920
It costs a lot of money to see a doctor.

125
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Our money is not enough.

126
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,920
My mother couldn't help it.

127
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,920
She went to the bank and borrowed money to see a doctor.

128
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Uncle, are you okay now?

129
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Yes.

130
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,920
After I recovered, I went to pay off my debt.

131
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,920
The Prime Minister said it was three cents.

132
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
When I went to pay off the debt,

133
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,920
they told me it was three cents every month.

134
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Next month, they would add the total amount of last month.

135
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,920
It's been several months.

136
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,920
I actually owe them 16 taels of interest.

137
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,920
I owe them too much money.

138
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
I can't afford to pay it off.

139
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Then they took my house and land away.

140
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,920
I can only live in a shabby temple.

141
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
But it's not over yet.

142
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,920
They still want me to pay off the debt.

143
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,920
How can we live?

144
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
I'm starving.

145
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,920
The money house is really dark.

146
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,920
How can they live with so little money?

147
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,920
How can they live?

148
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,920
I heard from the farmers that the land and house

149
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,920
were taken away by the people in the money house.

150
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Who can they sell it to?

151
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Other farmers?

152
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,920
They should sell it to the government as a landless land.

153
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,920
The money house won't leave any evidence.

154
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,920
The money is really over.

155
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,920
They use government money to lend to the people.

156
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Then they get huge interest from the people.

157
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
If the people can't pay it back,

158
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,920
they can take their land and house and sell it to the government.

159
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Then they can get another share of the money.

160
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,920
They empty the treasury and suppress the people.

161
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Only the people behind them can keep the money.

162
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
They are so bold.

163
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Who could it be?

164
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Jiang Yun Hao?

165
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
You're smart.

166
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,920
Then how can we find this place?

167
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Come with me.

168
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
This...

169
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Be careful.

170
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
It should be here.

171
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,920
We've found Guan Yin's real location.

172
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
But now,

173
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,920
if we want to find the money house,

174
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,920
it might alert us.

175
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,920
But the case of the five-way secret has caused Jiang Yun Hao to lose a lot.

176
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
If we want to catch him again,

177
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,920
we need to find a chance.

178
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
He will keep us safe.

179
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
No.

180
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
He will keep me safe.

181
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
The temperature is just right.

182
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Do you want to write it together?

183
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,920
My husband has been working hard recently.

184
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Working hard.

185
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
In this case,

186
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
I should enjoy it.

187
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Okay.

188
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Take a shower.

189
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Remember to call someone if you want hot water.

190
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
I'm sorry.

193
