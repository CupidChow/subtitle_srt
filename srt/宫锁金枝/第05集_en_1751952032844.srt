1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,960
The

2
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,320
Final

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

4
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
I thought that you only liked books.

5
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,760
I never thought that you would like music this much.

6
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,160
I just don't know what it is.

7
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,360
Can I see your handwriting?

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,800
Husband, I haven't finished packing yet.

9
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,120
When I'm done, you can come and see.

10
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,360
This zither is beautiful and has a good quality.

11
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,160
If I pack it with you,

12
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,080
although I'm not good at it,

13
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,400
I know music very well.

14
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
I'm also curious about your collection.

15
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,280
I wonder what instrument is in those boxes.

16
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Husband! Husband!

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Husband,

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,680
last night was our wedding night.

19
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,680
But I got drunk.

20
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,360
Husband, the sky is empty.

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
But I...

22
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Why do you say that?

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
What's the point of regret?

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,360
My wife and I will have a good day in the future.

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Your Highness, Lord Jiang is here.

26
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
I know.

27
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Husband, you go ahead.

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Okay.

29
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,360
I'll talk to you later.

30
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Let's go.

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Are you okay, Miss Bai?

32
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
I'm fine.

33
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,360
This is the information from the prince.

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,360
It's the official list of the imperial examination.

35
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Maybe...

36
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,360
My brother is going to interfere in the imperial examination.

37
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
I've checked the files of Dali Temple.

38
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
The imperial examination is over.

39
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
Some people reported the fraud of the imperial examination.

40
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
But...

41
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,360
But in the end, it's over.

42
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,360
The person who covered up the truth is like the concubine Shu.

43
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
She's smart.

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,360
But she can't touch the imperial examination with the power of the Shu family.

45
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,360
My brother's mother is a scholar.

46
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
My grandfather is a great man.

47
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
The Tao is full of miracles.

48
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,360
It's easy to interfere in the imperial examination.

49
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,360
You mean, it's made by Grand Tutor Guo?

50
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,360
No.

51
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Grand Tutor Guo is old.

52
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
He doesn't care about the world.

53
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
He thinks he's a great man.

54
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
He has his own pride.

55
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
But he's old.

56
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
I can't stand the people below.

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Everyone thinks I can't live until the day of the imperial examination.

58
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Although the concubine Shu's help made the third emperor suffer.

59
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,360
But my brother has a reason.

60
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,360
It's normal for the country to do something behind the scenes.

61
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Then we...

62
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,360
We can get the news.

63
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Others can.

64
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,360
We just recorded it.

65
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,360
We can't do anything without a plan.

66
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Keep an eye on it.

67
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Don't worry about the snake.

68
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,360
I know.

69
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
I know.

70
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Let's go.

71
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Go!

72
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Go!

73
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Go!

74
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Your sword skills are getting better.

75
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
You should go back and rest in peace.

76
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I have this idea.

77
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
But now,

78
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
the most important thing is...

79
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
Uncle Liu came with me.

80
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
He knows my purpose.

81
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
You're a doctor.

82
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
I told him.

83
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
I've prepared soup and medicine for the crown prince.

84
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,360
I've got his trust.

85
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
I want to ask you.

86
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Is there any medicine that's colorless and tasteless?

87
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,360
There are many kinds of medicine.

88
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,360
There are several kinds.

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,360
How long do you want to be honest?

90
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,360
I just joined the Eastern Palace.

91
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm still a little bit confused.

92
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,360
At least I have to wait until I get pregnant.

93
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
After I find out the truth.

94
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
I know.

95
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Please wait for a few days.

96
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
I'll prepare the medicine.

97
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Uncle Liu.

98
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Please prepare some medicine for nourishing your body.

99
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
My mom always needs to be considerate.

100
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
So she can get the trust of the crown prince.

101
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
So she won't be suspicious of me.

102
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
I know.

103
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
I'll send it to you today.

104
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Thank you, uncle Liu.

105
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,360
Uncle Liu, thank you for your hard work.

106
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Thank you, uncle Liu.

107
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,360
You're really great.

108
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Thank you.

109
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Thank you.

110
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,360
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Let's go.

114
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Let's go.

116
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Go.

117
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm not sure.

118
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
You mean,

119
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
we should send more people to investigate?

120
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
No need.

121
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
No need to make any noise.

122
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Since he's here to see me,

123
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
there must be a second move.

124
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Now,

125
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
we're in the dark.

126
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
As long as we wait patiently,

127
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
we'll definitely find him.

128
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Next time he comes out,

129
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
we must make him look good.

130
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
Alright.

131
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Let's go to the kitchen

132
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
and see how the food is today.

133
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Okay.

134
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Let's go.

135
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
My dear husband,

136
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
hot pot is the best for winter.

137
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Today,

138
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
I've prepared some meat and blood for you.

139
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
They're all good ingredients for your health.

140
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,360
I'm not that bad, am I?

141
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Here, the meat is ready.

142
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Try it, my dear.

143
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Don't bother.

144
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
I can do it myself.

145
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Okay.

146
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Eat it.

147
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
I'll give you another bottle of blood.

148
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
I can do it myself.

149
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
My husband is busy all day.

150
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
He can't get sick

151
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
even if he eats this.

152
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Eat it.

153
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Okay.

154
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Okay.

155
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
This little girl

156
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
is really a torturer.

157
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Why am I the only one in Nan Sheng?

158
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Why are you here?

159
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
The crown princess is so strong.

160
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
She hid a dagger under the pillow

161
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
and almost hurt me.

162
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
It's you again.

163
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Why are you here again?

164
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
So what?

165
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
I can come here whenever I want.

166
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
But the crown princess

167
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
misses me.

168
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Shameless!

169
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Let me go!

170
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
I saved her life.

171
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Does she

172
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,360
care about our relationship?

173
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
What relationship?

174
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
If you're surrounded by guards

175
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
in the Eastern Palace,

176
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
you can't escape

177
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
even if you have the skills.

178
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
I don't care.

179
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
If the crown princess

180
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
wants others to see us,

181
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
we're the same.

182
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
I don't mind.

183
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
I'll do more.

184
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
What do you want?

185
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm here to help you.

186
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
The crown princess

187
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
wants the crown prince's life.

188
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
How about

189
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
I help you?

190
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
How about it?

191
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Nonsense!

192
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,360
You don't want to kill the crown prince?

193
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Or you want to

194
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,360
kill the whole imperial family?

195
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
How about I help you?

196
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
The premise is

197
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
you and me.

198
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Do you think

199
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
I'll believe your evil?

200
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,360
The clouds are cloudy.

201
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Is it the moonlight

202
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:18,360
or the moon in your heart?

203
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,360
The old world is trapped in the eyes.

204
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,360
The clouds and the moon are like the changes in the world.

205
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Who are you talking to?

206
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Don't try it.

207
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Don't be blinded by it.

208
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Conceal my

209
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,360
greedy yearning.

210
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
When the regret of the past

211
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,360
is locked in the taste,

212
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Only true love

213
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,360
can return the years of the past.

214
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,360
How can the mask be hidden?

215
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,360
The star in your eyes

216
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:15,360
is like the clouds and the moon in your heart.
