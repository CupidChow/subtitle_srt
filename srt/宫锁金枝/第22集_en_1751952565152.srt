00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,860
Episode 12

2
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,580
Imperial father!

3
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,580
Where is father?

4
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,580
Father!

5
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,580
Someone!

6
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,580
Crown Prince

7
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,580
is trying to kill the Emperor.

8
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,580
Take him down.

9
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,580
Who dares?

10
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,580
Third Brother,

11
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,580
what are you doing?

12
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,580
Of course, I'm catching the traitor.

13
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,580
Second Brother, you're already the Crown Prince.

14
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,580
You're going to kill father

15
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,580
and ascend the throne?

16
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,580
Take him down!

17
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,580
Jiang Yun Hao is really a traitor.

18
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,580
Shen Yuan Yuan didn't lie to us.

19
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,580
If he knew, he would have transferred the imperial guards to us.

20
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,580
He didn't lie to us about this.

21
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,580
But we were caught

22
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,580
because of him.

23
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,580
He came to tell us

24
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,580
just to lure us into the palace.

25
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,580
If it weren't for him,

26
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,580
we wouldn't have decided to enter the palace now.

27
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,580
This woman

28
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,580
really never has good intentions.

29
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,580
But she really

30
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,580
wants to give her whole family's life to me.

31
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,580
Don't panic, Madam.

32
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,580
It's hard to tell who's the traitor.

33
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,580
Let's go find my father.

34
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,580
Jiang Yun Hao has controlled all the imperial guards in the palace.

35
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,580
It seems that

36
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,580
he has been planning for a long time.

37
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
Let's go.

38
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,580
Look.

39
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,580
Where did this little rat come from?

40
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,580
You're really not dead.

41
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,580
Your Majesty.

42
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,580
How does the taste of the bilo

43
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,580
taste?

44
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,580
You, a poisonous woman,

45
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,580
this is definitely not the first time

46
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,580
you've done such a poisonous thing.

47
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,580
Of course it's not the first time.

48
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,580
Your Majesty

49
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,580
knows better than I do.

50
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,580
Crown Prince,

51
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,580
do you think

52
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,580
I killed your mother?

53
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,580
I didn't kill her.

54
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,580
Isn't it?

55
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,580
Indeed,

56
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,580
I was the one who poisoned her.

57
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,580
You finally admitted it.

58
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,580
It's really you.

59
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,580
It's really you.

60
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,580
Is this just a matter of hate?

61
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,580
Your Majesty,

62
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,580
you're also the murderer.

63
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,580
Continue.

64
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,580
The late Empress was in the harem.

65
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,580
She and His Majesty were young couple.

66
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,580
From the most vulnerable prince

67
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,580
to the emperor,

68
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,580
the love between husband and wife

69
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,580
was unquestionable.

70
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,580
Everyone in the capital was envious.

71
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,580
His Majesty and I

72
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,580
also want such a love.

73
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,580
So you were

74
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,580
so mean to her.

75
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,580
That's right.

76
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,580
I was mean to her.

77
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,580
But no matter how good the love is,

78
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,580
it will change.

79
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,580
If you hadn't

80
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,580
had a child with her,

81
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,580
how could I have poisoned her

82
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,580
under the protection of her?

83
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,580
You're talking nonsense.

84
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,580
This is just

85
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,580
your heart.

86
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,580
Heart?

87
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,580
Your Majesty,

88
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,580
do you remember

89
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,580
you told me

90
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,580
I'm the one

91
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,580
you love the most?

92
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,580
I know everything you want.

93
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,580
So,

94
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,580
I'll help you.

95
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,580
Right?

96
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,580
You're so vicious.

97
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,580
Mother,

98
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,580
there's the blood of the Zhao family on you.

99
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,580
Do you know

100
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,580
the late Empress,

101
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,580
her family,

102
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,580
and the courtiers

103
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,580
are all members of the Zhao family?

104
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,580
They want to rule

105
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,580
their own country

106
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,580
and let their own kids

107
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,580
be emperors.

108
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,580
Isn't that

109
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,580
the simplest thing?

110
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,580
I will never do that.

111
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,580
Really?

112
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,580
You will never do that?

113
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,580
What about the Xu family?

114
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,580
The Xu family has half of the army.

115
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,580
Don't they have any sense of disdain?

116
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,580
Shu Qi.

117
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,580
You are really a fool.

118
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,580
You are really crazy.

119
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,580
Shu Qi.

120
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,580
You finally started calling me Shu Qi.

121
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,580
Your Majesty, I know your mind.

122
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,580
Your world is taken away.

123
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,580
What you are most afraid of is being taken away.

124
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,580
Right?

125
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,580
Although you don't say it,

126
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,580
I can see it.

127
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,580
So I will help you.

128
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,580
After that, I killed the Empress.

129
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,580
I solved the troubles secretly.

130
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,580
For you, I can do anything.

131
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,580
Without these obstacles, I can be your true love.

132
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,580
Unfortunately...

133
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,580
Unfortunately,

134
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,580
you never love me.

135
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Your Majesty.

136
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,580
Your Majesty.

137
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,580
I have one wish in my life.

138
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,580
Please grant me.

139
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,580
Say it.

140
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,580
Before I die,

141
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,580
I want to see my son one last time.

142
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,580
I know you are worried.

143
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,580
Let me be your sword.

144
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,580
As long as you wish,

145
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,580
I can do it.

146
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,580
Please grant me.

147
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,580
Your Majesty, he is too much.

148
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,580
Now the prince is in prison.

149
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,580
You made him locked up.

150
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,580
Other princes are young.

151
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,580
Only the crown prince is your family.

152
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,580
Do you think the emperor will tolerate it?

153
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,580
He won't.

154
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,580
If I die,

155
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,580
I will have a chance.

156
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,580
Here it is.

157
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,580
That's all.

158
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

159
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,580
Your Majesty.

160
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,580
Get ready to go to the crown prince's mansion.

161
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,580
Your Majesty.

162
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
Your Majesty.

163
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,580
What else do you want to say?

164
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,580
Your Majesty.

165
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,580
Have you ever really liked me?

166
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,580
I have a little affection for my beloved.

167
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
You...

168
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,580
How dare you assassinate me?

169
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
Somebody.

170
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
Somebody.

171
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,580
Somebody.

172
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,580
Get her.

173
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,580
Su Guifei assassinated.

174
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,580
You have a private affection for her.

175
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,580
You are too cruel.

176
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,580
Go.

177
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,580
Go to the imperial study and tell them

178
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
I am dead.

179
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,580
You are so vicious.

180
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,580
The empress is not vicious.

181
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,580
You killed her.

182
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,580
I am so happy to see you two

183
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,580
enter the palace.

184
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,580
Your Highness.

185
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,580
What do you think of my plan?

186
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,580
Tomorrow morning,

187
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
everyone will know

188
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,580
that you killed your father and

189
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
took the throne.

190
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,580
And my son is the meritorious minister

191
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,580
who killed and rebelled.

192
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,580
He is the emperor.

193
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,580
I will kill him.

194
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,580
You are so cruel.

195
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,580
You are so vicious.

196
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,580
You killed your father and

197
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,580
took the throne.

198
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,580
Your Highness.

199
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,580
Do you think the ministers are fools?

200
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,580
You can't even see

201
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,580
such a simple trap?

202
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,580
You are right.

203
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,580
You are right.

204
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,580
But

205
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,580
for my plan,

206
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,580
nothing is lost.

207
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,580
You

208
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,580
should all die.

209
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,580
Whoever kills them,

210
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,580
I will give him the title of

211
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,580
the imperial minister.

212
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,580
I will reward him with thousands of gold.

213
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,580
I will send the crown prince

214
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,580
to the empress.

215
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,580
Your Majesty,

216
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,580
you should stay with me.

217
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,580
The light is flickering.

218
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,580
It's like snow falling on my shoulder.

219
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,580
I am in the middle of the world.

220
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,580
I am looking back at you.

221
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,580
The clouds are cloudy.

222
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,580
Is it the moonlight

223
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,580
or the green grass

224
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,580
that you grow in your heart?

225
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,580
The wind is blowing.

226
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,580
Is it the moon that you embroider?

227
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:55,580
The old world is trapped in the abyss.

228
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,580
The moon is like a?

229
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,580
Who is it that you are talking to?

230
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,580
Don't try to talk.

231
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,580
Don't lie.

232
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,580
Don't lie.

233
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,580
Don't lie.

234
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,580
Don't lie.

235
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,580
Don't lie.

236
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,580
Don't lie.

237
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,580
Don't lie.

238
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,580
Don't lie.

239
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,580
Don't lie.

240
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,580
Don't lie.

241
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,580
Don't lie.

242
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,580
Don't lie.

243
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,580
Don't lie.

244
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,580
Don't lie.

245
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,580
Don't lie.

246
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,580
Don't lie.

247
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
The clouds and wind are cloudy.

248
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,580
The moon is like a?

249
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,580
Who is it that you are talking to?

250
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,580
Don't lie.

251
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,580
Don't lie.

252
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,580
Don't lie.

253
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,580
Don't lie.

254
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,580
Don't lie.

255
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
Don't lie.

256
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,580
Don't lie.

257
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
Don't lie.

258
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Don't lie.

259
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,580
Don't lie.

260
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,580
Don't lie.
