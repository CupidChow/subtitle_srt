1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Debut

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I heard that the Crown Prince hurt His Highness a few days ago.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What nonsense.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It was just an accident.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Really?

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It seems that my cousin has a deep opinion of you.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's just a couple's emotions.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't think it's a good thing.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I think you should be careful.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's just a couple's emotions.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You don't understand.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Cousin, aren't you going to tell cousin about this?

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's not the time yet.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If we tell her in a hurry,

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
everyone will be in danger.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Then we have to find a way to reveal something.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If she is always in the valley,

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
it's hard to avoid her.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
She will be in trouble sooner or later.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I have my own opinion.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Your Highness, our people have got the Juzi list.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So fast?

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Only the list is not enough.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I heard that the Crown Prince is much better these days.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The officials also praised him.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It seems that it's different to marry a wife.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Sheng'er is indeed much better.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But it's still a bit difficult to do the job.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It still needs more experience.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Your Majesty, don't worry.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
With Mr. Guo's company,

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the Crown Prince will definitely do it smoothly.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If my sister sees it, she will be happy.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If Sheng'er is here,

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
she will be happy.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Happy?

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When the Spring Festival begins,

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
that bitch will come out of the coffin.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She will be so angry that she will die.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What are you waiting for?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hurry up and pack up.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Husband, you've been very busy lately.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You need to use more.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You too, Madam.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You don't have to worry too much.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This lotus seed soup is light and hot. It's good for your health.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Madam, please wait.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This bowl is not cold or hot.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's just right for the mouth.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Madam, please use this bowl.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's wrong?

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Nothing.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry, Your Highness. I deserve to die.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I deserve to die. I'm sorry, Your Highness.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hurry up and go get punished.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is Madam injured?

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
No.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Husband, I'll go get changed.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Madam,

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't rush to get up.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Listen.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Your heartbeat is beating so fast.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You must be scared.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Suzhu.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Suzhu.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How is she?

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
She's fine.

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
She's practicing her zither in the room.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's good.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Clean up everything.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't leave any traces.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Your Highness, considering this poisoning,

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
this is the second time the Crown Princess has killed you.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This...

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Your Highness, friendship is always like this.

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If the Crown Princess is like this, what if one day she doesn't investigate,

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and then she hurts you? How can we be involved in preventing thieves?

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Shut up.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How can you let the Crown Princess do things?

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm being too harsh.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you care so much about the Crown Princess,

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
why don't you tell her about those things?

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can also eliminate misunderstandings.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
True heart is for true heart.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Wait a little longer.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The Crown Princess's heart is so deep.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
She hid it so well.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
She actually played me so well.

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Do I still have a chance to kill her?

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
My Lady, what are you doing?

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm fine.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll just calm down.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
My Lady, don't be anxious. We didn't get discovered this time.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We still have a chance. We don't have time to be anxious.

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Maybe she already found me.

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's just that she didn't tell me.

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
She's just acting with us.

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
There's news from Ding'er.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Ding'er has already found the list of all the participants.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
She also checked their address.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
They all copied one copy. They didn't clean up the mess.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
My Lady, what should we do next?

110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What else can we do?

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Send her out.

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll go check on her.

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes.

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You really did appear.

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The Crown Princess Consort was completely surprised.

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I would appear here.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How many times have you been in the Eastern Palace

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
like a mirrorless mirror?

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You are in the Eastern Palace.

120
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Does it hurt?

121
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's just a skin wound. What hurts?

122
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Have you ever thought about finding the wrong person to avenge you?

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm not a fool. I can't let go.

124
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If it wasn't for the Crown Prince, what would you do?

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When I find out the truth and avenge him,

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
if it really wasn't him,

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll give him my life.

128
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What are you going to do?

129
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Wait a little longer.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll give you the truth.

131
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Wait a little longer.

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What do you mean?

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Soon, you'll know the whole truth.

134
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You'll also know that the Crown Prince

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
just wanted to protect you.

136
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What right do you have to say that?

137
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who are you?

138
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Or do you want to say that you are him?

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Since you don't dare to show your true face

140
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and you don't want to kill me,

141
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
then don't try to hide it here.

142
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Qing不要想要셔

143
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What?

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Your Highness.

145
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Come here, catch him.

146
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Start working through his Vampire School standards.

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,680
I already gave you my 혼 ambush

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,600
and started attacking him.

149
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Go.

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Start.

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
What kind of protection is that?
