1
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,420
Yuan concert

2
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,820
2 years ago

3
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,940
Why can't we see the crown prince

4
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,740
I heard that his body has recovered.

5
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,740
Is he sick again?

6
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,540
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince has been on leave.

7
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,940
He hasn't been attending the court for a while.

8
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,340
It's because the Crown Princess has been looking for a divine doctor

9
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,940
who can cure the Crown Prince's leg.

10
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,140
That's why he's on leave.

11
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,340
That's great.

12
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,740
Shen'er's leg is finally saved.

13
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,940
Shuang'er will be happy to be in heaven.

14
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,940
Send my decree. Let the head of the Imperial Hospital treat him.

15
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,940
Yes.

16
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,340
How is it? Is there any improvement?

17
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,740
Reporting to Your Highness,

18
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,540
the medical skills of the divine doctor Liu is indeed outstanding.

19
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,940
The dust and blood in the Crown Prince's meridians has been removed.

20
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,940
Can the medicine that has been revived be used?

21
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,340
The secret of the sect's secret technique is only in the skill of the poetry needle.

22
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,740
It can't be used for other purposes.

23
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,740
I understand.

24
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,340
Congratulations to Your Highness.

25
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,740
In less than two months, you will be fully recovered.

26
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,540
It's all thanks to the Crown Princess's divine doctor who invited me.

27
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,540
As long as the Crown Prince is able to be in peace, Chu Yun will be at ease.

28
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,940
Can the divine doctor Liu discuss

29
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,140
to prevent the medicine from being left out?

30
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,940
Of course. Let's talk outside first.

31
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,140
Of course.

32
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,140
Your Highness, we'll take our leave.

33
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,340
I didn't expect that I really couldn't see your real condition.

34
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,340
If it wasn't for this medicine, I wouldn't be able to live until now.

35
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,140
But it's all thanks to Dr. Liu

36
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,340
that he actually changed that prescription.

37
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,940
It made my body look like it was recovering.

38
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,540
Of course.

39
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,340
I'm not the only one who's not recovering.

40
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,940
I'm the one who's not recovering.

41
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,940
It looks like it's recovering.

42
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,540
Of course.

43
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,940
The Liu family's students are really amazing.

44
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,740
Indeed.

45
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,540
Even the secret medicine of the past dynasty, Deng Xian, can be found.

46
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,140
The Crown Prince's illness is indeed recovering.

47
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,540
Replying to Your Majesty, I've confirmed that the Crown Prince's pulse is recovering.

48
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,740
That girl from the Xu family is really capable of finding someone like her.

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,140
During the time that the Crown Prince is recovering,

50
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,140
I need to know his recovery progress.

51
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,540
I will obey your order.

52
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,340
I didn't know that you know this much of martial arts.

53
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,140
So what if I know a lot?

54
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,740
I still can't beat you.

55
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,140
Chu Yuan, don't compare yourself to me.

56
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,340
My martial arts method is different from the common people.

57
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,740
The price I pay is also very high.

58
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,540
Can I take a look?

59
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,940
Of course.

60
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,740
If there's a chance, I'll definitely let you see it.

61
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,740
The Eastern Palace has already prepared a martial arts arena for you.

62
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,940
We can go to the competition later.

63
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,340
Okay.

64
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,740
The weather is already good.

65
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,340
Can't the Crown Prince still attend the court?

66
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,940
The Crown Prince's body is weak.

67
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,940
I'm afraid that he needs to rest for a few more days.

68
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,740
A few days ago, I heard that

69
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,140
the cotton curtain hanging on the Eastern Palace's bedside hall

70
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,940
is still hanging there.

71
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,740
I'm afraid that it's not suitable for him to sleep.

72
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,740
I'm afraid that he'll be too tired to sleep.

73
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,340
I'm afraid that he'll be too tired to sleep.

74
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,740
The cotton curtain hanging on the Eastern Palace's bedside hall

75
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,740
is still hanging there.

76
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,140
Look at him.

77
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,940
He's already raised such a son.

78
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,540
He's even inferior to the Princess of the Ruo Bu Jin Palace.

79
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,540
The Crown Prince has arrived!

80
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,740
This...

81
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,540
This is really a golden dragon.

82
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,740
This is really a golden dragon.

83
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,340
This is really a golden dragon.

84
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,340
This is really a golden dragon.

85
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,340
Is your leg okay?

86
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Thanks to Your Majesty's grace, I've recovered.

87
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,140
I've come to report to you.

88
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,540
Is your leg really recovered?

89
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,540
After Liu Shen entered the palace, he used his family's acupuncture skills

90
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,140
to connect my meridians.

91
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,540
Now, his activity is no different from the usual people.

92
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,540
In the future, he won't be absent from the court meeting

93
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,340
and will make you worry.

94
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,940
This is your blessing.

95
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,940
Thank you, Father.

96
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,140
Third Emperor, this is my position.

97
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,340
You should make some room.

98
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,140
Of course.

99
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,940
The Crown Prince is going to stand properly.

100
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,940
Stop sighing.

101
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,620
Whoa!

102
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,340
How was it?

103
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,540
This is not complete sometine!

104
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,940
Wow...

105
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,840
This is great.

106
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
It's indeed a very ShareGeneral.

107
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,340
The figure on her forehead is the latest.

108
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,940
If I can't manage to obtain it,

109
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,340
then that will be my failure to Address Her Majesty.

110
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,940
What are you saying?

111
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,140
After all this time, Eng Of Crescent drums and the Dashing Expectations

112
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,380
can only be collected

113
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,740
if you can do something else.

114
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,940
to be a lowly servant and save your reputation?

115
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,820
Or do you want to be like Jiang Yun Mo,

116
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,220
who is a scoundrel?

117
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,340
It's just that some officials

118
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,540
are buying and selling officials.

119
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,700
It's not a big deal.

120
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,940
Father punished me.

121
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,060
Why do you mention it?

122
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,380
Why don't you use your brain

123
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,820
to complain?

124
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,580
So what?

125
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,420
I'm still the one that father favors the most.

126
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,660
Now the crown prince has already stood up.

127
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,940
A strong and strong prince

128
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,380
is standing in the court.

129
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,420
You know your father's temperament.

130
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,700
He values dignity the most.

131
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,940
You know that

132
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,820
he won't easily give up.

133
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,220
It's really difficult

134
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,180
for you to fight with him now.

135
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,700
So what?

136
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,780
Can he help us with the Mu family?

137
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,180
He doesn't.

138
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,740
His Zhao family is dying.

139
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,620
Can he compare with me?

140
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,180
Although you say so,

141
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,860
no one can say for sure about the future.

142
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,140
Haowen.

143
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,260
Since you married Shen Yuanyuan,

144
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,460
you must have the assistant of the prime minister.

145
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,380
You must hold on to him.

146
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,460
Do you know that?

147
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,420
No.

148
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,220
You...

149
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,180
I know.

150
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,220
The imperial school of Xiu Shan is a great talent.

151
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,860
We got the crown early

152
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,140
to open the treasury in time

153
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,420
to avoid delaying the big event.

154
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,460
But the most urgent thing now

155
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,980
is the Ministry of Revenue.

156
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,580
The law of the Great Qing Dynasty

157
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,140
is divided into two parts.

158
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,700
Without the internal media in his hands,

159
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,580
he can't get in no matter how urgent it is.

160
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,380
Why hasn't the person who went to invite him come back?

161
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,380
You go too.

162
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,220
Go to the minister of Revenue's official place to persuade him.

163
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,380
Yes.

164
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,020
My lord.

165
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,900
My lord.

166
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,100
My lord.

167
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,140
The minister...

168
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,460
What's wrong?

169
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,700
He's dead.

170
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,140
The whole family is dead.

171
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,380
Dead?

172
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,940
The minister of Revenue

173
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,940
and a family of old and young are dead.

174
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,900
My family is dead.

175
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,860
Three million taels of silver is not enough.

176
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,900
Great.

177
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,220
This is a great news.

178
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,580
Crown prince.

179
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,940
Tell me.

180
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,540
How much money does the Great Qing Dynasty

181
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,220
pay every year?

182
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,780
Father.

183
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Three years in Ruian,

184
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,140
the tax of the upper part of the 13 provinces

185
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,300
is 20 million taels.

186
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,060
Among them,

187
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,140
the richest people in Ruian

188
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,620
get 3 million taels.

189
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,980
3 million taels.

190
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,100
It's not easy.

191
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,900
Did you lose the money?

192
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,620
You stole my Ruian province.

193
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,700
You stole my country.

194
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,460
We are guilty.

195
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,940
We are all guilty.

196
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,100
If you can't find the culprit,

197
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,780
I'll kill you

198
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,180
to get back the 3 million taels.

199
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,460
Yes.

200
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,860
Director Lam asks for it.

201
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,140
What's the case?

202
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:13,260
In case the

203
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,340
threeating life

204
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,060
exists after that,

205
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,140
I guess you've made up your mind.

206
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,900
The Imperial Cemetery is heavily guarded.

207
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,820
Minister Lu is dead.

208
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,300
It's a dead end.

209
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,980
The one who did it will be dead.

210
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,140
Even in front of His Majesty,

211
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,420
he won't get any benefits.

212
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,580
Yes.

213
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,620
In that case,

214
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,700
we need a man who can live and die.

215
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,580
Then we can take the responsibility.

216
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,300
I won't let you down.

217
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,180
I won't let you down.

218
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,860
I'll make His Majesty satisfied.

219
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,340
And His Highness will be satisfied.

220
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,460
Okay.

221
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,380
Let's go, Minister Shen.

222
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,580
Your Highness.

223
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,780
Are you paying your respects?

224
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,740
Your Highness.

225
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,100
What gives Your Highness the fragance to

226
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,500
demand from me in the study?

227
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,940
Well, it's村 Ну.

228
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,100
村hem?

229
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,140
Fixed emissary is here.

230
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,780
You're the only one who can do it.

231
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,300
This is not a case of investigation.

232
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,180
I just want you to be the scapegoat.

233
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,140
This kind of thing that is not good for the outside world

234
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,340
and it's also annoying people.

235
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,980
It's natural to push me

236
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,140
to the crown prince who is old and useless.

237
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,900
Moreover,

238
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,340
my third emperor

239
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,260
can't stand the fact that I've been in a good mood recently.

240
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,060
He naturally wants to do everything to help me.

241
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,100
It's best to fail

242
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,700
and lose the imperial seal.

243
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,660
A hidden person

244
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,180
can't hide anything.

245
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,060
I meanronics winning.

246
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,660
I can't friendly

247
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,740
but I can teach you a great lesson.

248
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,020
For him,

249
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,860
There must be something.

250
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,200
traitsite

251
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,460
I looked through the Taiconop Base once approximately three months ago

252
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,140
berry trees and중풍이

253
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,400
At the time, SDF is all there,no problem

254
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,600
I'm not interested in it.

255
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,080
There's no difference between

256
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,800
putting silver in the vault and stone.

257
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
Once it flows out,

258
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
it's a big deal for the people.

259
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
In three months,

260
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,800
if there's a big amount of silver in the vault,

261
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,600
how could it

262
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,680
not affect anything?

263
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
Six months.

264
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,800
At this time, silver is missing.

265
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Your Highness, I've thought of something important.

266
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Go and check it out.

267
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
The light is flickering,

268
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,000
as if snow falls on my shoulder.

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,400
I'm in the middle of the world,

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
looking back at you.

271
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,000
The clouds are cloudy,

272
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,400
is it the moonlight,

273
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:38,400
or the moon in your heart?

274
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
The old world is empty,

275
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,400
I can't see it.

276
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
The wind and moon are like two birds,

277
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,400
who are you talking to?

278
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,400
Don't talk about it.

279
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Don't talk about it.

280
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,400
This is my

281
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,400
most hard-working yearning.

282
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:17,400
When the regret of the past is locked in the palace,

283
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:24,400
only true love can return the years of the past.

284
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,400
The mask was once hidden,

285
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,400
but you are in your eyes.

286
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
The clouds and moon are like two birds,

287
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,400
who are you talking to?
