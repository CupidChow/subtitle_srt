00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Streets of Rage

2
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,240
Episode 31

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
I've checked the poems of Minister Lu's family for 800 times.

4
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,280
It's indeed self-punishment. No one forced me to do it.

5
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,600
And Taicangkou.

6
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,920
The wall is broken.

7
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
There's not even a single Haozidong.

8
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,680
Jiang Shaoqing is forbidden to enter the hall.

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,680
The court is frozen.

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,480
Miss, please calm down.

11
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,760
Even if this Luzi is a man of the sword,

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,400
there must be some traces in his family.

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,680
I've been looking for him again and again.

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,200
There's still nothing.

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,680
Where did he hide all the money?

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,080
Where did he hide it?

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
Don't...

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,560
Second Young Master.

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,440
This is about your future.

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,640
Why aren't you worried at all?

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,480
Jiang Xi, let me ask you.

22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Where is a cup of water hidden?

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,520
It's the hardest to attract attention.

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,280
A cup of water?

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,200
It's naturally hidden in the teapot.

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,520
That's right.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,400
Three million taels of silver.

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,600
Only when it's in the market,

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
it might not be hidden.

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
I understand.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
That's why people go to the ticket office to find out.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Such a large number of official places

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
are all with a patent.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,520
If you want to circulate in the market,

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,120
you must go to the ticket office to exchange for silver.

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,400
Not only that.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,000
If you exchange for silver,

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,800
you'll have a chance to get in touch.

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,600
No matter who's the owner or the owner,

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,000
you can always find out some clues.

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Second Young Master is a genius.

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll sit here and wait for the case to be solved.

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
It's already midnight.

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
Xue Ping hasn't come back yet.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,400
Did something happen?

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
Wait a bit longer.

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
How is it? Did you find anything?

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,600
Your Highness, Young Master Jiang.

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,400
I've already sent someone to check the tickets in the city.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
There's nothing to find.

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,600
And there's no extra silver.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,800
You're a genius.

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
You didn't find anything in the middle of the night.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,600
Is this what you want to tell me?

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,000
It seems that the task that you're doing,

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
isn't it satisfactory?

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,000
Your Majesty is very interested in this case.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,600
If you're doing it too slowly,

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,000
you should naturally ask for it.

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Then I think

61
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
my smart brother

62
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,600
has done a great job in the science department.

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Can he win another round this time?

64
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
Third Prince,

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
the case needs evidence.

66
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
Without evidence,

67
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,600
nothing can be done.

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,800
You're right.

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
But don't worry, Shen Xia.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
This time,

71
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,400
he won't find anything.

72
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,000
He won't find anything?

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
How could His Majesty do such a thing?

74
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
Such a big piece of inkstone,

75
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,600
he hit it with his head.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,000
He hurt such a big piece.

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,400
I, the Emperor,

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,400
hate people who don't ask for anything.

79
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,400
What he cares about is not the 3 million taels of silver,

80
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,800
but the authority that someone is trying to take away from him.

81
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,000
Now,

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,200
he can't find the author,

83
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,600
and he's angry and has nowhere to go.

84
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,400
He has to...

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,600
He has to come to me.

86
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Where is Crown Princess Consort?

87
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Is she in the mansion?

88
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
Miss.

89
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,000
This is the military medal that fell down.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,400
The original is gone.

91
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,600
These days, I secretly contacted

92
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
the elders in the army.

93
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,400
I also asked them.

94
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,600
Now, looking at the account book,

95
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,200
it's more certain.

96
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,000
What Miss said is...

97
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,800
Every June,

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
is the time when the court sends out the money.

99
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
But every time, it has to be delayed for a few months.

100
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,400
The longest time,

101
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,600
it has to be at the end of the year before the money can be sent out.

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,600
My father can't bear to see the soldiers shed blood and tears,

103
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
so he used his own money to make up for it.

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,200
General Xu, you're so considerate of us.

105
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I didn't expect it to become...

106
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
become...

107
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,800
become evidence that our Xu family

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,000
has joined the army

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and is trying to rebel.

110
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,200
I remember very clearly.

111
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,000
Every year, the money sent by the court

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
is also about three million taels.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
And the delay in sending out the money

114
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,400
is the same as the delay in sending out the money for the bank.

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,200
These past few days, Madam has been coming home late at night,

116
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
calling me...

117
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,600
Sister of Miss.

118
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,400
I've prepared a gift for you.

119
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,000
Do you want to see it?

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
Come here.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,400
The gold hairpin is not even in the right color.

122
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,600
The Crown Prince is really a beautiful woman.

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,200
This is the surprise that Madam prepared for me?

124
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,200
This is just a necessary step before sending out the gift.

125
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,800
Crown Prince, think about it.

126
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,400
Now, a dog at the Crown Prince's residence

127
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,600
could be the third prince's spy.

128
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
He's just waiting to see you get into trouble.

129
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,200
Even if you go out in disguise now,

130
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,600
you might be followed by two streets.

131
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
Now, besides putting on a disguise,

132
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,800
do you have any other ways to get out and investigate?

133
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
Okay.

134
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,800
Madam is right.

135
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,000
What you said makes sense.

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,600
This way.

137
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,400
Let me.

138
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,000
Is that okay?

139
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,800
Let's go.

140
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
What are His Highness and Madam doing?

141
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
That's how it is in the capital.

142
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,400
The army is delaying sending out the silver.

143
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
It's about four or five years.

144
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,400
It's just the right time to send out the silver.

145
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,000
As you said, the case is reasonable.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,200
Thank you for helping me.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
It's not just helping you.

148
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
If we can find out the case,

149
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,200
the soldiers at the border will not have to worry about the food.

150
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,000
This way.

151
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,800
How did you know it was here?

152
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,200
The money-slaver doesn't need to pay 3 million taels of cash.

153
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
What's the difference with the stone?

154
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,400
Since there's no ticket number,

155
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:59,140
it should be in the hands of those who put on the

156
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,000
money-slaver.

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,800
That way.

158
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Let's go.

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is the young lady here to see us?

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,400
I want to borrow some money.

161
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,600
Borrow money?

162
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Easy.

163
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Do you have any mortgage?

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,200
I have a deed.

165
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,400
I just need it urgently.

166
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,800
Can I borrow it today?

167
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,000
Today?

168
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,600
This is a serious deposit.

169
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,400
You need to go through the process of borrowing money.

170
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,800
After checking your mortgage,

171
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,600
it will take at least four or five days.

172
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
You need it urgently.

173
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,800
Brother, please be kind and let us know.

174
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,800
My family is really sick.

175
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,000
We can discuss the conditions.

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
Let's go.

177
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,600
If you can't do it, then you can't.

178
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200
If you're not happy, then don't bother me anymore.

179
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,000
Let's go. Hurry.

180
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,600
We've been targeted.

181
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,400
It's fine. It's him we're waiting for.

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,600
Sister, what should we do now?

183
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,200
If we can't borrow money,

184
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,800
Father, Mother,

185
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Eldest Brother and Second Brother will all die of illness.

186
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Don't panic, Sister. There must be a way.

187
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,400
Wait.

188
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,800
Please wait.

189
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,200
May I ask if you two are in a hurry to borrow money?

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,400
How did you know?

191
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
I saw you guys borrowing money from Hong Da Money House.

192
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,200
They won't lend it to you, right?

193
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,200
I know a place that can lend it to you.

194
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
But the conditions are harsh.

195
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
How is it?

196
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,800
Aren't you in a rush to borrow money? It's more important to save people.

197
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,600
Then I'll trouble Eldest Brother to lead the way.

198
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,200
Let's go.

199
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,200
The light is flickering

200
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
Set post with blood

201
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:51,600
arms

202
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,100
in the cloud

203
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,000
someone next to me

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
only organization
