Su Fun

00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,900
Episode 38

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:26,160
She has in her might a little

4
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to enter the study of the Prince's Mansion.

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Get out of the way!

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let me go!

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let me go!

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Search!

9
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,160
The Prince's Mansion

10
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Your Majesty,

11
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,360
I have something to report.

12
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Go ahead.

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,160
I want to report that the Third Prince, Jiang Yunhao,

14
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,760
Stealing the official seal of the Ministry of Revenue

15
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,960
and using it to recruit soldiers to buy horses

16
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
to rebel

17
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,160
This is the evidence

18
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Father, I am innocent

19
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Innocent

20
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,760
This is the account book found in your mansion

21
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,160
Is it fake?

22
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Yes

23
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,760
Father, this account book is fake

24
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,360
I have never seen it

25
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,960
The Crown Prince is trying to slander me

26
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
and make a fake evidence

27
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
Third Brother

28
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,760
This account book was found in your study

29
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,960
At the same time

30
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,960
I also found the Crown Princess's pearl hairpin

31
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,560
If the Crown Princess

32
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,960
broke your plan and made you catch her

33
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,960
I beg you to let her go

34
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,560
After all, the Crown Princess is innocent

35
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,160
The Third Princess

36
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,960
disappeared because of this?

37
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,160
The Third Prince's mansion was built

38
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
to cultivate grain and plant crops

39
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,960
It's not a few points worse than this palace

40
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,360
I just don't know

41
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,160
where the money for the mansion

42
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,360
came from

43
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Zhao Yusheng

44
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,160
I didn't expect the Crown Princess

45
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,760
to be so evil

46
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,760
I didn't expect the Crown Prince to be so useless

47
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Now he is so shameless

48
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
He is innocent and wants to accuse me

49
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Father, stop

50
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Do you have any respect?

51
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,760
The Crown Prince is your brother

52
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,160
He is my legitimate son

53
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
You dare to insult the Crown Prince

54
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,160
It seems that I have always

55
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,760
spoiled you too much

56
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,160
That's why you are so bold

57
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
Father

58
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
I ask you

59
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Where is the money for the mansion?

60
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,960
Where is the horse?

61
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,360
The horse

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
Tell me the truth

63
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Your Majesty

64
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,360
Your Majesty

65
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,360
I will never do anything

66
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,560
to harm you, Your Majesty

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,760
I am so loyal to you

68
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,960
How could I do anything

69
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,160
to hurt you?

70
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,160
Please, Your Majesty

71
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,760
Please, Your Majesty

72
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,360
Your Majesty

73
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,560
I am willing to be a burden to you

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Please, Your Majesty

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Please forgive me for this time

76
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Your Majesty

77
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,160
I just want to enjoy

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,360
I really have no other meaning

79
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,960
Your Majesty

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,360
Your Majesty, please

81
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,760
Listen to her

82
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,760
She just wants to enjoy

83
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,560
The 3 million taels of silver

84
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,360
You just want to enjoy

85
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Stop

86
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Father

87
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,960
You have been watching me grow up

88
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,160
You have loved me since I was a child

89
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,760
You have given me everything

90
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
All these years

91
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
I just got used to

92
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,360
living a comfortable life

93
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,360
But the horse

94
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,960
has nothing to do with me

95
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Someone must have framed me

96
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,360
I have never

97
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,560
tried to rebel, Father

98
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,960
You are so cruel

99
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,560
You are really my good son

100
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,960
Your Majesty

101
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Please forgive me this time

102
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
He has no intention to rebel

103
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,760
Your Majesty

104
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,760
Your Majesty

105
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,160
Please understand

106
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,560
Your Majesty

107
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,760
I know my fault

108
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,360
Please punish me, Father

109
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,800
Instagram

110
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,960
Your Majesty

111
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,560
The The Crown Prince and the Great Princess Consort arrived

112
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,000
Do you want to haunt the princess?

113
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,340
Crown Princess Consort

114
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,300
have actually appeared there own?

115
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,560
This way please.

116
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,840
Several Crown Princess Consort and legal à²  dimensions Consort

117
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,000
will now be here.

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Father.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Greetings, Father.

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Rise.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Thank you, Father.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Crown Princess Consort, what exactly is going on?

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Replying to Father, I have brought all the real accounts of the Ministry of Revenue's case.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This time, in the underground money house, we also found some letters.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Please let Lord Jiang Qi and the rest of the people of the Ministry of Revenue

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
wait for Father's interrogation and interrogation in the Court of Judicial Review.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hurry and bring it here.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Your Majesty, please go back to your room.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Can you wake up by doing this?

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Six years ago, Father used such an unnecessary crime to set a trap for the Zhao family.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Six years ago?

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
To collude with the rebels, you were able to find the letters that were sent to the enemy in the manor?

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Father wanted to use this method to deal with the Xu family.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But the Xu family is heavily guarded.

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's hard for him to secretly do it.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's why, the bandit family was able to close the door.

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He couldn't use the reason of the Tang Empire to kill my father.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So he chose to kill us.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Chu Yuan, everything will pass.

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Once everything is over, it will be the day when we reunite as a family.

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Tomorrow, go to the Third Prince's Manor and try to let him stay.

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We will use him as a bait to make a good show.

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I will go to the Third Prince's Manor.

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Ouyang Danji

172
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,600
Yan Yinshu

173
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,220
You really can't revive Minister Xu's daughter.

174
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,620
There are Kensattus.

175
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Haor, do you admit your crime?

176
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,320
I...

177
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,600
I admit my crime.

178
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Haor, do you admit your crime?

179
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Haor, do you admit your crime?

180
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,400
When the regret of the past is locked in the palace

181
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Only true love can return the years of the past

182
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,400
How can the mask be hidden?

183
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,400
In your eyes, the star is dark

184
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:05,400
The clouds and wind are not different from the moon
