1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,260
ignant

2
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,720
layer

3
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,360
Worry Jaopang

4
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
Chu Yun.

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,360
Chu Yun?

6
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Don't worry.

7
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
I've prepared the antidote.

8
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
Everything will be fine.

9
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,360
I saw Jiang Yun Hao on my way back.

10
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,360
He must have been planning something else

11
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,360
when he came out at this time.

12
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
Chu Yun.

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
But I made such a big deal in the palace.

14
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,360
I'm sorry that the Noble Consort

15
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
has been so cruel to you.

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,360
His Majesty also has some sense of justice for her.

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
In this way,

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,360
not only can the revenge plan go smoothly,

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,360
Jiang Yun Hao also lost his assistant in the palace.

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
No matter what he comes back for,

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,360
the Eastern Palace should have a solution.

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Chu Yun.

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,360
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

24
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
I just wanted to make a plan.

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
I...

26
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Your Highness.

27
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
You have your own plot.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
I also have my own ideas.

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Our Xu family has always been fond of military tactics.

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
I also know that

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
not everything can be told to the general.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
But the commander-in-chief

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
is afraid of being in danger.

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
So he wants to tell the general

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
that he's not afraid of being in danger.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,360
It's too risky to be in danger.

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
I...

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
I'm very angry now.

39
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
I don't want to study.

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Have a good rest.

41
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Chu Yun.

42
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Chu Yun.

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
I'm here to apologize to you.

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
I know why you're angry.

45
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Except that

46
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
I'm hiding it from you.

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
What you care more about

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
is that I didn't tell the general about the plan.

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
I know that

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
you're angry with me.

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
But I'm not.

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm not angry with you.

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm not angry with you.

54
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
I'm not angry with you.

55
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
It's such a risky thing.

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
I just want to take the responsibility alone.

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
I'm afraid to get you involved.

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Jiang Yusheng.

59
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
How much do you love me?

60
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Or do you mean

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
I'm a person who will run away

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
from this thing in your heart?

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Of course I love you wholeheartedly.

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
But I'm alone.

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
I've been in this palace

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
for too long.

67
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
How to trust someone

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
and entrust him with a new one

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
is a new thing to learn.

70
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
What's wrong with you?

71
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Didn't you cut the poison?

72
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm fine.

73
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Just a little tired.

74
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Jiang Yusheng.

75
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
What you need to learn

76
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
is not only how to love someone,

77
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
but also how to take care of yourself

78
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
for the one who loves you.

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Since you got poisoned,

80
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
I only know one thing.

81
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
That is

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
I can't live without you.

83
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
I can't watch you

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
die in front of me.

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Even if it's a mountain of fire and cold,

86
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
I have to go through it

87
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
for you.

88
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Chu Yuan.

89
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
I know.

90
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
I promise you

91
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
I won't

92
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
think about it again.

93
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
I'll always have you in my dream.

94
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,360
I'll always have you in my heart.

95
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
You dare to come to me?

96
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Aren't you afraid that I'll send you to Dali Temple?

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Third Princess.

98
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
I'm here to ask for help.

99
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Ask for help?

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Are you joking?

101
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I know

102
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
I've hurt you many times.

103
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
It's normal for you to hate me.

104
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
But I'm here today

105
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,360
to ask for your help.

106
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
I want you

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,360
to let me and the Shen Family go.

108
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Try it.

109
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Third Prince is no longer in the mansion.

110
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
He has gathered a large number of people.

111
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
In the next two days,

112
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
he'll find a chance to enter the palace

113
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
and close the palace.

114
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Third Prince

115
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
is going to take the throne?

116
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Yes.

117
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Then why did you come to me?

118
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
If he succeeds,

119
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,360
aren't you the Empress?

120
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm the Empress.

121
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
I'm the Empress.

122
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Then aren't you the Empress?

123
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
I do want to be the Empress.

124
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
But I don't need to

125
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
sacrifice my whole family's life

126
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
to be with him.

127
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Let alone the current Crown Prince,

128
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
the tiger tally in your hand

129
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
is not for nothing.

130
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Third Prince has no chance of winning.

131
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
I just want to live

132
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
and protect the Shen Family.

133
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
I'll go.

134
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Then I'll trust you

135
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
for once.

136
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Xu Chuyun!

137
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Why are you so good?

138
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Your Xu family is dead.

139
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Why are you still

140
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
the Crown Princess?

141
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Why are you living better than me?

142
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
It's so disgusting.

143
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Shen Yuanyuan,

144
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
didn't you choose

145
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
the path yourself?

146
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
I think Shen Yuanyuan

148
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
is most likely telling the truth.

149
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
When I came back from the palace today,

150
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,360
I saw Jiang Yunhao on the road.

151
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
There were too many people on the street.

152
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
I thought I was blind.

153
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Jiang Yunhao had been a model for many years.

154
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,360
He must have made a lot of money.

155
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
He used it to recruit soldiers,

156
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
but he was not enough.

157
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
What should we do?

158
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Although I only have the Xu family's tiger tally,

159
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
400,000 border guards

160
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
can't be transferred immediately.

161
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
There are some soldiers

162
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
who are in the city.

163
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
They are my old friends.

164
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Maybe they can transfer Yan'er.

165
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Xue Ping,

166
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
ask Jiang Qi to prepare

167
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
and order people to listen to the order

168
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
of the court's officials.

169
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,360
I'm going to the palace.

170
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Yes.

171
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Wait.

172
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Are you going to the palace alone?

173
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Yes.

174
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Whether Jiang Yunhao is going to rebel

175
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
or just being poisoned,

176
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
he has to go to the palace to see the emperor.

177
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
I'll go with you.

178
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
You stay outside the palace.

179
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
If Jiang Yunhao really wants to rebel,

180
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
he will wear the tiger tally

181
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
and lead the troops to the palace.

182
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Do you understand?

183
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Suzhu.

184
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
My lady.

185
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,360
You heard what His Highness said.

186
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,360
You take the tiger tally for me

187
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
and lead the troops to the palace.

188
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Yes.

189
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
I'll go with you.

190
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Chu Yun,

191
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
this is not a small matter.

192
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Are you going to leave me alone?

193
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Okay.

194
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
You come with me to the palace.

195
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
That way

196
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360

Let's go and have a look.

198
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Third Emperor?

199
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Why are you here?

200
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Shouldn't you

201
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
be grounded in your house?

202
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Jiang Yunsheng,

203
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
you killed my mother.

204
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
I want you to die.

205
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Noble Consort Shu is dead?

206
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Yunxiu,

207
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
tell me.

208
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
What did you do to her?

209
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
I killed her.

210
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
I killed her.

211
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
Tell me.

212
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Your Highness,

213
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Noble Consort Shu

214
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
committed a terrible crime.

215
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
His Majesty

216
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
asked Third Prince

217
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
to come to see you for the last time.

218
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
If it's true,

219
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
it's really

220
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
a big heart.

221
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Stop!

222
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
Say it again!

223
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Let me go!

224
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Jiang Yunsheng,

225
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
I want you to die.

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
I want you to die a hundred thousand times!

227
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Let me go!

228
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
We have to go to the Imperial College to get the medicine.

229
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360

230
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360

233
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Where is Father?

234
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
