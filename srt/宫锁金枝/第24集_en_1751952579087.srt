1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,240
What's on your mind?

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
You are to pull that monster of evil

3
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,120
and go to the hell with him

4
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,120
You are no longer your mother

5
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,560
Get well

6
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,040
Zhen...

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,560
Zhen...

8
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,880
Zhu...

9
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,640
My mother never wanted me to be like her.

10
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,680
Your Highness.

11
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,400
Your Highness.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,640
Your Highness.

13
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,160
Your Highness.

14
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,280
You deserve to die for your crime.

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,600
Your Highness.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,880
Your Highness.

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,560
Let me go.

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
Consort Feng!

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Consort Feng!

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,200
You killed him!

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Did you see that?

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Jiang Yunsheng!

23
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
Is His Majesty really dying?

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
The day Shu died was too much of a shock.

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,280
His blood flowed and caused his poison to spread.

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,880
He's just dying now.

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,880
The imperial physician didn't prepare the antidote for him.

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
The palace is heavily loaded with antidotes.

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,880
The Crown Princess Consort took them away a few days ago.

30
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Let's go.

31
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,880
What's the matter?

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,480
All those involved in the rebellion have been arrested.

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,080
The Shu clan is the leader.

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,480
The rebel, Zhu Jiuzong.

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Why bother?

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,680
He's my family...

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Father, the Zhao family is also outnumbered.

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,880
I've been working with the Zhao clan for years.

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,880
The Zhao family is also outnumbered.

41
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Also, I have something to say.

42
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Go ahead.

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,880
I have a secret antidote here.

44
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,080
Give it to me!

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Father,

46
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,480
I got this from the Crown Princess Consort.

47
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,480
She has a secret.

48
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,280
She wants to get rid of Father.

49
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,680
You want to frame me?

50
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
Ask.

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Your Majesty.

52
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Did you do it when the whole Xu family was destroyed?

53
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,080
I did it.

54
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Why?

55
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,880
The people say that the northwest border

56
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,080
can only be settled under the protection of the Zhenguo Palace.

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,480
Is this reason enough?

58
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,680
The Xu family...

59
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,680
The Xu family never had any ulterior motives.

60
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,480
Just because of the rumors that are so false?

61
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,680
Isn't this reason enough?

62
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,480
What is the meaning of that?

63
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,880
It is a truth.

64
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Fuhua.

65
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,680
You've eaten your last day of marriage.

66
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,480
and the royal family of the Zheng family

67
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,240
will be killed.

68
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,280
You're joking.

69
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,280
Chen Qiang is weak.

70
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,440
How can the world last for long?

71
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,280
If you don't get rid of him,

72
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,160
how can you keep the country?

73
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,040
Only by killing me

74
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,080
can you be the first emperor of the Ming dynasty.

75
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,920
According to my father,

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,440
you killed the innocent

77
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,680
for my own good.

78
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,960
Of course.

79
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,880
You're my son.

80
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,040
I'll think for you.

81
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,040
It's also your mother's wish.

82
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,680
But before mother died, she only told me

83
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,400
not to be like you.

84
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,080
I was deceived by Prince Yu.

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,520
I became a monster who only knew how to play the game.

86
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,720
I never dare to forget it.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,080
Jiang Yusheng,

88
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,200
are you trying to be a father?

89
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,480
No, I was not.

90
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,560
Father,

91
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,720
we have to pay the cost

92
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,520
if we live.

93
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:23,780
with your love of Riley

94
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:23,940
Shen,

95
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,340
This antidote is yours.

96
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,540
It's up to you whether to give it to him or not.

97
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,940
Jiang Yusheng, I'm your father.

98
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,060
You killed my mother.

99
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,740
You killed my mother's father.

100
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,580
I've already taken the punishment.

101
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,380
Xu Chuyuan, give me the antidote.

102
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,380
Give it to me.

103
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,860
Here, give it to me.

104
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,780
Here.

105
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,780
Give it to me.

106
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,700
Father, I think

107
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,380
the case of the Zhao family

108
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,860
and the Xu family

109
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,020
can't be released.

110
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,860
I'll take my leave.

111
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,140
Xu Chuyuan.

112
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,540
Sheng, give me the antidote.

113
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,900
Give me the antidote.

114
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,540
Sheng.

115
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,060
Give me the antidote.

116
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,020
Sheng.

117
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,380
ortex

118
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,260
Donoretty

119
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,460
The late emperor has passed away for two months.

120
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:52,700
The leaseirs are already all

121
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Let the Ministry of Rites start arranging it.

122
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Your Highness,

123
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,700
should we start preparing for the grand ceremony?

124
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,700
Yes.

125
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
Prepare for the grand ceremony

126
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
according to the highest standard.

127
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
Yes.

128
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Chu Yue!

129
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
Where is the Crown Princess Consort?

130
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
She was just here.

131
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
I'll go find her now.

132
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Yes.

133
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Are Master and the others going back to the Xu Manor?

134
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Yes.

135
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Father sent a letter

136
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
saying that they are on their way back.

137
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
It's been a long time

138
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
and there are some days

139
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
that I miss the whip.

140
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Miss, don't you miss home?

141
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,700
Su Zhu,

142
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,700
you may leave now.

143
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Yes.

144
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,700
You've seen it?

145
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,700
You're leaving me?

146
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
I did think of leaving you.

147
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
But I can't.

148
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,700
I can't.

149
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,700
I can't.

150
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
I can't.

151
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,700
I can't.

152
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
I can't.

153
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
I can't.

154
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
I can't.

155
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
I can't.

156
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
I can't.

157
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,700
I can't.

158
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,700
I can feel

159
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
your love for me.

160
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,700
But my parents

161
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
loved me so much.

162
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,700
Then I...

163
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
I...

164
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
I promised General Xu

165
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
that if you ever leave,

166
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
I won't stop you.

167
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,700
I promise you that

168
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,700
I'll protect you.

169
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,700
Leave

170
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,700
or stay?

171
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,580
I know .

172
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,940
Don't tell anyone about it

173
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,980
Gerilim .

174
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Mother

175
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I don't want to let him go.

176
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,940
Okay.

177
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,020
I can use the imperial power.

178
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,260
Yes.

179
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,580
I can control him with the imperial power.

180
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,100
I have the power.

181
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,580
But what's the difference between him and my father?

182
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,980
If I do that,

183
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,260
will I become like him?

184
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,700
File the ways of the imperial court.

185
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,400
According to this

186
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,180
he'll be loyal to my parents.

187
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,940
Let me handle him.

188
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,980
Yes.

189
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,380
I can leave for military service to attend the family business.

190
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,700
Sit down, Shouze.

191
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,020
Tell him not to waste time to make suggestions.

192
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,220
I'll help him.

193
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,940
I'm ready to follow your advice.

194
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,380
He has promised to me.

195
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,020
I know what's better than being a man of a man's heart.

196
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,340
Why should I do that?

197
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,180
He doesn't neglect me.

198
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,340
During this time,

199
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
The moon

200
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,660
The sea in the sky is full of love

201
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
Just for the palace

202
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,660
Chu Yun

203
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
The wind and frost

204
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,380
Greetings, husband

205
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,380
Get up

206
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,260
You don't have to bow to me

207
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,260
Don't you want to leave?

208
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,420
Do you want me to leave?

209
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,100
How is that possible?

210
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,420
It's just that day

211
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,260
I've been thinking about it these days

212
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,460
If in the future

213
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,780
What hasn't happened yet

214
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,180
But affected now

215
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,980
What is the difference between what the late emperor did

216
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,340
And

217
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,340
This is what I want to stay with you

218
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,540
You are pregnant

219
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,180
Congratulations to the emperor and the empress

220
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,740
The emperor and the empress both have a happy marriage

221
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,620
Long live the emperor

222
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,300
Long live the emperor
