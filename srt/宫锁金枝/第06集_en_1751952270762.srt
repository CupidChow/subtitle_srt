00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Do you think

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will believe your...

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You are so fierce.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you dare to move again,

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't mind living with you.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
My promise is still valid.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Crown Princess Consort,

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
you can take your time.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Get lost!

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The news from the Eastern Palace

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
has been saying that

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess Consort

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
have a good relationship.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They are a good match.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The Crown Prince has prepared

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
a room for the Crown Princess Consort.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The Crown Princess Consort

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
makes tonic soup for the Crown Prince every day.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Your Highness,

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm angry.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Four hundred thousand Xu's soldiers

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
were easily hurt

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
by that useless person.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How can I not be angry?

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Your Highness,

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
there is an old saying among the people.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It says that

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
the money is in the money box.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
When you hear the sound of the Tao,

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
you can't spend it.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's the same as not having it.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The Tao is interesting.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Tell me about it.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The Crown Prince is useless.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Even if Xu Chuyun

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
is a little clever,

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
he has no power to control the military power.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's the same as not having it.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Moreover,

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
the Third Prince is very arrogant.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Once the money is in the money box,

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
the whole country will be in trouble.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What else can the Xu's army

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
do?

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The whole country will be in trouble.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The blame is on me.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
My beloved consort is here.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My wish

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
has been fulfilled.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Your Highness,

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
drink some tea to get rid of the fire.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Go ahead.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
My husband,

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
here is your soup.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Your wife is so considerate.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm touched.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I changed the prescription.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Try it,

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
see if it's good.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My wife

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
is washing her hands and making soup every day.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I feel so sorry for her.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
As long as you are healthy,

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm willing to do anything.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why are you injured?

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I got a cut on the cup.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's not serious.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
My wife hasn't been out

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
for a few days.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The imperial examination is coming.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's very lively in the capital.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Why don't we go out for a walk?

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm willing to do anything.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
My wife,

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
go to change the prescription.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
My husband.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let's go out after drinking the soup.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No matter how many times

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I see the beautiful scenery in the capital,

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I feel like I'm in the capital.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I feel like I'm in the capital.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I feel like I'm in the capital.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If you like it,

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
we can go out in the future.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But every time I see the beautiful scenery,

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I think of the border.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You know that

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I grew up in a small place in the border.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The people there

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
seem to live for the sake of living.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Can't you go shopping in the street?

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Those shops

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
are different from the peaceful scenery

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
in the capital.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
My wife is a small house.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm a little lonely.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm the only one in the Xu family.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Where else do you have a home?

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We are husband and wife.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The Eastern Palace is your home.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You're right.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
One day,

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll take you back to the border to see.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't be afraid.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm here.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What's this?

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You've never been to the fountain to spray people?

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you can share it,

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can even take the cost.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You come with me.

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Husband, I'll go ahead and see.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Where do you want to go?

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Follow me.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Si Zhu.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Find out who they are.

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What's the situation

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
if you ask Ding Er to send someone to look for them?

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,960
The

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
As ordered by His Highness,

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
it disrupted the state's plan.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now half of the students

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
know that this year's Chunwei corpse will be sold.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
My big brother

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
has a empty head.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He didn't inherit

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
half of his experience as a foreign countryman.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
He's stupid.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
In addition to Guo Da Ru,

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
no one in the Guo family is wrong.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Your Highness is right.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The last two times, the Guo family's

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
imperial examination of the military is already

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
being suppressed by you.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
They thought

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
they were doing it without a limit.

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So this year,

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
they dared to let go and want to make a big turn.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let our people

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
tame Guo Heng more.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Make it soon

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
to be appointed by Guo Heng as the chief examiner.

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So that

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
they can't take off this hat.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Remember,

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the bigger the trouble, the better.

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The bigger the trouble,

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the more miserable

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
my big brother will be.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
As expected from Your Highness,

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
this time,

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
someone is selling the corpse.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And there are many people who bought it.

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But the seller is busy

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and the plate is wrong.

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We can't find the source for now.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The chief examiner of the Chunwei College

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
hasn't even been determined.

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Where did the body come from?

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I've found out.

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's a pre-sale.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
First, we take the money of these examiners.

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
After we know who the chief examiner is,

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
we take the body from the chief examiner

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and sell it.

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
How can this be?

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Your Highness,

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
they are too bold.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It seems that their people

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
can control the choice of chief examiner.

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You mean the Guo family?

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Not only that.

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's not the first time the Guo family

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
has done this.

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It must be careful.

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Your Highness,

185
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
why is there someone

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
on the street

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
who can say this?

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Jiang Yun Mo and Jiang Yun Hao

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
are watching me closely.

190
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This matter

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
has nothing to do with them.

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes.

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Why did the Crown Prince

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
tell your father for no reason?

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He said you were married.

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You also have a disease.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He dragged you into

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
the Soul-Sleeping Water of Keju.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Nonsense.

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm not in a hurry to agree.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yun Hao,

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
your father has always been interested in you.

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But you have to understand

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
that the chief examiner

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
is a woman of no joy.

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You are so impatient

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
that you can't let others talk about you

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and give others a chance to trick you.

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Mother, don't worry.

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I have married the daughter of the prime minister.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
All the officials in the court

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
know what to do.

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Jiang Yun Sheng wants to drag me into the water.

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He is not afraid of drowning himself.

215
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Now the Crown Prince

216
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
has become a useless person.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Even if he marries Xu Chu Yun,

218
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
what can he do?

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Can he still live

220
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
until he becomes the prime minister?

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's more important

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
to get rid of the Crown Prince

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
before he gets angry.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Ding has reported that

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
there is a big official in the capital

226
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
who is collecting money

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
to give the examiner

228
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
the imperial exam paper for this year.

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This can also be a imperial exam?

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If it's like this,

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
what's the point of this imperial exam?

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Ding said that

233
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
those who have contact with the examiners

234
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
are all low-level people.

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
They don't do things very strictly.

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Now almost half of the examiners

237
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
know about this.

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let the low-level people sell the exam paper.

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Who came up with such a stupid idea?

240
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's really stupid.

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But Ding Er Mo checked for a long time.

242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Their relationship

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
is constantly messed up.

244
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
They can't find the source in a short time.

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The exam paper can also be sold.

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The imperial examination has come to this point.

247
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It can be seen that the court

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
is already a mess.

249
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Fine.

250
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This situation is also beneficial to me.

251
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Let Ding Er Mo keep an eye on them.

252
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No matter who did it,

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
as long as they don't affect my plan,

254
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't care if they are dogs or beasts.

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's best to involve the other princes.

256
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm sorry.
