1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
wants to avenge his father

2
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:40,480
andやって sister

3
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,680
Man%Sыл關係 lately

4
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,420
Episode 48

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,840
We're going after him.

6
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,640
Search, everything is doesn't matter...

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,200
If

8
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,200
If

9
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,560
We have to be searching

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
I know him well.

11
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,920
Your Highness,

12
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,840
don't be sad.

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,720
The empress...

14
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,600
I've known it.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
The Jiang family

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,040
is so cruel

17
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,920
and full of scheming.

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,160
Maybe

19
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,800
she really had feelings for my mother.

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,560
But those

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,360
are not the royal power she has.

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,400
Whether it's me

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,920
or Jiang Yuanhao

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,760
who has been favored by her these years,

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,640
or your Xu family,

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,840
they are all pawns she can lose at any time.

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,960
Once she's blinded,

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,560
the only thing

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,920
she can wait for is to be killed.

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,280
Your Highness.

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,800
Chu Yuan,

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,440
don't feel sorry for me.

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,440
That's the least I need.

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,000
What should we do next?

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,760
Another scenario,

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,560
you need to figure out

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,240
which woman can be trusted by the politicians.

38
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,800
Madam,

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,360
do I know all your henchmen?

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,960
Be careful, Your Highness. Let's go.

41
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Let's go.

42
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Let's go.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Let's go.

44
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Zhuyuan, let's go.

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Husband,

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
you'll be fine, right?

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Of course I'll be fine.

48
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
I have to wait for my wife

49
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
to bring someone to save me.

50
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Zhuyuan, you go.

51
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
You go.

52
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
Who's the red jade?

53
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Let me see the ice and make you write.

54
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Looking back, this love dream

55
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
has always been with you.

56
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,560
It has always been with you.

57
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Brother.

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
You've been making trouble

59
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
just to send Xu Chuyun away.

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Don't worry.

61
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
I didn't plan to kill him.

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Jiang Yunhao,

63
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
you're not a good person.

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
You're not a good person.

65
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
You're not a good person.

66
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
You're not a good person.

67
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
You're not a good person.

68
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
You're not a good person.

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Jiang Yunhao,

70
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
it's not too late to stop now.

71
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
You think you're the Crown Prince?

72
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Waiting for dawn,

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
everything will be settled.

74
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
For the sake of our brotherhood,

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
I allow you to kill yourself

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
and give you a right to speak.

77
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
What are you laughing at?

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
I'm laughing at you.

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
What do you mean?

80
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Do you really think you're winning?

81
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Do you really think

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
just based on what Shen Yuanyuan said,

83
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
you can trick me?

84
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Jiang Yisheng,

85
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
death is near,

86
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
do you struggle to death?

87
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Don't worry.

88
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
After you die,

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
I will bring Xu Chuyun here,

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
take her to the palace

91
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
and make her a concubine.

92
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
She's not something you can covet.

93
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
How come?

94
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I told you,

95
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
I'm not a man of great power.

96
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
If that's the case,

97
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
let them all die with you

98
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
here.

99
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Kill!

100
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Kill!

101
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Kill!

102
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Kill!

103
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Why are you panicking?

104
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
To be an empress,

105
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
you need to have the aura of a god.

106
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Mother, what you said is...

107
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
I underestimated that bitch.

108
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
You too.

109
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
You can't even talk to your father.

110
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
You only know how to keep your reputation.

111
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Forget it.

112
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
It doesn't matter if she doesn't come.

113
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Anyway, Haor is winning today.

114
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Are you looking for something?

115
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Are you looking for the jaguars or harem?

116
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Two of them are here.

117
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Don't test your Little Sister's luck!

118
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Your defended officers will be cursed.

119
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
What's wrong?

120
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
What happened?

121
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Xienastar…

122
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Interesting stuff.

123
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,560
The one who is threatened with death

124
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
will not be cured and must leave for the team.

125
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Kill the traitor and clear the military plan to save His Majesty!

126
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,240
Kill the traitor and clear the military plan!

127
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,720
Kill the traitor and clear the military plan!

128
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,640
Kill the traitor and clear the military plan!

129
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,840
How come?

130
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,880
My Crown Princess Consort even saved you.

131
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,280
Xu Jia Hu Talisman.

132
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,680
Xu Chuyuan actually took it out for your uselessness?

133
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,040
Of course.

134
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,520
After all, we are husband and wife.

135
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,600
You lost.

136
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,440
My husband, I'm late.

137
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,640
Not late. Just right.

138
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,160
Jiang Yunsheng, I told you to be more tough.

139
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,200
Prime Minister Shen?

140
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,920
Prime Minister Shen, you came just in time.

141
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Jiang Yunsheng is trying to kill my father.

142
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,400
He wants to take over the throne!

143
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,480
Jiang Yunhao!

144
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,640
Do you think that someone will still believe you?

145
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,080
Xu Chuyuan!

146
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,640
Don't be fooled by him.

147
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,080
He's just using you to take over the throne.

148
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,720
Aren't you going to take revenge?

149
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,400
I can help you.

150
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,920
Father!

151
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,400
Father, please help the Third Prince.

152
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,480
The Crown Prince is trying to kill the Emperor.

153
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

154
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,840
We will listen to the Crown Prince's orders

155
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,640
to capture Jiang Yunhao, the traitor.

156
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,920
And take him to the Dali Temple.

157
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,320
Father, what are you saying?

158
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,040
Prime Minister Shen!

159
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,320
After the Third Prince Jiang Yunhao's rebellion,

160
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,120
he tried to kill my father.

161
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,880
He's unforgivable.

162
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,160
But I won't kill you.

163
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,800
I'll be a monk for life.

164
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,880
I can't be out of the palace.

165
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,280
I...

166
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,960
I'll thank you for not killing me!

167
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,720
Shushi.

168
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,160
I'm not that kind to you.

169
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,960
You still dare to kill me?

170
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,840
Not kind?

171
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,040
Do you really think that way?

172
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,640
All these years,

173
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,640
you've been my most beloved concubine.

174
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,440
Your Majesty,

175
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
all these years,

176
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,040
have you ever...

177
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,840
done anything for me?

178
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,040
Have you ever done a plum blossom for me?

179
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,840
Have you ever carved a flower for me?

180
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,840
No.

181
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,840
I've never done anything for you.

182
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I've never done anything for you.

183
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,040
No.

184
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,040
You've never done anything for me.

185
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,240
This is a small matter.

186
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,840
Isn't it enough that I give you a fortune?

187
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Of course it's not enough!

188
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,840
You've done all these for the Empress.

189
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,640
You've given her a hairpin,

190
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,040
a plum blossom, and even

191
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,840
carved jade for her.

192
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,840
Why can't you do anything for me?

193
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,440
Can't you love me more?

194
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,040
Jiang Zheng!

195
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,640
You...

196
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,640
That bitch...

197
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,040
She should have died long ago.

198
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,040
Even if I die,

199
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,640
I'll still be able to take that bitch's sword

200
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,240
and die with her.

201
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
You...

202
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

203
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

204
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

205
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

206
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

207
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

208
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

209
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

210
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

211
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,240
I don't want to talk to anyone.

212
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Don't talk about it.

213
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Don't talk about it.

214
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:59,240
I'm so greedy.

215
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,240
When the regret is locked in the palace.

216
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Only true love can return to the years of the past.

217
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,240
How dare I hide it?

218
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,240
You are in love.

219
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,240
It's okay to be with the wind and the moon.

220
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

221
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

222
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,240
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.
