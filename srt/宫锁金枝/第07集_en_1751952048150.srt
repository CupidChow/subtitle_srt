1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The Untamed

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The Untamed

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The Untamed

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Episode 32

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,600
Long live the emperor.

7
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,760
Rise.

8
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,040
Thank you, your majesty.

9
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,480
How's the selection of the head examiner?

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Most of the students have entered the capital.

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,880
Today, we must make a decision no matter what.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
Your majesty.

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,200
Your majesty.

14
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,080
The selection of the head examiner is not a big deal.

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
I suggest that

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,120
the crown prince should be the head examiner.

17
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,400
That's the best.

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,640
What do you mean?

19
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,480
The crown prince is the crown prince of our dynasty.

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,680
He's also married.

21
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,560
It's time to show the crown prince's power.

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,160
At that time,

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,640
we should show the people

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
the crown prince's talent.

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,600
Father.

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,120
I...

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,920
Father.

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,840
I also think

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,640
the crown prince is the most suitable candidate.

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,080
I think

31
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,600
since the crown prince got married,

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,120
he's been getting healthier.

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,920
I think he can share his worries with me.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,200
Father.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
I don't think it's appropriate.

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,120
Although the crown prince has been in politics for years,

37
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,800
he hasn't had any practical results.

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,120
If he's the crown prince's head examiner,

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,760
I'm afraid the students will be disappointed.

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,080
I agree.

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,760
I WHY

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,240
I identify

43
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,480
a reason.

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,560
deep

45
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,960
Deep

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,080
I also think this proposal is very good

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Then let the Crown Prince be the main guest this time

48
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,080
I will obey the decree and will not fail to entrust

49
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Mother

50
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
What's wrong with you

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
That damn Guo Heng

52
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,880
That damn Guo Heng

53
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
I actually proposed to the court

54
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,480
Let that useless person be the main examiner in this world

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,080
Why did Guo Heng mention him?

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,880
do not know

57
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
That useless

58
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
So many years in the court

59
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
Is a mascot

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
What happened

61
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,880
Nothing happened

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,880
Stupid Jiang Yunmo

63
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,680
I must want to drag him down

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,880
Take yourself out

65
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,880
The direction of this matter

66
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,680
A little strange

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,280
Why mention him?

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,080
How do i know

69
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,680
This thing is wrong

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
Hao

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,280
Stop everything you do

72
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Stop

73
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,080
Mother

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,880
This is what we did for nine years

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Just so waste

76
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,080
This thing is a bit strange

77
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,280
It's easy to do something rashly

78
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,680
Mother, you are thinking too much

79
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
A waste will not be handled

80
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,080
I will never let the plan fail

81
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,080
No

82
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,080
Let me think again

83
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,280
Think about it

84
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,480
Miss

85
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,880
The Crown Prince was named

86
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,680
The main examiner of this Spring Festival Gala

87
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
What did you say

88
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,680
What the hell is this

89
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,880
Which bastard came up with the idea

90
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,880
People from Guo's family

91
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,480
The eldest prince has the courage

92
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
This is clearly

93
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,080
Want the Eastern Palace to be sad

94
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,080
Miss

95
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,280
Will we be implicated

96
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Of course

97
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,280
I am now the Crown Princess

98
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
On the face of the face

99
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,480
With the Eastern Palace

100
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
One face is one face

101
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,280
One loss is one loss

102
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,280
If the Crown Prince is in trouble

103
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
I don't say revenge

104
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,080
Even myself

105
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,880
It seems that now

106
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,080
Can't be alone

107
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,480
You let Ding Er take the Ding team

108
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,080
Go and check everything for me

109
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
I want to know

110
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Who is the main master behind the scenes

111
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,080
I'll do it now

112
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,280
The crown prince is really a high-level move

113
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
You guessed it

114
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,680
Not my high-level move

115
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
But they

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,280
I didn't put me in my eyes at all

117
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,680
Whether it's Jiang Yun Mo or Jiang Yun Hao

118
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Yi Huo is my beloved father

119
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,080
As long as Jiang Yun Mo finds

120
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,480
The use of my tool

121
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,480
He will definitely come out

122
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,880
The third prince probably didn't expect

123
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,080
He will be your wedding dress

124
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,880
He is too proud

125
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,280
Empty

126
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,880
Treat everything as what it should be

127
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,280
I don't want to look down

128
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,880
I should give him the last lesson as a brother

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
I have to thank him

130
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,880
Gave me the opportunity to make a name for myself

131
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
Your Highness, you have to be extra careful

132
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,880
You have a Crown Princess now

133
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
I know

134
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,680
This Crown Prince

135
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,880
As long as you live

136
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,680
Will be a living target

137
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,280
If you stay longer

138
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,440
My life is more Áo Ló

139
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:14,740
My life is more Áo Ló

140
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,200
if you just walk out

141
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Save your life

142
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,640
Ah

143
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
A lot

144
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
I am in this trouble

145
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
I am of the same kind

146
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,200
We have to resolve the puzzle

147
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,680
but

148
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,760
Don't explain to him

149
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,760
Stop him

150
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,080
This You

151
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,720
Sensitive

152
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,400
Are you

153
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,160
Especially P Renee coding accompany Rope Class Cadet.

154
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,640
15 months is quite a long time.

155
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,580
Gotta work that hard if I can earn that much,

156
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,800
you know?

157
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,400
I can only face problems when I can direct my own leading actresses,

158
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,800
all of them Arcane Duo members.

159
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,360
You have caught their attention already?

160
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,160
Do you respect them?

161
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,240
No trouble.

162
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,760
Especially when they are the army who

163
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,960
Is this something you should be concerned about?

164
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,360
If you keep talking, get out.

165
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,560
Husband, can I come in?

166
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,960
Please come in, Crown Princess Consort.

167
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,960
Husband.

168
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,760
Madam.

169
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Madam, why are you here?

170
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,360
Husband, do you hate me?

171
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Why did you come here?

172
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
I came to see you.

173
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Why are you not willing to sleep with me?

174
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,960
How could that be?

175
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I just...

176
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
I'm not feeling well.

177
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,760
If you're not feeling well, should I come and take care of you?

178
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,160
I just want...

179
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,560
You and I are husband and wife. If you're not here,

180
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
do you want to leave me alone?

181
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
How could that be?

182
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,760
I just feel that I'm not worthy of you.

183
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,160
I want to leave some room for you.

184
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,760
Our marriage is because of that cage.

185
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,560
I don't want you to regret it.

186
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,160
I didn't intentionally hide from you.

187
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
I just...

188
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,160
I really believe in you.

189
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,960
I already said it.

190
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,360
There's nothing that I don't want to do.

191
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,560
You're still young. I don't want you to force yourself.

192
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,360
I hope that you can marry the person you like.

193
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,360
I'm the person I like.
