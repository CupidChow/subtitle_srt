Chief destiny

Chief destiny

4
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,620
Queen of 거官

00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,140

8
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Hey, brother

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,560
Brother, are you looking for father?

10
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,560
I'm waiting for you, the third emperor.

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
Waiting for me?

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
What do you mean?

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
You know what I mean.

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
You're so tall.

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,560
How can you be cut off one day?

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
You're so stupid.

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
Stupid.

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,560
The boss fought with the third emperor like a wild dog.

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,560
They didn't bite each other.

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,560
But after a few months, they started to fight each other.

21
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
They lost a lot of sugar and fish.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Now they have no place to control the six tribes.

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
We should go to the battlefield.

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
The official paper on this paper.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Try to push our people up.

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
You should be careful.

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Don't worry about that.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,560
The few beauties you ordered me to send to the palace a few days ago.

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
They've been defeated.

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,560
You're busy fighting.

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
You can't even stand on the ground.

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
You don't have time to take care of your son.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
That's enough.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
We're in trouble.

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
We're empty-handed.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,560
I should do what I should do.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
My crown princess consort is here.

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,560
I'll go to welcome her.

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Where's the crown princess consort?

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
She's passed the second gate.

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
Why is the lady here?

42
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Your highness.

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,560
I saw you've been busy with the spring round.

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,560
I'm so tired.

45
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,560
I'm worried about your health.

46
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,560
So I asked for doctor Liu.

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
I'm Liu Yan.

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Your highness.

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
You're worried about me.

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Come on.

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Sit.

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
I didn't know.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Uncle Liu was my father's military doctor.

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,560
I've had a bad illness since I was a child.

55
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
It's all because of uncle Liu.

56
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,560
So I want him to see you.

57
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,560
I know you're kind.

58
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,560
But I've been disappointed too many times.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
I...

60
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,560
But Chu Yun made you embarrassed.

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
It's Chu Yun's fault.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,560
I'll make you soup.

63
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
My husband.

64
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Doctor Liu has been here.

65
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
If you change your mind,

66
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
you can call him anytime.

67
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
Xue Ping.

68
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,560
It's hard for you to be by his side.

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,560
You can drink the soup.

70
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
I'm not tired.

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
I'm not tired.

72
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,560
I don't want to drink the soup.

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,560
I didn't expect he would be so resistant.

74
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
According to the lady,

75
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,560
the imperial doctor and the doctor the emperor asked for

76
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
didn't cure him.

77
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
It gave him hope and disappointed him.

78
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,560
It's true that he will be resistant.

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
He will be crippled.

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Uncle Liu.

81
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Is it possible that his leg is fine?

82
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
No problem.

83
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,560
It's not obvious.

84
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,560
I need to treat him.

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Forget it.

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,560
I don't care about his leg.

87
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,560
I care about whether he can help me to get pregnant.

88
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Miss.

89
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
The porridge is ready.

90
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Let me do it.

91
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Honey.

92
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Eat the supper and go to sleep.

93
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Didn't I just have dinner?

94
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
I...

95
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Longyan porridge is the most nutritious.

96
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
You are not in good health.

97
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
You have been working hard for the spring festival.

98
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Drink the porridge.

99
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
You will have a good sleep.

100
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Okay.

101
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Since it's like this,

102
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,560
I will have some.

103
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
It's hot.

104
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Be careful.

105
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Honey, are you okay?

106
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Help.

107
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Help.

108
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,560
I'm fine.

109
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Help.

110
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Help.

111
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Honey, it's my fault.

112
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,560
I can't hold the bowl of porridge.

113
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,560
I will send for the doctor.

114
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Don't panic.

115
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Just some porridge.

116
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
I love it.

117
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Honey, it's my fault.

118
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
If I hadn't been careless,

119
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,560
you wouldn't have been in the court today.

120
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
If father blames me,

121
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,560
I will take all the blame.

122
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
I won't blame you.

123
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
I'm fine.

124
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
I didn't get a burn.

125
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
I will rest for a few days.

126
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,560
If I could be more careful,

127
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
I wouldn't have been like this.

128
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
I won't blame you.

129
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Never.

130
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Really?

131
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
I never break my promise.

132
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,560
Jiang Yusheng, who are you?

133
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
I can't trust you.

134
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
I don't dare to trust you.

135
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Until now,

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
I can only rest assured

137
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,560
after finding out the truth.

138
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
You're so nice to me.

139
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,560
It's been a long time.

140
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Yeah.

141
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
It's been a long time.

142
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
You're so nice.

143
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Miss, I have a clue.

144
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Tell me.

145
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
The person in charge of this case

146
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
is in contact with Third Prince.

147
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Ding Ermo has seen his residence.

148
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
He is going to find time

149
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,560
to find the key clue.

150
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Jiang Yuanhao really got involved

151
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,560
in the case.

152
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Tell Ding Ermo to keep an eye on him.

153
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
But don't touch him.

154
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Yes.

155
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
For a man,

156
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
Miss Hai almost got into trouble.

157
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
Even if such a man

158
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
is happy,

159
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
he won't have any good result.

160
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
He's just a chess piece

161
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,560
that was taken away by someone.

162
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Shen Yuanyuan

163
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
is not a low-class person

164
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
who can do things.

165
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Tell me.

166
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Are they really in love

167
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
or pretending to be a play?

168
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Third Prince.

169
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
I walked too fast.

170
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
So they are really in love.

171
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
I thought the royal family

172
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
was just acting.

173
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
So...

174
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Only Jiang Yusheng and I

175
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
are acting to each other.

176
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Let's go.

177
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

178
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Please rise.

179
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
I wonder if Your Highness

180
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
has any information

181
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
about the royal family.

182
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Nothing.

183
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
Just a casual look.

184
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Today, Your Highness

185
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
is busy with work.

186
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,560
You should eat light food.

187
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Yes.

188
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
We prepared

189
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560
some light dishes.

190
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Your Highness, please look.

191
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,560
Who made this lotus seed soup?

192
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
