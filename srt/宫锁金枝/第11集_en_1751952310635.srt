1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,760
The Founding creation of the Central Plane

2
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,440
The Temple of the Mind

3
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,640
Episode 32

4
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,860
The nerves you take up

5
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,580
Thei Phillip will always remember

6
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,180
to take with him

7
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,900
the craft of water from the blue sea.

8
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,180
Si Feng,

9
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,240
Zhenyas have received such complete information from the police.

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,500
Therefore, I believe you just as aそれでod bordaring courier

11
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,920
may recently invocations for there use.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,280
Don't you hope that

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,720
a leader who has all the intelligence evidence

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:15,560
and shadow intelligence

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,220
may attract information from the police

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,120
on the basis of the phone callids.

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,060
Look,

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,500
The answer of on-call investigation

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,560
after the​ offical exchange

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,000
I need my

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,280
palace

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:42,200
This is as expensive

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,480
brigade

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,640
аль

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,760
Your Royal Highness

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,640
you know

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,160
I thought

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,160
I only want what you have.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Brother Qian, come.

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,160
Everyone, I wish you a good luck in this meeting.

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,160
I am the gold medalist.

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Brother Qian, based on your tone,

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,160
you must be very successful in this meeting.

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,160
I have put a lot of effort into this meeting.

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,160
No matter how good the results are,

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
I must be worthy of my own efforts.

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Brother Qian, you are so fierce.

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Come, let's do it again.

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Come, come, come, gold medalist.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
So fake.

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,160
I have already sent people to lure those

42
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,160
who have bought the oranges for the exam.

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,160
I have arranged some places to buy the big oranges.

44
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Now there are 60% of the people who have bought the same big oranges.

45
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
60%?

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Yes.

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,160
Not bad.

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,160
When the exam paper is written,

49
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
it will be very lively.

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,160
So many similar exams appear.

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,160
I don't know how my eldest brother

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,160
will take the responsibility.

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
You think so?

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Yes.

55
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Long live the emperor.

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Everyone, rise.

57
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

58
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Your Majesty.

59
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Your Majesty, I have something to report.

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Report.

61
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
I want to thank you for your help in the examination.

62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
You have done a lot of research.

63
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,160
You have bought the exam paper and the bag.

64
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
You have used the money to buy the bag.

65
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
You have made the world's princes feel sad.

66
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
You have made our country's wealth and wealthless.

67
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,160
You have shaken the foundation of the country.

68
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,160
Don't slander the good people.

69
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
I am not slandering.

70
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,160
What I have is evidence.

71
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
The name of the orange on the purchase test paper,

72
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
the name of the official,

73
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
and the business certificate are all here.

74
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Your Majesty.

75
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Your Majesty.

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

77
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,160
What else do you want to say?

78
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Sheng, tomorrow is the meeting.

79
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Are you sure that the topic of the meeting has been leaked?

80
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
I am sure.

81
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,160
I beg you to take the orange on the purchase test paper and interrogate it.

82
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
As for the exam,

83
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
as the main examiner,

84
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,160
I should have taken the exam for this meeting.

85
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
So I didn't take Guo Heng's opinion.

86
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,160
The meeting tomorrow will be as usual.

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
How do you know?

88
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
The Minister of Dali Temple, Jiang Qi,

89
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
was ordered to investigate this case.

90
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
The court knows it.

91
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,160
I went out with the Crown Princess recently.

92
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
I heard that there was an orange

93
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
discussing the business test paper.

94
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
I dare not be careless.

95
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
I will report it to the Dali Temple immediately.

96
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Your Majesty.

97
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
The Crown Prince is right.

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,160
I have investigated the case of the Fifth B.

99
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
I won't let it go as long as I have news.

100
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Jiang Qi.

101
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
What did the Crown Prince say?

102
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Are you trying to frame Zhong Liang

103
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,160
by robbing the party and the private sector?

104
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,160
What did the Crown Prince say?

105
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Jiang Qi is a court official.

106
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
The case is only in Dali Temple.

107
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Whether it's the government office or the Eastern Palace,

108
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
when did you see me and the Crown Prince

109
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
following the order?

110
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
The paper of Dali Temple is here.

111
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
I will report it.

112
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,160
Someone is indeed selling the test paper.

113
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
The meeting is urgent.

114
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,160
We can't let anyone destroy our foundation.

115
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,160
I ask Your Majesty to investigate this case

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
for the sake of the people.

117
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Do as the Crown Prince said.

118
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Investigate.

119
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Go.

120
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Hurry up.

121
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
What's going on?

122
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Hurry up.

123
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Do you have any sense?

124
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
How dare you?

125
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Why don't you arrest me?

126
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
I have to take the exam tomorrow.

127
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
You can't arrest me.

128
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
I am a Juren.

129
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Why are you panicking?

130
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
You will be dead soon.

131
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Take him back to the government office.

132
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Yes.

133
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Hurry up.

134
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Why don't you arrest me?

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
Hurry up.

136
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
I didn't expect the Crown Prince to be so skilled.

137
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
What skill?

138
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
He found the target so quickly

139
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
and arrested everyone.

140
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
It's a secret city.

141
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
He can bear it and be calm.

142
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
He also has the thunderous technique.

143
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,160
He is very similar to the rubbish

144
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
that everyone says.

145
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
I underestimated this person.

146
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
My Lady, what should we do?

147
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Tell the brothers below

148
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
to be more cautious in the future.

149
00:08:49,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Take out their ability to deal with the Manzi

150
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
and withdraw the goods.

151
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
From now on,

152
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
you will be the most important person in the city.

153
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Yes.

154
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Hurry up.

155
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Who is this person?

156
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
I don't know.

157
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
I am the Crown Prince, Jiang Yun Sheng.

158
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
I am the main examiner of the Spring Festival.

159
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
If you are so high,

160
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
I am your teacher.

161
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Really?

162
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
I know that you are suspicious

163
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
about what happened yesterday.

164
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
But please

165
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
put down your suspicions for now.

166
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Those who can stand here

167
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
are all the students who can

168
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
attend the examination in peace.

169
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
When you enter the court as officials in the future,

170
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
you will experience more.

171
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
If even what happened yesterday

172
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
can stir up the confusion

173
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
and can't be answered,

174
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
I advise you to leave this park as soon as possible.

175
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
This is not the place

176
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
you should stay.

177
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Let's start.

178
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Let's go.

179
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
There is nothing to see.

180
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,160
I really have two sons.

181
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
One is a court official.

182
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
He is a corrupt official.

183
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
The other is an official under the jurisdiction.

184
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
He dares to sell his official position.

185
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
I am the first son.

186
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
How dare he sell his official position?

187
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
How is the Crown Prince?

188
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Your Majesty,

189
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
the Crown Prince

190
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,160
personally comforted the other sons.

191
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,160
The Spring Festival is going well.

192
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
That's good.

193
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Send my order.

194
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
All officials involved in this

195
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
must be punished severely,

196
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
including my son.

197
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Yes.

198
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Your Majesty,

199
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I am innocent.

200
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Your Majesty,

201
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
I really don't know

202
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
if anyone would sell his official position

203
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
under his jurisdiction.

204
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
He is still young.

205
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
He must have been deceived.

206
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Please investigate it thoroughly.

207
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Your Majesty.

208
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
I know this is not my son's fault.

209
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
But the incident has already happened.

210
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
I have to take some responsibility.

211
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Don't worry, my dear.

212
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
My son will be fine.

213
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
The Crown Prince

214
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,160
did such a treacherous thing

215
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,160
and let Your Majesty lose face.

216
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Your Majesty,

217
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
you can punish him.

218
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Don't get angry.

219
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
I can't leave Your Majesty

220
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
without taking care of my son.

221
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
All right.

222
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
I know.

223
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Get up.

224
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

225
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
Your Majesty.

226
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
