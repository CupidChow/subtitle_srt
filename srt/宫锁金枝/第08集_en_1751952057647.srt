1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,100
Back to the

2
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,920
この

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,800
이

4
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,020
uka

5
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,300
Are you

6
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,020
here

7
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,380
confused

8
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:09,900
what happen

9
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,200
안

10
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,700
you

11
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,280
resist

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,040
what

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,520
what

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,120
it

15
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,760
this

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,760
I'll think of a way to expose this matter to the Crown Prince.

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,160
Don't they want to use the Eastern Palace?

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Then let's be the cornerstone of the Crown Prince's reputation.

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,160
When everything is calm,

20
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,560
it's when I take the power of the Fish King.

21
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,960
I know.

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,560
Oh, right. How's the mask man doing?

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,160
The people who spilled out the information about the special features that you mentioned earlier,

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,160
they searched the whole capital.

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,560
They still haven't found it.

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,160
Those special features are not wrong.

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,160
If they still can't find it,

28
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,360
it means that person is hiding it on purpose.

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,560
They say that a gentleman is honest.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,360
What is the purpose of this person hiding his face and tail?

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,960
What purpose?

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,960
If his identity is special, he wouldn't dare to show his face to others.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Miss, if you say that, did you think of someone?

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,960
Miss.

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,160
Let's check again.

36
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,760
Yes.

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,560
Your Highness.

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
How is it?

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,560
I already did as you said.

40
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,160
The Third Prince has already been taken.

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,960
This time, he can surely be the second wife.

42
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,560
This time,

43
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,160
let Jiang Yun Mo at most remove the list of the heir to the throne.

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,160
Jiang Yun Hao won't be abandoned by my father because of this matter.

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,760
I'm not going to let you do that.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,360
You were abandoned by my father.

47
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,760
He can't bear to let his own chess piece be destroyed like this.

48
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,960
Then...

49
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,760
Take it slow. Don't rush.

50
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,960
Let Jiang Qi be careful.

51
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,560
Yes.

52
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,360
Wait.

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,160
Go to Tian Xiang House and buy some human-like ingredients

54
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,160
and send it to the Crown Princess Consort.

55
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,560
Yes.

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,360
I already told you she is the second wife.

57
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,560
Every woman must have their own musique.

58
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Don't emit too much research for the imperial concubine.

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,360
Then, I'll share the responsibility.

60
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,560
I cannot let you do that.

61
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,160
Yin Xue.

62
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,160
Miss, I want to ask a laborious question.

63
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,960
Do you want me to marry Xia Chun Hua?

64
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
I don't want it.

65
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,760
It's colorless and tasteless.

66
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,560
I take it once every three days.

67
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,760
On the surface,

68
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
it looks like

69
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,360
my body is getting stronger.

70
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
It's very strong.

71
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,760
In fact,

72
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,760
the poison will accumulate in the body.

73
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,360
It only lasts for three years.

74
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
Then it can be unconscious

75
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,960
and die like falling asleep.

76
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,160
It's a common disease.

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,760
Will it be checked by

78
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,960
the imperial doctor of the Qingping Anmai?

79
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,360
It's a secret medicine from the previous dynasty.

80
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,160
I take it once every three days.

81
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
It's a small dose.

82
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,560
It won't be detected.

83
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,160
I'll find a chance

84
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
to lead you to the crown prince these days

85
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,560
so that you can make up for his loss.

86
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,160
Please wait for my order.

87
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,560
I'll take my leave.

88
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,560
My lady,

89
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,960
the crown prince prepared for you

90
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,160
your favorite almond crisp.

91
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
Have some.

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Thank you.

93
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
I'll take it.

94
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,360
No.

95
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
You eat it.

96
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Jiang Risheng,

97
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,160
don't be too nice to me.

98
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
My lady.

99
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,160
Suzhu,

100
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,560
go and prepare.

101
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Tonight,

102
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
we have more important things to do.

103
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,760
The weather is dry.

104
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,960
Be careful of fire.

105
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,760
The weather is dry.

106
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Be careful of fire.

107
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
The weather is dry.

108
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Be careful of fire.

109
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Give me one.

110
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Give me one.

111
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,960
This is really the method of this test.

112
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,560
No.

113
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
With this method,

114
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,760
we can definitely make it.

115
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
That's right.

116
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
That's right.

117
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
That's right.

118
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Hurry up and prepare it.

119
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
It's really good.

120
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
That's great.

121
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
This is really good.

122
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
It's really good.

123
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
It's really good.

124
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
No problem.

125
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,160
How is it?

126
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Did you find anything?

127
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,960
The bodyguard said

128
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,360
the crown prince was going to

129
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
investigate the past events in the study

130
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,160
for the sake of the crown prince.

131
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
My lady, please don't wait for him.

132
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Rest early.

133
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,960
Okay.

134
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
I understand.

135
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
You can leave first.

136
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Yes.

137
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
Come out.

138
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
It's you again.

139
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
It seems that I

140
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
was recorded by the crown princess.

141
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,560
The crown princess is in black.

142
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,360
She looks so beautiful.

143
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,160
You tricked me three times.

144
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
What exactly do you want to do?

145
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,160
I like the crown princess.

146
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Do you not understand the crown princess?

147
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,360
It's so rare to have a fairy.

148
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,560
Who is the crown princess going to give it to?

149
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,360
I want to give it to the crown princess.

150
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,760
A useless person like the crown princess

151
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,560
is too aggrieved

152
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,360
to marry the crown princess.

153
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
But

154
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,160
there is no need to use the way of the fairy.

155
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,760
I can do it.

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,960
You said you wanted to help me.

157
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
But you always wear a mask

158
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,760
and never show your face.

159
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,360
If you can take off the mask

160
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,160
and tell me your real identity,

161
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,760
there is still a chance.

162
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,560
Now...

163
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
Now is not the time.

164
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,560
But to be able to share the royal power with the crown princess

165
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
is a good thing.

166
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,160
You don't need to run away.

167
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,360
We are on the same boat.

168
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,360
I want to help you.

169
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,760
I can't tell you my identity now.

170
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,960
But I promise you

171
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,560
in this palace,

172
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
you will always be the safest.

173
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,960
You are the crown prince's...

174
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
No.

175
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,160
I am yours.

176
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,560
Let's go.

177
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,760
Leave here.

178
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,160
You should be the one to give me the question.

179
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
But Guo Heng asked you to set the question.

180
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,160
He doesn't even take you seriously.

181
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,760
He doesn't take me seriously.

182
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,560
In his eyes, I'm just a living target.

183
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,360
He set the question?

184
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,760
Yes.

185
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,160
His Highness said he would study the year-end exam paper.

186
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,560
Guo Heng used his time to prepare the paper.

187
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,360
His Majesty set the question beforehand.

188
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,760
It seems he can't wait any longer.

189
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,760
His Highness is also waiting for the answer?

190
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,360
He's just guessing.

191
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,360
With my talent, I'm sure he won't be able to get the question.

192
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,760
Fine.

193
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,760
I'll just wait for Guo Heng to send the question.

194
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,360
The people from the lower level reported that

195
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,960
they ran into another group of people when they were investigating Guo's family.

196
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,560
I don't think they're Jiang Yuehao's men.

197
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,160
My Lady, when Ding Er reported that they were investigating,

198
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,160
another group of people were also investigating the Spring Festival.

199
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,560
You fought with them?

200
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,960
Yes.

201
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,960
It's just that they seem to have found us.

202
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,560
Look.

203
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,760
It's fine. If you're done fighting,

204
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,560
just tell them that you're Jiang Yuehao's men.

205
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Let Ding Er be careful. If they find out,

206
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,760
just call them by their names.

207
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,160
Yes.

208
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,400
General's presentation minister,

209
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,000
you decided to obtain benefactors' permits today.

210
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,960
In his personal life,

211
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,980
Xu Y poquito and Xixiang were obsessed with

212
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,840
power prices,

213
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,040
but Difurbing CHO

214
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,640
kept their affection cavalier.

215
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
Because of this

216
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,660
all the church and the lowest level

217
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,560
couldn't preserve No.1's trust.

218
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,280
Philip will not trust

219
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
a Christian.

220
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,960
If I hadn't been,

221
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,560
I would have been really per nationally astronomy Welcome.

222
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,360
Sure.

223
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,160
I want to look back with you

224
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,280
The clouds are cloudy

225
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,520
Is it the moonlight

226
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:23,040
Or the moon in your heart

227
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,760
The old sea is trapped in the eye and does not dare to retreat

228
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,060
incredible

229
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,520
when lover

230
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,160
The regret of regret is locked in the palace

231
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:06,320
Only true love can return to the years of the past

232
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,800
The mask has seen the past

233
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,160
You are in the eye
