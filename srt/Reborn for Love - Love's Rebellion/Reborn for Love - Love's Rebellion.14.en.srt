00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,260
So Chief Nan Fang has already...

194
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,170
That talisman genie...

195
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,720
Even if you

196
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,270
got the second volume of the talisman genie today,

197
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,550
she's the only one who can absorb

198
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,410
the talisman genie and make it whole.

199
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,760
I advise you to let it go.

200
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,990
Nan Yan is going to wake up.

201
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,590
I might not be able to take it.

202
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,260
Why am I here?

203
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,990
The Seven Sins Manual is split

204
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,200
into two parts.

205
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,730
The first half is in your body.

206
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,180
The other half

207
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,150
is in the inner circle of Filth Valley.

208
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,210
Just now,

209
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,550
the talisman genies sensed each other

210
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,260
and brought you here by force.

211
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,700
You're injured.

212
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,950
I'm fine.

213
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,410
You mean

214
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,290
the Seven Sins Manual

215
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,520
is in my body now?

216
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,890
There was only half of it before.

217
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,030
Now it has become one.

218
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,420
Ji Yang.

219
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,320
Hold on.

220
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,170
Look.

221
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,910
You finally got what you wanted.

222
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,240
Wait.

223
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,859
It is said that

224
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,270
the blood of an alchemist

225
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,270
can increase the effect of the pill.

226
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,839
Here.

227
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,990
Dragon Lord.

228
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,940
Who did this?

229
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,830
Dragon Lord.

230
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,590
We cannot

231
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,070
let this matter go so easily.

232
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,730
We must avenge the Young Lord.

233
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,230
Zhanting has never suffered.

234
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,900
Judging from his injury,

235
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,030
it was caused by a desperate battle.

236
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,350
But for him,

237
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,550
this is also a lesson.

238
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,580
It'll teach him that

239
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,200
only capable people

240
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,310
can master their own fate.

241
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,010
This revenge

242
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,590
must be served by Zhanting

243
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,500
himself.

244
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,430
Dragon Lord.

245
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,010
Filth Valley is closing soon.

246
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,010
We have to leave as soon as possible.

247
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,510
Let's go.

248
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,840
How are you?

249
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,280
Are you feeling better?

250
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,790
Don't you

251
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,650
have any other questions for me?

252
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,830
For example, ask me

253
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,470
if I stayed in the Lunar Sect

254
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,240
and taught you magic

255
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,620
for the Seven Sins Manual.

256
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,270
So what if you did?

257
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,190
I don't mind.

258
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,400
Even when I set up the formation

259
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,800
on the second day I met you

260
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,590
and almost killed you

261
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,590
to retrieve

262
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,570
the talisman genie,

263
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,370
you don't mind?

264
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,180
You said it.

265
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,760
Only almost.

266
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,610
I'm perfectly

267
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,140
fine right now.

268
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,510
Besides,

269
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,260
you've been my

270
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,860
medicine tester for so long.

271
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,960
We're

272
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,100
even now.

273
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,820
If...

274
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,960
If you mind,

275
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,570
then...

276
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,080
Continue to be my medicine tester.

277
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,700
For how long?

278
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,130
As long as possible.

279
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,240
Your pulse is strong and powerful.

280
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,110
The Five-Poison Heart Pill

281
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,820
really worked.

282
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,530
As expected of you.

283
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,060
Little Fox!

284
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,090
Let him go!

285
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,270
Hand over the Seven Sins Manual

286
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,070
or I'll sacrifice this

287
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,260
fox to heaven.

288
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,610
Save me!

289
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,870
The Seven Sins Manual has been obtained.

290
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,470
I have no use for him anymore.

291
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,570
Besides,

292
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,630
this sly fox

293
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,760
tried to kill me and Yan several times.

294
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,990
Sacrificing him to heaven

295
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,250
is exactly what I want.

296
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,070
The lord of Great Path

297
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,430
is really ruthless.

298
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,910
It seems that the rumors

299
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,470
about you are true.

300
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,290
Since his life is worthless,

301
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,210
I'll kill him first.

302
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,910
Wait!

303
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,800
I have the Seven Sins Manual.

304
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,170
I can give it to you.

305
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,360
But you have to let him go first.

306
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,780
Yan, calm down.

307
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,380
Little Fox owes me a favor.

308
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,300
I'll save him.

309
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,710
You deal with Deng Ba.

310
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,840
Yan...

311
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,870
Don't believe them.

312
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,310
Hand over the Seven Sins Manual!

313
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,910
I told you to let him go first!

314
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,690
Little Fox!

315
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,830
Go!

316
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,490
Yan!

317
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,620
Yan!

318
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,510
Ji Yang!

319
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,910
Ji Yang!

320
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,630
You killed Yan

321
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,600
and Ji Yang!

322
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,070
Yu Yong.

323
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,310
Die Wan.

324
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,360
And Deng Ba.

325
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,640
Two lives for three lives.

326
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,650
Only you left.

327
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,050
Mian.

328
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,750
Come.

329
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,960
Kill him yourself.

330
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,460
Chief.

331
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,020
The Yin Zhus are returning to their nests.

332
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,790
Although we have

333
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,070
the spirit bone magical weapon,

334
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,000
we're no match for so many Yin Zhus.

335
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,790
Why don't we evacuate as soon as possible

336
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,460
and let the fox stay here

337
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,990
to be drained alive?

338
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,170
Let's go.

339
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,690
Yan!

340
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,110
Young Lord, he...

341
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,550
He...

342
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,260
Young Lord...

343
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,920
What happened to him?

344
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,530
He's severely injured

345
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,320
and fainted.

346
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,170
It's good that he's alive.

347
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,350
By the way,

348
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,960
have you seen my beloved disciple?

349
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,230
She's the girl who entered

350
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,100
the valley with your young lord.

351
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,920
We didn't see her.

352
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,880
She’s still in the valley.

353
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,090
Did something really happen?

354
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,950
The Filth Valley is closing soon.

355
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,900
Good luck, Mr. Meng.

356
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,240
I'll take my leave.

357
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,920
Oh, Nan Yan...

358
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,160
You must be safe.

359
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,630
Otherwise, how can I

360
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,890
answer to your mother?

361
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,970
If I use all my spiritual powers

362
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,330
to resist the barrier,

363
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,560
I might be able to buy her some time.

364
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,150
Whether she can get out alive

365
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,030
depends on her fate.

366
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,230
Ji Yang.

367
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,440
We survived a fall

368
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,380
from the cliff.

369
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,870
This proves that

370
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,750
it's not our time to die yet.

371
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,030
We need to

372
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,950
find a way to get up there.

373
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,190
Listen.

374
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,920
The Filth Valley is closing soon.

375
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,280
All the Yin Zhus will return to their nest.

376
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,200
By then,

377
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,860
we won't be able to hide here anymore.

378
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,390
What about the silver mermaid pearl?

379
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,950
Can't it keep us safe?

380
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,380
We're in the Yin Zhus' lair.

381
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,610
Even with the protection of the silver mermaid pearl,

382
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,520
we will only be safe for a moment.

383
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,300
What about after that?

384
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,390
We'll surely die.

385
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,410
My mom has passed away.

386
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,250
Your heart disease

387
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,790
has recovered.

388
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,580
I...

389
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,620
I have no regrets.

390
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,440
But you have to live.

391
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,390
You have to live a good life.

392
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,190
You're different from me.

393
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,830
You still have unfulfilled wishes.

394
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:37,900
Nan Yan.

395
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,260
Forget about me.

396
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,520
Forget you?

397
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:53,570
Nan Yan.

398
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,390
I can only

399
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,220
gamble with my remaining spiritual power

400
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,790
for a chance of survival.

401
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,980
Don't do anything stupid.

402
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,730
You promised me.

403
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,360
You promised me

404
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,670
to get out of here alive.

405
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,340
You can't leave me, Ji Yang.

406
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,020
You can't leave me!

407
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,360
Didn't you promise me?

408
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,770
You promised me!

409
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,590
You said

410
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,300
we would

411
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,240
get out of here together alive.

412
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,200
Don't do anything stupid.

413
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,960
If you do something stupid,

414
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,280
I will hate you, Ji Yang.

415
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,160
I will hate you!

416
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,110
I will never forgive you

417
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,290
in this lifetime.

418
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,510
You promised me

419
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,760
that you would get out alive.

420
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,650
You can't break your promise!

Yan.

You can't go down.

471
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,230
He's not dead.

472
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,310
Filth Valley is closing soon.

473
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:11,830
Ji Yang is alive!

474
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,510
We need to get out of here as soon as possible.

475
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,389
Let go of me!

476
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,670
Yan!

477
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,909
-Ji Yang!
-Yan.

478
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,790
-Ji Yang!
-You can't go down there.

479
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,600
Yan!

480
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:19,940
Ji Yang!

481
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,020
He's not dead!

482
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,929
Yan!

483
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:24,699
We're running out of time!

484
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,920
Ji Yang is not dead!

485
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,590
Ji Yang!

486
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,739
Let go of me!

487
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,880
Ji Yang!

488
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,000
What a fool.

489
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,470
The Filth Valley is closing.

490
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,750
Instead of running for his life,

491
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,550
he's carrying a burden with him.

492
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,450
I still hate the human clan.

493
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,090
They are always hypocritical

494
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,990
and cold-blooded.

495
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,720
But...

496
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,810
I don't hate you guys anymore.

497
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,060
Because...

498
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,350
Because...

499
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,770
The four of us

500
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,060
are stupid together.

501
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,280
God.

502
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,580
Please show us mercy.

503
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,820
Even if you want to kill me,

504
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,390
at least let Nan Yan

505
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,730
get out alive.

506
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,150
Chief...

507
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,860
Come out now!

508
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,630
Little Fox!

509
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,210
Where is Lord Shao Cang?

510
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,040
He died at the bottom of the cliff.

511
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,900
He died at the bottom of the cliff,

512
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,720
where the Yin Zhus' lair is.

513
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,290
How is Nan Yan?

514
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,790
She just fainted.

515
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,490
She's not in danger.

516
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,830
Isn’t this Elder Zhu,

517
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,030
who abuses his seniority?

518
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,560
Haven't found your rebellious disciple yet?

519
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,270
This little fox is protecting a transgressor.

520
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,110
I must take him back today

521
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,870
so the premier may punish him.

522
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,490
Leave this to me.

523
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,420
Take Nan Yan back to the Lunar Sect.

524
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,470
This fox brings me gambling luck.

525
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,290
It’s my lucky fox.

526
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,660
If you want to take him away,

527
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,790
you'll have to ask me

528
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,990
for permission.

529
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,780
Elder Zhu.

530
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,140
The barrier is closed.

531
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,550
Shao Cang isn't out yet.

532
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,900
I'm afraid he's already dead inside.

533
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,000
Let's go.

534
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,670
Let's go back to Great Path first

535
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,130
and report to the Premier.

536
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,550
Young friend.

537
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,900
I am Endurance.

538
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:02,720
I would like to befriend you.

539
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,240
I was going to the valley

540
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,790
to pick someone up.

541
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,630
I didn't expect you

542
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,720
to do me such a big favor

543
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,790
and pick her up for me.

544
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,390
To express my gratitude,

545
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,290
I am

546
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,450
willing to befriend you.

547
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,470
I don't understand what you're talking about.

548
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,430
If you want friends,

549
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,430
find someone else.
