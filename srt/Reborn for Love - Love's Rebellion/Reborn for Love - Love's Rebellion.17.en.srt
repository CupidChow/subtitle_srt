00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,310
It seems that

5
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,370
I'm not the only one

6
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,980
who can control Yin Zhus.

00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,500

8
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,670
You know me?

Forget it if you don’t remember.

10

Guys?

12
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,789
It seems that you don't remember Nan Yan either.

13

Who's Nan Yan?

14
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,240
It doesn't matter.

15
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,420
It's your fate that you cannot escape from protecting

16
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,150

I failed in protecting your Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

20
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,570
That demon covets it.

21
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,150
The purpose must be to gather the power of the Yin Zhus

22
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,150
and disrupt the cultivation realm.

23
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,550

Aren't they supposed to be in the Filth Valley?

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,430
Perhaps...

69
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,180

You have reached enlightenment.

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,630
concerning your destiny and responsibilities

82

Only those who have endured nine calamities

94
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,120
can decipher them.

97

the words of the ancestor.

100

the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

114
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,320
can break the array at Youquan Prison in Nancang.

115
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,390
You must catch up with him,

116
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,350
and retrieve the hairpin.

117

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,030
Why bother snatching the hairpin?

122
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,870
I can just go to the next prison

123
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,870
to intercept him.

124
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,690
Then what are you waiting for?

125

If he truly is the reincarnated Sen Luo,

147
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,560

Those demonic cultivators are so blatant.

170
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,430
It was an act showing that

171
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,270

172

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,910
how dare you use the same old trick again?

386
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,500
It's ridiculous!

387
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,560
[Jintang Pier]

388
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,450
These people are quite something.

389
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,210
If they obstruct us,

390
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,670
just kill them all.

391
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,440
If you destroy the whaleboat,

392
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,170
are you planning to walk to the Nancang Demon Sea?

393
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,970
Hiding demonic aura

394
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,940
is easy

395
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,780
for me.

396
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,610
What sect are you from?

397
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,880
[Lunar Sect]

398
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,090
Lunar Sect.

399
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,690
What is

400
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,740
your name?

401
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,310
My name is Yin.

402
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,490
[Yin from the Lunar Sect]

403
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,350
The inspection this time is very strict.

404
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,350
But we can be relieved now.

405
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,490
They have found out a demon.

406
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,820
Now there's no problem.

407
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,840
How is it?

408
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,310
As expected,

409
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,970
the scent of Yin Zhu has gotten on the whaleboat.

410
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,190
The demon is up to something big.

411
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,670
If any more demons

412
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,160
dare to use concealment talismans to sneak through,

413
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,090
they will be killed without mercy.

414
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,030
I didn't prepare for it.

415
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,670
I didn't expect

416
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,600
the inspection to be so strict now.

417
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,390
Here.

418
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,380
Give it back to me after we get off the whaleboat.

419
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,160
You really do care for me the most.

420
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,130
Put it on.

421
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,150
The whaleboat is like a small city.

422
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:54,990
The city

423
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,480
is divided into three areas.

424
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,510
The place we just stayed

425
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,510
is the guest area.

426
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,070
This is the trading area,

427
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,530
where all sorts of people gather,

428
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,600
a mix of good and bad,

429
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,110
so you can find some

430
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,640
rare spiritual treasures.

431
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,700
Why are you walking so fast?

432
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,870
There are so many good things.

433
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,850
We can browse

434
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,630
as we search.

435
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,570
This demon is hard to deal with.

436
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,390
There's not even a trace

437
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,090
of Yin Zhu's scent on the boat.

438
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,670
As long as he doesn’t take action,

439
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,630
he won’t be exposed.

440
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,430
Isn't it a waste of effort

441
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,760
to keep watch like this?

442
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,550
That's why

443
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,190
we can't just wait for him to act.

444
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,620
If he takes action first

445
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,990
and releases the Yin Zhu,

446
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,150
all the thousands of people on this boat

447
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,420
will be doomed.

448
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,570
What is this place?

449
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,310
The management office of the whaleboat.

450
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,270
The captain is a powerful figure

451
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,030
at the Yuanying Level in the cultivation realm.

452
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,150
He handles all the major and minor affairs

453
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,070
on the boat.

454
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,430
If we can team up with the captain for the search,

455
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,560
it will definitely be more effective.

456
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,820
Then let’s go find him.

457
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,920
Let's go.

458
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,280
Let's go.

459
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,560
I am Zhen Yuan,

460
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,920
a disciple of Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea.

461
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,390
I have something important

462
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,520
to discuss with you.

463
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,280
Disciple of Master of Endurance?

464
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,860
You're the Bloody-handed Asura?

465
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,070
Yes.

466
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,590
This is my friend, Yin Ya.

467
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,310
I can be consider an external disciple

468
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,240
of the Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea.

469
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,530
I've made an exception

470
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,750
and arranged a superior room for you.

471
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,390
If there are any issues with the food

472
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,520
or accommodations,

473
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,990
just speak to the waiter in the guest area.

474
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,950
Sir,

475
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,390
a demonic cultivator has sneaked onto the whaleboat.

476
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,190
Demonic cultivator?

477
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,590
He has Yin Zhu,

478
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,750
which means he’s not an ordinary demonic cultivator.

479
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,330
We’ve tracked him all the way here.

480
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,170
I’m certain

481
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,040
this demon is on the whaleboat.

482
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,880
However, he’s currently concealing his scent and holding his breath,

483
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,480
so we can’t locate him for the moment.

484
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,520
Nonsense!

485
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,030
I’ve been at the helm for decades

486
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,810
without making any mistakes.

487
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,990
If what you said is true

488
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,590
and such a powerful demon

489
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,050
has sneaked onto the ship,

490
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,210
wouldn’t that mean

491
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,090
that both I and the guards

492
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,720
on the whaleboat are blind?

493
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,600
What I said is true.

494
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,400
Please lend your assistance

495
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,280
and help us eliminate this demon.

496
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,290
Young lady,

497
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,190
you’re relying on the title of the Bloody-handed Asura

498
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,790
and your word with no evidence,

499
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,150
expecting everyone on the ship to join you

500
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,070
in a game of catching a thief.

501
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,630
I don’t have time for this.

502
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,390
Come on, you old man.

503
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,040
Not only are you blind, but you’re also deaf.

504
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,670
This matter

505
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,710
concerns the lives of everyone on the ship.

506
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,270
Why can’t you hear

507
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,230
a single word from us?

508
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,640
It's none of your business.

509
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,370
See them out.

510
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,970
Hey, You old man...

511
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,920
You attacked us?

512
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,110
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

513
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,770
Little Fox.

514
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,600
Let's go.

515
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:22,870
Wait, he...

516
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,400
Let's go.

517
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,030
He's so ungrateful.

518
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,750
He must either be stupid

519
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,480
or have serious mental issues.

520
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,880
He indeed has a problem.

521
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,480
He has

522
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,630
a flushed face,

523
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,630
bulging eyes,

524
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,310
and sores on his mouth and tongue,

525
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,710
and he sweats a lot and is sensitive to heat.

526
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,830
These are clear signs

527
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,230
of excessive liver heat.

528
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,280
No wonder I smelled

529
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,970
the stench of sweat from afar.

530
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,540
And his neck

531
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,470
is noticeably

532
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,760
thicker than normal.

533
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,950
It seems that he has a long-standing illness

534
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,110
for which mortal medicines

535
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,510
are no longer effective,

536
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,230
which is why he’s irritable

537
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,310
and has difficulty controlling his emotions.

538
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,470
Even if it’s a terminal illness,

539
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,790
it’s unlikely to be beyond your capabilities.

540
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,630
If we can

541
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,140
cure him,

542
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,430
it will make discussing demon-slaying

543
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,940
with him much easier.

544
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,550
Cure him?

545
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,630
Are you going to use poison?

546
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,830
I haven’t used poison in a long time.

547
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,670
Let’s first

548
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,260
check out the apothecary ahead.

549
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,110
Sure.

550
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,430
Let’s use something strong on him

551
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,110
and show him

552
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:27,950
our strength.

553
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,150
A new poetry collection by Young Dragon Lord is out,

554
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,810
containing exclusive Dragon Capital secrets.

555
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,060
It contains exclusive Dragon Capital secrets.

556
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,080
Take a look at the new book.

557
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,320
I wonder how Big Brother is doing.

558
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,550
He actually managed to publish

559
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,380
a poetry collection under the Dragon Lord's nose?

560
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,840
Could it be that his dad has changed his mind?

561
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,450
Dragon Capital is so boring.

562
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,890
Everyone is just playing tricks.

563
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,290
The tricks aren’t impressive,

564
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,050
but the flattery is loud.

565
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,910
This is not a secret of Dragon Capital.

566
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,620
This is a public execution.

567
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,510
That's him.

568
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,690
Great!

569
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,390
Great!

570
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,430
And there's more.

571
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,350
Young Lord! Young Lord!

572
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,320
It's so hot!

573
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,500
Hurry up!

574
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,200
Look at our Young Lord.

575
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,980
You've improved a lot.

576
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,330
Your fire is unstoppable.

577
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,270
Congratulations,

578
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,560
Young Lord.

579
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,900
You can't say that.

580
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,590
I was

581
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,550
originally a star in the literary world.

582
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,880
It was only for the sake of my friends

583
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,290
that I accidentally

584
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,660
reached the pinnacle of martial arts.

585
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,540
Alright.

586
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,870
That’s enough for today.

587
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,590
I’m now inspired

588
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,810
and eager to go back and write poetry.

589
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,590
Young Lord.

590
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,740
The Dragon Lord said

591
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,060
you must practice for the time

592
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,860
it takes for a full incense stick to burn every day.

593
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,720
How about

594
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,910
doing a martial arts squat for a while?

595
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,810
Well, I...

596
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,160
See?

597
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,200
It must be because the fire was too intense earlier

598
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,300
and made him sweat, right?

599
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,310
Let me wipe it off.

600
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,390
Don't catch a cold.

601
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,540
You were right.

602
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,630
Yes, I do

603
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,590
feel a bit unwell now.

604
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,440
I’ll head back first.

605
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,240
Young Lord.

606
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,510
You don't feel well?

607
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,980
I specifically prepared a secret medicine.

608
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,820
Finish your practice before you leave.

609
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,870
[Cold Medicine]

610
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,820
[Cold Medicine]

611
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,520
Why do you have everything?

612
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,100
[Cold Medicine]

613
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,510
Fine.

614
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,900
I don't have to go back.

615
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,300
How about

616
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,620
I recite a poem for you two here?

617
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,620
What do you think?

618
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,750
I haven’t fully absorbed

619
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,670
yesterday’s poem yet.

620
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,310
Could you please hold on a little longer?

621
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,770
You haven't absorbed yet?

622
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,450
Come on.

623
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,300
Being so dull and lax,

624
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,980
how can you make any progress?

625
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,130
Tell me,

626
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,920
how has the response been

627
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,590
to my new poetry collection?

628
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,020
It's already being talked about in the streets.

629
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,950
They just constantly complain...

630
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,570
They...

631
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,190
They are full of praise.

632
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,610
They are all complaining.

633
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,170
Nonsense!

634
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,850
What is there to complain?

635
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,810
They...

636
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,800
They complain that

637
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,290
the word count is not enough.

638
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,550
Look,

639
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,700
I knew it!

640
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,990
This just comes naturally, doesn’t it?

641
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,610
This is just the

642
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,670
perfect scene.

643
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,310
Thoughts gushing forth uncontrollably,

644
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,380
stuck doing squats in the square,

645
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,850
sneezes blasting away with the wind.

646
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,160
And wouldn’t you know it?
Someone’s standing right in my way.

647
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,630
See?

648
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,090
This is what we call professional.

649
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:31,910
Young Lord,

650
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,060
let's just get back to practice, shall we?

651
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,960
Me, practice?

652
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,670
What's the point of me practicing?

653
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,630
You don't know,

654
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,440
Nan Yan,

655
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,330
my sister,

656
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,350
has inherited the true teachings of

657
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,790
the Master of Endurance.

658
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,150
I don't need to protect her.

659
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,230
So tell me, what good is this practice for me?

660
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,230
Absolutely none!

661
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,870
But, Young Lord...

662
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,150
Well...

663
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,680
Alright.

664
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,000
Now I need to take time

665
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,260
to listen to their feedback,

666
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,000
right?

667
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,790
So when I go out

668
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,920
and meet them again,

669
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,270
I can take these new works

670
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,720
as a reunion gift.

671
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,760
Four copies each

672
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,310
for...

673
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,050
Not one less.

674
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:10,840
OK.

675
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:11,909
Let's go.

676
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:12,820
Go and see

677
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,510
what the literary world

678
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,960
think of me

679
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,050
as a rising star.

680
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,070
Young Lord.

681
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,469
Young Lord!

682
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,190
Young Lord.

683
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,150
Practice! Just Practice!

684
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,630
What are you doing?

685
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,310
Practice! Practice!

686
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:21,870
Let me go!

687
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,550
Everything has changed over these three years,

688
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,880
yet he remains the same.

689
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,190
If the Dragon Lord sees

690
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,320
his peculiar poems,

691
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,320
he may not escape unscathed.

692
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,330
Both of you,

693
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,949
Our Young Lord is both knowledgeable and talented.

694
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,469
Why not take two books back with you

695
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,469
for a closer look?

696
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,420
How about this?

697
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,670
I'll give you a special offer,

698
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,400
you can buy one and get one free.

699
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,070
knowledgeable and talented.

700
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,469
You're really good at flattering.

701
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,830
Let's buy two then.

702
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,810
Why?

703
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,920
Take them back as souvenirs.

704
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:01,790
Father.

705
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,990
Since you asked me to practice martial arts,

706
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,360
I've been working hard

707
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,410
from dawn to dusk every day.

708
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,310
Now that I've mastered it,

709
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,640
Why won't you let me out?

710
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,180
What are you going out for?

711
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:15,840
I...

712
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,550
Is it for your so-called

713
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,150
Mighty Dragon Literary Society again?

714
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,550
I have other things to do.

715
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,670
You promised me that

716
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,270
you would let me write poems.

717
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,330
I did promise you.

718
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,430
But that was because at the gate of Filth Valley,

719
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,690
your little friend

720
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,120
passionately proposed

721
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,160
that I shall respect your hobby.

722
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,060
Okay.

723
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,000
I did so.

724
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,310
And I spent a considerable amount of money

725
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,950
to publish your poetry collection.

726
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,590
But what

727
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,520
you wrote is completely nonsense.

728
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,220
You see my poems?

729
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,630
How would I know if I didn't see it?

730
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,970
You are spouting nonsense,

731
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,870
completely disgracing

732
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,110
Dragon Capital's reputation.

733
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,130
How am I talking nonsense?

734
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,590
Art itself is...

735
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,790
It comes from life and is higher than life.

736
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,270
I'm just doing it on a real basis...

737
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,500
Shut up!

738
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,930
How dare you talk back?

739
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:57,860
Guards!

740
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,590
Take him away and lock him up!

741
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,590
Burn all his writing brushes, ink,

742
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,630
paper, and inkstone!

743
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,290
He's not allowed to write a single word anymore!

744
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,030
No.

745
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:05,710
No.

746
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,650
You foolish emperor!

747
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,310
A tyrant!

748
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,870
You have no martial arts ethics!

749
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,050
You can't do this!

750
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,640
Yu Quan, Yu Que.

751
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,010
Go to the Royal Treasury

752
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,240
and pick some things

753
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,070
that girls would like.

754
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,090
What girls would like.

755
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,550
Our Dragon Court

756
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,320
is all men.

757
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,910
And the treasury is full of ancient weapons.

758
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,750
There's nothing that girls would like.

759
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,210
Go buy if there are not any.

760
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,310
We are going to welcome

761
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,460
the lady of the house here very soon.

762
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,800
Are you getting married?

763
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,760
Nonsense!

764
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,120
Talking rubbish!

765
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,720
Young Lord is getting married.

766
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,330
Young Lord is in his prime,

767
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,580
is he marrying early?

768
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,990
This

769
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,870
unfilial son

770
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,660
is mostly due to

771
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,200
his immature nature

772
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,870
and being unmarried.

773
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,280
Let him marry early,

774
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,110
firstly, it can bring children and blessings

775
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,370
to our Dragon Capital.

776
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,780
And secondly,

777
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,800
with a wife and child by the hearth,

778
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,440
it could also temper

779
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,190
his impulsive nature.

780
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,240
His Majesty is wise.

781
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,590
Once the Young Lord enters the land of tenderness

782
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,450
he will no longer act recklessly.

783
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,400
Master Yun of the Yao Palace

784
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,290
has mentioned to me several times

785
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,900
hoping that Miss Yun Nian

786
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,440
could marry Zhan.

787
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,790
What do you think?

788
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,560
Miss Yun comes from a noble family.

789
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,390
it is said that she is gentle and virtuous,

790
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,870
knowledgeable and well-mannered.

791
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,800
If she could often stay by his side,

792
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,670
she would surely make Young Lord more stable.

793
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,010
Good.

794
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,190
Very good.

795
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,930
I've sent someone

796
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,430
to pick up Nian Nian.

798
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,390
Are the two of you here to buy medicinal herbs?

799
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,320
Come in and have a look,

800
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,850
we have everything inside.

801
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,890
Let's go inside.

802
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
This way, please.

803
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,700
Boss,

804
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,630
do you have

805
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,370
top-quality Wanku grass?

806
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,750
Miss,

807
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,240
the Wanku grass is highly poisonous.

808
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,840
If taken carelessly,

809
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,430
at the least it can cause diarrhea for three days,

810
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,160
and at worst,

811
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,110
it may be utterly devastating.

812
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,080
Such harmful items

813
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,830
should not be bought and sold carelessly.

814
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,000
That intense, huh?

815
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,690
Since it's a poisonous plant,

816
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,240
it can also clear heat when used in medicine.

817
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,550
Experts all understand that

818
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,350
that it's a rare medicinal herb.

819
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,810
Just go ahead and fetch it.

820
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,600
Even that being said,

821
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,480
what if

822
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,590
something goes wrong?

823
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,560
Don't worry.

Okay.

Both of you,

please wait for a moment.

What's wrong?

00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,110
Do you feel like

someone is watching us covertly?

835
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,310
I didn't expect that

836
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,910
the Bloody Asura

837
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,030
would turn out to be

838
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,390
such an ethereal beauty.

839
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,510
What are you looking at, Young Lord?

840
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,720
I'm just looking at...

841

I just want to see...

842
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,300
Have you seen enough, Young Lord?

843
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,800
I'm getting jealous.

No one is as pretty as you.

Come.

Since we got on the whale boat,

850
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,470
I've always felt someone

851
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,590
watching us.

852
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,130
No.

853
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,550
with a face that brings trouble

854
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,990
and notorious reputation of

the Bloody Asuras.

856
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,170
It'd be odd not to attract attention.

Relax.
