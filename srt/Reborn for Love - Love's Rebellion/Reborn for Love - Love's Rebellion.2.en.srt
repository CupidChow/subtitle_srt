00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,720
In a few days,

388
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,630
we can harvest.

389
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,690
You can try it then.

390
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,390
Hurry up.

391
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,430
Yesterday, you asked me to stay

392
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,890
to test medicines for you.

393
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,190
You didn't say anything about fertilizing.

394
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,250
I said I'd offer you food and lodging,

395
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,070
but I didn't say they were free.

396
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,260
Wait. Wait.

397
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,310
How about

398
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,470
I offer you lodging for free?

399
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:39,990
Okay?

400
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,690
Come on.

401
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,760
Let me teach you.

402
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,110
Like this.

403
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,610
Put your hand in it.

404
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,310
Yes.

405
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,110
Grab more.

406
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,870
Grab more.

407
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,470
Don't look at me.

408
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,990
Look here.

409
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,450
Come on.

410
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,800
Grab it.

411
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,070
Yes, come on.

412
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,650
Come on. Grab.

413
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,590
Grab it.

414
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,670
Grab it with your hand.

415
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,270
Yes.

416
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,120
Then put it here.

417
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,990
Above the root.

418
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,750
Again.

419
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,070
Grab more.

420
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,710
Yes.

421
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,910
Put it here.

422
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,970
Above the root.

423
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,220
What do you think?

424
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,830
Simple, right?

425
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,790
Come on, try again.

426
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,850
Grab more.

427
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,550
Put it here.

428
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,350
Yeah.

429
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,480
Alright, Miss.

430
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,230
I've learned how to do it.

431
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,120
I'll leave the rest to you.

432
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,350
You learned it so fast.

433
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,040
Great.

434
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,920
Then I'll leave

435
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,030
this spiritual land to you.

436
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,430
I'll go grind some herbs.

437
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,480
After you wash your hands,

438
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,300
come to test pills.

439
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,760
Come on.

440
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,390
Go on.

441
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,110
Chop, chop.

442
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,910
Keep working.

443
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,970
Eight hours left.

444
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,120
I'll put up with you for now.

445
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,750
You have no idea.

446
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,270
Since I was young,

447
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,550
my dad has only cared about

448
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,550
his turf wars.

449
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,750
In my long

450
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,710
and dark childhood,

451
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,550
I accidentally

452
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,790
read Lord Shao Cang's poems.

453
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,510
They blew my mind

454
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,710
and stirred my heart.

455
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:00,840
After that,

456
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,910
I started my journey in literature

457
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,930
and aspired

458
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,840
to create my own poetic genre:

459
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,390
the Mighty Dragon Genre.

460
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,690
Mighty Dragon?

461
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,290
Wait.

462
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,990
Whose poems did you read?

463
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,590
Lord…

464
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,040
You were just a naive boy back then.

465
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,810
Don't mention that man again.

466
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,260
Create your own genre

467
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,730
if you want.

468
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,030
It's not like someone's in your way.

469
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,580
My dad is.

470
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
He's so overbearing.

471
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,900
Every time I met kindred spirits

472
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,270
and tried to bond through literature,

473
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,070
he could always find me in no time

474
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,730
and use despicable means

475
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,190
to force them to leave me.

476
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,160
That's indeed too much.

477
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,550
He's such a tyrant.

478
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,030
Yes.

479
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,350
Every time,

480
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,990
he threw tens of thousands of spirit stones

481
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,260
right before those people

482
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,830
and asked them

483
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,110
to cut ties with me.

484
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,590
Wait, wait.

485
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,050
You mean…

486
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,630
You mean,

487
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,010
to make

488
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,210
people who were also interested

489
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,650
in poetry like you

490
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,120
cut ties with you

491
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,520
and never see you again,

492
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,710
your dad threw tens of thousands of spirit stones

493
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,950
before those people?

494
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,550
Yes.

495
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,210
Brother.

496
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,010
Time to take medicine.

497
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,000
Where are you going?

498
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:38,970
Lie down.

499
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,790
Eat this.

500
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,890
Heart-Strengthening Pill.

501
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,240
Wait for a while.

502
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,750
Your story

503
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,240
reminds me of

504
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,950
when I was young.

505
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,910
To tell you the truth,

506
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,150
I was just like you.

507
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,660
I had big dreams.

508
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,710
I loved calligraphy.

509
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,150
I wanted to be a great calligrapher.

510
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,320
Unfortunately,

511
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,590
my dad killed that dream.

512
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,570
So,

513
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,710
I relate to you.

514
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,760
Brother,

515
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,910
stay here

516
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,290
and pursue your dream.

517
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,470
If your dad comes here for you one day,

518
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,300
I'll definitely not

519
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,870
be bought by a few spirit stones.

520
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,550
He has to

521
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,750
give me at least 500,000 spirit stones.

522
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,790
Chief,

523
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,350
are you really willing to take me in?

524
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,310
From now on,

525
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,190
you're a disciple of the Lunar Sect.

526
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,610
I refused you just now

527
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,990
just to test if you were serious

528
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,610
about cultivation.

529
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,670
You didn't

530
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,780
let me down.

531
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,480
I knew it.

532
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,510
Thank you, Chief.

533
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,410
Since you are

534
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,390
a formal disciple of the Lunar Sect now,

535
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,270
as the chief,

536
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,470
I have to

537
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,560
tell you

538
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,030
the ethos of our sect.

539
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,830
I'm all ears.

540
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,770
Kill spirits and demons. Become invincible.

541
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,070
Rule the cultivation world.

542
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,670
Listen.

543
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,430
Those things

544
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,430
are unnecessary.

545
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,880
You heard me.

546
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,670
Talented cultivators are rare.

547
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,200
You're not likely to be one.

548
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,340
For cultivation,

549
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,760
good health

550
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,090
is the most important.

551
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,450
To be healthy,

552
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,990
you need a healthy lifestyle.

553
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,430
Eat well. Drink moderately.

554
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,080
Don't stand when you can sit.

555
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,830
Don't sit when you can lie down.

556
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,830
That's the way to prolong your life.

557
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,520
As for cultivation,

558
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,240
remember,

559
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,550
read more and fight less.

560
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,210
Otherwise,

561
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,550
I can't explain things to your parents.

562
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,590
Also,

563
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,630
don't mention Lord Shao Cang again.

564
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,150
Lunar Town is crawling

565
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,970
with people from the Great Path.

566
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,150
Don't get the Lunar Sect into trouble.

567
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,040
Understand?

568
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,400
Yes, Chief.

569
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,920
Okay. Time's up.

570
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,280
It should've kicked in.

571
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,910
Here.

572
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,710
Do you feel any heat here?

573
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,030
No.

574
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,630
No?

575
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,470
How about here?

576
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,710
N-No.

577
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,750
No?

578
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,070
How about here?

579
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,710
No, no.

580
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,070
I don't feel any heat.

581
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,030
Really?

582
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,870
Weird.

583
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,470
That pill is ten times stronger than normal ones.

584
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,830
It even worked on Strong.

585
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,230
Why does it have no effect

586
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,670
on you at all?

587
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,470
What went wrong?

588
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,350
Who is Strong?

589
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,070
The buffalo outside.

590
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,760
You test medicines on animals?

591
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,570
I had no choice.

592
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,920
I have a bad reputation.

593
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,700
Normally,

594
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:46,970
I only get to treat

595
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,020
cows and pigs.

596
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,830
But

597
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,710
I practice on humans sometimes.

598
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,650
Sometimes?

599
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,450
Aren't you a human?

600
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,150
But that doesn't matter.

601
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:57,920
What matters is that

602
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
you have to trust my medical skills.

603
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,150
In terms of making pills,

604
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,260
few people

605
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,550
are better than me

606
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,130
on all five continents.

607
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,550
What went wrong?

608
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,170
Don't go. Don't go.

609
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,310
Don't go.

610
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,190
Since this method didn't work,

611
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,550
I'll try something else.

612
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,080
I'm going to make new pills.

613
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,230
After that pill wears off,

614
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,160
come and help me.

615
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,150
It actually didn't work.

616
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,440
What went wrong?

617
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,250
Medicine test notes.

618
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,930
Patient classification.

619
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,570
Treating wild donkeys?

620
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,530
Treating buffaloes?

621
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,950
Treating Ji Yang?

622
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,820
Four hours.

623
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,070
I'll endure you for four more hours.

624
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,410
I told you not to stand

625
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,350
when you could lie down

626
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,080
and to read more and fight less,

627
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,770
yet you still caused trouble!

628
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,560
Chief.

629
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,960
Yesterday,

630
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,260
Nan Yan attacked me.

631
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,400
I almost

632
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,100
died.

633
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,790
I…

634
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,520
was just angry

635
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,980
and criticized her.

636
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,580
Yeah.

637
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,950
Nan Yan started it.

638
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,130
Chu Jing was just indignant.

639
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,530
Was he indignant,

640
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,950
or did you mean to pick on her?

641
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,310
Sorry, Chief.

642
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,680
Sorry, Chief.

643
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,670
You two,

644
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,200
go apologize to Nan Yan.

645
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,270
-Yes.
-Yes.

646
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,640
And you.

647
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,310
No way. It's none of my business.

648
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,510
I didn't set the fire.

649
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,830
Both of them

650
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,790
listen to you.

651
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,630
If you

652
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,320
hadn't had it out for Nan Yan,

653
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,300
how could this have happened?

654
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,510
Father.

655
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,790
Why are you always defending Nan Yan?

656
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,590
Has gambling addled your brain?

657
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,310
I'm your daughter.

658
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,720
Are you going or not?

659
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,670
No!

660
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,610
Now I know

661
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,070
why you always pester

662
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,870
her mother to play mahjong with you

663
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,070
and lose money to her.

664
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,870
You want to make her

665
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,310
my stepmother, don't you?

666
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,870
You...

667
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,430
Chief, calm down.

668
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:38,940
Go away!

669
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:39,500
Go ahead.

670
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,040
Beat me.

671
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,760
Beat me to death

672
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,690
so Nan Yan can take my place

673
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,930
to be your good daughter.

674
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,450
Stop.

675
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,110
I should be beaten. It's all my fault.

676
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,590
I spoiled you.

677
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,490
Nan Yan

678
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,890
is just like you.

679
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,470
You don't have a mother, and she doesn't have a father.

680
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,000
Life is hard for both of you.

681
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,110
Why is it that she's

682
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,430
hellbent on curing her mother

683
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,310
while you're hellbent

684
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,240
on making me angry and falling ill?

685
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,630
Chief, calm down.

686
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,310
We'll go apologize to her now.

687
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,790
I'm not going.

688
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,730
Calm down.

689
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,750
Let go of me.

690
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,510
Calm down.

691
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,470
I'm not going.

692
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,190
Eat.

693
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,930
This is the delicious food

694
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,390
you mentioned?

695
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,510
Is there a problem?

696
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,070
Just bear with it.

697
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,220
Mom.

698
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,440
Your heart disease

699
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
is very rare.

700
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,550
You have to depend on medicinal cuisine

701
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,750
to control symptoms.

702
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,250
That's more like it.

703
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,640
Listen to me.

704
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,850
This dish

705
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,990
is great for

706
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,760
your heart disease.

707
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,710
Finish it.

708
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,800
All of it.

709
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,750
I spent a lot of time on it.

710
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,150
Eat more.

711
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,670
Thank you for taking care of me.

712
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,810
Sorry.

713
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,400
In the future…

714
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,930
What are you talking about?

715
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,590
Do you want

716
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,720
to go back on your word?

717
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,300
So noisy.

718
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,360
[7 p.m.]

719
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,750
Nan Yan.

720
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,130
Will this formation

721
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,020
take her life?
