My wife has squandered all of our fortune.

It looks like

I've been dealing with it for a long time.

It looks like the people here

know nothing about Youquan Prison.

36
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,150
That'll get him to activate the formation in advance.

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,750
There's no need to alert him.

160
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,910
the blood of the Nightmare Fox Clan,

161
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,550
there was no way we could break free from the formation.

How about this lantern?

192
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,080
Flowers fall with love,

193
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,910
and the river flows with affection.

194
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,110
May both of you

195
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,450
be in everlasting bliss.

196
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,910
It's a pair of mandarin ducks on the lantern.

197
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,870
The lantern

198
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,790
is really beautiful.

199
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,740
Of course.

200
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,520
Any couple

201
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,370
who wishes upon this lantern

202
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,250
will definitely stay together.

203
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,530
Fine.

204
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,750
I'll decide for my wife.

205
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,920
We'll take this one.

206
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,050
Okay.

207
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,150
Hold tight.

208
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,330
This lantern is so beautiful.

209
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,280
Yan, both of you should come with us.

210
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,880
Okay.

211
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,990
♫I weave through the crowd♫

212
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,410
♫Rain passes by, leaving traces♫

213
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,580
♫How lucky I am to meet you♫

214
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,360
♫There is endless scenery to be seen♫

215
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,740
♫There are too many topics to talk about♫

216
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,310
What did you wish for?

217
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,190
♫I'll be with you until it's sunny♫

218
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,400
May all beings

219
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,950
enjoy this spectacle peacefully every year.

220
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,530
That's all?

221
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,240
Nothing else?

222
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,320
One day,

223
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,190
when the dust is settled,

224
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,210
come back to the Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea with me.

225
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,470
Sounds good.

226
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,170
But the Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea

227
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,500
is a really quite place.

228
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,080
I'm just a commoner.

229
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,390
I just want to

230
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,540
do all the mundane things with you.

231
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,450
Don't say that.

232
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,780
Just for this moment,

233
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,210
can you forget about the world

234
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,430
and just focus on us?

235
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,040
♫The sound of rain♫

236
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,810
♫I hold my breath♫

237
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,820
♫Our promise under the umbrella♫

238
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,690
What about you?

239
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,470
What did you wish for?

240
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,320
♫When I'm with you♫

241
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,960
♫It becomes clear♫

242
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,870
I wished for

243
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,400
♫I'll hold it up for you♫

244
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,070
for your wishes to come true.

245
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,290
♫Even if it rains heavily♫

246
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,270
♫The blurry world is now clear♫

247
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,650
♫I won't give up♫

♫How lucky I am to meet you♫

252
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,430
I really envy you two.

253
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,760
If only I could fall in love

254
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,550
and marry someone

255
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,030
just as good.

256
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,380
That's not easy.

257
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,550
You'll need to learn from Yan.

258
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,840
I'm afraid I won't get the chance.

259
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,520
What's wrong?

260
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,500
I've already made my wish.

261
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,870
I'll try my best to be a bride

262
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,730
and sacrifice myself to Evil Lord

263
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,550
at the ceremony tomorrow.

264
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,250
Sacrifice yourself to Evil Lord?

265
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,780
This is the Spirit-Sealing Formation

266
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,410
set by Great Path Sect.

267
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,650
Let's go.

268
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,750
What's the hurry?

269
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,720
I came well-prepared.

270
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,960
Isn't this the Drunken Qin

271
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,990
which you stole from the shop

272
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,180
before we alighted the whaleobat?

273
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,830
Well, don't say that.

274
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,610
Boss.

275
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,640
Get me the Drunken Qin.

276
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,940
This Drunken Qin

277
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,410
is our shop's treasure.

278
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,910
If you are looking to play qin as you write poems,

279
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,110
why don't you consider

280
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,750
the top-class Wuya Qin?

281
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,980
I promise it will

282
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
live up to your expecations.

283
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,980
His poems...

284
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,670
probably go better with a suona.

285
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,000
Don't you say anything.

286
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,460
Don't be a nag.

287
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,230
I want only want the Drunken Qin.

288
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,750
Besides, yours is not the legitimate item.

289
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,430
Why do you feel upset parting with it?

290
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,990
Although it's not legitimate,

291
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,870
it's still a top-notch counterfeit

292
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,440
in the cultivation realm.

293
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,440
Forget it.

294
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,040
Yu Quan told me everything.

295
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,960
You've got ten

296
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,590
of this counterfeit qin.

297
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,620
Fine.

298
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,900
I'll get it for you.

299
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,470
What other tricks

300
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,930
do you have up your sleeve?

301
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,190
Little Fox.

302
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,790
Do you see this score?

303
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,670
[Silent Night]

304
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,170
Silent Night?

305
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,120
Yes.

306
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,670
These past three years,

307
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,860
I asked around

308
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,270
and finally got something useful

309
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,470
from Yu Quan's mouth.

310
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,170
It is said that

311
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,190
the formation guard here

312
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,450
is a qin master.

313
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,230
Silent Night is his musical piece.

314
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,640
You mean

315
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,490
you want to lure him out with the sound of the qin?

316
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,099
Yes.

317
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,390
But Silent Night

318
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,869
also has some tricks to it.

319
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,890
It seems that it can only be played

320
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,240
by the real Drunken Qin.

321
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,470
But the real Drunken Qin

322
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,470
has been destroyed.

323
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,319
So,

324
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,280
I asked around some more.

325
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,770
Yu Quan told you more things?

326
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,570
That's right.

327
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,690
Yu Quan said

328
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,780
the best fake

329
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,930
is on the whaleboat.

330
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,070
That's why

331
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,200
I stole—

332
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,290
I bought it for you.

333
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,370
Big Brother,

334
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,090
you really got smarter.

335
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,800
Look.

336
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,120
You are the Mighty Dragon's brother.

337
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,360
How can I watch you

338
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,340
risk your life?

339
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,390
Right?

340
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,350
Come.

341
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,540
It's very fun

342
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,230
to meet with the qin.

343
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,580
Little Fox,

344
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,600
do you need me to burn incense and fan for you?

345
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,600
Hey.

346
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,920
Do you know how to play or not?

347
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,010
Silent Night can't be

348
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,090
learned so easily.

349
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,810
Why don't you do it?

350
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,740
Forget it.

351
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,430
I only know how to play with words.

352
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,770
I know nothing about playing music.

353
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,770
Play it yourself.

354
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,270
Wait a minute.

355
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,950
Here.

356
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,520
Take it yourself.

357
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,950
Wait a minute.

358
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,890
Okay, go ahead.

359
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,850
[Silent Night]

360
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,970
Who is messing around?

361
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,560
This is sacrilegious.

362
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,250
[Nan Yi, Young Lord of Yao Palace]

363
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,120
Silent Night.

364
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,440
These are the women

365
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,730
who married the Evil Lord over the years.

366
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,290
Is the so-called sacrifice

367
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,310
to send these girls

368
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,170
into the formation?

369
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,130
That's the Evil Lord's mansion.

370
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,720
A hundred years ago, the Evil Lord suddenly appeared

371
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,950
and countless Creeping Bloodthorns

372
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,480
extended from his mansion.

373
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,820
They almost killed the whole village.

374
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,120
Our ancestors tried all sorts of solutions.

375
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,800
In the end, they chose a bride

376
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,080
and sent her to the mansion.

377
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,530
Indeed, the Creeping Bloodthorns

378
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,060
no longer spread that year.

379
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,600
The rule of doing this

380
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,680
once per year

381
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,970
continued after that.

382
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,560
Then why do you want to be the bride?

383
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,310
Those who marry the Evil Lord

384
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,840
are given the title of Queen

385
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,440
and given a candle here.

386
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,320
Not only can they be respected by the whole village,

387
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,650
but their families are also treated well.

388
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,570
So,

389
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,920
you did this for Ba Jiao?

390
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,030
I don't want him to suffer

391
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,630
with me anymore.

392
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,020
But to get from the formation's entrance

393
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,020
to the Evil Lord's mansion, I still have to pass a test.

394
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,520
I heard the test is hard.

395
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,190
I don't know if I can do it.

396
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,990
But have you ever thought

397
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,750
that maybe there is

398
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,720
no Evil Lord at all?

399
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,280
Maybe you'll just die

400
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,760
if you go in.

401
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,870
Who cares what's inside?

402
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,280
It’s a good thing

403
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,580
to protect the entire village by myself.

404
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,370
With money and a good reputation,

405
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,470
Ba Jiao can start a family and his career.

406
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,600
He can live proudly in the village too.

407
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,640
That’s enough.

408
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,570
The celebration is about to begin.

409
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,650
I'll go take a look.

410
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,510
To put it bluntly,

411
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,310
the custom of this place

412
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,870
is human sacrifice.

413
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,030
Many girls have been killed.

414
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,560
Talks about the Evil Lord

415
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,620
are ridiculous.

416
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,760
But they strongly believe

417
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,840
in this matter.

418
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,340
If we insist on breaking into the formation tomorrow,

419
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,200
even if we can

420
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,570
deal with Huo Wuji by himself,

421
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,630
I’m afraid it’ll hard to deal with

422
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,760
the entire village.

423
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,770
We will hurt the innocent too.

424
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,090
Are you thinking...

425
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,360
I'll be

426
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,330
the Queen this year.

427
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,830
No.

428
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,480
It's dangerous if we don't know the situation.

429
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,720
Didn't you say

430
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,020
that my reputation

431
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,430
as the Bloody-handed Asura is well-known?

432
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,180
What?

433
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,810
You don't trust me now?

434
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,550
It's not that I don't trust you.

435
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,430
Is there another way

436
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,090
to see Youquan Prison faster?

437
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,160
This is the only way

438
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,070
to help you overcome the demon

439
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,010
and find who murdered Chief Meng.

440
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,310
Follow me.

441
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,940
What are you doing?

442
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,600
Since you want to be the Queen,

443
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,600
then

444
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,250
I can only be Evil Lord.

445
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,110
Chief.

446
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,390
The competition is about to begin.

447
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,440
Coming.

448
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
There's no hurry.

449
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,790
Let's talk.

450
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,680
You?

451
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,100
I have something

452
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,510
to discuss with you.

453
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,510
You two?

454
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,780
No discussion.

455
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,170
You lied to me.

456
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,630
Didn't you say you have

457
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,890
no cultivation at all?

458
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,980
I'm a little curious.

459
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,860
I want to know

460
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,680
what your Evil Lord looks like.

461
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,630
Please do me a favor

462
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,350
and allow me to participate

463
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,350
in the Queen's selection tomorrow.

464
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,430
Are you crazy?

465
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,070
My wife is so polite.

466
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,850
How dare you call her crazy?

467
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,520
You must want to die.

468
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,290
Threats are what I fear

469
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,800
the least.

470
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,990
Even killing me will do no good.

471
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,750
I won’t allow outsiders

472
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,030
to meddle in our village's affairs.

473
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,290
Still being stubborn?

474
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,890
Yes or no?

475
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,750
Absolutely not.

476
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,110
My lady,

477
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,920
attack.

478
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,990
Wait!

479
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,460
Do you have any last words?

480
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,530
If you win

481
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,860
today's competition,

482
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,480
I'll let you go. How about it?

483
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,850
Deal.

484
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,890
You're done?

485
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,470
Why is there no response?

486
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,280
This can't be it.

487
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:56,790
If the qin master knew

488
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,270
someone played his piece so badly,

489
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,870
he should jump out to hit you.

490
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,240
Who is playing the Silent Night?

491
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,100
Sir.

492
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,930
The one playing was I,

493
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,670
Yin Ya.

494
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,990
The Silent Night was composed together by Ying Zewei

495
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,170
of the Great Path.

496
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,790
It has never been disclosed.

497
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,670
Where

498
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,110
did you learn it from?

499
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,670
I got the sheet music

500
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,750
from Dragon Court Treasury.

501
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,940
And who are you?

502
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,310
I am Mu Zhanting, the Young Dragon Lord.

503
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,710
Young Dragon Lord?

504
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,700
I was an old friend of Dragon Lord.

505
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,440
A century has passed.

506
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,630
I didn't know he's started a family.

507
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,630
This is a forbidden place of the cultivation realm.

508
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,180
What brings you two juniors

509
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,530
here?

510
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,830
I want to open the formation

511
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,830
to save my clan.

512
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,430
Ridiculous!

513
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,550
The Spirit-Sealing Formation has sealed the many spirits

514
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,930
for 100 years.

515
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,340
It's impossible

516
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,710
to open it.

517
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,870
The hundred years are up.

518
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,310
The spirits are still being tormented inside

519
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,390
the Spirit-Sealing Formation

520
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,510
You broke the contract first

521
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,360
and you didn't give us an explanation.

522
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,010
I want to save my clansmen.

523
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,870
What's wrong with that?

524
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,580
I'm just guarding the formation.

525
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,060
As for the matter of the spirits,

526
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,910
the Great Path is in charge.

527
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,550
Please leave.

528
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,400
I'll pretend you never came.

529
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,030
If you insist on stopping me,

530
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,960
I will risk my life to fight you.

531
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,960
Let's show him what we've got!

532
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,570
The silver mermaid pearl?

533
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,760
Why is this pearl

534
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,060
with you?

535
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,920
Yan.

536
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,320
Huixiang.

537
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,550
Are you here for the game too?

538
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,110
Yes.

539
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,820
How do we play this game?

540
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,040
See that

541
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,400
flower ball over there?

542
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,790
When the drumming starts,

543
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,310
the ball will be passed around.

544
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,350
Once the drumming stops,

545
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,880
whoever has the flower ball is out of the game.

546
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,730
That's it?

547
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,630
The last one standing

548
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,870
without the flower ball

549
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,200
will be the winner.

550
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,890
Okay. Let’s go have a look.

551
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,640
Chief.

552
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,910
Keep your promise.

553
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,600
You should let me join the selection tomorrow.

554
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:14,780
What?

555
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,050
You want to join the selection too?

556
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,950
Trust us.

557
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,860
You...

558
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,020
Are so despicable.

559
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,910
Don't be a sore loser.

560
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,610
[Jiao Niang]

561
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,750
After I return to the Yao Palace

562
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,950
and report our matter

563
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,280
to my mother and sister,

564
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,840
I will marry you.

565
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,170
What does marry mean?

566
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,690
It means we will

567
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,390
sleep together when we're alive

568
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,590
and be buried together when we're dead.

569
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,680
Will it be like now

570
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,430
till the day we die?

571
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,880
Okay.

572
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,580
I'll wait for you.

573
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,610
By the way,

574
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,580
I heard spirits have been spotted in the vicinity lately.

575
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,530
You're a mortal.

576
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,750
You have no cultivation.

577
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,070
While I'm away,

578
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,920
you must be wary of danger.

579
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,890
Don't worry.

580
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,470
But do you know that

581
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,870
without the silver mermaid pearl

582
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,440
concealing my aura,

583
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,480
I'm also the danger you speak of?

584
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,090
Is this pearl really his?

585
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,530
The silver mermaid pearl suddenly recognizes its owner

586
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,989
and he acted so anxiously.

587
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,290
If it weren't for

588
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,630
the appearance of the mermaid's divine energy

589
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,630
stopping him just now,

590
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,040
we would have been dead.

591
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,540
The silver mermaid pearl

592
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,150
was really given to you

593
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,590
by a lady surnamed Nan?

594
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,480
Absolutely.

595
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,870
I swear on my dad's life.

596
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,000
This pearl is my sister

597
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,130
Nan Yan's heirloom.

598
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,550
Her uncle left it to her mother

599
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,150
and her mother left it to her.

600
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,880
What's her mother's name?

601
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
I don't know.

602
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,880
Chief Nan Fang of Yao Palace,

603
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,590
Nan Rao.

604
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,100
It's her, then.

605
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,980
My sister.

606
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,480
Are you

607
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,970
Chief Nan Fang's brother,

608
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,920
Nan Yi?

609
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,230
Oh my!

610
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,550
Uncle!

611
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,790
Uncle.

612
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,710
What do you mean?

613
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,240
Uncle, you are...

614
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:12,830
I...

615
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,840
Who is your uncle?

616
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,570
Don't talk nonsense.

617
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,130
Uncle.

618
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,650
Fine.

619
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:20,750
You...

620
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,200
Listen to me.

621
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,930
Uncle,

622
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,820
you don't know.

623
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,850
Actually, Little Fox, Nan Yan, and I

624
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,840
have already bowed to heaven and earth.

625
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,660
We're just sworn siblings, don't talk like we're married.

626
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,860
Whose side are you on?

627
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,070
Don't sworn siblings have to

628
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,900
bow to heaven and earth too?

629
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,880
No.

630
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,350
It's not important.

631
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,010
Anyway,

632
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,430
we were like a family

633
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,780
back in the Lunar Sect.

634
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,560
We even went to Filth Valley together.

635
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,710
We lived and died together.

636
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,470
Our relationship,

637
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,200
oh man,

638
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,870
is closer than a real family!

639
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,720
No wonder she gave you

640
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,210
the silver mermaid pearl.

641
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,510
She acted so freely.

642
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,250
It's very like her mother.

643
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,030
Uncle,

644
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,200
since we are family,

645
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,610
please help us

646
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,410
and let us in.

647
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,460
Uncle.

648
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,510
Great Path's people

649
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,580
are on their way.

650
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,000
If we miss this opportunity,

651
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,970
we don't know

652
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,550
how much longer the fox clan will be locked inside.

653
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,600
As I said,

654
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,390
the Premier has his own reason

655
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,710
to strengthen the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

656
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,950
If the spirits return to the world,

657
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,950
it'll inevitably cause more trouble.

658
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,470
Great Path must uphold the greater good.

659
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,160
If your innocent family and loved ones

660
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,900
were subjected to slaughter

661
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,630
by the righteous groups

662
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,540
purely because they are spirits,

663
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,270
sir,

664
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,700
what would you do?

665
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,680
What did you say?

666
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,400
Don't upset him.

667
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,440
Now that I know

668
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,590
your name,

669
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,080
I understand

670
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,370
why you were exiled here

671
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,500
for a hundred years.

672
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,180
Sir,

673
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,720
you were once the son of the Red Emperor,

674
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,320
Young Lord of the Yao Palace.

675
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,620
But for a mere mermaid,

676
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,930
you committed the Linglong Capital massacre.

677
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:01,650
Shut up!

678
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,850
What do you think?

679
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,850
Do I look the part?

680
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,980
The Evil Lord's bride

681
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,960
is indeed the most beautiful.

682
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,710
Sit.

683
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,360
No one would expect that

684
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,450
the bride is wearing

685
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,860
the real Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

686
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,810
Why are you doing this?

687
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,740
What's in it for you to be the Queen?

688
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,110
Huixiang,

689
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,710
if I persuade you

690
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,400
to give up on this selection,

691
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,900
will you listen to me?

692
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,890
You helped me a lot.

693
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,890
But I will never

694
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,690
give up on this matter.

695
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,670
Ba Jiao's future life

696
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,510
depends on me.

697
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,720
In that case,

698
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,740
no matter what happens today,

699
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,380
I will protect you.

700
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,980
We'll depend on our own skills.

701
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,580
I may not lose to you.

702
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,210
Sister Nan Yan,

703
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,600
you look like a fairy

704
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,140
in this outfit.

705
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,020
You look prettier than my sister.

706
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,880
This brat.

707
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,480
He's sweeter than me.

708
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,140
Ba Jiao, come here.

709
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,010
Why do these two foreigners

710
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,010
insist on joining

711
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,710
our ritual?

712
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,320
They're even a couple.

713
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,470
And now he's giving his wife to the Evil Lord just like that.

714
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,670
What kind of man is he?

715
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,310
My lady.

716
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,060
I'm starting to regret it.

717
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,830
Don't worry.

718
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,760
Everyone is here.

719
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,670
The ritual begins.

720
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,190
As usual,

721
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,880
each of you

722
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,880
will take a red candle

723
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,110
and enter the Luanfeng Cave.

724
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,400
Whoever comes out of the cave

725
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,830
with her candle still lit

726
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,120
will be the Queen of this year.

727
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,200
Luanfeng Cave

728
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,090
is no more than a hundred feet in and out.

729
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,930
But there is wind everywhere in the cave.

730
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,320
It's not that easy

731
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,480
to protect the candle's flame.

732
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,210
Don't worry.

733
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,710
It's easy.

734
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,110
Since you're willing to be the scapegoat,

735
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,180
I'll send you off.
