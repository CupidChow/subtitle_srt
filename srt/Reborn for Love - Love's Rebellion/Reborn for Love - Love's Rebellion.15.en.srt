[Episode 15]

4
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,000
You ran so fast.

5
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,160
Your cultivation is at least Core Formation Realm.

6
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,850
You must be tired.

7
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,110
I

8
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,509
prepared some

9
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,950
vegetable buns.

10
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,229
Wait.

11
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,390
Why are you

12
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,680
chasing us for?

13
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,910
I'm here to fetch that young lady

14
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,570
to cultivate in the mountain.

15
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,380
Originally,

16
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,330
I could've just taken her away.

17
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,950
But I thought you came from an extraordinary background,

18
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,790
so I wanted to help you.

19
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,520
Are you from the Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea?

20
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,560
Yes.

21
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,400
I can

22
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,870
ferry all living beings.

23
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm not interested.

24
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,329
She's not interested either.

25
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,090
Please let us go.

26
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,630
If I'm not mistaken,

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,280
you are a descendant

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,430
of the Nightmare Fox, right?

29
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,620
Are you going to

30
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,910
capture me and bring me back to receive the reward?

31
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,680
In the battle between humans and spirits,

32
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,740
everyone's having a difficult time.

33
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,230
I think

34
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,500
if the two clans can live peacefully,

35
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,470
we can reduce

36
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,970
unnecessary sacrifices.

37
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,780
Since you don't want to catch spirits,

38
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,400
then cut the crap.

39
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,910
I know what you want.

40
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,150
But it's not the right time yet.

41
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,760
The Seven Sins Manual can't help you either.

42
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,160
Focus on your cultivation.

43
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,270
When you are enlightened,

44
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,630
you can try again.

45
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,329
Fine.

46
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,320
I'll tell you

47
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,870
when I'm enlightened.

48
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,579
Young friend, you made a mistake.

49
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,700
I'm not at Core Formation

50
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,500
but at Demigod.

51
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,930

52
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,700
Forget me.

53
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,950
No!

54
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,970
No.

55
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,899

Nan Yan!

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,390
Young friend, wait up.

62
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,530
You want to go to the Filth Valley?

63
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,590
I have a way.

64
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,390
Old man,

65
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,850
where did you send Nan Yan?

66
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,930
Wherever her love comes,

67
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,790
she shall be executed.

68
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,630
When she comes around,

69
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,490
Light Sect will send her back

70
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,280
to Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea.

71
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,090
No one can be kept alive in the Netherworld Prison.

72
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,290
Yet you're still alive?

73
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,930
You have Yin Zhu as your soul,

74
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,780
a human face, and a ghost look.

75
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,130
You are the demon, Sen Luo?

76
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,770
How dare you.

77
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,730
How dare you call me by my name?

78
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,670
Why not?

79
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,580
You caused chaos in the five states

80
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,320
and brought misery to the world.

81
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,150
Anyone has the right to execute you.

82
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,930
If Holy Master hadn't sacrificed himself to rid of the demon

83
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,070
and put you into the valley,

84
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,630
you would have–

85
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,390
Shut up!

86
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,650
He is my defeated opponent.

87
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,220
That old man's soul was scattered,

88
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,730
yet he can only seal my body,

89
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,290
but not my soul.

90
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,230
But you,

91
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,380
after escaping Yin Zhu,

92
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,540
can still survive.

93
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,780
Let's see

94
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,800
how good you are.

95
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,430
You've cultivated the Heart of the Six Realms?

96
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,340
So what?

97
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,490
You

98
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,450
are a rare talent.

99
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,240
What do you mean?

100
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,220
You are a body that breaks illusions during the Yin hours,

101
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,080
by swallowing the moon and consuming the ethereal.

102
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,550
By nature, you are immune to the erosion of Yin Zhu.

103
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,190
Since God

104
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,600
brought you here,

105
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,020
I shall

106
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,560
take on your body!

107
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,680
Come on.

108
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,030
Still fighting on the brink of your death...

109
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,590
Do you know that this Netherworld Prison

110
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,190
has the power to turning the world upside down?

111
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,710
You'd be lucky

112
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,570
to have only your body taken over.

113
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,660
You don't know what's good for you!

114
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,740
In a place where evils are kept,

115
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,410
and with the power of evil,

116
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,370
you still think you're right?

117
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,080
How shameless!

118
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,750
You!

119
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,200
I can finally see the sun again.

120
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,910
From now on,

121
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,150
everything in the world

122
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,670
are all in my hands!

123
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,450
What's going on?

124
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,200
Primordial Annihilation...

125
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,740
This is a forbidden spell.

126
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
You want mutual destruction?

127
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,330
I lured you into my body

128
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,310
to make you completely disappear

129
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,680
with my body as the weapon

130
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,830
and put an end to it.

131
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,520
How could this happen?

132
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,380
Why did this happen?

133
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,670
Shao Cang used

134
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,030
the forbidden skill of Primordial Annihilation,

135
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,920
invoking the pressure of the resonance between heaven and earth,

136
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,430
which remains enduring and undiminished.

137
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,690
This place has become a forbidden place.

138
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,970
No one can enter it.

139
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,960
In that case, Nan Yan...

140
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,820
There are different paths for life and death.

141
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,530
It will be up to her.

145
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,920

♫Transforming into a butterfly♫

195
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,030
Ji Yang is dead.

♫Landing at your fingertips♫

197

Ji Yang is not dead...

What's going on?

216
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,640
Dragon Lord.

217
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,700
King Dan said

218
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,570
Young Lord has a serious cold.

219
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,590
Normal medicine can't penetrate his bone.

220
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,870
Even the Immortal True Elixir

221
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,190
created by the Nine Heavenly Thunder

222
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,200
doesn't seem to

223
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,470
work.

224
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,920
Young Lord's

225
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,660
organs have all been damaged.

226
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,540
If we don't find another way,

227
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,630
I'm afraid...

228
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,470
This unfilial son...

229
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,950
He wants to die

230
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,430
before I punish him?

231
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
I'll go find another famous doctor.

232
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,780
No need!

233
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,850
Let me do it.

234
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,210
You unfilial son.

235
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,710
In the battle in the Filth Valley,

236
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,510
you didn't embarrass me.

237
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,250
Young Lord is fine now.

238
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,210
Dragon Lord,

239
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,590
you've transferred so much spiritual power

240
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,440
to Young Lord,

241
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,770
can you handle it?

242
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,110
It's fine.

243
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,590
Even if I do this for another three days and three nights,

244
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,790
I can still tie this unfilial son

245
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,920
onto a beam

246
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,040
and beat him up for three years.

247
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,450
If Young Lord finds out,

248
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,619
you sacrificed half of your life

249
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,250
for him,

250
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,270
he will be grateful for his father's love

251
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,200
and never run away from home again.

252
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,890
I hope so.

253
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,839
When he wakes up,

254
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,160
no one

255
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,550
should tell him

256
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,829
about what happened today.

257
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,349
Yes.

258
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,940
♫When you appeared behind me♫

259
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,490
♫The stars in the sky stopped twinkling too♫

260
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,280
♫The universe has fallen♫

261
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,490
♫When I stand by your side♫

262
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,230
♫Everything in the world turns into nothing♫

263
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,500
♫Only your eyes remain♫

264
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:33,000
♫Every minute and second that I'm with you is engraved in my mind♫

265
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:40,560
♫Our story falls into your eyes like smoke and willows♫

266
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,080
You even like duck blood now?

267
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Is there anything

268
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,370
I don't eat here?

269
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,790
I announce

270
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,900
from now on,

271
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,110
we are tied in

272
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,080
a blood oath.

273
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,950
Eat!

274
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,270
♫When I stand by your side♫

275
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Keep practicing.

276
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,180
♫Everything in the world turns into nothing♫

277
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,460

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,450
♫Our story falls into your eyes like smoke and willows♫

280
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,680
♫Can you hold my hands tightly?♫

281
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,760
♫No matter if it's a fair or gloomy day♫

282
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,700
♫From the beginning♫

283
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,690
♫Till the end, oh♫

284
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:08,760
Remember,

285
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,990
♫Let me keep going forward with you♫

286
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,650
I saved your life.

287
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:19,890
♫Let all the bright fireworks stop for you, oh♫

288
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,780
You?

289
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,290
Saved my life?

290
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,390
That's right.

291
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,720
♫When the wind blows♫

292
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,120
♫When the wind blows♫

♫To my heart♫

295
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,000
♫It seems calm but it's actually turbulent♫

296
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,300
Thank you.

297
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,740
Although it's ugly,

298
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,010
♫I was once ignorant♫

299
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,900
I

300
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,080
♫But am now deeply in love♫

301
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,070
like it a lot.

302
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:48,070
♫All I can say is that I will never leave you♫

303
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,240
♫Let me keep going forward with you♫

304
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,440
♫Let all the bright fireworks stop for you♫

♫When the wind blows♫

306
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,180
Forever in Chang'an,

307
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,120
♫When the wind blows♫

308
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,910

♫When the wind blows♫

310
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,310
So,

311
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,430
when you left

312
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,590
Lunar Sect,

313
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,450
you knew

314
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,310
you'd most likely die

315
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,380
in Filth Valley.

316
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,220
Don't worry.

317
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,670
I will keep the promise

318
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,150
of staying safe.

319
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,780
You've let it go?

320
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,630
Cultivation is about your heart, not your mind.

321
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,840
Only when you let it go,

322
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,280
can you have a clear mind

323
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,710
and no inner evils.

324
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,690
I am willing

325
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,100
to join your sect.

326
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,030
You have to think carefully.

327
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,130
I've made up my mind.

328
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,400
Okay.

329
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,200
Everything in life

330
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,740
is within the world.

331
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,360
I shall call you Zhen Yuan.

332
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,630
Follow me to the back mountain tomorrow

333
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,280
and cultivate in the pagoda.

334
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,030
Thank you, Master.

335
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,770
Are you sure you've made up your mind?

336
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,610
Yes.

337
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,940
If I continue to indulge in pain,

338
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,740
I'll just let Ji Yang's sacrifice be in vain.

339
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,890
And why are those demons

340
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,510
still alive?

341
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,270
Why am I the only one

342
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,710
suffering in this world?

343
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,430
So...

344
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,020
So, Ji Yang can't die in vain.

345
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,120
Every one in Evil Path Sect

346
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,760
and all the demons in the world,

347
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,770
I'll kill them all

348
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,000
to revenge Ji Yang.

349
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,620
You used to practise medicine to save people.

350
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,710
In the future, you will eliminate demons.

351
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,730
That's my sister.

352
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,360
I'm going to be in seclusion tomorrow.

353
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,430
What's your plan?

354
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,230
If you don't leave,

355
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,490
I won't leave too then.

356
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,830
But I can't get used

357
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,200
to this shabby place.

358
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,270
Fortunately, there's a cottage at the middle of the mountain.

359
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,930
I will make do with that place.

360
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,990
Maybe I can go down the mountain from time to time

361
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,450
and catch a chicken to eat.

362
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,660
While

363
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,290
I wait for you to come back.

364
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,390
Okay.

365
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,700
Here.

366
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,170
[Nine Calamities Pagoda]

367
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,710
This is the Nine Calamities Pagoda.

368
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,750
Master.

369
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,750
What's in the pagoda?

370
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,330
The Nine Calamities Sea

371
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,490
and the Ten Percepts Mountain.

372
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,490
Only the people in the pagoda know the suffering.

373
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,740
As the saying goes,

374
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,510
"On the Mount of Sorrow, the divine beings pity all ages;

375
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,010
in the Brahman Sea, the Asuras glare in anger to dispel the Sea of Suffering."

376
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,660
Grandmaster Ji Ming

377
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,310
learned this meaning

378
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,410
in the Nine Calamities Pagoda,

379
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,350
thus he named our sect

380
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,390
Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea.

381
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,710
I'm willing to serve this sect's ideology.

382
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,380
But remember,

383
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,230
other disciples

384
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,340
cultivate their mind to help the people.

385
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,450
We must not kill

386
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,570
nor break the rules.

387
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,020
But Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea

388
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,290
believes that

389
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,830
only by eliminating all evil

390
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,520
can the mortal world can be pure.

391
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,160
After experiencing nine calamities in the pagoda,

392
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,310
you will understand this.

393
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,820
Form a Nine-petal Golden Lotus

394
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,310
and inherit the title of our founder.

395
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,410
Go ahead.

396
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,390
May your entry to the pagoda

397
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,850
bring you enlightenment.

398
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,340
If the fire doesn't extinguish,

399
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,760
Zhen Yuan is fine.

400
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,550
Sister, I'll wait for you!

401
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,790
The parting of life and death

402
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,650
is painful.

403
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,390
It's a demon in your heart.

404
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,950
With subduing Seven Sins Manual,

405
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,940
it's an abyss.

406
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,890
To have a bright future,

407
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,180
you must eradicate these thoughts with real fire.

408
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,480
Heavenly lightning extinguishes anger,

409
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,550
and the cold ice freezes the sorrow.

410
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,810
Only then can you

411
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,600
get to the top.

412
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,400
Yin Ya,

413
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,330
where are you going?

414
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,110
Yan entered the pagoda for Ji Yang.

415
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,630
I won't be fooled.

416
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,990
Apart from being vegetarian,

417
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,750
there's nothing to do on this mountain.

418
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,720
I don't want to stay here.

419
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,340
I'm going to wait for her at the foot of the mountain.

420
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,370
You can't leave.

421
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,390
I didn't join Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea.

422
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,710
Why can't I leave?

423
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,190
Don't you think you haven't

424
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,730
moved up in your cultivation for a while now?

425
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,730
How do you know?

426
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,810
Nightmare Foxes

427
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,700
are violent and greedy.

428
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,190
You've been living in the mortal world since you were little.

429
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,590
You have wild desires.

430
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,200
You don't train properly

431
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,100
and also absorb

432
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,090
human's moon Yin energy,

433
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,590
thus your blood is murky.

434
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,470
It's as if you're under a restriction.

435
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,610
What do you think I should do then?

436
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,870
Easy.

437
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,670
You just need to slowly release your blood.

438
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,230
What do you want?

439
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,690
Quit drinking and sexual activities or go join to cultivate in peace.

440
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,400
Choose one.

441
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,350
Let me die.

442
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,270
Young foxes are all like this.

443
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,220
So straightforward.

444
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,910
I have hands and legs.

445
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,590
What I do

446
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,470
and where I go

447
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,890
is none of your business.

448
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,760
Stop right there.

449
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,920
Old man!

450
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,590
Old man, what do you want?

451
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,350
The only way now is to

452
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,950
suppress you in an alms bowl

453
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,470
and help you cultivate in peace,

454
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,630
purifying your blood.

455
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,300
Go forth!

456
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,520
Old man!

457
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,070
You're so sly!

458
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,580
My friend,

459
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,150
Filth Valley will open up soon.

460
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,210
Pick some suitable magical weapons.

461
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,730
Sir, you're a gentleman.

462
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,150
You match this Mechanical Butterfly.

463
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,750
This is indeed great.

464
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,840
How much is this?

465
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,910
100 spirit stones.

466
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,310
You really love your wife.

467
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,460
You're shopping with your wife again?

468
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,440
We have new magical weapons.

469
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,570
Bring your wife over and have a look.

470
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,580
My wife told me

471
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,630
your shop sells things at exorbitant prices.

472
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,690
She told me to check out other places.

473
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,040
Let's go,

474
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,990
my wife.

475
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,390
Hello.

476
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,790
Where did the

477
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,650
old man that used to set up a stall here

478
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,810
go?

479
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,150
His family

480
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,730
took him back to the countryside for the winter.

481
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,060
He has too many dolls. He couldn't take all of them with him.

482
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,080
So he left a pair.

483
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,900
A pair?

484
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,440
But...

485
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,150
there's only one left.

486
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,300
I think some child

487
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,710
took it.

488
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,060
Why did this child

489
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,450
not take a pair

490
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,920
but he leave one behind.

491
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,830
After saying that,

492
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,140
the hero turned to leave.

493
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,230
When can I

494
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,830
see Mighty Dragon again?

495
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,580
Why was I

496
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,150
the one left behind...

497
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,490
To be able to endure

498
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,300
the suffering from three calamities: happiness, anger, and sadness,

499
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,680
it's not too bad.

500
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,300
But next,

501
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,720
to rid of your emotions

502
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,990
is your real test.

503
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,830
Where is this?

504
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,710
Your Yu Mansion.

505
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,550
This is also the place

506
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,750
the Talisman Genie is kept in your body.

507
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,260
They cultivated in here

508
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,340
for 49 days.

509
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,820
These closed doors and windows

510
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,450
stopped them from escaping from your mansion.

511
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,370
After three calamities,

512
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,130
your Yu Mansion protected you.

513
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,040
It was you

514
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,250
who made this place into

515
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,530
what you like.

516
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,989
If you have deep feelings,

517
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,350
you can't control

518
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,389
the power of the Seven Sins Manual.

519
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,389
There are four more calamities

520
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,320
waiting for you.

521
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,030
If you regret it,

522
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,199
it's still not too late.

523
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,530
You don't give up

524
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,500
but won't let go of your feelings.

525
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,600
He traded his life for your life.

526
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,170
Yet he became your inner demon.

527
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,409
Though you're alive, it's as if you're dead.

528
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,580
Since you have no wish to save the world,

529
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,380
nor a decisive decision to kill,

530
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,909
how can you overcome the nine calamities?

531
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,040
How can I forget?

532
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,640
Being trapped by love,

533
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,450
you can't stand a single blow.

534
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,590
How can I not be trapped by love?

535
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,810
In that case,

536
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,640
you can see him

537
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,130
if you exit from here

538
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,430
and fall into the abyss with him.

539
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,270
Isn't this what

540
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,570
you've always wanted?

541
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,780
Open the door,

542
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,060
leave this place,

543
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,440
and be with him.

544
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,190
This will fulfill your wish.

545
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,960
Ji Yang.

546
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,900
Ji Yang...
