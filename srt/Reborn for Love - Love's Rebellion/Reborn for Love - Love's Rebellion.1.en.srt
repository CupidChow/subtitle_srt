196
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,200
I didn't do this.

197

Who else

202
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,010
could it be?

203
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,000
Someone must be behind this.

204
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,970
Since Master's sure I did it,

205
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,300
there's no point in talking.

206
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,920
I need to find another way.

207

the truth will be unveiled.

At midnight tonight,

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,520
I can gather Vermilion herbs.

His heart rate's unstable.

305
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,530
Why are his symptoms

306
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,630
exactly like

This sick boy

310
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,030
is quite pretty.

311
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,430
You...

312
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,980
saved my life?

313
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,980
That's right.

314
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,520
I think you

315
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,230
seem educated.

316
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,580
I don't need you...

317
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,510
I've disturbed you for a long time.

318
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,960
I'll get going.

319
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,580
Aren't your limbs weak

320
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,070
and you can't move?

321
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,870
Of course.

322
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,310
Isn't it obvious?

323
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,090
This is for your own good.

324
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,680
I'm not being ungrateful,

325
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,340
but this behavior's

326
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,560
known as kidnapping.

327
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,150
Kidnapping?

328
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,520
That's an overstatement.

329
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,700
The Golden Crow herbs I just gathered

330
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,120
have the poison

331
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,230
that gets rid of your disease.

332
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,360
But since

333
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,540
it was an emergency,

334
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,350
the ratio

335
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,000
of herbs weren't precise.

336
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,560
So...

337
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,700
There are some side effects.

338
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,820
I didn't want you to run away rashly.

339
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,930
That's why I

340
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,880
tied you up.

341
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,180
I'll untie you now.

342
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,070
Righteous sects

343
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,550
have always been strict.

344
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,890
It's improper

345
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,130
for me to stay here.

346
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,550
It's fine.

347
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,710
I secretly brought you back

348
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,670
through the alley.

349
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,580
No one saw it.

350
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:16,950
Just lie down.

351
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,840
Forget it.

352
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,830
At first, it was just solar plexus pain.

353
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,940
Gradually, it got worse

354
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,370
and more frequent.

355
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,380
You even become short of breath

356
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,660
and fall unconscious.

357
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,490
Then your breathing

358
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,110
stops

359
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,680
and your heart rate drops.

360
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,270
It's akin to death.

361
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,800
What a coincidence.

362
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,670
Mortal medicine

363
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,940
and ordinary elixirs

364
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,300
can't save you.

365
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,830
Only my

366
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,510
treatment with poisons

367
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,120
is effective.

368
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,600
Why don't you stay here

369
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,650
and be my

370
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,740
medicine tester?

371
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,990
Free food, accommodation,

372
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,910
and guaranteed recovery.

373
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,420
Yeah?

374
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,470
No thanks.

375
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,470
Three.

376
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,900
Two.

377
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,660
One.

378
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,070
With your condition,

379
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,270
your power will only

380
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,800
backfire on you.

381
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,320
You can't go out

382
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,170
even if you want to.

383
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,870
Why don't you let me go first?

384
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,130
Well,

385
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,100
if you leave here now,

386
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,230
you'll be dead

387
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,690
within three days.

388
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,150
Just stay here.

389
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,460
You're sick

390
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,470
and I have poisons.

391
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,190
Let's get what we each need.

392
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,200
Isn't a win-win situation

393
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,840
good?

394
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,780
What's good?

395
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,350
I want to be on my own.

396
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,610
I don't want a partner.

397
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,680
How much did your herbs cost?

398
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,810
I'll pay you double.

399
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,180
It's a doctor's duty to help out the needy.

400
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,310
Do you think

401
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,530
I saved you for money?

402
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,000
What do you want then?

403
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:35,980
Your body.

404
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,380
You can only

405
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,910
blame yourself

406
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,100
for having the same heart disease

407
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,410
as my mom.

408

Have a good sleep.

413
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,130
When I've made the new medicine,

414
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,990
I promise you'll feel relieved

415
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,390
after you take it.

416
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,970

419
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,540
Senior wouldn't kill anyone.

420
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,270
It must be a misunderstanding!

422
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,420
Anything to say?

423
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,360
I've been cultivating for years.

424

I've let you down.

425

I...

426
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,220
have nothing to say.

429
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,510
who's gone astray

430

and killed fellow disciples

At this point,

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,260
my priority

435
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,030
is to find the Seven Sins Manual

436
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,450
and the person plotting against me.

437
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,710
Don't kill it.

438
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,580
This snake

439
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,820
is still useful to me.

440
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,230
It has demonic aura.

441
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,160
It can't be kept.

442
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,180
After I extract its poisonous fangs

443
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,140
and gallbladder,

444
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,250
you can kill it.

445

447

What did you say?

448
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,930
How dare you

449
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,800
be so rash in front of me?

450
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,300

454
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,660
and kill all demons who come my way.

455
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,330

00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,060
It is said that

459
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,260
Seven Sins Manual is within Filth Valley.

460
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,510
Why are you here?

461
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,540
That's

462
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,170
just hearsay.

463
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,970

465
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,450
but was absorbed by this poisoner.

466
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,690
If you can take me out of here,

467
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,910
I might

468
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,380
consider acknowledging you as my master.

469
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,860
How can you switch masters?

470
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,620
Tomorrow night at 8 p.m.,

471
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,220
after sunset,

472
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,320
enact the Soul-Seizing formation

473
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,140
and it'll be done.

474
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,350
Soul-Seizing formation?

475
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,480
Although her spiritual power is weak,

476
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,320
she's still ambitious.

477
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,170
Without the formation,

478
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,370
I doubt I can escape.

479
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,650
This is the formation's formula.
