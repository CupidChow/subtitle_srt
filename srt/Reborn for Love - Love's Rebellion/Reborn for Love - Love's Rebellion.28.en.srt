[Episode 28]

4
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,800
The soul of Sen Luo has disappeared.

5
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,740
You and Yin Ya...

6
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,420
You did it.

7
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,480
Master,

8
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,060
what Sen Luo said...

9
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,430
It's true.

10
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,320
No need for that.

11
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,509
I just hope you can treat my brother well in the future.

12
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,320
Even if you kill me,

13
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,870
your Yan

14
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,060
will die.

15
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,270
Listen,

16
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,640
your Yan is going to die.

17
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,430
What do you mean?

18
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,430
They only know

19
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,990
Seven Sins is demon subduing magic.

20
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,250
What they don't know is it's also a kind of backfire poison.

21
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,150
In Youquan Prison,

22
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,070
I activated the evil power of Seven Sins

23
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,670
in Nan Yan's body.

24
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,290
In 81 days,

25
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,270
Nan Yan will definitely die.

26
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,540
If you want to save her,

27
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,670
the only way is

28
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,790
to gather the five prisons

29
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,390
and let Nan Yan kill you

30
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,110
to combine all of Yin Zhu's power

31
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,640
to eliminate Seven Sins.

32
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,100
That's how you can save her.

33
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,370
Who are you?

34
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,120
You are the Young Dragon Lord?

35
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,910
Of course.

36
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,750
Well,

37
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,480
don't I look like the Young Dragon Lord?

38
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,660
Everyone knows

39
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,530
Dragon Capital's skills are impressive

40
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,190
and are among the best in the cultivation realm.

41
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,630
Look at you.

42
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,810
I guess you've only learned 10% at most.

43
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,110
Who are you?

44
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,750
Why are you

45
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,680
judging me here?

46
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,150
You look young.

47
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,710
You're in the Core Formation Realm at most.

48
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,670
Why are you laughing?

49
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,660
Let's fight if you dare.

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,530
Don't worry.

51
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,530
This is my territory.

52
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,650
Even if you hurt me,

53
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,840
no one will ask you to take responsibility.

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,020
I happen to be boring

55
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,420
at home these days.

56
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,630
Come on.

57
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,110
So it's the Cold Swordsmanship of the Yao Palace.

58
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,870
I thought

59
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,430
it was something more powerful.

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,590
I'm sure you've only learned 10%.

61
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,960
I have a sharp eye for people.

62
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,770
I haven't even made a move. Why are you so sure?

63
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,909
Even if I've only learned 10%,

64
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,510
it's enough to deal with you.

65
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,680
Young Lord.

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,350
Why are you still here?

The guest has been waiting for you.

68
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,990
I was just about to...

69
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,190
Fine.

70
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,380
Wait for me here.

71
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,110
I'll be back soon.

72
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,770
Don't move.

73
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,110
Let's continue to fight after I'm back.

74
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,920
Don't run away.

75
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,470

76

Who is he?

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,210
I can't believe him.

78
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,970
Don't move!

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,950
Ying Zewei,

80
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,180
show yourself.

81
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,890
On the matter concerning the fox clan,

82
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,510
Premier already let you go.

83
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,340
But now you're bold enough

84
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,170
to leave the Spirit-Sealing Formation without permission

85
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,760
and come to Great Path.

86
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,710
Nan Yi,

87
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,630
are you crazy?

88
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,280
I just want to ask Ying Zewei

89
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,080
one question.

90
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,530
Ask him out.

91
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,520
Since you want to die,

92
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,550
I'll grant your wish.

93
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,980
Step aside.

94
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,820
Why are you doing this?

95
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,210
Since it's here,

96
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,760
it's easy.

97
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,790
Miss, I hope you can keep your promise.

98
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,600
Please.

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,909
Why did you lie to me?

101
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,290
You know

102
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,780
what happened to Rao?

103
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,140
Do you know

104
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,390
the person I trusted the most in this world

105
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,450
is you?

106
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,950
But you lied to me.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,090
You didn't even tell me

108
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,510
about her death.

109
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,770
Today,

110
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,030
you must give me an explanation.

111
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,440
I didn't want to tell you the truth

112
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,670
because I was worried

113
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,200
you would become like this.

114
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,050
You sacrificed your lifespan

115
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,310
and left the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

116
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,420
If Rao knows,

117
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,910
she definitely would blame me.

118
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,840
She's my sister.

119
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,860
She was my only family in this world.

120
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,420
For her,

121
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,350
so what if I only have ten days left to live?

122
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,000
As long as I can bring her back to life,

123
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,590
it'll be worth it even if I have to reduce to ashes.

124
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,860
Nan Yi,

125
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,120
she was also

126
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,230
my beloved one.

127
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,550
What?

128
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,150
Beloved one?

129
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,450
Your beloved one died wrongly.

130
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,600
But you've stayed in Great Path peacefully.

131
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,020
Premier,

132
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,510
stop joking.

133
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,150
I only have one question for you.

134
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,680
Did you kill my sister?

135
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,580
Don't think I dare not kill you.

136
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,280
In this world,

137
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,590
only you and I know

138
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,850
she had the Nirvana spirit heart.

139
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,820
You suspect me?

140
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,150
Back then, my sister accepted

141
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,990
the punishment of lightning for me.

142
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,190
You accompanied her.

143
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,830
After that,

144
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,190
what happened?

145
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,170
She went to Filth Valley.

146
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,590
Filth Valley?

147
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,400
At that time,

148
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,750
Yin Zhu under Filth Valley suddenly became restless.

149
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,580
After accepting the punishment of lightning,

150
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,350
Rao was ordered to go to Filth Valley

151
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,550
to reinforce the seal

152
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,870
in exchange for your safety.

153
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,000
Before she left, she told me

154
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,480
not to tell you about this.

155
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,150
She was worried you'd be unwilling to accept the punishment.

156
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,960
I pled for you

157
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,160
and your sister,

158
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,550
but I was punished by Master.

159
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,470
I was held in confinement to reflect on myself.

160
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,100
When I was released,

161
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,780
Rao was nowhere to find.

162
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,450
Could it be something happened to her

163
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,270
when she was reinforcing the seal?

164
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,750
I went deep into

165
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,810
Yin Zhu's stronghold to look for her,

166
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,470
but I was no match for the soul of Sen Luo.

167
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,480
I returned without finding her.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,940
People respect me as their master.

169
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,200
But I couldn't even

170
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,560
protect my beloved one.

171
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,100
If you blame me,

172
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,210
I have nothing to say.

173
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,490
It was my fault.

174
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,430
Back then,

175
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,950
I shouldn't have let her accept the punishment for me.

176
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,750
I should have accepted my fate.

177
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,650
It was my fault.

178
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,240
My sister's death

179
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,800
is on me.

180
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:43,830
Nan Yi.

181
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,640
Lunhui Prison is at Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament Grounds.

182
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,000
But Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament Grounds

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,400
hasn't opened for years.

184
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,060
81 days.

185
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,610
Yan can't wait any longer.

186
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,680
Where are you going?

187
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,990
I'm going to Dragon Capital to see Yan

188
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,110
and tell her Sen Luo is dead.

189
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,590
Now, all the sects

190
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,990
are heading to Dragon Capital.

191
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,030
It's very likely that Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament Grounds

192
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,200
will reopen.

193
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,910
To see Nan Yan is not the only reason

194
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,990
why you want to go to Dragon Capital now.

195
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,070
Clearly, you want to go there

196
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,600
because of Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament.

197
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,660
Are you crazy?

198
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,670
If you continue to gather the prisons,

199
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,470
you will become Sen Luo for sure.

200
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,740
I'm warning you.

201
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,230
Don't tell anyone about this,

202
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,360
especially Nan Yan.

203
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,990
You want to sacrifice yourself.

204
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,870
You want to trade your life

205
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,070
for Nan Yan's life.

206
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,050
You want to play the role of a good man,

207
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,510
but you're asking me

208
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,970
to keep it a secret for you.

209
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,670
I really can't do this.

210
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,630
I can't lie to Nan Yan.

211
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,150
If she knows I helped you lie to her,

212
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,150
she would kill me.

213
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,120
Do you think I dare not kill you?

214
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,370
I'm going to ask you one last time.

215
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:11,990
Will you

216
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,780
keep it a secret for me or not?

217
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,530
You know what?

218
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,480
Actually, I've always

219
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,360
disliked you.

220
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,710
Whether you're Ji Yang

221
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,400
or Yin,

222
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,480
you are always so arrogant

223
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,710
and self-righteous.

224
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,610
But Nan Yan, that stupid girl,

225
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,470
loves you wholeheartedly.

226
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,200
Until this time,

227
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,860
I saw everything

228
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,790
you did for her.

229
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,400
That was when I realized

230
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,030
why she likes you so much.

231
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,290
Human beings

232
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,770
are so foolish.

233
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,880
They have given all their love,

234
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,150
but in the end,

235
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,920
all they can get is a sad ending.

236
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,620
But this time,

237
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,470
I really can't help you.

238
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,790
I can't lie to Nan Yan.

239
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,250
If you want to die for her,

240
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,330
tell her yourself.

241
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,050
81 days.

242
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,710
I can't wait 81 days.

243
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,840
I can't just watch her

244
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,750
get backfired.

245
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,110
What do you want me to do?

246
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,560
I can't

247
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,740
watch you die.

248
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,270
I can't

249
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,510
watch her die either.

250
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,190
But if I don't do this,

251
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,410
Nan Yan will die.

252
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,600
I have no choice.

253
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,300
Besides,

254
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,110
I should always be the one

255
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,280
falling into the abyss.

256
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,670
Yin Ya,

257
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,390
I know you and Nan Yan

258
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,470
are very close.

259
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,000
She once told me

260
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,280
she treats you

261
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,370
as her own brother.

262
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,140
One last time.

263
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,780
Help me one last time.

264
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,230
Protect Nan Yan with me.

265
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,510
I'm begging you.

266
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,910
The Blood Phoenix Hairpin is nearby.

267
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,120
How come there is no trace of it now?

268
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,890
This courtyard...

269
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,110
Yan.

270
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,030
Come here.

271
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,010
It's you again.

272
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,910
You took away so many spirit stones during the day.

273
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,349
Now you're here to make trouble again at night.

274
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:16,130
You're forcing me to do it the hard way!

[Long stay by the Yangtze River,
Thousands of miles away from home,
Yellow leaves in late autumn wind
Fall and float in hills, making me sad]

277
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,260
Young Lord,

278
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,930
Miss Yun isn't here.

279
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,030
This courtyard indeed is quiet.

280
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,420
Forget it.

281
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:35,960
Just let her go.

282
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,420
I just found out the young man I saw

283
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,070
during the day is her elder brother.

284
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,980
Look at him.

285
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,070
He's so arrogant.

286
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,790
I'm angry whenever I see him.

287
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,070
Yun Qin

288
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,920
plays a very important role in the Yao Palace.

289
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,150
This time, he specially came here

290
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,470
for Miss Yun's marriage.

291
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,130
Young Lord,

292
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,430
we can't neglect him.

293
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,410
He picked on me first.

294
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,750
What happened?

295
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,010
It's Chaoyu Pavilion.

296
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,900
Who

297
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,070
is so bold to break into

298
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,770
the forbidden area of Dragon Court?

299
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,890
If my father catches this person,

300
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,290
this person will suffer.

301
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,180
This is strange.

302
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,960
Except Dragon Lord,

303
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,170
only those

304
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,110
with Chongming Bird's bloodline

305
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,710
can break the barrier there.

306
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,390
This...

307
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,050
Chongming Bird?

308
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,370
My sister!

309
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,140
Father!

310
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,200
You unfilial son.

311
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,910
You fought against me

312
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,290
for a woman!

313
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,980
Well, Father.

314
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,040
Listen to me.

315
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,010
She is...

316
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,890
Dragon Lord,

317
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,530
I'm Nan Rao's daughter,

318
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,550
Nan Yan.

319
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,420
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

320
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,040
You didn't ask me.

321
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,910
Girl,

322
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,280
did I hurt you just now?

323
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,230
No.

324
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,550
Dragon Lord,

325
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,500
this...

326
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,230
is my mother's courtyard?

327
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,050
The master of the Yao Palace

328
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,450
is your mother's stepmother.

329
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,540
But they didn't get along well.

330
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,470
Your mother didn't want

331
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,070
to argue with that old woman.

332
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,130
So,

333
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,390
she came here

334
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,130
and spent many years here.

335
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,760
But later,

336
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,870
after what happened to Nan Yi,

337
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,150
she never came back.

338
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,450
This place is exactly the same

339
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,080
as my home.

340
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,790
Your mother liked

341
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,950
flowers and plants.

342
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,650
Right,

343
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,990
this tree

344
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,520
was planted

345
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,510
by your mother.

346
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,880
Back then,

347
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,560
after the Yao Palace delivered the news of her death,

348
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,840
the flowers on this tree

349
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,320
all fell overnight.

350
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,030
It took me a lot of effort

351
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,700
to save it.

352
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,600
She was more powerful

353
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,690
than us.

354
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,920
But...

355
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,110
she died before us.

356
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,130
This is strange.

357
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,080
You know what?

358
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,320
This place is exactly the same

359
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,750
as my godmother's home.

360
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,750
In your opinion, what's the relationship

361
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,550
between my father and Chief Nan?

362
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,670
Dragon Capital has always been on good terms with the Yao Palace.

363
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,560
Dragon Lord

364
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,230
and Chief Nan

365
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,470
grew up together.

366
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,920
They played together and were very close.

367
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,950
So...

368
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,590
their relationship is the same as that between me and Nan Yan?

369
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,590
My mother

370
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,900
never celebrated any festival.

371
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,590
But

372
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,740
on one New Year's Eve,

373
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,430
I saw other kids

374
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,670
holding red packets.

375
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,450
So I went home and asked my mother for one.

376
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,470
My mother lazily found two coins

377
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,380
from the bottom of a box

378
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,610
and wrapped them in a red handkerchief.

379
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,310
Then she gave it to me as a red packet.

380
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,150
She had never lived such a miserable life before that.

381
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,200
When she was in Dragon Capital,

382
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,780
she could always have what she wanted

383
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,110
and eat delicious food.

384
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,870
But I didn't expect

385
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,400
after she went to the North,

386
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,440
she took care of her child alone

387
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,520
and lived such a poor life.

388
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,630
Yu Quan.

389
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,800
Dragon Lord.

390
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,970
Go get me a red packet.

391
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,130
This...

392
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,750
Dragon Court never celebrates any festival of mortals.

393
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,300
Besides, we don't have such a thing.

394
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,300
You're useless!

395
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,680
Go make one now if we don't have one.

396
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,260
By the way,

397
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,830
bring me the fief jade seal

398
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,590
of Wangqiongjing.

399
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,510
Dragon Lord,

400
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,840
Young Lord doesn't have a fief currently.

401
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,950
Dragon Lord,

402
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,990
I dare not accept your gifts.

403
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,600
Even if I give you Dragon Capital,

404
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,640
you're qualified to accept it.

405
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,980
Back then,

406
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,970
your mother risked her life for me.

407
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,410
I killed people for her.

408
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,450
She and I

409
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,550
were sworn brothers.

410
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,410
Dragon Lord, I appreciate

411
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,220
your kindness.

412
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,020
There is something

413
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,290
my mother mentioned to me.

414
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,150
What is it?

415
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,480
The Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

416
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,490
Yu Quan,

417
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,870
you're in charge of the Treasury of Dragon Capital.

418
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,550
Is there such a thing inside?

419
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,210
I've never seen it.

420
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,300
Forget it then.

421
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,010
Dragon Lord, I want

422
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,790
to take a closer look at Chaoyu Pavilion,

423
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,070
where my mother lived.

424
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,810
Sure.

425
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,340
From now on,

426
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,330
Chaoyu Pavilion will be your home.

427
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,450
Just live here.

428
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,190
Don't worry about anything.

429
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,460
Your mother is gone.

430
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,590
From now on,

431
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,610
Dragon Capital will protect you.

432
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,150
You asked me here at this hour

433
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,110
just to let me see you

434
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,370
in this drunken state?

435
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,750
This is

436
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,520
the Clear Dew Sorrow made by her.

437
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,200
Do you want a drink?

438
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,590
No.

439
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,450
Alcohol will dull the sword spirit.

440
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,590
You ignorant old man.

441
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,870
You asked me here at this hour

442
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,210
just to drink?

443
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,540
You always practice swordsmanship on the snow mountain.

444
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,740
You're a rare visitor.

445
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,900
Let's catch up on each other.

446
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,820
Looks like you're reminiscing

447
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,390
and you have a story to share with me.

448
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,180
Back then,

449
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,370
we were in Great Path,

450
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,950
listening to the old master preaching together.

451
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,880
We ate and lived

452
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,870
together.

453
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,500
She lived next door to me.

454
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,890
Listen,

455
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,070
one day,

456
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,310
I went to her room.

457
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,530
But

458
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,750
she was not there.

459
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,620
I knew

460
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,790
she always wanted to steal water

461
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,350
from the Soul River of Great Path to brew wine.

462
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,330
So,

463
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,050
I went to the Soul River.

464
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,090
I found

465
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,520
she was stealing water from the Soul River.

466
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,420
Guess what?

467
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,190
After she found out I was there,

468
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,160
she kicked me

469
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,510
into the river.

470
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,350
And I ended up with a fever all night.

471
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,750
You

472
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,960
even sang all night.

473
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,340
Really?

474
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,730
She said

475
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,490
I

476
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,560
was possessed by a female ghost.

477
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,260
The old friend and the old story

478
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,880
are all in the past.

479
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,870
Dragon Lord,

480
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,110
you should let it go as soon as possible.

481
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,750
Listen,

482
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,510
Nan Yan is here.

483
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,850
She is her daughter.

484
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,010
Listen!

485
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,270
If you dare

486
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,530
to mention a word

487
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,820
about my past

488
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,400
to the younger generation,

489
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,830
I'll have a falling-out with you!

490
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,720
Sister,

491
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,550
why didn't you tell me

492
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,890
you would come?

493
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,610
Otherwise,

494
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,230
what happened just now wouldn't have happened.

495
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,560
I sent you a message, but you didn't reply.

496
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,120
I didn't receive it.

497
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,650
Was it because

498
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,440
you were too scared

499
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,710
to leave your house

500
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,760
after being beaten up by Dragon Lord?

501
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,000
You know this too?

502
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,060
Let's not talk about this.

503
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,040
I heard the girl who came with you

504
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,520
is a demonic cultivator.

505
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,750
You're Bloody-handed Asura.

506
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,880
Why are you with a demonic cultivator?

507
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,820
Big Brother,

508
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,880
I'll tell you

509
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,470
about this later.

510
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,510
Thank you

511
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,350
for helping her settle down.

512
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,420
No big deal.

513
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,600
This is my territory.

514
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,930
Hiding someone is easy.

515
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:49,950
Right,

516
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,000
why did you come

517
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,390
to Dragon Capital this time?

518
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,830
Ji Yang and I met the person

519
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,510
gathering the prisons in Nancang.

520
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,970
That person took the Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

521
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,840
I used this

522
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,530
to trace the hairpin

523
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,500
and came all the way here.

524
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,870
You mean

525
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,730
that person is in Dragon Court right now?

526
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,100
I'm sure

527
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,640
that person is here.

528
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,260
But I think

529
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,190
there is a restriction in Dragon Court.

530
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,530
After I came here,

531
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,990
this thing doesn't work.

532
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,950
Impossible.

533
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,990
I've never heard Dragon Capital

534
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,190
has any restriction.

535
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,810
Is there anyone

536
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,680
you suspect?

537
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,610
That person...

538
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,420
is a demigod.

539
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,180
A demigod in Dragon Court?

540
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,120
Do you suspect my father?

541
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,230
Of course I don't want

542
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,430
to suspect Dragon Lord.

543
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,320
But...

544
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,600
It can't be my father.

545
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,320
There is something coincidental.

546
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,970
My father sent invitations

547
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,070
to all the sects a few days ago.

548
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,030
Now the demigods

549
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,120
and quasi-demigods are all here.

550
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,690
Why?

551
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,840
I don't know.

552
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,740
My father didn't tell me.

553
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,890
I didn't dare to ask.

554
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,000
But

555
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,270
the chiefs of the sects

556
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,310
live in Dragon Court currently.

557
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,910
They will be there tomorrow.

558
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,470
So,

559
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,010
currently, there are

560
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,680
other demigods

561
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,160
in Dragon Capital?

562
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,130
I'm going to check now.

563
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,070
Don't.

564
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,630
Don't you think

565
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,630
you've caused enough chaos?

566
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,640
If they get up

567
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,770
and complain to my father,

568
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,370
you'll be in bigger trouble.

569
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,960
How about this?

570
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,410
I'll take you to the hall tomorrow.

571
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,500
Then let's play it by ear.

572
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,050
Okay.

573
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,900
By the way,

574
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,200
where are Ji Yang and Little Fox?

575
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,500
I heard Ji Yang

576
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,910
took Youquan Prison.

577
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,340
He was backfired by Sen Luo. He was worried he would hurt me,

578
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,680
so he went to exorcise the demon alone.

579
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,720
He left you again.

580
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:02,750
It's okay.

581
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,510
When he comes back,

582
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,240
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

583
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,260
I hope

584
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,230
he can come back soon.

585
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,440
Don't worry.

586
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:15,800
Big Brother,

587
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,790
I want to take a look at the room

588
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,280
my mother lived in.

589
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,050
Let's go. I'll go with you.

590
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,950
I heard Godmother was renowned

591
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,880
for being very beautiful in the five states.

592
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,430
All the painters in the world went to draw portraits of her.

593
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,360
I didn't expect the paintings have been hidden here.

594
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,970
My mother...

595
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,280
was like this.

596
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,360
[Rao, I failed to keep the appointment on July 7. Take this as an apology from me]

597
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,130
Even I could rarely see

598
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,820
my mother

599
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,210
looking so relaxed.

600
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,200
I guess

601
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,400
someone she trusted very much was around her.

602
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,630
Rao, I failed to keep the appointment on July 7.

603
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,010
Take this as an apology from me.

604
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,360
Whose handwriting is this?

605
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,910
I don't know.

606
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,480
The Clear Dew Sorrow

607
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,210
was left by my mother.

608
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,350
In the past,

609
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,190
she drank

610
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,679
and enjoyed flowers

611
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,449
in this courtyard.

612
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,830
It must be very pleasing.

613
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,870
Did she never mention these to you?

614
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,010
It's late.

615
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,790
Why don't you go back and rest first?

616
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,010
See you

617
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,310
in the hall tomorrow.

618
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,909
Okay.

619
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:52,150
She was determined

620
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,920
to leave her elegant life here behind.

621
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,139
Could it be...

622
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,780
because of that accident?

623
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,420
They haven't shown up yet.

624
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,150
We've been waiting for so long.

625
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,640
You'll know later.

626
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,640
Sword Master, please sit.

627
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,990
Please sit, everyone.

628
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,640
Everyone is here.

629
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,900
There's still one absent.

630
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,410
Looks like

631
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,350
Premier is going to be late.

632
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,390
Great Path's judicial elder,

633
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
Elder Zhu is here.

634
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Fu Lang?

635
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,490
Greetings, Dragon Lord,

636
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,510
Sword Master.

637
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,100
Why did he go to Great Path?

638
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,050
Premier has something important to do today.

639
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,450
So he asked me to come here

640
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,150
to discuss with you

641
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,630
on behalf of him.

642
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,790
Elder Zhu,

643
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,810
help yourself.

644
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,710
Everyone is here now.

645
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,230
I've checked them with my divine energy.

646
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,040
Except Dragon Lord and Sword Master,

647
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,400
no one else is a demigod.

648
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,410
Could it be...

649
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,710
Big Brother, mind your words.

650
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,220
Who is whispering?

651
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,410
Greetings, Dragon Lord,

652
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,710
Sword Master.

653
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,580
Sword Master,

654
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,200
let me introduce her to you.

655
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,100
This is

656
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,640
Nan Yan.

657
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,230
She's Chief Nan's daughter.

658
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,340
She has such a strong background.

659
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,470
She deserves to be Chief Nan's daughter.

660
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,770
She's so beautiful.

661
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,410
Luckily,

662
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,180
my son introduced her to me.

663
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,860
That's how I knew Yan

664
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,070
is the daughter of my old friend.

665
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,670
I'm really happy.

666
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,720
Today's meeting

667
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,560
is not for you to catch up.

668
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,080
Miss Nan,

669
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,230
if you have nothing important to say,

670
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,790
please sit quietly.

671
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:57,890
Okay.

672
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,050
Yu Quan, Yu Que,

673
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,510
bring them chairs.

674
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,430
Everyone,

675
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,100
I believe you all know

676
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,330
Sen Luo has reappeared in the cultivation realm.

677
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,860
A few days ago,

678
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,910
he just got Youquan Prison in Nancang.

679
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,830
I've confirmed with Premier

680
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,050
that he is the former monarch,

681
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,620
Shao Cang.

682
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,520
As the leader of the Justice Hall, the monarch

683
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,050
should eliminate demons and defend justice.

684
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,280
But this man has willingly become a demon.

685
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,520
He has failed everyone

686
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,760
and disgraced

687
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,140
the Justice Hall.

688
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,270
We should elect a new monarch

689
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,190
to lead the Justice Hall to fight against Sen Luo

690
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,530
and defend justice.

691
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,800
In the past century,

692
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,650
the monarchs all came from Great Path.

693
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,100
Also, Great Path

694
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,710
has always been in charge of the Justice Hall's affairs.

695
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,390
Of course,

696
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,190
with great talents

697
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,750
like Premier and Shao Cang,

698
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,870
disciples of other sects dare not

699
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,620
covet the position of monarch.

700
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,780
However,

701
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,430
I don't think

702
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,910
Great Path has had such brilliant disciples

703
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,730
like them in recent years.

704
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,790
On the contrary, there have been many

705
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,650
gifted people in the five states.

706
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,470
In terms of abilities,

707
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,640
Great Path's disciples may not be able to outshine them.

708
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,020
The position of monarch

709
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,770
and the crown

710
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,590
are the most valuable treasures in the cultivation realm.

711
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,790
It's a good thing that you

712
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,270
want them.

713
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,070
Elder Zhu,

714
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,000
Premier is not here today.

715
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:09,060
Can you really make decisions for him?

716
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,900
Master has been in seclusion recently.

717
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,620
Besides, there is a traitor

718
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,570
in our sect.

719
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,750
So Master still needs to handle

720
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,350
the Justice Hall's affairs.

721
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,610
He's very tired.

722
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,390
If this time, we can

723
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,990
successfully elect a new monarch,

724
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,150
well,

725
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,480
Master won't have any objection.

726
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:35,830
Okay.

727
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,680
Since everyone here

728
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,190
has reached a consensus,

729
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,760
this year,

730
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,570
I'll be the host.

731
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,920
Dragon Capital will release announcements.

732
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,330
In three days,

733
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,320
we'll open Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament Grounds

734
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,860
and elect a new monarch.
