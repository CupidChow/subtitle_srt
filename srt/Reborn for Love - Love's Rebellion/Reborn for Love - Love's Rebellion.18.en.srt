[Cold Medicine]

5
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,710
Since I got on the whaleboat,

6
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,340
I've felt someone

7
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,070
has been watching us secretly.

8
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,110
Well,

9
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,350
you have a pretty face.

10
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,950
You also have a reputation

11
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,150
for being Bloody-handed Asura.

12
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,680
It'd be strange if you're not noticed by them.

13
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,860
Relax.

14
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,320
Demons should be killed,

15
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,250
but you should also live your life.

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,820
Miss,

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,700
the medicine you want is all here.

18
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,470
Thank you.

19
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,950
You take a walk around here.

20
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,009
I'll go take a look,

21
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:37,770
in case

22
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,300
the demon shows up.

23
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,350
This boat is small but fully equipped.

24
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,130
It's called a boat, but it's actually an island.

25
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,370
Why not change its name to Whale Island?

26
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,440
Was it...

27
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,000
really an illusion?

28
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,760
Female friend.

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,040
I want to ask

30
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,200
if you're a cultivator from Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea.

31
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,120
Yes.

32
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,120
Do you want me

33
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,150
to set up an altar and perform a ritual

34
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,870
or to release the souls of your relatives and friends?

35
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,400
No.

36
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,510
I'm Yuan Feng.

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,560
I have always

38
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,450
been interested in cultivation.

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,150
In the vast sea of people,

40
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,500
it's fate

41
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,840
that made us meet

42
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,340
on the whaleboat.

43
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,810
I wonder if I can

44
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,550
invite you to my room

45
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,160
to have a cup of spirit tea.

46
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,060
According to you,

47
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,710
fate made my sister

48
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,910
meet every cultivator

49
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,910
on the whaleboat.

50
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,000
Should she drink

51
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,010
more tea than she can handle?

52
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,320
This is...

53
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,070
This is my younger brother.

54
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,380
I'm the young lord of Haixiao City.

55
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,000
What I've cultivated has its own charm.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,030
As long as you are willing to come,

57
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,500
we can drink something else

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,160
if you don't want to drink tea.

59
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,290
Considering your warm hospitality,

60
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,450
I should go with you.

61
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,700
Very good.

62
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,040
Very good.

63
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,350
Friend,

64
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,940
please.

65
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,730
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,660
Please don't mind it.

67
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,450
Looks like you have indigestion today.

68
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,920
You shouldn't drink tea.

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,720
Bye.

70
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,640
Friend, wait.

71
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,630
Let me explain.

72
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,740
You female cultivator,

73
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,510
I just want to treat you to a cup of spirit tea.

74
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,970
Why did you do this to me?

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,780
You...

76
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,460
Don't.

77
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,620
Don't stand in my way.

78
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,520
Take it easy.

79
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,870
Are today's female cultivators

80
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,910
so domineering?

81
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,030
In my life,

82
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,260
I hate people bullying others the most.

83
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
Why don't you let me help you?

84
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,290
Sir,

85
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,190
how do you plan to help me?

86
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,450
You...

87
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,130
Sister,

88
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,320
you secretly drugged him.

89
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,230
Impressive.

90
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,350
Now, everyone on the whaleboat

91
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,060
knows him.

92
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,030
Those who accost me on the street

93
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,650
are bad people usually.

94
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,650
Of course I should

95
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,710
teach him a lesson.

96
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,430
Your despicable tricks

97
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,080
are still as good as before.

98
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,800
Now, you're just

99
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,470
pretending

100
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,890
to look innocent, right?

101
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,630
There are many ways to offer salvation to people.

102
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,440
I can't just kill them all.

103
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,400
Right,

104
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,390
did you notice

105
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,920
anything strange just now?

106
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,730
I already checked him.

107
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,830
He has no demonic aura.

108
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,710
Also, he's just in the Core Formation Realm.

109
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,170
I don't think he's the one we're looking for.

110
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,800
What are you laughing at? Stop laughing.

111
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,740
Who

112
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,750
did that unlucky guy offend?

113
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,440
Sister,

114
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,710
it's almost time for dinner.

115
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,600
Let's go back.

116
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,150
You go back first.

117
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,750
I still have something important to do.

118
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,550
Ask the waiter

119
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,450
to deliver some dishes to my room.

120
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,270
Leave it to me.

121
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,720
I don't eat meat or fish.

122
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,050
Be careful.

123
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,190
Sister, sorry.

124
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,960
My butterfly flew away.

125
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,030
Wait a minute.

126
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,050
Let me show you.

127
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,640
A butterfly.

128
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,470
Do you like it?

129
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,730
Yes.

130
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,320
Go home. Be careful.

131
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,340
Okay.

132
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,980
Young Lord, what happened to you?

133
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,700
Bloody-handed Asura

134
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,230
was so rude to me.

135
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,390
But...

136
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,990
But she's a pretty girl after all.

137
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,170
I...

138
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,530
You just made yourself humiliated.

139
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,850
Why are you still thinking about her?

140
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,510
I've seen all kinds of female cultivators.

141
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,460
But I've never seen

142
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,100
a female cultivator who has severed

143
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,760
worldly attachments before.

144
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,050
What's so special about them?

145
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,900
I heard

146
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,210
all cultivators do is subduing demons and defending justice.

147
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,270
They can't get romantic hints at all.

148
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,500
You don't understand.

149
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,870
Bloody-handed Asura

150
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,120
is aloof but cute.

151
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,810
Also, she's gentle but proud.

152
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,490
The more she resists,

153
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,460
the more she actually wants people to get closer.

154
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,070
At the thought

155
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,560
of her look

156
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,470
after she loses her virginity,

157
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,150
I feel increasingly restless and impatient.

158
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,299
Young Lord,

159
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,190
you can think about it.

160
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,480
But she is not

161
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,230
an ordinary girl like me.

162
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,669
She won't

163
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,960
let you have her easily.

164
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,710
Have you heard of the Illusory Love Fragrance?

165
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,150
No matter how noble and unsullied she is,

166
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,430
even if she's an immortal, she would crave love

167
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,350
after sniffing just a little of its powder.

168
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,950
Going to Nancang is your idea.

169
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,030
What?

170
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,350
It's been only half a day.

171
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,150
Have you already lost patience?

172
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,260
How much longer do I

173
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,260
have to stay here?

174
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,770
At least...

175
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,370
three to five days.

176
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,620
Back then,

177
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,790
when I dominated the cultivation realm,

178
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,710
demon boats were everywhere in the five states.

179
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,390
There were hundreds of them.

180
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,030
They were much faster

181
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,380
than this stupid thing of Dragon Capital.

182
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,300
They could take us to Nancang within two or three days.

183
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,090
Who asked you that?

184
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,150
Let me remind you.

185
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,800
Your life

186
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,710
was given by me.

187
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,900
You'd better

188
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,770
show some respect.

189
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,690
Get lost.

190
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,980
Let me remind you!

191
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,900
We're one now.

192
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,150
You have me in you

193
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,280
and I have you in me.

194
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,830
In this life,

195
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,770
your fate is destined to intertwine with mine.

196
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,440
What are you talking about?

197
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,490
Don't you think it's disgusting?

198
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,670
You want to get rid of me so badly?

199
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,860
Have you forgotten

200
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,340
the price you'll pay

201
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,570
if you leave me?

202
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,320
You're crazy.

203
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,170
You really have the guts to gamble with your life.

204
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,140
What?

205
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,610
Do you want to perish together?

206
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,150
It's about to rain on the whaleboat.

207
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,830
Friends, please

208
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,710
take shelter under the eaves to enjoy the scenery

209
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,370
so that you won't get splashed by the seawater or things in the sea.

210
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,070
Interesting.

How dare you do this to me?

228
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,310
You're Bloody-handed Asura, so what?

229
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,120
This is Mu's whaleboat.

230
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,630
Sir, please don't be angry.

231
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,270
I'm sorry for offending you.

232
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,380
But may I ask

233
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,820
if you... feel calm?

234
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,210
What did you give me?

235
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,230
Deadly Grass.

236
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,330
What?

237
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,450
Don't worry.

238
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,750
When Deadly Grass is used

239
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,940
with mint, lotus seeds, and radix gentianae,

240
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,010
its toxicity is negligible.

241
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,150
It can clear heat, cool the blood,

242
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,880
and effectively balance excessive Yang energy.

243
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,930
You have such ability?

244
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,110
You fell ill due to prolonged overwork.

245
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,300
I shouldn't have disturbed you

246
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,840
with the matter concerning demonic cultivators.

247
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,920
But now,

248
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,730
you're fine.

249
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,490
Can I have a moment to share my thoughts?

250
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,650
No need to say more.

251
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,440
Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea

252
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,260
has always regarded killing demons and defending justice as its responsibility.

253
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,590
Of course I should take it seriously.

254
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,310
I'm going to alert the cultivators on the boat

255
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,230
and ask everyone to be careful.

256
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,220
No.

257
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,270
This person is not an ordinary demonic cultivator.

258
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,270
Once he finds out,

259
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,880
he'll cause great trouble.

260
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,680
Please allow me

261
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:16,200
to check the list of passengers

262
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,349
to investigate suspicious people.

263
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,730
This is against the rule.

264
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,500
However,

265
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,250
since you are

266
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,360
a disciple of Master of Endurance,

267
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,360
I'll make an exception.

268
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,090
Take this talisman

269
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,400
to get it yourself on the second floor.

270
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,380
Thank you.

271
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,050
It's her again.

272
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,180

274
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,530
Yin?

275
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,610
Who are you?

276
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,570
Someone snuck in?

277
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,070
Did you find any clue from the list?

278
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,340
Can you tell me

279
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,250
where Yin lives?

280
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,480
This person is suspicious?

281
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,030
I want to investigate this person secretly.

282
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,030
Once I find something,

283
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,060
I'll let you know immediately.

284
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,210
You can't touch this woman.

285
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,840
What if I insist?

286
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,140
This woman

287
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,230
has the Seven Sins Manual in her body.

288
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,730
Once she sees through your identity,

289
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,530
she will try her best to kill you.

290
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,990
Compared to being immortal,

291
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,550
isn't it more interesting

292
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,590
to meet

293
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,850
a deadly opponent?

294
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:22,960
You...

295
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,250
You'll get burned if you play with fire.

296
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:39,950
What's wrong?

297
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,030
That old man

298
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,090
is still stubborn?

299
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,640
The captain promised to do his best to help us.

300
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,280
I've found some clues.

301
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,030
What clues?

302
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:51,870
Little Fox,

303
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,410
you lived in Lunar Sect for a few days.

304
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,270
Have you heard of someone

305
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,780
named Yin?

306
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,300
Yin?

307
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,070
There are only over 20 people

308
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,060
in Lunar Sect.

309
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,350
I've seen them all.

310
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,880
There is no such person.

311
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,740
I think someone

312
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,270
fabricated his identity

313
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,870
and got on the boat by pretending to be

314
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,270
a disciple of Lunar Sect.

315
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,400
Who else could it be?

316
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,020
It must be that demon.

317
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,830
He killed Meng.

318
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,280
I can't believe he has the guts

319
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,590
to pretend to be a disciple of Lunar Sect.

320
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,950
He's so arrogant.

321
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,420
I'm not sure.

322
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,280
But there must be something fishy about this.

323
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,160
There must be something wrong

324
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,690
with this person named Yin.

325
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,250
Let's go find out

326
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,890
who this person really is.

327
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,560
I'm going to investigate further.

328
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,360
Wait.

329
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,070
Everyone on the boat

330
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,630
knows you're Bloody-handed Asura.

331
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,480
You'll alert him if you go.

332
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,670
I'll go.

333
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,350
You go?

334
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,620
Room check.

00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,040
Sorry.

00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,830
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,030
Sir, watch your step.

341
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,520
I'm carrying too many things.

Be careful in case I collide with you again.

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,350
What's so delicious?

344
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,120
Someone ordered so many portions.

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,980
Let me take a look.

346
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,120

There are all kinds of delicious dishes

349
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,160
on the whaleboat.

350
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,760
The guest in that room

351
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,680
prefers braised chicken drumsticks.

352
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,240
She ordered ten portions.

353
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,320
I thought it was something delicious.

354
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,070
Leave.

355
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:16,710
Okay.

356
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,140
Sir, goodbye.

357
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,720
This is strange.

How come there is no human smell

359
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,090
in this room at all?

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:15,960
Who are you?

361
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,740
Why did you break into the guest room?

362
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,760
Well, keep your voice down.

363
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,220
Don't let others hear you.

364
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,900
I came here to take a look

365

00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:34,920
Miss,

384
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,740
the dishes you ordered are here.

385
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,060
Thank you.

386
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,100
Please deliver the drumsticks

387
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,300
to the room next door.

388
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:54,920
Okay.

389
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,550
Thank you.

390
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,330
Miss,

391
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,320
enjoy your meal.

392
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,070
Why is it you?

393
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,120
Who else

394
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,810
could it be?

395
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,220
Did you find anything?

396
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,280
Nothing abnormal for now.

397
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,400
He was not there.

398
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,350
No trace was left

399
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,410
in the room either.

400
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,080
I

401
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,390
found something.

402
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,570
What happened?

403
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,670
Someone put a drug in the food.

404
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,620
Put a drug?

405
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,750
When the waiter just delivered them here,

406
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,470
I already noticed the smell is not right.

407
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,470
I smelt it.

408
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,510
It should be knockout drops.

409
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,330
Then my chicken drumsticks...

410
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,630
Your chicken drumsticks should be okay.

411
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,870
I asked the waiter to deliver them to the room next door.

412
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,600
That's good.

413
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,640
But

414
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,920
who is so bold

415
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,650
to play tricks in front of you?

416
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,580
Could it be the unlucky guy

417
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,040
who farted in the morning?

418
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,760
No matter who it is,

419
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,390
since he has taken the risk,

420
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,650
he will show up.

421
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,270
But...

422
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,890
where is the person who should've come here?

423
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,900
You...

424
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,880
Pretty girl.

425
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,080
Pretty girl.

426
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,270
Pretty girl.

427
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:06,920
I...

428
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,070
What's wrong with him?

429
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,440
Pretty girl.

430
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,410
It's you.

431
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,370
Great.

432
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,230
I haven't settled the score with you

433
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,670
considering what happened during the day.

434
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,730
Now you're here to ruin my plan again.

435
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,350
How much do you know

436
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,030
about the woman in that room?

437
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,010
Do you want to compete with me for her?

438
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,000
Do you know who I am?

439
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
Listen,

440
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm the young lord of Haixiao City.

441
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,760
I'm known as Speedster of East Sea.

442
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,360
You're scared now, right?

443
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,350
Okay.

444
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:05,970
Just ask me.

445
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,290
I'll tell you everything I know.

446
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,640
Tell me.

447
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,870
It was like this.

448
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,750
I'm leaving!

449
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,280
Speedster of East Sea?

450
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,880
I'd like to see

451
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,320
how fast you can run.

452
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,190
Why are you like a ghost haunting me?

453
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,380
What do you want?

454
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,680
Now you know

455
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,910
who is a speedster.

456
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,330
You still want to escape?

457
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,100
I was ignorant.

458
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,560
May I...

459
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,390
know your name?

460
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,160
You don't need to know who I am.

461
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,300
You just need to tell me

462
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,750
the background

463
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,790
of the woman you drugged.

464
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,950
This woman has a Dharma name of Zhen Yuan.

465
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,310
Although she's a cultivator,

466
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,600
she's very beautiful.

467
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,670
She has big eyes.

468
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,260
Get to the point.

469
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,640
Okay.

470
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,390
Since she left Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea,

471
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:30,950
she has killed

472
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,740
over 100 demonic cultivators.

473
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,960
In terms of killing demons,

474
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,080
no one else is better than her.

475
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,460
People call her Bloody-handed Asura.

476
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,790
Bloody-handed Asura?

477
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,790
Someone was here.

478
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,540
What's wrong?

479
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,770
Take it out.

480
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,660
Take...

481
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,720
Take... Take what?

482
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,710
Looks like you have something else

483
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,240
except the knockout drops.

484
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,020
No.

485
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,400
I have nothing else.

486
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,740
Well,

487
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,640
you can't take it.

488
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
You really can't.

489
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,550
Today,

490
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,990
I failed to protect your Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

491
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,200
Blood Phoenix Hairpin?

492
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,130
This...

493
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,370
What a coincidence.

494
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,910
Luckily, he didn't put the drug on my chicken drumsticks.

495
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,710
Why do you have to eat

496
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,270
chicken drumsticks in my room?

497
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,670
You're eating meat

498
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,830
in front of a cultivator.

499
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,590
How wicked!

500
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,040
Eating alone

501
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,220
is quite boring.

502
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,540
Besides,

503
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,070
you should get used to it.

504
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,630
We can't always eat separately

505
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,430
in the future,

506
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,390
right?

507
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,270
I don't need anyone to accompany me when I eat.

508
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,570
Now take your chicken drumsticks

509
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,230
and go back to your room to eat.

510
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,120
No.

511
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:20,960
I want to see

512
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,550
which ignorant guy

513
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,480
would walk straight into the trap.

514
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,270
The effects of the drug

515
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,270
wore off long ago.

516
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,510
I don't think this person

517
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,830
will come tonight.

518
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,930
He's lucky.

519
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,530
He has escaped a calamity.

520
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,570
As long as he's on the boat,

521
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,430
he'll give himself away

522
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,940
sooner or later.

523
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,300
You're right.

524
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,720
Just eat.

525
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,070
Go to bed early after you finish eating.

526
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,370
Where did you get this?

527
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,970
Well...

528
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:55,970
Well...

529
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,990
I really can't tell you.

530
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,430
Tell me!

531
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,580
Sir,

532
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,510
you don't know the rules

533
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,770
of escorting things.

534
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,350
We don't ask where the goods came from

535
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,150
or where they should be delivered.

536
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,270
We don't meet our clients

537
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,310
or buyers.

538
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,110
Besides, we can't ask

539
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,710
about the goods' quality

540
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,560
or value.

541
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,580
If I know any of these things,

542
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,719
I wouldn't have lived till this day.

543
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:26,610
Got it.

544
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:28,870
Leave.

545
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,050
Well...

546
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,570
Sir,

547
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,679
I'll die

548
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,179
if I lose it.

549
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,949
If my client knows

550
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,250
I lost it,

551
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,350
he definitely will come to kill me.

552
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,080
Anyway, it's yours now.

553
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,909
Can I also be yours?

554
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,260
As long as you protect me,

555
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm willing to do anything for you.

556
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,930
Why do I need you?

557
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,260
Just now,

558
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,600
you

559
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,420
helped Bloody-handed Asura.

560
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,640
Was it because...

561
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,310
Sir, don't worry.

562
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,600
If you want her,

563
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,080
I can help you.

564
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,560
She's just a woman.

565
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,610
You don't need to do it personally.

566
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,310
Right?

567
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,260
You stay here.

568
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,840
I'm going to tie her up and bring her here now.

569
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,150
I'm going to invite her here.

570
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,750
I'm going to invite her here.

571
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:36,990
Wait.

572
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,540
One more thing.

573
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,450
Go ahead.

574
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,200
W-Well.

Friend,

612
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,840
I made a mistake last night.

the remaining Illusory Love Fragrance.

619
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,750
