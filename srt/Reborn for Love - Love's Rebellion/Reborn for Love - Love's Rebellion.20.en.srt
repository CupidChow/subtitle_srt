Bloody-handed Asura.

5
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,550
You are Sen Luo.

6
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,870
On the account of

7
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,280
your grandmaster, Ji Ming,

8
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,520
I will avenge all

9
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,110
old and new grudges today.

10
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,210
It's the Seven Sins Manual again.

11
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,900
I lower my head and listen to people's suffering,

12
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,130
and then raise my head to kill all demons who come my way.

13
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,450
Ji Yang!

14
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,200
Continue if you dare.

15
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,270
I share the same body with him,

16
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,800
so we live and die together.

17
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,650
If I turn into ashes,

18
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,680
your little lover

19
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,470
will die a horrible death.

20
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,130
I won't let you leave me again.

21
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,600
As the disciple of Ji Ming,

22
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,579
I'll let you experience

23
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,750
Yin Zhu's soul-consuming pain.

24
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,950
Don't you recognize your master?

25
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,320
Come back!

26
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,760
If you don't kill her today,

27
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,150
you'll definitely regret it in the future.

28
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,300
You will!

29
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,370
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,880
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,350
You could have walked

32
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,090
the safe and easy road.

33
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,659
But now, you got lost

34
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,730
and came to the netherworld.

35
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,010
You even risked your life.

36
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,300
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,230
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,500
Looks like

39
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,120
I'm doomed to be stuck

40
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,180
with Sen Luo, that old thing.

41
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,770
Ji Yang.

42
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,600
I owe this to you.

43
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,550
I'm not the real Ji Yang.

44
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,540
If there ever comes a day

45
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,670
when you've lost your heart,

46
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,900
please don't forget that

47
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,710
even though I'm in hell,

48
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,440
I'm willing to turn into a flat boat floating on the river

49
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,060
and take you to the other side.

50
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,280
You're still talking about me?

51
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,950
You're playing this game better than I am.

[A fair maiden, a gentleman's desire]

53
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,590
These small tricks are meant to

54
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,110
only fool

55
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,680

56
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,680
Shut up.

57
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,420
Back then,

58
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,880
I had 3,000 beautiful girls at my fingertips.

59
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,300
If I fancied any girl,

60
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,760
I just had to take her away.

61
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,590
I didn't had to go through all this trouble.

62
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,270
You just told me to stay away from her.

63
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,000
Now you want me to take her away?

64
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,810
This a different matter.

65
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,640
You're the head of prison.

66
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,350
Yet, you are racking your brain

67
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,770
over a woman.

68
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,170
I'll teach you how to be a man.

69
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,600
Teach me how to be a man?

70
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,050

Today's poem battle

75
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,920

It felt so good!

77
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,970
Poem battle?

78
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,480
I've held it in for three years.

79
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,140
I can finally make my mark.

Tomorrow, Dragon Capital

81
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,680

If God doesn't give birth to me, Mu Zhanting,

83
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,860
the literary world would be stuck in an endless night.

84
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,080
That's a beautiful quote.

85
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,550
Today,

86
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,570
since my inspiration is flowing,

87
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,500
I thought I would

88
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,650
write another 300 poems for Dragon Capital.

89
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,990

Today, we're going to use the moon as our theme.

I didn't call Dad, did I?

95
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,040
Look how drunk you are.

96
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,960
How inappropriate!

97
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,190
Niannian is here.

98
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,430
You're a man.

99
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,080
You have no manners at all.

100

to keep waiting for you?

102
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,210
No.

Feeling better?

[A fair maiden, a gentleman's desire]

111
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,660
Firstly,

112
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,230
spend more time together.

113
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,180
If you keep her by your side,

114
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,560
you'll have the chance to earn her affection.

115
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,070
When...

116
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,130
are you planning to leave?

117
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,290
I won't bother you then.

118
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:05,870
No.

119
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,670
Wait.

120
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,620
I mean...

121
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:12,970
Do you

122
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,210
like these things?

123
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,210
You bought

124
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,280
these for me?

125
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,440
Secondly,

126
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,410
spend a lot of money on her.

127
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,910
As long as you're willing to spend money,

128
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,870
there is no woman

129
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,720
in the world you cannot please.

130
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,360
I just happened to buy some.

131
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,960
They aren't that expensive.

132
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,920
Just 30,000 spirit stones.

133
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,350
He's just as bad

134
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,680
with money.

135
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,660
I'm not helping you overcome the demon

136
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,020
for these rewards.

137
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,840
Are you unhappy?

138
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,410
Why would I be happy?

139
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,500
Thirdly,

140
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,460
be understanding.

141
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,120
Women

142
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,960
often don't say what they mean.

143
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,860
If you can understand her real intention,

144
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,860
you can take her by surprise and win.

145
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,940
What do you mean?

146
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,530
I also don't understand...

147
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,370
what you mean.

148
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,350
I mean...

149
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,440
What I mean is...

150
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,540
You can just say

151
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,810
what's on your mind.

152
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,720
I mean...

153
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,550
You don't want to get along with me,

154
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,100
nor do you like my gift.

155
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,900
I'm not allowed to be understanding of you either.

156
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,750
So, exactly what should I do

157
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,980
to make you happy?

158
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,350
So,

159
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,050
you mean...

160
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,950
you're trying to make me happy?

161
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,730
Suhe Grass?

162
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,320
Toad venom?

163
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,750
You're making medicine that strengthens one's heart and energy?

164
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,200
I've just made some medicine.

165
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,120
I'll go get it for you.

166
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,830
Wait here.

167
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,200
This medicine tastes bitter.

168
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
I...

169
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,450
just added some honey

170
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,770
so that it'll be easier to swallow.

171
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,610
There's... not enough Suhe.

172
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,880
The toad venom...

173
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,730
can be reduced by half.

174
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,900
But...

175
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,510
Since this is the first time

176
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,910
you're making medicine,

177
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,670
I will give you a pass.

178
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,770
Yan.

179
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,880
You even understand medicine?

180
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,560
In the past,

181
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,670
you had heart disease.

182
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,260
You were my patient.

183
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,440
In that case,

184
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,710
between you and him,

185
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,730
and between you and me,

186
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,850
we actually shared kindness.

187
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,680
In the past...

188
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,970
In the past,

189
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
we not only shared kindness,

190
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,860
but I also kept you warm,

191
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,240
and you cared about my safety.

192
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,560
It's just like...

193
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,800
what's happening now.

194
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,910
At that time,

195
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,700
all of that didn't seem that special.

196
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,070
I just thought

197
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,950
we would live happily ever after.

198
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,280
I see.

199
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,170
Now I know.

200
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,770
That's why

201
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,500
you became happy over this.

202
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm happy...

203
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,130
not just because of this.

204
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,010
You used to

205
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,840
get into a lot of trouble,

206
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,240
and you had poor health.

207
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,370
You also had many enemies.

208
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,970
As long as I don't keep an eye on you,

209
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,000
you would be heading out to fight.

210
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,440
So,

211
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,740
it's only when you achieve real peace

212
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,569
that I will be truly happy.

213
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,240
Fine.

214
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,420
Although I'm not Ji Yang,

215
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,500
from now on,

216
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,300
I will do my best

217
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,550
to avoid trouble.

218
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,180
So,

219
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,340
it's only when you achieve real peace

220
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,190
that I will be truly happy.

221
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,910
You look so happy.

222
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,350
I wonder...

223
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,300
if you had knocked on her heart

224
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,860
or her door?

225
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,570
I-I am sorry.

226
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,260
I-I'm just kidding.

227
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,690
If you have something to say, spit it.

228
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,270
Young Lord,

229
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,470
have you heard of

230
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,550
the legend

231
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,010
regarding our whaleboat?

232
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,150
What?

233
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,570
At 1 a.m. today,

234
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,030
our whaleboat

235
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,360
will be travelling to a sea.

236
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,300
There is a kind of spiritual fish underwater in this area.

237
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,630
Because their body sparkles and they move as a shoal,

238
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,790
resembling stars in the sky,

239
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,050
they are known as floating star carp.

240
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,010
There are exotic fishes to be found all over this island.

241
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,340
It's not all that novel.

242
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,130
The floating star carp might not be novel.

243
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,910
But the point is not the fish,

244
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,340
but its scales.

245
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,420
It's just fish scales, isn't it?

246
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,020
What's with the fish scales?

247
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,160
There's only one fish scale

248
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,060
that falls once a year

249
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,750
from the millions of fish.

250
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,070
So?

251
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,000
It's precious just because it's one in a million?

252
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,760
There's something behind this fish scale.

253
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,910
It is said that...

254
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,460
back then, the giant whale that

255
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,410
carried the boat

256
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,760
sacrificed his life to save his lover.

257
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,720
As for the lady,

258
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,980
she hoped to use her tears to exchange for another life together.

259
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,990
After several lifetimes,

260
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,630
the girl became a floating star carp.

261
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,430
Whenever the shoal of fish meets

262
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,390
the giant whale,

263
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,000
the floating star carp which was evolved from that lady

264
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,460
will drop a single piece of

265
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,900
shiny fish scale.

266
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,000
It's with hopes that her lover

267
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,130
will be free from illness and calamity

268
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,510
and stay carefree with no worries.

269
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,420
So,

270
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,780
the whale turned into a whaleboat

271
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,630
just to

272
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,160
cross paths with his lover?

273
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,670
That's right.

274
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,440
Personally, I'm just

275
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,070
saddened by the wasted time

276
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,660
between the floating star carp and the giant whale.

277
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,590
What exactly is love in this world?

278
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,190
I probably would never

279
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,850
understand in this lifetime.

280
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,500
Miss, you have been looking for me?

281
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,930
Young Lord.

282
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,360
Because of this legend,

283
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,950
this fish scale has another meaning.

284
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,350
It's an amulet to

285
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,190
be free from illness and calamity.

286
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,250
No amount of spirit stones can buy it.

287
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,120
Across the five states,

288
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,400
this is definitely the most sincere gift

289
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,330
you can give.

290
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,960
A lifetime of peace,

291
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,470
free from worry and hardship.

292
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,550
Now,

293
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,120
I return this wish to you.

294
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,990
I hope that in the future,

295
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,940
[I wish you a lifetime of peace, free from worry and hardship]

296
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,130
you will have a lifetime of peace,

297
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,200
free from worry and hardship.

298
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,740
To be free from illness and calamity,

299
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,930
and stay carefree with no worries.

300
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,310
Well...

301
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,310
Miss Nan Yan

302
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,550
got hurt because of you.

303
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,530
Isn't it only right that

304
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,410
you pray for her?

305
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,750
What kind of lame idea

306
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,210
are you thinking of again?

307
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,070
I...

308
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,750
Who would believe that story?

309
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,100
No.

310
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:53,760
No.

311
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,870
How stubborn.

312
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,380
Compared to me,

313
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,220
he's nothing.

314
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,560
Tonight's splendor

315
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,480
is a once-a-year opportunity.

316
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,160
Yes.

317
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,310
I wonder which lucky girl

318
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,170
will get that fish scale tonight.

319
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,790
Miss Nan Yan

320
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,270
got hurt because of you.

321
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,130
Isn't it only right that

322
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,270
you pray for her?

323
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,590
A scale in exchange for a life?

324
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,870
Only a mere mortal would believe it.

325
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,470
What are you doing here?

326
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,400
I can't sleep.

327
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,160
So I just came to join in the fun.

328
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,180
What is this young man doing here?

329
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,630
Isn't this fish scale

330
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,520
meant for women

331
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,130
seeking a good marriage?

332
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,710
I don't know.

333
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,290
Perhaps he doesn't know what's going on?

334
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,230
He just thought that the scale

335
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,390
could help him make a wish

336
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,660
for the girl he loves?

337
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,470
Is this a lantern?

338
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,180
Where is it?

339
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,270

You are the biggest demon in the world,

yet you want to pray for her.

366
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,140
You're asking for death.

Sir,

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,590
are you looking for something?

Welcome.

381
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,670
Come in.

382
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,250
[Heavenly No. 1]

383
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,880
What is this?

384
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,130
Take a look.

385
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,150
How can you drink

386
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,420
such awful tea?

387
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,190
This is such a valuable gift,

388
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,760
and you're giving it to me?

389
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,130
Of course.

390
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,770
It's nothing special.

391
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,680
It's just something I picked up.

392
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,610
You picked it up?

393
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,480
The scale of the floating star carp

394
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,320
only falls once a year.

395
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,080
And you just happened to picked it up?

396
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,470
I wonder how many ladies' hearts

397
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,360
had been broken on the whaleboat.

398
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,710
If you don't like it,

399
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,770
just throw it away.

400
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,650
It's nothing precious anyway...

401
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,600
I heard that this fish scale

402
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,400
is meant to be a prayer for blessings.

403
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,120
When you picked it up,

404
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,940
what did you prayed for?

405
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,230
Nothing.

406
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,020
A lifetime of peace,

407
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,600
free from worry and hardship.

408
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
What did you say?

409
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,720
A lifetime of peace,

410
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,400
free from worry and hardship.

411
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,500
Because these 8 words

412
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,800
guided me out of a hopeless situation.

413
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,200
It's not that complicated.

414
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,100
All I'm asking for is contained in two words.

415
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,570
Which two words?

416
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,690
Thank you.

417
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,350
You did well picking up this fish scale.

418
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,900
This gift was also thoughtful enough.

419
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,280
Also,

420
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,740
only in the whaleboat's treasure chest

421
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,060
would such a box

422
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,390
be used for packaging

423
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,830
and not be a waste.

424
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,930
Your thanks are appreciated.

425
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,190
You also don't have to worry.

426
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,900
I'm much better now,

427
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,200
and I'm doing alright.

428
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,300
That's great.

429
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,370
Get some rest then.

430
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,430
I'll leave first.

431
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,570
By the way,

432
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,950
before I helped you overcome the demon yesterday,

433
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,900
I went to the pharmacy

434
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,260
to buy a pill of Heart Slaying Sand

435
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,330
for you to take.

436
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,210
This is a special medicine.

437
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,830
If someone asks,

438
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,780
a separate explanation is needed.

439
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,760
Besides, the patrol on the whaleboat is tight,

440
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,220
and there are many people.

441
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,500
You mustn't expose your demonic aura again.

442
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,530
You have to be cautious in everything you do.

443
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,910
To be cautious in everything I do,

444
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,450
and asking for a lifetime of peace.

445
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,450
It's his way of doing things, isn't it?

446
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,790
Regardless of

447
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,850
how are we doing now,

448
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,350
I just hope

449
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,000
you can be safe and sound.

450
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,100
To walk around the world cowering in fear,

451
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,830
wouldn't such a life be boring?

452
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,340
But don't worry about me.

453
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,790
Because...

454
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,040
I'm the danger.

455
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,280
Enough.

456
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,200
You're still hurt.

457
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,530
Take care of yourself.

458
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,580
I'm leaving.

459
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,060
I heard many women were fighting over it,

460
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,490
and it was eventually taken away by a noble man.

461
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,150
I didn't think it would be you.

462
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,570
I didn't take it.

463
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,860
Then why do you have it?

464
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,410
Someone heard that I'm good at medicine,

465
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,360
so he came to seek consultation.

466
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,990
This is a gift from that patient

467
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,120
after treating him.

468
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,280
So, who gave you this present?

469
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,070
This is meant to be given

470
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,190
to one's beloved.

471
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,910
Is that guy surnamed Yuan

472
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,930
harassing you again?

473
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,960
I'll get even with him for you.

474
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,690
It's not him.

475
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,520
Don't worry.

476
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,220
No one can harass me.

477
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,980
This patient...

478
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,960
simply considers this as a token of appreciation.

479
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,950
He didn't know

480
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,610
it's meant for one's beloved.

481
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,190
By the way,

482
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,280
Young Lord Yin's movements remain mysterious.

483
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,740
I’ll meet him again today.

484
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,550
No need.

485
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,460
W-Why?

486
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,520
Don't worry about it for now.

487
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,920
I'll tell you more

488
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,420
once I've figured it out.

489
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,030
Ask no more.

490
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,980
Leave it for now.

491
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,830
Go back and rest.

492
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,820
Go.

493
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,130
Go back.

494
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,390
What's the matter?

495
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,850
Young Lord.

496
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,900
Did the fish scale last night

497
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,630
help you further

498
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,150
your relationship

499
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,680
with Bloody-handed Asura?

500
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,090
I've got nothing to say to you.

501
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,390
You're on your own.

502
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,030
Yes, yes.

503
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,480
If you need anything,

504
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,350
I’m at your command,

505
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,540
and I'll do anything you say.

506
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,460
Get going.

507
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,940
Young Lord.

508
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,040
I'll leave now.

509
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,210
So he was the one who gave

510
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,570
Nan Yan the fish scale.

511
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,190
But this voice is clearly...

512
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,830
[Heavenly No. 3]

513
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,600
Ji Yang?

514
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,090
Who is it?

515
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:53,969
Young Lord.

516
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,239
What's up?

517
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,790
Let me ask you.

518
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,110
Why did you ask about how

519
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,070
my relationship is going with Bloody-handed Asura?

520
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,110
Young Lord.

521
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,200
I'm your man now.

522
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,120
Naturally, I'll be right behind you,

523
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,250
aligning with your thoughts

524
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,140
and worrying about you.

525
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,260
Well... how will you know

526
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,920
what sort of worries I have?

527
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,520
Of course I'll know.

528
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,400
That'll definitely be how

529
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,750
you can take down this lady.

530
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,410
Young Lord.

531
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,270
I’ve been thinking

532
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,860
about this all day long.

533
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,400
I have three good ideas.

534
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,430
Firstly—

535
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,250
You're incorrigible!

536
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:33,870
I think

537
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,880
you are thinking for yourself.

538
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,160
How could you say that?

539
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,340
I'm a loyal follower of yours.

540
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,830
Now matter how beautiful

541
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,530
that Bloody-handed Asura is,

542
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,200
I wouldn't dare to seek death myself, would I?

543
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,760
You said you were loyal.

544
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,530
Then you should know

545
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,350
how to show your loyalty, right?

546
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,550
Young Lord,

547
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,780
my life

548
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,870
and the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

549
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,470
are in your hands.

550
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,310
Now,

551
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,710
I can't turn back either.

552
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,570
You can't leave me behind.

553
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,460
Young Lord!

554
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,820
You're really... a loyal man.

555
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,930
Did he get addicted to hitting me now?

556
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,230
What's wrong?

557
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,830
Why do you look so flustered?

558
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,150
The captain is dead.

559
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,890
When?

560
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,240
You're asking me? Don't you know?

561
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,020
I...

562
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,570
The man called Yin

563
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,830
looks just like Ji Yang.

564
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,090
Why didn't you tell me?

565
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,820
He's not Ji Yang.

566
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,770
There's no trace

567
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,320
of Ji Yang in his demeanour.

568
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,490
Since Ji Yang returned alive at Filth Valley,

569
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,570
he had lost his memory.

570
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,570
Memory loss?

571
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,750
What a low excuse that is.

572
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,360
What if he's some devil

573
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,070
who casted an illusion

574
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,870
and turned into Ji Yang

575
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,870
just to trick you?

576
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,430
Yan.

577
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,620
Ji Yang is dead.

578
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,720
He died in Filth Valley.

579
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,030
He is Ji Yang.

580
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,040
If he was Ji Yang,

581
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,580
would he kill innocent people?

582
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,240
Will Ji Yang kill the captain?

583
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,760
The captain was killed by Ji Yang?

584
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,710
I saw it with my own eyes.

585
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,600
After Ji Yang

586
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,810
entered the captain's quarters,

587
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,310
the captain died.

588
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,040
That's impossible.

589
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,080
It's impossible.

590
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,370
Fine.

591
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,590
The Blood Phoenix Hairpin which Lunar Sect had lost

592
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,220
is now in his hands.

593
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,550
How do you explain that?

594
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,230
We chased the murderer from Lunar Sect

595
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,750
all the way to this whaleboat.

596
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,550
Are you going to forget

597
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,910
the purpose of our trip

598
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,630
because

599
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,090
he looks just like Ji Yang?

600
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,540
You are saying the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

601
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,710
is in his hands?

602
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,430
This is a serious matter.

603
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,970
Before the truth is revealed,

604
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
we mustn't reveal his demonic aura.

605
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:28,950
Little Fox,

606
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:29,960
please trust me.

607
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,740
He is Ji Yang.
