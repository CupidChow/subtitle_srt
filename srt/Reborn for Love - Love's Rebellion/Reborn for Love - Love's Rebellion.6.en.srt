[Love's Rebellion]

00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,630
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,310
They're all dead.

5
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,380
Ji Yang.

6
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,150
How are you?

7
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,710
I...

8
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,650
Don't talk.

9
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,070
Here.

10
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,910
Open your mouth.

11
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,190
Swallow it.

12
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,750
Yes.

13
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,470
How is it?

14
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,860
You're awake.

15
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,850
How do you feel?

16
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,240
I'm fine.

17
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,190
Let me see.

18
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,030
I'm fine.

19
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,350
Don't worry. I'm fine.

20
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,650
I'm really fine.

21
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,810
Don't talk.

22
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,030
It seems you're okay now.

23
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,350
Turns out that the Spirit Thorn Grass is really effective.

24
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,960
Didn't I ask you to leave first?

25
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,440
Why did you come back?

26
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,480
My Lord, since you were afraid of implicating me,

27
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,630
I had to be more sensible, too.

28
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,150
So, I went for a walk

29
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,980
and saw

30
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,510
if I could obtain some raw material on the spot

31
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,630
to save your life while I was at it.

32
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,390
Thank you, Doctor, for not giving me up.

33
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,670
Is this your so-called "obtaining raw material

34
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,470
on the spot"?

35
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,590
It's just a scratch.

36
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,280
It's okay.

37
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,920
I'll just apply some ointment after I'm back.

38
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,590
Give me your hand.

39
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,550
So ugly!

40
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,070
My Lord.

41
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:49,970
Have a seat.

42
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,210
This is called a bronze cauldron hotpot.

43
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,350
My mother used to go out to play mahjong.

44
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,190
She often came back late at night.

45
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,150
She'd ask me to cook supper for her if she was hungry.

46
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,710
This was her favorite.

47
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,420
Here, My Lord.

48
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,390
Try it.

49
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,270
See how it tastes.

50
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,580
What?

51
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,490
Are you afraid I'll poison you?

52
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,320
Do you know?

53
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,830
When you need my help,

54
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,630
although you didn't say it,

55
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,230
it's all written in the dish.

56
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,990
Is it?

57
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,330
Is it good?

58
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,100
Not bad.

59
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,430
At least it's better than the pickled raw snake heads

60
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,890
and the stir-fried snake hearts you cooked.

61
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,270
During this period,

62
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,420
we have

63
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,880
supported each other.

64
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,010
I didn't mistreat, right?

65
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,960
Well,

66
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,190
I have a favor to ask.

67
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,830
It's not too much, right?

68
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,480
Let me guess.

69
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,670
There are only two things you'd ask me to do:

70
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,870
testing the medicine

71
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,300
or breaking the curse.

72
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,150
As for testing the medicine,

73
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,630
considering your filial piety to your mother

74
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,600
and

75
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,590
the medicine for heart disease

76
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,640
works for me,

77
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,990
I won't mind it.

78
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,540
Then...

79
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,190
Then...

80
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,930
breaking the curse is…

81
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,160
out of the question.

82
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,990
When it comes to a favor,

83
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,720
it's all about mutual consent.

84
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,960
No matter what,

85
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,750
I saved your life today.

86
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,950
You rejected me so stiffly.

87
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,000
That hurts my feelings so much.

88
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,710
What feelings do you have

89
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,770
towards me?

90
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,150
We...

91
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,790
Us…

92
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,350
The feelings that a doctor has towards a patient.

93
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,950
Why did I waste my energy to make the bronze cauldron hotpot?

94
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,840
He only deserves the steamed nux vomica

95
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,640
and the heartbreak grass salad.

96
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,360
A man and a woman stay in the same room.

97
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,660
They must be very close.

98
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,410
That's much easier, then.

99
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,480
Time for breakfast.

100
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,510
How is it?

101
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,190
Eat.

102
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,570
Do you have no appetite?

103
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,950
Not bad.

104
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,830
Not bad.

105
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,550
That means you're not satisfied.

106
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,910
Tell me what you want to eat.

107
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,040
I'll make it for you.

108
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,080
Meat. Better to be drumsticks.

109
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,850
And I'd like a pot of good wine.

110
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,720
Didn't you say

111
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,270
you wanted to have a light diet?

112
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,000
Last night,

113
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,590
we just had a bronze cauldron hotpot.

114
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,630
It's early in the morning.

115
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,910
Shouldn't you have some

116
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,830
congee and pickles

117
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,960
to clear your belly?

118
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,550
That makes sense.

119
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,580
Eat.

120
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,440
Eat more of this.

121
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,550
Where are you?

122
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,240
Why are you sitting here?

123
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,340
Come here.

124
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,510
Drink with me.

125
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,110
What?

126
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,990
Are you insane? It's early in the morning!

127
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,670
How about this?

128
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,310
Let my buddy

129
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,440
eat with me.

130
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,610
He's sick.

131
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,640
You can't eat it.

132
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,180
It doesn't matter to have one or two bites.

133
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,270
The drumsticks are greasy.

134
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,670
One bite will shorten your life by two days.

135
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,100
As the saying goes,

136
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,570
"Drink today if there's wine;

137
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,830
let tomorrow's worries be dealt with tomorrow."

138
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,830
Even if the drumsticks are so greasy

139
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,790
that they shorten your life, it doesn't matter.

140
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,350
Eat, bro.

141
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,370
I support you.

142
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,320
He's right.

143
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,230
It doesn't matter to have a few bites.

144
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,620
You can eat as much as you want today.

145
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,120
I'll help you

146
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,350
heat up the rice wine.

147
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,910
It's autumn. You can drink some wine

148
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,170
to warm yourselves up.

149
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,550
Ji,

150
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,300
do you know

151
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,040
why I'm so happy?

152
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,320
Why?

153
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,510
Yesterday,

154
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,720
at the market,

155
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,670
I was so close…

156
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,560
I was so close

157
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,540
to meeting Shao Cang!

158
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,450
Shao Cang?

159
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,590
And I made a great contribution.

160
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,370
I've done him a huge favor!

161
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,960
If it weren't for me,

162
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,800
he might

163
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,360
have been taken away by that pig

164
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,750
from the Great Path Sect.

165
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,430
Really?

166
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,310
Really!

167
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,910
I know

168
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,230
you must be

169
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,030
envious of me.

170
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,510
You want to protect Shao Cang

171
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,670
like me.

172
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,720
It's just that

173
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,710
you're sick

174
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,760
and hiding here.

175
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,430
It's inconvenient for you to show up.

176
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,510
But it's okay.

177
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,590
Once I have good news,

178
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,110
I will come and tell you immediately.

179
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,660
Here, bro.

180
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,490
How about this?

181
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,870
When your heart disease recovers,

182
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,270
and you don't have to hide in the Lunar Sect,

183
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,150
at that time, we can achieve

184
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,550
something big together!

185
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,190
Cheers!

186
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,190
Here.

187
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,690
Ji, what…

188
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,580
What?

189
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,330
Are you allergic to alcohol?

190
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,240
He's not Ji Yang.

191
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,890
Who is he, then?

192
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,860
I poisoned the wine.

193
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,540
Soon,

194
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,190
he will show his true colors.

195
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,470
Goodness!

196
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,190
He really shows his true colors!

197
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,730
It was just a metaphor!

198
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,760
Fox spirit! He's a fox spirit!

199
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,510
That's not right.

200
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,030
Aren't all fox spirits locked up

201
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,790
in the Spirit-Sealing Formation

202
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,790
in Nancang by the Great Path Sect?

203
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,840
How come there's

204
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,490
another escaped fox here?

205
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,210
It's you!

206
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,410
You know him, too?

207
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,220
S-Sister.

208
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,720
Please spare me.

209
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,590
I tried all the poisons in the world,

210
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,390
but I've never studied spirits.

211
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,840
I wonder if a little fox

212
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,510
has something that I can use

213
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,670
to make medicine?

214
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,980
I've heard

215
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,030
that spirits who have gained human forms

216
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,170
all have an Internal Elixir inside.

217
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,230
And their spiritual power

218
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,280
is all tied to it.

219
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,240
Wait.

220
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,260
What do you want?

221
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,220
What do we want?

222
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,920
Cut you open and get the elixir.

223
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,400
Senior.

224
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,350
What delicious food did you make

225
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,610
for Junior Meng again?

226
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,800
Get lost.

227
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,530
Did she shut you out again?

228
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,000
I found

229
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,110
you're just like a toad on people's feet—

230
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,550
you do no harm but disgust others, right?

231
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,110
Toad?

232
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,770
Are you the only one who knows?

233
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,570
What kind of poison did that Poisoner

234
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,230
give Yingying?

235
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,440
Why does she

236
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,070
always take her side lately?

237
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,310
Senior,

238
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,110
why don't we go to the chief

239
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,990
and tell on her?

240
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,030
Good idea.

241
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,510
You think our chief

242
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,170
is not annoyed with me enough?

243
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,190
He obviously

244
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,190
takes the side of that poisoner.

245
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,070
Can't you see?

246
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,560
We need to find

247
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,610
her weakness first.

248
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,410
Her weakness?

249
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,240
Wait.

250
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,650
What's wrong?

251
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,240
The spirit aura?

252
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,440
The spirit aura?

253
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,950
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

254
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,089
Trying to escape?

255
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,880
You evil thing!

256
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,390
Indeed, you are a spirit.

257
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,589
Nan Yan.

258
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,250
You are very bold.

259
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,280
How dare you harbor a spirit?

260
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,750
Senior Fu Lang,

261
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,680
you're really labeling me at will.

262
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,770
You're caught red-handed. How dare you deny it?

263
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,250
What are you looking at? Go after him!

264
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,940
Let me out!

265
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,410
Let me out!

266
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,440
Little brat,

267
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,800
I finally caught you.

268
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,310
Try to run again, will you?

269
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,320
In the Lunar Sect,

270
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,650
I could catch you with my eyes closed

271
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,850
and solely by your smell. Stop running!

272
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,080
I'll flick you on the forehead!

273
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,360
He's pretty strong.

274
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,590
Let me out!

275
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,470
Stop struggling.

276
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,020
This is the Deity Binding Bag.

277
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,470
You can't break it

278
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,670
if your cultivation hasn't reached the Yuanying Soul Realm.

279
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,790
After I hand you over to the Great Path Sect

280
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,520
and lock you up in the Spirit-Sealing Formation,

281
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,510
I might be able to contribute

282
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,390
to our Lunar Sect.

283
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,110
Yes.

284
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,480
Give it back.

285
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,080
I found him first.

286
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,310
That's right, Senior.

287
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,390
You can't do this.

288
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,390
You intercepted it,

289
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,720
and you even accused us.

290
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,850
You harbored a spirit. How could you defend yourselves?

291
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:51,960
Senior,

292
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,790
don't accuse an innocent person.

293
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,080
This fox had the audacity

294
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,790
to barge into my yard to steal stuff.

295
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,310
Today,

296
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,870
I must teach him a lesson.

297
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,810
After I slit him open and take the elixir out,

298
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,680
I'll give him back to you.

299
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,710
It's not too late to give him to the Great Path Sect by then.

300
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,470
Stop acting.

301
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,950
You poisoner, you concealed a spirit

302
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,110
and hurt people maliciously.

303
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,990
After I hand this beast

304
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,250
to the Great Path Sect,

305
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,520
I'll punish you, too.

306
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,310
Arrest her!

307
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,740
Who dares?

308
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,510
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

309
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,440
How dare you!

310
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,420
Chief.

311
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,390
Chief.

312
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,110
Nan Yan was bold enough to harbor a spirit

313
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,950
and ordered that beast to hurt people in secret,

314
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,780
causing trouble to our sect.

315
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,930
You really have a way with lies!

316
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,390
You don't admit it, do you?

317
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,070
It's okay.

318
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,400
I have a witness.

319
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,590
Chu Jing.

320
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,550
Tell Chief the whole story.

321
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,230
Are you done talking?

322
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,110
Go and do your homework.

323
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,760
How many times have I told you?

324
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,590
Don't sit if you can lie down.

325
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,150
Read more and fight less!

326
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,190
Chief,

327
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,110
Nan Yan went in my way several times.

328
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,160
She was so afraid that I'd hand this beast

329
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,030
to the Great Path Sect.

330
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,690
She must be up to something there.

331
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,690
Please investigate it, Chief.

332
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,410
Stop slandering people.

333
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,590
Why did you go in his way?

334
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,570
Chief, you're wise.

335
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,270
This fox stole my stuff.

336
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,830
I just wanted to slit him up to get the elixir to make medicine

337
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,730
and teach him a lesson.

338
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,210
How dare you still deny it?

339
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,230
Shut up!

340
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,170
The fox spirit sneaked into the Lunar Sect

341
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,630
with unknown intentions.

342
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,710
I have to interrogate him in person

343
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,810
before making a decision.

344
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,120
Master.

345
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
The water of Soul River is ice-cold.

346
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,620
The Candlelight Beetles nibble one's bones.

347
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,680
Yes.

348
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,730
Master, I wanted nothing but to surpass you,

349
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,580
so I made a mistake.

350
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,960
Shao Cang.

351
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,120
If you plead guilty,

352
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,190
you must hand over the Internal Elixir you cultivated

353
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,030
and be dethroned from the position as the monarch

354
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,890
and put in the underwater prison.

355
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
The water of Soul River is ice-cold.

356
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,230
The Candlelight Beetles nibble one's bones.

357
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,230
Have you really thought it through?

358
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,470
I…

359
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,060
plead guilty.

360
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,550
Master,

361
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,840
even if you are completely disappointed,

362
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,580
I hope you can listen to me

363
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,790
when you see me

364
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,570
next time.

365
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,470
Did he hurt you just now?

366
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,670
If he's capable of that,

367
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,550
I might think a little highly of him.

368
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,280
Don't worry.

369
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,200
But why

370
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,870
haven't we seen Ji all along?

371
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,150
Otherwise, we wouldn't have been

372
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,190
tricked by the transformation magic

373
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,270
of that stinky fox.

374
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,030
Where did he go today?

375
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,200
He didn't even have breakfast.

376
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,990
Did he go out and fight with others

377
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,250
with an empty stomach?

378
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,350
You evil spirit, why did you mix

379
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,950
in our Lunar Sect?

380
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,550
It's because of this place's excellent feng shui

381
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,390
and good food.

382
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,470
The Great Path Sect claims they are

383
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,550
in charge of education all over the world.

384
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,210
They like rebellious spirits

385
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,620
like you the best.

386
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,750
I'll go down the mountain

387
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,720
and hand you over to them in person.

388
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,880
It seems that you won't let me stay.

389
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,610
Then, I can only expose the scandal

390
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,620
of the Lunar Sect

391
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,390
while I go down the mountain.

392
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,140
The Lunar Sect has always been indifferent to fame and fortune.

393
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,670
We're known as upright cultivators.

394
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,950
What scandal do we have?

395
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,790
What a joke!

396
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,150
I've been wandering around the market lately.

397
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,380
I found that among the spiritual treasures

398
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,180
that the Treasure Pavilion was selling secretly,

399
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,450
many had the inscriptions of the Lunar Sect.

400
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,310
If I guessed right,

401
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,290
you took it to pay the gambling debt, right?

402
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,440
Nonsense!

403
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,890
It's not true!

404
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,190
True

405
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,510
or not,

406
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,470
it depends on whether you

407
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,200
will keep me for a few more days.

408
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,570
The Lunar Sect is weak and powerless.

409
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,110
If the Great Path Sect finds out

410
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,150
that we harbored a spirit,

411
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,010
I can't take the responsibility.

412
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,400
Don't worry, Chief.

413
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,870
Making things easier for others also makes things easier for myself.

414
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,670
Once the Filth Valley opens,

415
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,670
I'll leave immediately.

416
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,510
I will never cause any trouble

417
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,550
to the Lunar Sect.

418
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,950
What do you think?

419
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,550
Deal.

420
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,450
But...

421
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,550
But what?

422
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,170
From now on,

423
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,950
you have to

424
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,030
take charge of cleaning in our sect.

425
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,060
Cleaning?

426
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,650
Yes.

427
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,510
You suddenly start to stay here,

428
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,710
so there has to be an explanation.

429
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,910
I will announce

430
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,040
that you are being punished here

431
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,070
for trespassing our sect.

432
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,830
In this way,

433
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,110
your stay will be perfectly justifiable.

434
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,550
There's no need for you to hide.

435
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,250
Of course,

436
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,670
if you don't want to clean…

437
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,550
No problem.

438
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,030
Only…

439
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,770
we need to put it in writing.

440
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,700
What do you mean?

441
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,550
To make medicine.

442
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,710
I finally caught you.

443
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,370
Try to run again, will you?

444
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,520
One more thing.

445
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,940
No one can hurt me.

446
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,520
As you wish.

447
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,370
[Whoever violates this order will be expelled from the sect]

448
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,370
[The person who holds this document can move freely in the Lunar Sect]
[No disciples can hurt him under any excuses]

449
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,300
Thank you, Chief.

450
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,520
Selling the artifacts of the sect?

451
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,190
You think you can scare me

452
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,080
with such a trivial thing?

453
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,580
I heard that the fox clan

454
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,790
has the ability to attract money.

455
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,190
Their nickname is Home-Protecting Immortals.

456
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,190
Now that the Lunar Sect

457
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,250
has a beautiful fox

458
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,910
like you as a protective talisman,

459
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,130
I will have a great hand

460
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,650
when I play mahjong today.

461
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,710
Why isn't he back yet?

462
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,870
The dishes are getting cold.

463
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,190
Sister,

464
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,000
you are

465
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,950
too defensive.

466
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,530
You made me suffer twice.

467
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,070
This time,

468
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,470
you finally fell into my hands.

469
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,210
Give me your silver mermaid pearl.

470
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,200
Why did you ruin my plan?

471
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,570
On the count of three,

472
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,390
remove your illusion curse.

473
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,190
Otherwise,

474
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,590
I'll chop off one of your tails

475
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,920
every minute you delay.

476
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,150
What's the rush?

477
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,820
Could it be that

478
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,430
you also want her treasure?

479
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,390
Two.

480
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,190
One.

481
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,360
Are you serious?

482
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,170
I did as you said.

483
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,800
If you hurt me again,

484
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,200
I'll expose the secret

485
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,510
of you hiding here.

486
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,190
Do you know who I am?

487
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,670
A sick man who acts at will

488
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,950
just because he has some spiritual power.

489
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,280
I don't care who you are.

490
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,980
Let me remind you.

491
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,330
Stay away from her.

492
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,750
Otherwise,

493
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,950
I'll kill you.

494
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,100
Who is she to you?

495
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,690
Why do you care so much?

496
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,190
I think

497
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,270
you have an ulterior motive for her.

498
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,200
You are not saying anything.

499
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,060
So, you two have no relationship.

500
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,830
Then, why are you still staying by her side?

501
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,250
Are you doing it

502
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,910
for the silver mermaid pearl, just like me?

503
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,750
Then, let's

504
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,210
get straight to the point.

505
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,870
It turns out that he didn't leave

506
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,870
and protected me

507
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,250
just to get my mermaid pearl.

508
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,200
Let me remind you again.

509
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,850
Don't dream of getting

510
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,850
the silver mermaid pearl.

511
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,080
Listen.

512
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:01,750
Don't scare me

513
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,750
with that.

514
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,030
I'm now

515
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,230
Chief's Home-Protecting Immortals.

516
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,270
If anything happens...

517
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:06,870
Stop!

518
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,310
Did Mr. Meng ask you to stay?

519
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,310
Yes.

520
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,830
[Whoever violates this order will be expelled from the sect]

521
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,830
[The person who holds this document can move freely in the Lunar Sect]
[No disciples can hurt him under any excuses]

522
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,030
This is the document

523
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,350
written by Mr. Meng himself.

524
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,480
He allows me to stay here for a few days.

525
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,990
No one can hurt me.

526
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,550
Nan Yan,

527
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,450
this fox is cunning…

528
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,250
Did Chief arrange a room for you?

529
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,530
He said

530
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,580
I'm just a fox.

531
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,800
I can just sleep

532
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,680
in the bushes or along the wall.

533
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,710
I can just make do with it.

534
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,670
Unfortunately,

535
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,270
my room

536
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,550
is small.

537
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,320
It's hard to turn around with one more person.

538
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,240
What do you mean?

539
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,710
I think your illness

540
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,810
is getting better.

541
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:07,740
How about

542
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,110
you make room for him?

543
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,210
You're asking me to leave?

544
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,170
I'm sorry, Brother.

545
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,750
I'm endangered, after all.

546
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,710
Is it okay?

547
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,880
Why don't you follow the rules,

548
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,950
you sickly wretch?

549
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,950
Take your document and get lost!

550
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,950
What's wrong with your hand?

551
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,710
It hurts.

552
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,400
Come with me.

553
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,500
Nan Yan, this fox...

554
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,430
Treating him is more important.

555
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,990
Come on.

556
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,100
Sister,

557
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,130
do you really agree to let me stay?

558
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,270
It's okay for you to stay,

559
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,160
but

560
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,190
you have to tell me the truth.

561
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,250
Why did you sneak into the Lunar Sect?

562
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,690
To get your silver mermaid pearl.

563
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,970
You're honest enough.

564
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,590
Since I decided to stay,

565
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,070
we should trust each other.

566
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,190
If you don't know me well,

567
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,320
how can you trust me?

568
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,010
Then, why do you want my pearl?

569
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,260
You might not believe me if I tell you.

570
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,650
I steal it

571
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,850
to remember someone by looking at it.

572
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,070
Who?

573
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,130
My parents died young.

574
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,230
I was raised

575
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,510
by my sister.

576
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,070
But now,

577
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,430
she's locked up in the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

578
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,150
We haven't seen each other

579
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:39,990
for 100 years.

580
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,030
I got a glimpse of your pearl

581
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,290
that day at the market.

582
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,970
I felt a sense of closeness

583
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,390
because

584
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,270
my sister has

585
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,570
a silver mermaid pearl exactly the same.

586
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,000
Then, why did you disguise yourself as someone else?

587
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,670
I failed to steal your pearl last time,

588
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,110
so I knew you were very vigilant.

589
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,970
Of course I needed to find some other reliable ways.

590
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,670
When I was outside the courtyard that day,

591
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,200
I saw him

592
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,590
leave your room.

593
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,830
I thought

594
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,270
that a man and a woman were in the same room,

595
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,590
so you two must be very close.

596
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,929
Who is close to him?

597
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,929
He's just a medicine tester.

598
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,139
He's no different from

599
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,190
the buffalo called Strong

600
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,110
at the gate.

601
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,020
Okay.

602
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,460
He is whatever

603
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,909
you say he is.

604
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:31,880
By the way,

605
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,030
my mother gave me the pearl.

606
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,790
I will never give it to anyone else.

607
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,230
You'd better give up.

608
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,810
Just stay here.

609
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:41,949
Whenever you miss your sister,

610
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,389
come and look at my pearl.

611
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,570
Remember.

612
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,989
Just look at it.

613
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,159
Don't try anything stupid.

614
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,790
My needle has no eyes.

615
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,110
But the needle does have an eye.

616
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,969
The needle eye.

617
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,250
How dare you talk back?

618
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,270
I dare not.

619
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,030
Let me make it clear beforehand.

620
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,750
About that guy

621
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,280
who is staying downstairs,

622
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,070
you must not

623
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,220
tell anyone.

624
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,350
Otherwise…

625
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,230
The bottles on the table...

626
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,280
Do you see them?

627
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,670
Pick one.

628
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:19,870
Sister,

629
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,190
didn't you want to

630
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,230
kick him out?

631
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,480
It's easy.

632
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,310
I'll go

633
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,910
and report to Mr. Meng later.

634
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,740
It's for your own good.

635
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,670
Have you heard of the saying?

636
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,510
Those who are barefoot have nothing to lose, so they aren't afraid of anyone.

637
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,710
He's terminally ill.

638
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,860
He's dying.

639
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,990
If he really gets kicked out of the sect,

640
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,430
he will wait for you at the foot of the mountain.

641
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,830
He'll try to kill you every time he sees you.

642
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,700
What a fraudulent place this is.

643
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,010
One is a vicious woman,

644
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,200
and the other is a dying desperado.

645
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,500
Why is there no normal person here?

646
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,200
Don't worry.

647
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,680
I won't say a word.

648
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,340
Sister,

649
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,280
I was tossed about

650
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,680
like a ball just now.

651
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,870
I threw out

652
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,220
all the delicious food.

653
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,570
I'm starving now.

654
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,950
Can you give me some food?

655
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,880
You disguised yourself as someone else

656
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,590
to trick me.

657
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,730
You deserve it.

658
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,070
Sister, you are beautiful and kind.

659
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,470
Just pity me.

660
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,710
You want to eat, right?

661
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,700
Did you see

662
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,510
the bucket of roc droppings?

663
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,020
Bring it here first.

664
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,150
Do you eat that?

665
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,810
Hurry up.

666
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,800
In my place,

667
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,230
you have to follow my rules.

668
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,110
You want to eat?

669
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,630
Finish the work first.

670
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,070
We're both staying here temporarily.

671
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,600
Why doesn't he need to work?

672
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,540
He's terminally ill.

673
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,310
Already halfway to the grave.

674
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,590
He's not smart, either.

675
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,030
He can't do these things.

676
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,520
But he can't live here for free.

677
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,530
Then what?

678
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,030
How about I prick you with the needle

679
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,750
and make you half-paralyzed, too?

680
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,320
Then you can also live here for free.

681
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,070
Okay?

682
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,970
Forget it.

683
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,800
Get to work.

684
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,110
Pick the ones on the left.

685
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,310
Okay, Sister.

686
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,540
Sister.

687
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,670
What is the effect

688
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,590
of this fruit?

689
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,060
It can be put into the medicine to save people's lives.

690
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,630
Got it.

691
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,630
Sister.

692
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,380
I'll take them with caution.

693
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,230
I won't cause you

694
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,020
any trouble.

695
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,190
You're sensible.

696
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,410
What's wrong?

697
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,620
It hurts.

698
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,770
Why are you so careless?

699
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,580
Let me see.

700
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,130
You hurt your hand again?

701
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,310
When will you start cooking today?

702
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,620
It's still early.

703
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,480
I haven't finished my work yet!

704
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:32,730
Then...

705
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,350
I'll do it.

706
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,040
No need!

707
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,590
I'll go cook then.

708
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,890
What kind of heat should I use?

709
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,030
You...

710
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,390
Don't touch my stove!

711
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,370
Let me supervise the work for you.

712
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,110
Sister.

713
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,430
You won't leave me

714
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,290
here, will you?

715
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,550
I...

716
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,640
I can cook.

717
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:06,910
But

718
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,190
don't hurt him.

719
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,380
I'm not afraid of him.

720
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,610
I pity him for not being able to live long,

721
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,340
so I won't bother with him.

722
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,230
Really?

723
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,120
I promise I won't bury you

724
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,580
before sunset.

725
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,840
I promise

726
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,550
you can live until sunset.
