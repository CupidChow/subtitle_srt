00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,700
Let's go.

6
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,990
If we don't go back to celebrate the festival,

7
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,650
Yingying will complain to me.

8
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,480
Young Lord,

9
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,240
remember to give the thing to her.

10
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,720
Okay.

11
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,460
What is it?

12
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,300
Your mom left this to you.

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,280
The chief

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,680
found it when he was organizing the relics.

15
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,220
Yan,

16
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,600
I'm afraid I have to go travel around the world

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,940
before you do.

18
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,340
I've never given you

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,930
luxury and happiness,

20
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,800
but you

21
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,920
gave me so much.

22
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,960
I'm afraid

23
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,980
I can't repay you.

24
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,870
Fortunately, you have someone

25
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,530
who treats you sincerely now.

26
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,570
I can finally leave in peace.

27
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,150
By the way,

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,690
I left you a gift under the peach blossom tree.

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,970
When you get married,

30
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,530
you'll need it.

Where have you been?

38
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,020
I brought you mooncakes.

39
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
It's multigrain.

40
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,160
So you went on a date

41
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,570
with Yan?

42
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,160
And she gave you the silver mermaid pearl!

43
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,100
She treats you so much better than she treats me.

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,120
Since she is so infatuated with you,

45
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,260
My Lord,

46
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,550
you can’t let her down.

47
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,810
Why don't you two get together?

48
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,350
After I get

49
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,870
the Seven Sins Manual,

50
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,430
I'll also

51
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,650
help avenge you.

In this way,

53
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,750
I'll kill two birds with one stone.

54
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,690
Isn't that wonderful?

55
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,770
My Lord,

56
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,350
don't be angry.

57
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,400
Don't be angry.

58
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,220
You'll enter the Filth Valley tomorrow.

59
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:54,990
People from the Great Path

60
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,510
will definitely wait for you there.

61
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,670
It happens that the fox clan

62
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,630
has a charm spell

63
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,390
that can help you,

64
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,200
My Lord.

65
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,390
Cut the crap.

66
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,680
If you're not useful,

67
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,680
why would I spare your life?

68
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,370
Get to the point.

69
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,880
After the charm spell is cast,

70
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,480
even if you still look the same

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,550
and your clothes are still the same,

72
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,640
they will only see

73
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,110
the most beautiful women.

74
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,040
No matter how sharp their eyes are,

75
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,740
they won't be able to

76
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,880
recognize you.

77
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,990
They'll only be mesmerized

78
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,150
by your beauty.

79
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,270
In this way,

80
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,430
you can deceive them all

81
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,360
and go straight into Filth Valley.

82
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,000
Really?

83
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,920
Of course.

84
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,230
If they don't fall for you,

85
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,690
I'll take on your surname.

86
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,280
Slowly.

87
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,270
Be careful.

88
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,540
Get away!

89
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,700
Nan Yan,

90
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,560
looks like I'll have to break my promise.

91
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,100
You have to go to Filth Valley alone.

92
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,090
Father.

93
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,920
My dear son,

94
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,710
I missed you so much.

95
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,000
I missed you too.

96
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,500
Then come home with me.

97
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,310
Father, let's talk on the side.

98
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,570
Let's talk on the side.

99
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,730
Wait for me.

100
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,790
You can't walk like this.

101
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,910
What if they find out?

102
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,310
You have to learn from me.

103
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,630
Chin up, chest out.

104
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,350
Suck in your stomach and sway your hips.

105
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,710
Go.

106
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,800
Watch your head.

107
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,270
You're a beauty now,

108
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,030
not a grumpy woman.

109
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,830
Can your expression not be so grumpy?

110
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,120
Don't push your luck.

111
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,110
If they find out,

112
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,750
everything will be in vain.

113
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,340
Come.

114
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,299
Chin up, chest out.

115
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,630
Sway your hips and go.

116
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:44,910
Do you have a misunderstanding

117
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,240
about beautiful girls?

118
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,190
That's because you only care about

119
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,110
Nan Yan.

120
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,230
Of course you don't understand

121
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,360
the beauty of charm.

122
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,910
But your seniors and juniors

123
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,910
are all bumpkins.

124
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,740
The beauty in their hearts...

125
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,710
Is someone like me.

126
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,530
Come, I'll lead you.

127
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,060
Chin up,

128
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,070
chest out.

129
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,660
Don't be shy,

130
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,380
especially in front of your junior.

131
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,550
Let's go.

132
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,860
Father,

133
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,840
I finally found

134
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,110
bosom friends.

135
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,190
How can I leave

136
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,300
and abandon them?

137
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,830
So you have the nerve to leave

138
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,480
and abandon your father?

139
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,830
If you don't force me

140
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,640
to play with swords,

141
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,570
I can consider going back with you.

142
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,920
Zhanting,

143
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,050
you are the Young Dragon Lord.

144
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,110
You play around with books all day

145
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,090
instead of practicing.

146
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,070
And now, you've come

147
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,710
to the barren North

148
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,790
to be a wandering poet.

149
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,990
This is so embarrassing

150
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,290
for me.

151
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,270
So I have to give up my dream

152
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,050
for your sake?

153
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,430
Inheriting your father's career is the way of nature.

154
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,470
You're the Young Dragon Lord.

155
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,670
This is your destiny.

156
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,400
You have no right to refuse.

157
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,640
My entire life,

158
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,190
you just keep repeating these two lines.

159
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,450
Aren't you tired of it?

160
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,440
You're becoming more and more unfilial.

161
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,340
Mr. Mu,

162
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,730
can I say something?

163
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,390
Who are you?

164
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm Nan Yan.

165
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,680
Greetings, Dragon Lord.

166
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,610
What do you want to say?

167
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,790
Dragon Lord,

168
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,460
in this world, no two people are the same,

169
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,090
and no two paths are identical.

170
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,920
When I went to school as a child,

171
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,600
I was despised by my teacher.

172
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,730
He said I was stupid.

173
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,840
At that time,

174
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,840
my mother told me

175
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,470
there are many paths

176
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,200
to choose from in this world.

177
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,350
There's no need to follow the flow

178
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,790
to recite the Three Character Classic

179
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,590
or Thousand Character Classic.

180
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,680
I think

181
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,440
I've heard these words before.

182
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,150
My mother knew

183
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,120
I liked to practice medicine and develop poisons,

184
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,920
so she invited

185
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,960
the best doctor

186
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,210
to teach me to distinguish herbs

187
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,780
and develop poisons with insects.

188
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,860
If my mother was like you

189
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,230
and forced me

190
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,690
to do what she liked

191
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,830
in the name

192
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,550
of inheriting my parent's career,

193
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,310
then I

194
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,280
would be destined to be useless

195
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,470
because I obviously can't compare

196
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,950
in the thing she likes.

197
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,900
Meanwhile, I would've given up

198
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,400
on the thing I liked.

199
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,780
Now,

200
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,700
my mother has passed away.

201
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,040
No matter what I want to say to her,

202
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,840
I don't have the chance anymore,

203
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,700
but you still have a lot of time.

204
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,320
There are no permanent grudges

205
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,720
between a father and son.

206
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,560
Just talk things out

207
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,610
and it'll be okay.

208
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,840
Believe it or not,

209
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,720
he seems angry with you,

210
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,510
but I can see that

211
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,750
in his heart,

212
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,990
he has always been proud of you.

213
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,270
How did you know?

214
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,500
I've never said that.

215
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,190
You're right.

216
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,980
I will

217
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,710
take this unfilial son

218
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,710
back to the Dragon Capital.

219
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,010
Let's talk openly

220
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,290
with each other.

221
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,190
I'm not going back.

222
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,850
I'm going to the Filth Valley.

223
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,470
Why are you going there?

224
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,270
To search for treasures?

225
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:57,750
Can't I build you

226
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,360
a Filth Valley in Dragon Capital?

227
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,070
No, Father.

228
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,280
My friend is sick.

229
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,070
I have to go to Filth Valley

230
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,110
to find a life-saving medicinal ingredient for him.

231
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,780
Medicine?

232
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,900
Big Brother,

233
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,150
why don't you stay?

234
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,300
I'll look for the Snow Branch myself.

235
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,310
Thank you, miss.

236
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,510
Isn't this

237
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,200
the boastful guy from the Great Path,

238
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,440
Elder Zhu?

239
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,430
Greetings, Dragon Lord.

240
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:31,950
Elder Zhu,

241
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,580
what do you mean by this?

242
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,260
Didn't you tell me

243
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,390
in the Street Market

244
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,350
you hate the East Sea's Dragon Capital

245
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,350
the most?

246
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,710
You even said my father

247
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,360
is extravagant, flamboyant,

248
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,220
and only knows how to make a scene.

249
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,150
Oh yes,

250
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,190
you also said

251
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,850
that even after 500 years,

252
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,230
he still won't qualify

253
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,150
to serve your premier.

254
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,660
Right?

255
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,680
When did I say that?

256
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,590
Hurry up. Stop looking.

257
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,620
Hurry up.

258
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,310
Dragon Lord, don’t listen to the slander.

259
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,970
I am an elder of the Great Path.

260
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,590
How could I say

261
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,780
such hurtful words?

262
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,130
Cut it out.

263
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,400
If you didn't say that,

264
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,410
my son wouldn't frame you.

265
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,210
Also,

266
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,060
what is wrong with

267
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,120
that Ying Zewei?

268
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,270
When it rains,

269
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,150
he has to collect basins of water

270
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,550
to wash his clothes with.

271
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,760
After he finishes,

272
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,320
he pours the water before other people's houses.

273
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,490
He's a dirty and greedy old man.

274
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,960
He's bad luck.

275
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,880
Premier is the head

276
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,750
of the cultivation realm's Five Elders.

277
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,810
Dragon Lord, please mind your words.

278
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,730
Mind what?

279
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,310
Let me tell you.

280
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,160
One day,

281
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,970
I will drive the whale boat

282
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,390
into the Soul River

283
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,390
of the Great Path.

284
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,550
The type of master determines

285
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,590
the type of dog.

286
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,210
Dragon Lord,

287
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,600
I'm afraid the Young Lord has entered the Filth Valley during the chaos.

288
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,930
Do you need me to send someone to chase him?

289
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,310
No need.

290
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,490
Just wait at the gate of Filth Valley.

291
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,280
Dragon Lord,

292
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,870
there are all sorts of people in Filth Valley.

293
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,910
Danger is everywhere.

294
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,550
Aren't you afraid

295
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,150
Young Lord will be in danger?

296
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,550
Isn't he going in to find

297
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,950
a medicinal ingredient?

298
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,190
It'll just be a small scuffle

299
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,720
at the gate of Filth Valley.

300
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,360
If he can't even get past

301
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,890
this small obstacle,

302
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,670
he doesn't deserve

303
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,470
to be my son.

304
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,430
No.

305
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,470
Chin up.

306
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,660
Chin up.

307
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,070
Chest out.

308
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,460
Move your hips.

309
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,050
Put your hands like this.

310
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,480
Good.

311
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:05,830
Stop!

312
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,440
What are you looking at?

313
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,590
You've never seen a pretty girl before?

314
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,390
Indeed, I've never seen

315
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,120
such a tall and beautiful girl.

316
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,240
Which sect are you from?

317
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,750
Filth Valley is a public hunting ground in the cultivation realm.

318
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,000
It opens once per year

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,020
on August 16.

320
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,430
All cultivators

321
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,070
can enter to search for treasures

322
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,730
no matter their backgrounds.

323
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,630
How come

324
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,090
it's become the Great Path's territory now?

325
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,050
A major criminal has escaped recently.

326
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,510
We are here to investigate

327
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,590
to ensure

328
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,490
the safety of other cultivators.

329
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,670
I see.

330
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,820
You must investigate thoroughly.

331
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,600
Great Mountain Sect?

332
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,470
Mo,

333
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,630
is there such a sect in the North?

334
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,290
I've never heard of it before.

335
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,010
You two sirs

336
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,099
are ignorant.

337
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,270
You haven't even heard of us,

338
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,829
the Great Mountain Double Lotus.

339
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,440
Great Mountain Double Lotus?

340
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,109
I am

341
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,089
the Great Mountain Sky Lotus.

342
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,250
I am

343
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,599
the Great Mountain Snow Lotus.

344
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,830
My sister and I form

345
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,040
the Great Mountain Double Lotus.

346
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,510
We're famous in the North.

347
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,110
I'm afraid the Great Path

348
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,150
is in the Middle City,

349
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,360
so you're far away

350
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,130
and get limited information.

351
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,320
This female cultivator doesn't talk much.

352
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,510
Could it be

353
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,540
you're a little nervous?

354
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,910
My sister doesn't like to get intimate with men.

355
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,720
Maybe you are

356
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,840
too manly

357
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,170
and this makes my sister uncomfortable.

358
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,790
Alright.

359
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,980
Welcome in.

360
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:31,840
Scout ahead.

361
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,510
Didn't we agree that after we get into the Filth Valley,

362
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,210
we'll rely on our own skills?

363
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,840
You are brave and invincible.

364
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,440
Is it necessary to use me

365
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,320
as your shield?

366
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,190
The fox clan is most sensitive to the smell

367
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,030
of Yin Zhu.

368
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,690
When we get inside,

369
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,710
I want you to lead me

370
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,440
straight to the nest of Yin Zhu.

371
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,290
No.

372
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,120
You—

373
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,030
You're a rogue.

374
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,160
Are you going or not?

375
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,990
Don’t worry, My Lord.

376
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,530
With the protection of the fox clan,

377
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,930
your wish will come true.

378
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,770
I thought the North was remote.

379
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:20,950
I didn't expect

380
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,440
the Dragon Lord to come here in person.

381
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,570
I'm really unlucky.

382
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,280
Elder,

383
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,200
we’ve checked the entrances

384
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,660
and didn't find Shao Cang.

385
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,990
The rebels are full of tricks.

386
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,890
Looks like he got in again.

387
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,690
Follow me in

388
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,310
to continue searching.

389
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,210
-Yes.
-Yes.

390
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,230
Yes, sir.

391
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,510
Where's Mo Xingzheng?

392
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,280
He was here just now.

393
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,280
It really is you.

394
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,470
I made it clear to you

395
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,350
last time.

396
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,330
Why don't you let go?

397
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,100
That day,

398
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,310
why did you show mercy?

399
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,950
You followed me all the way

400
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,350
just to ask this?

401
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,140
With your cultivation,

402
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,880
even if you were burned by the Candlelight Beetles,

403
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,750
it wouldn't be difficult

404
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,640
to kill us.

405
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,160
Why did you

406
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,070
keep us alive?

407
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,870
Aren't you afraid of causing more troubles?

408
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,940
It's not too late

409
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,190
to kill you now.

410
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Stop pretending.

411
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,480
Everyone said you went astray

412
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,790
and killed your fellow disciples.

413
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,950
But I saw you couldn't bear to do so

414
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,010
because of previous relationships.

415
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,360
Xingzheng,

416
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,950
for some things,

417
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,870
ignorance is bliss.

418
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,020
Just remember

419
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,810
your mission

420
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,580
is to catch the fugitive Shao Cang.

421
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,560
We have different paths.

422
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,010
If we meet again,

423
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,300
I won't go easy on you.

424
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,960
You'd rather work with that fox spirit

425
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,180
than believe me?

426
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,840
Traitor,

427
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,320
let's see where you can escape to!

428
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,040
Do you have a death wish?

429
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,070
Nan Yan.

430
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,620
From now on,

431
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,700
I've decided to stay in Filth Valley.

432
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,540
Why?

433
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,360
My father must be waiting outside the barrier.

434
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,350
After what happened just now,

435
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,470
I'll die if I go out.

436
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,620
Later,

437
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,070
after you find the Snow Branch

438
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,800
and meet up with Ji Yang and the fox,

439
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,150
have them take you away.

440
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,550
You can come in to visit me

441
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,280
every year when the valley opens.

442
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,300
That'll do.

443
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,390
Isn't it funny?

444
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,700
You look down.

445
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,790
I wanted to cheer you up

446
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,910
with a joke.

447
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,080
Thank you.

448
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,190
I'm your Big Brother, after all.

449
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:34,630
But just now,

450
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,120
what you said to my father

451
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,160
was awesome.

452
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,040
You made my father so confused.

453
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,420
I've decided

454
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,300
to write a long poem

455
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,390
to commemorate

456
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,910
this great moment.

457
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,670
I've thought of the title already.

458
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,470
I'll call it

459
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,030
Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

460
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,380
Big Brother,

461
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,650
doggerels

462
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,930
are really not funny.

463
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,630
I rise and dress alone in the morning and evening.

464
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,120
No one to speak to at the lonely grave.

465
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,730
Where have my sisters married to?

466
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,950
Parents no longer return.

467
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,600
I rise and dress alone in the morning and evening.

468
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,020
No one to speak to at the lonely grave.

469
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,910
Where have my sisters married to?

470
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,430
Parents...

471
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,440
Don't get seduced.

472
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,810
The song just now

473
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,640
sounded like my mother's voice.

474
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,930
No way.

475
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:33,940
No,

476
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,790
it sounded like

477
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,990
my father singing it.

478
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,590
But when I thought about it,

479
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,710
my father has a horrible voice.

480
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,830
He can’t sing so well.

481
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,090
It must be an illusion.

482
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,880
Illusion.

483
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,860
It seems that this vengeful spirit

484
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,590
is good at imitating

485
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,190
the voice of family members.

486
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,700
We must be more careful,

487
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,790
especially you.

488
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:54,790
Here.

489
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:55,730
This...

490
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,460
Block your ears.

491
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,130
Let's go.

492
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,870
Go!

493
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,650
Fox clan illusion.

494
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,890
Rebel disciple Ji Yang, show yourself now!

495
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,530
It's the fox spirit from the Lunar Sect.

496
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,790
All good.

497
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,030
This isn't your first time

498
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,360
in Filth Valley, right?

499
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,040
I come here almost every year.

500
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,280
But I always just pick some herbs

501
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,550
or poisonous insects

502
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,910
in the outer ring.

503
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,880
It’s weird.

504
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,760
Yin Zhu lives in the valley.

505
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,910
Not only does this not discourage people

506
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,970
but it even leads more people to come.

507
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,580
The Filth Valley is full of spiritual aura.

508
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,510
There are many rare treasures and beasts.

509
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,910
Yin Zhu is scary

510
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,310
and danger is everywhere here,

511
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,630
but it's also the best place

512
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,690
for cultivators to gain experience.

513
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,830
As the saying goes,

514
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,330
fortune and wealth are sought in danger.

515
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,900
There is demonic aura.

516
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,650
I don't want

517
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,160
such wealth.

518
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,890
Watch out!

519
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,870
Five Evil Ghosts.

520
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,950
You actually know me?

521
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,750
Two years ago, someone wreaked havoc

522
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,870
near the East Sea.

523
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,880
When my father passed by,

524
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,000
he jumped into the sea in the distance and escaped.

525
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,060
Wasn't it you, Deng Ba,

526
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,370
the Black Iron Gold?

527
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,700
I was wondering who it was.

528
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,960
Turns out you're the Young Dragon Lord.

529
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,310
I'm glad you know.

530
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,080
Where's that Zhan Xian

531
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,950
who killed and stole with you?

532
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,830
Zhan Xian is here.

533
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,770
Nan Yan!

534
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,630
I saved your life just now.

535
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,210
Why don't you thank me?

536
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,090
It's just a petty trick.

537
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,110
You still depend on

538
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,870
the petty tricks of the fox clan

539
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,550
in order to

540
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,140
find the Seven Sins Manual.

541
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,500
If you delay any longer,

542
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,270
the Seven Sins Manual

543
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,330
will fall into someone else's hands.

544
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:49,960
I smell it.

545
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,960
It's over there.

546
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,440
Let go of my sister!

547
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,720
Deng,

548
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,290
this girl is attractive.

549
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,880
She can be a dual cultivation vessel for you.

550
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,100
You know me well, Zhan.

551
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,590
Don't you dare touch her.

552
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,100
Sun Fire.

553
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,350
If your father used it,

554
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,310
we would have

555
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,690
turned into ash by now.

556
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,760
As for you,

557
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,070
it's only enough to heat a pot of wine.

558
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,660
Shut up!

559
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,270
It's all because of the chain

560
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,000
can absorb my spiritual power.

561
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,030
Catch him alive!

562
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,160
Bring him back to be Chief's corpse puppet.

563
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,450
It'll be so impressive to have the Young Dragon Lord

564
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,510
under our control.

565
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,610
Don't worry.

566
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,140
Wait a moment.

567
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,660
After my Black-Gold Chain

568
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,190
drains his spiritual power,

569
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,990
we can capture him easily.

570
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,300
If the barrier falls,

571
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,160
you won't be able to escape.

572
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,430
If you want the antidote,

573
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,360
let him go first.

574
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,050
Poisoner.

575
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,030
Give me the antidote!

576
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,060
You destroyed my Mechanical Butterfly.

577
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,990
How are you going to compensate me?

578
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,950
After I use the Sun Fire

579
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,150
to break the barrier,

580
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,870
I'll try to stop them.

581
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,600
You go first.

582
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,560
What about you?

583
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,180
I'm fine.

584
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,130
My father is right outside Filth Valley.

585
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,820
If they don't want to be chopped into pieces,

586
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,280
they won't dare to kill me.

587
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,030
They won't dare to kill you.

588
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,080
But what if they maim you?

589
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,850
Oh, right.

590
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,110
I can be humiliated,

591
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,380
but I need my hand.

592
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,550
You want to enter Filth Valley

593
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,690
to look for the Snow Branch.

594
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,710
It's likely you'll run into

595
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,570
the Demon Clan.

596
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,190
Then I'll bring more poison,

597
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,110
the kind that can

598
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,430
kill those demons.

599
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,360
With your cultivation,

600
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,000
if you meet

601
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,990
an elder-level demonic cultivator,

602
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,320
you'll be the one dying.

603
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,390
What a jinx.

604
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,830
He was completely right.

605
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,810
Not only did I run into elders of the Demon Clan,

606
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,470
but I even ran into two at once.

607
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,590
Nan Yan seems to be in danger.

608
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,520
I'll take a look.

609
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,960
Go find the entrance immediately.

610
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,550
Don't play tricks.

611
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,620
These hopeless romantics are unreliable indeed.

612
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,740
At critical moments,

613
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,400
I have to do everything alone.

614
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,720
It’s the monarch of the Great Path!

615
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,340
Stop chasing them.

616
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,400
They were poisoned by me.

617
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,750
Luckily, you came in time.

618
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,310
Otherwise, Nan Yan

619
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,640
would've been bullied.

620
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,820
Filth Valley is dangerous.

621
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,820
Why are you here?

622
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,390
You can come.

623
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,600
Why can't I?

624
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,520
I promised to protect you.

625
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,290
I won't let you take the risk.

626
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,930
Take Mu Zhanting

627
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,260
and leave immediately.

628
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,190
No.

629
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,030
She's here

630
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,830
to help you find the Snow Branch.

631
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,840
I don't need it.

632
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,390
My heart disease is fine.

633
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,680
Are you a doctor or am I a doctor?

634
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,430
This heart disease

635
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,550
is not up to you.

636
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,010
My mother is dead.

637
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,730
I don't want to lose you too.

638
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,900
But I don't want anything to happen to you.

639
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,220
If I persuaded you

640
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,830
not to come into Filth Valley,

641
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,010
would you agree?

642
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,230
I...

643
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,220
You wouldn't.

644
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,790
Because both of us

645
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,910
have wishes that we'll try to fulfill

646
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,510
no matter the difficulties.

647
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,690
In that case,

648
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,390
I won't stop you.

649
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,680
Don't try to persuade me either.

650
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,850
Today,

651
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,750
no one can stop me,

652
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,290
even if God himself comes.

653
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,560
I won't turn back.

654
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,470
Alright.

655
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,630
Stop arguing.

656
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,990
Both of you

657
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,310
are saying the same thing.

658
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,570
You're doing it for the good of the other.

659
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,240
Ji Yang,

660
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,870
listen to my advice.

661
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,510
It's not Nan Yan's first time

662
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,710
entering the valley.

663
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,110
You can't stop her anyway.

664
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,910
Why don't you trust me this time?

665
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,900
I, Mu Zhanting,

666
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,490
will help you

667
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,790
escort Nan Yan out safely

668
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,110
even if I have to sacrifice myself,

669
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,550
okay?

670
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,460
I have two conditions.

671
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:04,990
One,

672
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,360
no matter what the reason is,

673
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,570
don't go near the inner area.

674
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:07,910
Two,

675
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,230
once we find the Snow Branch,

676
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,470
we must leave immediately.

677
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,110
Right?

678
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,330
How did you know?

679
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,330
Before we set off,

680
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,230
Chief Meng already

681
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,230
told me this repeatedly.

682
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:15,870
Don't

683
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,440
keep nagging here.

684
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,770
You're just like my dad.

685
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,330
Don't worry.

686
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,490
I know what to do.

687
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,340
Then...

688
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,270
Do you know where

689
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,640
to find the Snow Branch?

690
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,200
It likes bitterly cold places.

691
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,310
I'll go search

692
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,490
wherever it's cold.

693
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,340
Isn't that looking for a needle in the haystack?

694
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,890
What's this?

695
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,140
Where we are standing righ tnow.

696
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,710
This spot has the highest terrain

697
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,910
and is covered with snow.

698
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,880
The Snow Branch

699
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900
should be here.

700
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,370
This place is in the

701
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,850
outer region of Filth Valley

702
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,480
and there's no threat of Yin Zhu attacks,

703
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,410
but it's close to the inner region.

704
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,010
It can't be underestimated.

705
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,750
Yes.

706
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,450
We will listen to Lord Shao Cang

707
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,980
and not let our guards down.

708
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,600
I'll go with you.

709
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,420
I can protect you for a while.

710
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,540
But when you reach the border,

711
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,430
you'll search for the Snow Branch immediately.

712
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,490
If you can't find it

713
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,450
within two hours,

714
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,050
you must leave Filth Valley.

715
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,920
What should we do next?

716
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,350
We'll take a shortcut

717
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,150
and cross the subsurface river.

718
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
The terrain here is so complicated.

719
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,780
How did you find me?
