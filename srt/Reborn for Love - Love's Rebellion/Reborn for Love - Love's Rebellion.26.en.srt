[Episode 26]

4
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,680
Sister.

5
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,510
Ya'er.

6
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,539
I'm back.

7
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,850
Sister.

8
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,710
Dad!

9
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,860
Dad!

10
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,570
How is my dad?

11
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,160
Dad!

12
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,570
Dad.

13
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,050
You befriended demons

14
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,040
and released the fox clan without permission.

15
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,870
You brat.

16
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,660
How dare you do this?

17
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,280
Do you want to go to die?

18
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,630
No, Dad, you...

19
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,970
Aren't you in a critical condition?

20
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,260
If you keep messing around,

21
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,940
I'll die soon.

22
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:27,940
Wait, Dad.

23
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,880
Let me explain.

24
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,570
What's the use of explaining?

25
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,140
The matter with the Spirit-Sealing Formation

26
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,960
has been exposed to the Great Path.

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,870
If you really get charged

28
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,220
with being a rebel,

29
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,870
you won't be able to gain a foothold in the cultivation realm

30
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,000
no matter how I use

31
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,320
my connections or speak for you.

32
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,920
No,

33
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,130
it's the Great Path that doesn't know right from wrong.

34
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,800
Shut up!

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,640
Inform the people of the city

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,170
to gather at the city gates.

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,610
I'll punish this unfilial son.

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,220
Beating me again?

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,390
That's why

40
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,700
I not only have another sister,

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,070
but also a Big Brother

42
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,570
and an uncle.

43
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,890
I was planning on telling you all about

44
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,030
my experiences these past few years

45
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,730
after you came out,

46
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,470
but I couldn't stop talking once I started.

47
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,200
Are you tired of listening?

48
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,090
Of course not.

49
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,940
It's just that

50
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,160
you only talked about the good things.

51
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,650
I want to hear

52
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,930
how many hardships

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,300
you've encountered all these years.

54
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,829
Also,

55
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,700
your white hair...

56
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,990
I quite like

57
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,030
my white hair.

58
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,980
Besides,

59
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,310
you used to dislike

60
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,520
how impulsive I was.

61
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,380
Now, I look

62
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,110
more mature, right?

63
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,630
Big Brother said

64
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,690
I'm a lucky person.

65
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,840
Troubling matters

66
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,830
always avoid me.

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,840
Sister,

68
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,830
I really didn't experience

69
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,990
any hardships these years.

70
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,769
Don't worry.

71
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,680
Besides,

72
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,120
the fox clan

73
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,460
didn't participate in the war between humans and spirits

74
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,060
but still had this calamity.

75
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,960
I think all the bad luck

76
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,590
was used up

77
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,680
at that time.

78
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,840
Next, there will

79
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,040
only be good luck awaiting us.

80
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,480
Okay.

81
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,310
From now on,

82
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,640
we'll live quietly here.

83
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,690
Sen Luo's appearance is not a rumor.

84
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,430
Youquan Prison has been unlocked.

85
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,480
If the spirits come out now,

86
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,490
I'm afraid Sen Luo will take advantage of this chance.

87
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,750
Sister,

88
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,060
I...

89
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,240
You may need

90
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,170
wait for me a bit.

91
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,000
I have something to finish.

92
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,850
You're leaving?

93
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,150
People place importance on magic,

94
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,580
while the Sword Sect places importance on the sword.

95
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,880
If you want to join our sect,

96
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,530
you must forget

97
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,150
your previous cultivation methods.

98
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,240
You can only trust

99
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,650
your sword.

100
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,740
Understood.

101
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,640
It's easy to say yes,

102
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,780
but a decade of cultivation

103
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,730
is not easy either.

104
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,520
[Song Zhu, Chief Disciple of the Sword Sect]

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,590
Are you really ready

106
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,920
to start all over again?

107
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,850
So what?

108
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,430
I've cultivated for years,

109
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,590
but when I faced the Evil Path,

110
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,000
I was still powerless.

111
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,070
As long as I can become stronger,

112
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,690
I can throw away

113
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,909
my past results.

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,460
That's what I think too.

115
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,620
You two,

116
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
go cut off a branch each

117
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,830
and let me have a look.

118
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,040
At that time,

119
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll decide

120
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,300
your fate.

121
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,700
What's so hard

122
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,100
about cutting branches with a sword?

123
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,700
Let's go.

124
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,030
The Sword Sect views men and women

125
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,020
equally.

126
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,730
Your accuracy is good,

127
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,390
but you're not strong enough.

128
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,940
Judging from the surface,

129
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,150
you used your sword at least five times, right?

130
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,580
You are wise.

131
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,430
It was precisely five times.

132
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:03,830
Did you cut this down

133
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,030
with a sword just now?

134
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,120
What do you think?

135
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,100
The cross section is smooth.

136
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,860
It was a brilliant strike.

137
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,350
In terms of accuracy

138
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,510
and strength,

139
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,970
it's one in a million.

140
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,370
Sword Master, what do you think?

141
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,560
The Sword Sect

142
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,590
can't accept you.

143
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,980
You can't accept me?

144
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,350
He just said I'm one in a million.

145
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,720
Are you sure?

146
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,920
I told you from the beginning

147
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,500
that to join the Sword Sect,

148
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,980
you must forget the past.

149
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,470
Otherwise, your magic will disturb the swordsmanship.

150
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,690
You'll lose both.

151
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,950
Fu Lang,

152
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,170
you abused your spiritual power

153
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,360
and cheated with ill intentions.

154
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,620
How can the Sword Sect accept you?

155
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,220
Please find your own way out.

156
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,990
All these years,

157
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,520
Nan Yan took good care of me.

158
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,390
If it weren't for her

159
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,570
lending me the silver mermaid pearl,

160
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,630
I wouldn't have been able to break into the formation.

161
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,380
Now,

162
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,150
Youquan Prison is unlocked.

163
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,850
I'm afraid she'll be in trouble.

164
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,850
I have to help her.

165
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,680
No.

166
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,900
You can't go.

167
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,730
Nowadays, we can only survive

168
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,880
by walking on eggshells.

169
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,790
Why must you throw yourself

170
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,440
into the disputes of the four seas?

171
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,780
While you were away,

172
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,620
she acted as a sister, taking care of me

173
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,620
and protecting me.

174
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,710
She's in trouble now.

175
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,030
I have to help her.

176
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,740
It'll only be more troublesome if you help her.

177
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,860
Sister, don't worry.

178
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,179
I have seven tails now.

179
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,440
So what?

180
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,230
The spirit clan was powerful back then,

181
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,090
but they still got sealed easily.

182
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,450
People are prejudiced against spirits.

183
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,270
If you stand up,

184
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,000
the Great Path won't trust you.

185
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,420
Listen to me.

186
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,750
Anyone can help her,

187
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,750
except us.

188
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,150
Sister,

189
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,680
these years, I keep dreaming about

190
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,220
the night you told me to escape.

191
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,620
Actually, I regret it.

192
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,530
If I'd known

193
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,710
we would've been separated for so long,

194
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,710
I'd rather not run.

195
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,020
The feeling of running away

196
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,990
was not good.

197
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Now, my friend

198
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,070
is in trouble.

199
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,930
I can't run anymore.

200
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,800
Ya'er!

201
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,260
Ji Yang.

202
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,880
Ji Yang.

203
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,740
Ji Yang.

204
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,750
You're awake?

205
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,330
Why are you here?

206
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,570
Do you still feel unwell?

207
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,240
Where is Ji Yang?

208
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,020
Ji Yang?

209
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,860
Ji Yang?

210
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,050
Ji Yang!

211
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,030
He left.

212
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,080
He left?

213
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,230
He asked me to give this letter to you

214
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,870
after you woke up.

215
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:18,960
Yan,

216
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,620
forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

217
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,930
I wanted to wait until you woke up,

218
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,120
but I was afraid

219
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,880
I wouldn't bear to leave then.

220
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,840
♫When the moon rises and the sun sets, who is singing their loneliness softly♫

221
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,270
I thought

222
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,790
I'd be okay even if I had a demon's body.

223
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:44,300
♫The heart cries, complaining♫

224
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,400
I could still be carefree.

225
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,990
Later, I found

226
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,110
that the days I spent with you

227
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,020
♫Bind oneself up♫

228
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,440
were the most carefree.

229
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,770
♫I turn a blind eye for you♫

230
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,200
But I lost control because of Sen Luo

231
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,340
♫My heart belongs to someone, so I'm not afraid of loneliness♫

232
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,080
and kept putting you in danger.

233
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,110
If I can't protect you forever,

234
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,790
at least

235
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,510
I don't want you to be in danger because of me.

236
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,990
♫When I can't find my way back in the world♫

237
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,370
I've found a solution.

238
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,990
When the demonic barrier is cleared,

239
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:12,720
♫You are my only way back♫

240
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,390
I will come back to you

241
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,320
and we will never be apart again

242
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:20,180
♫Time will engrave the love into my bones♫

243
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,830
I will use this letter as my farewell.

244
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,450
Wishing you peace.

245
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,750
♫Will you still remember your roots?♫

246
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,920
♫Go through your day♫

247
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,480
♫And my night♫

248
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,150
♫Before I wake up♫

249
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,080
♫Follow the fate of my previous life♫

250
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,710

256
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,230
♫May life be♫

257
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,920

♫Time will engrave the love into my bones♫

261
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,510
In order to make the elixir, Young Lord Yin

262
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,370
♫Will you still remember your roots?♫

263
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,150
knelt cautiously in the rain

264
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,280
for an entire night.

265
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,390
He had to endure the scorching sun

266
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,270
and the icy cold.

267
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,650
♫Go through your day♫

268
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,390
After several hardships,

269
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,170
♫And my night♫

270
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,550
he finally formed this medicine.

271
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,950
♫Before I wake up♫

272
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,950
Ji Yang.

♫Follow the fate of my previous life♫

274
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,890

♫Travel through time♫

276
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,590
it stimulated the magic

277
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,590
of the Seven Sins Manual within you.

278
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,550
Young Lord Yin suffered for you

279
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,910
♫To see♫

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,880
♫The firefly of love♫

281
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,720

Ji Yang!

Ji Yang.

293
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,120
Where did you go?

294
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,830
Did you really think

295
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,480
that I'd be at peace

296
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,880
if you left?

297
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,170
Who do you think you are?

298
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,570
How can you

299
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,860
leave without saying goodbye each time?

300
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,030
Fine.

301
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,500
Leave if you want.

302
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,840
I trust you this time.

303
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,390
No matter what method

304
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,450
you've learned to exorcise the demon,

305
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,710
I'll wait for you here.

306
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,510
I'll wait for you to come back.

307
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,460
You must come back alive.

308
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,990
It seems a bit shoddy.

309
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,410
Senior,

310
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,030
this is the resting place

311
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,340
for wandering cultivators

312
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,800
taken in by the Sword Sect,

313
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,210
but don't worry.

314
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,230
You'll just stay here for the time being.

315
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,970
Take your time

316
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,630
to think about your next step.

317
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,320
It's just a bit?

318
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,750
And then?

319
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,960
Don't worry.

320
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,970
A senior will take me

321
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,170
to settle down later.

322
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,450
I will definitely bring you

323
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,950
some daily necessities.

324
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,790
Yingying.

325
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,650
How can you carry it alone?

326
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,730
I'll go with you.

327
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,310
I can't join

328
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,640
the Sword Sect with you,

329
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,190
but since you call me your senior,

330
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,370
I will try my best to be your support.

331
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,680
I appreciate your kindness,

332
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,150
but that's where the Sword Sect's disciples live.

333
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,750
They have rules

334
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,610
that outsiders...

335
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,410
can't enter.

336
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,340
Outsiders?

337
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,960
Outsiders?

338
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,329
What a great term.

339
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,869
Yingying,

340
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,760
you know I'm not

341
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,940
how the Sword Master said.

342
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,190
I just wanted to be their disciple so badly.

343
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,430
I wanted to stay with you.

344
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,869
I didn't expect him to care

345
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,660
about those trivial things.

346
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,660
Don't worry.

347
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,230
Sword Master must have his reason

348
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,590
for acting this way.

349
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,640
Becoming a disciple takes fate.

350
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,030
Don't worry about it.

351
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,020
Besides,

352
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,790
learning the demon subduing magic

353
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,710
to take revenge for the sect

354
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,330
is my own wish.

355
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,540
Maybe it's better for you

356
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,670
to not join the Sword Sect.

357
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,720
But you are

358
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,030
my last loved one.

359
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,690
Without you,

360
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,530
where should I go?

361
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,670
Yes.

362
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,390
Our loved ones are gone.

363
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,510
That's why I have to climb higher.

364
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,580
Senior,

365
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,150
too many things

366
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,480
have changed recently.

367
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,030
You must be tired.

368
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,180
Have a good rest.

369
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,020
Yingying.

370
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,170
I...

371
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,590
If you need anything in the future,

372
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,900
let me know.

373
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,050
I'll come often to take care of you.

374
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,110
Also, Senior,

375
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,430
don't underestimate yourself

376
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,500
in the future.

377
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,290
As long as you practice hard,

378
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,570
you'll make progress.

379
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,420
Is Nan Yan here?

380
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,300
Nan Yan?

381
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,400
Little Fox!

382
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,670
I heard from the villagers

383
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,230
that you were seriously injured.

384
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,290
Where are you hurt?

385
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:36,920
Does it hurt?

386
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,180
I'm fine.

387
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,640
I'm fine.

388
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,860
Come, sit down.

389
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,750
Here you go.

390
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,390
When I was in the Spirit-Sealing Formation,

391
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,590
I met someone

392
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,070
who said he was your uncle.

393
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,280
At first, I didn't believe

394
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,540
that he was your uncle.

395
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,590
But the silver mermaid pearl

396
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,510
seemed to recognize its owner

397
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,710
and flew to his hands.

398
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,140
Judging from his look,

399
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,800
he didn't seem to be lying.

400
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,710
Did he say his name?

401
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,760
Did he tell you

402
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,040
about my mother?

403
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,000
His name is Nan Yi.

404
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,620
He’s your mother’s brother.

405
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,360
Also,

406
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,920
your mother

407
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,670
was actually the long-missing

408
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,270
Chief Nan Fang of Yao Palace.

409
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,350
What did you say?

410
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,540
My mother

411
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,990
was Chief Nan Fang of Yao Palace?

412
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,850
Actually, when we were in Filth Valley,

413
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,240
Ji Yang already told me

414
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,460
your mother's identity.

415
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,210
But he asked me to keep it a secret from you,

416
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,190
because

417
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,990
this was entrusted by your mother before she died.

418
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,970
So I had to hide it from you

419
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,080
with him.

420
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,080
In my memory,

421
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,310
my mother has always run a steamed bun shop

422
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,220
in Lunar Town.

423
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,820
She was always

424
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,600
either playing cards or drinking.

425
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
How could she be

426
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,230
Chief Nan Fang of Yao Palace?

427
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,450
Then she...

428
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,870
Then why did she hide

429
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,710
her identity?

430
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,570
She even hid it from me.

431
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,250
Well...

432
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,860
I don't know.

433
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,320
But she must have

434
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,150
her reason for doing this.

435
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,590
What's your next plan?

436
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,180
Are you still going to find Ji Yang?

437
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,490
He said he would come back to me

438
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,070
after exorcising the demon.

439
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,440
You still trust him?

440
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,600
I trust him,

441
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,980
but I can't forgive him.

442
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,360
That's right.

443
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,750
We can't let him off easily.

444
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,270
He gets controlled by Sen Luo randomly

445
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,430
and bites people like a rabid dog.

446
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,800
He almost killed you.

447
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,100
If he comes back,

448
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,320
I will definitely...

449
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,190
I...

450
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,120
Will definitely what?

451
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,560
What else can I do?

452
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,780
I'll just kneel down if I can't beat him.

453
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,590
You'll stand up for me, anyway.

454
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,570
Yes.

455
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,690
I will definitely stand up for you.

456
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,910
Since you know

457
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,070
where your uncle is,

458
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,030
why don't you just go to

459
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,050
the Punishment Pavilion

460
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,380
and ask him face to face?

461
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,550
If my mother

462
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,190
really was Chief Nan Fang of Yao Palace,

463
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,520
then she had the cultivation of a demigod.

464
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,230
Then her heart disease

465
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,060
is suspicious.

466
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,160
And last time,

467
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,400
the person who took the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

468
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,930
seemed to know my mother.

469
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,270
Okay.

470
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,870
I'll go find my uncle.

471
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,260
Maybe if I find him,

472
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,820
the truth will be revealed.

473
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,330
You just recovered from your injury.

474
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,630
You must rest well.

475
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,740
The murderer who killed Chief Meng

476
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,250
will be found one day.

477
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,010
It's never too late

478
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:56,940
to take revenge.

479
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,230
When you see your uncle,

480
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,390
he'll definitely find a way

481
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,050
because he's knowledgeable.

482
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,260
If there is any news about him...

483
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,940
I will tell you immediately.

484
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,500
Just see me off here.

485
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,090
Farewells are inevitable.

486
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,630
Miss.

487
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,930
What are you doing?

488
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,510
Miss,

489
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,190
can I go with you?

490
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,710
You and Young Lord did me a great favor.

491
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,420
I promised Young Lord

492
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,560
to take care of you.

493
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,310
My blood

494
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,240
can be used for

495
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,670
the healing technique of the Evil Path.

496
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,200
For my brother's leg condition in the past...

497
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,950
I'm not your brother.

498
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,960
I don't need you

499
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,780
to cut yourself for the treatment.

500
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,530
If you want to follow me,

501
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:07,640
you have to follow

502
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,100
the rules of the Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea.

503
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,760
Come out.

504
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,590
Didn't you say you would kneel down

505
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,990
if you saw me again?

506
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,470
Didn't you leave?

507
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,710
Why are you sneaking around

508
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,770
and hiding nearby?

509
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,550
What do you want to do to Nan Yan?

510
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,210
If I stay by her side,

511
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,830
I will only hurt her.

512
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,910
So, when you said in the letter

513
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,980
you've found the way to exorcise the demon,

514
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,780
it was a lie?

515
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,290
I don't want to implicate her anymore.

516
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,650
I guess you have a conscience.

517
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,120
It's a demon

518
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,690
that even the Bloody-handed Asura couldn't exorcise.

519
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,490
In this world,

520
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,270
only one person can do it.

521
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,300
These paintings

522
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,000
were drawn personally by the Holy Master.

523
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,850
Back then,

524
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,230
he cultivated in seclusion

525
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,890
in this cave for ten years.

526
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,570
After Sen Luo appeared,

527
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,600
Holy Master

528
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,400
came out to suppress the demon

529
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,690
with a jade sword.

530
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,350
He fought Sen Luo

531
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,910
for 49 days

532
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,990
and finally defeated Sen Luo.

533
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,950
However,

534
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,510
Sen Luo did not die.

535
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,350
Holy Master could only suppress his soul

536
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,470
in five different prisons.

537
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,650
No wonder Sen Luo

538
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,830
keeps luring me to take back the five prisons.

539
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,960
Every time I get one,

540
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,050
the Yin Zhu within me grows stronger

541
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,010
and it's one step closer to the revival of Sen Luo.

542
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,550
That's why

543
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,810
you were possessed

544
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,590
by Sen Luo immediately

545
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,270
after you took over Youquan Prison.

546
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,200
That's why you accidentally hurt Nan Yan.

547
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,430
Master,

548
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,090
how can I get rid of

549
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,960
the soul of the Sen Luo in my body?

550
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,420
Holy Master sacrificed himself to suppress the demon.

551
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,830
He used his death

552
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,070
to exchange for the world's peace.

553
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,230
Before he died,

554
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,600
he left a fragment of the jade sword,

555
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,110
transmuted it into five Demon-Subduing Nails,

556
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,750
and sealed them in the cave.

557
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,610
So, Holy Master

558
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,910
already predicted

559
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,540
that Sen Luo would reappear?

560
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,780
That's right.

561
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,270
The enlightenment he learned during seclusion

562
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,750
was the destiny of the four seas

563
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,230
and five states after a century.

564
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,030
These five Demon-Subduing Nails

565
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,820
can suppress the residual soul of Sen Luo

566
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,900
and weaken the demonic aura.

567
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,370
That's great.

568
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,970
Let's use these nails.

569
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,800
He and Sen Luo

570
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,600
share a demonic body.

571
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,480
Using the Demon-Subduing Nail

572
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,810
will cause them to bear the pain together.

573
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,260
After a hundred years, his physical body

574
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,550
will disappear

575
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,230
along with Sen Luo's soul.

576
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,690
Only at that time

577
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,880
will he be truly freed.

578
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,890
Disappear together?

579
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,820
Isn't that death?

580
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,370
The Demon-Subduing Nail can preserve his soul

581
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,840
from being corroded by Sen Luo.

582
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,360
He won't be possessed

583
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,760
or go mad anymore.

584
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,110
If we don't suppress it,

585
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,040
one day,

586
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,830
he will completely lose consciousness

587
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,380
and become Sen Luo.

588
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:43,860
No way.

589
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,270
If the Demon-Subduing Nail is used,

590
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,590
he has to suffer for a hundred years

591
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,740
and die together.

592
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,200
Without the Demon-Subduing Nail,

593
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,870
he'll turn completely into Sen Luo.

594
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,600
Neither of these options work.

595
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,240
Master, Sen Luo...

596
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,940
Can he be resolved?

597
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,940
No.

598
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,030
That can't do.

599
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,270
What should we do if Nan Yan

600
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,910
finds out?

601
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,070
Master,

602
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,670
is there no other way?

603
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,640
Maybe there is another way.

604
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,180
It's to enter Sen Luo's state of mind.

605
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,490
Then you might be able to kill him.

606
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,760
How can we enter Sen Luo's state of mind?

607
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,560
The way to do so

608
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,270
is the secret technique of the fox clan.

609
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,840
But I was immature back then

610
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,980
and didn’t study it seriously.

611
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,900
My sister is

612
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,390
the only one in the four seas who can do it.

613
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,380
That's right.

614
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,540
The forbidden technique of the fox clan

615
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,880
can be used to enter one's state of mind.

616
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,330
But even if you do so,

617
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,370
it's unknown if you can

618
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,870
kill Sen Luo.

619
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,670
He might

620
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,250
die in the state of mind

621
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,880
and have his divine energy be devoured by Sen Luo.

622
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,990
I've only heard

623
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,890
Holy Master mention it.

624
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,240
In history,

625
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,520
no one has ever succeeded.

626
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,730
I want to try.

627
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,910
Are you prepared to die?

628
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,250
I won't regret it even if I die.

629
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,490
I'll go find my sister.

630
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,870
Master,

631
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,980
after the fox clan was released,

632
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,880
you took them here to recuperate.

633
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,180
The only one who knows the state of mind magic

634
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,710
is Yin Ya's sister.

635
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,220
So,

636
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,140
it's fate and karma

637
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,790
for us to meet.

638
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,090
The answer is predestined.

639
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,450
It only

640
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,160
awaits the problem solver.

641
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,630
We can't

642
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,750
help you with this.

643
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,750
Sister.

644
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,530
Weren't you afraid that Nan Yan

645
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,110
will be hurt by the reincarnated Sen Luo,

646
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,370
so you went to save her?

647
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,190
I was happy to see you

648
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,750
come back quickly and safely.

649
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,350
Why did you

650
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,340
bring that demon back?

651
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,800
And you want me to save him?

652
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,280
He's not a demon.

653
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,870
He is my friend.

654
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,730
That was before he became a demon.

655
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,370
He's now Sen Luo.

656
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,100
No, Sister.

657
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,790
Everything that Ji Yang has done

658
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,920
and has suffered for

659
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,530
is to get rid of Sen Luo.

660
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,280
And I believe

661
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,140
he can do it.

662
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,830
He's already out of control.

663
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:30,960
Otherwise,

664
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,670
why did you send Nan Yan away?

665
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,410
Back then, Sen Luo wanted to enter the demonic path

666
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,800
and caused chaos in the mortal world.

667
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,670
He sparked the war between humans and spirits,

668
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,080
causing all spirits

669
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,840
to be locked into the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

670
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,710
He is the source of everything.

671
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,960
Sen Luo's power

672
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,800
is far beyond our imagination.

673
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,580
The fox clan

674
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,080
has just been freed.

675
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,610
We need to rest.

676
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:02,950
We can't have

677
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,730
anything to do with Sen Luo now.

678
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,120
Ya'er,

679
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,580
you can save anyone,

680
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,590
except him.

681
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,860
But we finally got the help of

682
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,310
the Demon-Subduing Nails.

683
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,080
As long as

684
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,630
he can enter Sen Luo's state of mind,

685
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,790
I believe Ji Yang can

686
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,580
wipe out

687
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,070
the source of Sen Luo's remaining soul.

688
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,630
Then we'll kill him, right?

689
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,150
Sister,

690
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,650
I really can't watch

691
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,600
Ji Yang completely become Sen Luo.

692
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,000
Okay.

693
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,500
Even if he's not Sen Luo

694
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,940
and I view him as Ji Yang,

695
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,170
your friend,

696
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,200
Ji Yang

697
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,760
is hunted by the Great Path.

698
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,990
Meanwhile, the fox clan

699
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,990
has been suppressed by the Great Path

700
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,120
for all these years.

701
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,200
We've finally been freed.

702
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,480
If we help him now,

703
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,310
then

704
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,410
won't we offend the Great Path again?

705
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,660
As the Fox Empress, how can I endanger

706
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,190
the fox clan?

707
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,370
You worry about your friend's life,

708
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,210
while I

709
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,060
just want to lead the fox clan to live peacefully

710
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,190
and not suffer from a century of suppression again.

711
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,350
Ya'er,

712
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,910
I'm begging you.

713
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,320
Didn't you say

714
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,930
that if you could choose again,

715
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,120
you'd enter the Spirit-Sealing Formation

716
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,500
with us

717
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,270
instead of surviving alone?

718
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,200
So this time,

719
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,110
can you choose

720
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,590
to be with us?

721
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,980
I understand.

722
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,850
I'm possessed by Sen Luo

723
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,380
and a fugitive of the Great Path.

724
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,000
It's reasonable that your sister

725
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,370
is unwilling to help.

726
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,139
What you should do now

727
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,000
is to assist your sister

728
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,630
and take care of the fox clan.

729
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,639
But Yin Ya,

730
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,870
I need you

731
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,920
to help with one thing.

732
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,710
What?

733
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,420
Tell Nan Yan

734
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,670
you personally saw me

735
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,389
die from subduing the demon.

736
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,400
If Nan Yan knows about this,

737
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,550
she'll turn the world upside down

738
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,010
until she finds your body.

739
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:54,230
I can't

740
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,090
tell such a lie.

741
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:58,130
I'll suffered a century of pain because of the Demon-Subduing Nails.

742
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,050
She will also

743
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,440
suffer for this century.

744
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,240
Is that what you want to see?

745
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,640
A century

746
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,410
of loneliness,

747
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,510
pain,

748
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,260
and hopelessness.

749
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,750
You can't be freed unless you die.

750
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,180
Can you bear this hardship?

751
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,610
These days

752
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,990
with Yan's company

753
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,630
were short

754
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,120
but were better than everything in the world.

755
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,870
With these memories,

756
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,080
100 years

757
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,870
won't be hard to bear.

758
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,220
Master,

759
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,760
please arrange the nailing.

760
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,180
Have you made up your mind?

761
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,320
There's no return.

762
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,920
Once it starts,

763
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,520
you can't stop.

764
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,430
You will suffer endless pain.

765
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,600
I will bear

766
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,630
all the consequences.

767
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,180
Do you want to continue?

768
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,290
Do you need some rest?

769
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,290
If these five Demon-Subduing Nails are put in,

770
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,190
it'll be equal to being confined in the five prisons

771
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,610
and the more your soul will be devoured.

772
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,910
Compared to

773
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,030
the pain of rebuilding your demon body,

774
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,360
this will only be worse.

775
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,710
Can you handle it?

776
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,460
Continue!
