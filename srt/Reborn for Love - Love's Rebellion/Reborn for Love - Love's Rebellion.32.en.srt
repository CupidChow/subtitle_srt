[Episode 32]

4
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,630
Have a good rest then.

5
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,870
Let's go.

6
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,340
Come in.

7
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,789
I won't bite.

8
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,110
I’m sorry

9
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,660
for being rude.

10
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,590
I've seen you before.

11
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,280
You must've mistaken me for someone else.

12
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,130
In the Great Path Hall, I suddenly dreamed

13
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,940
of you, Han,

14
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,640
and Silly Meng together.

15
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,400
Do you know them?

16
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,640
Chief Meng summoned Chief Nan's consciousness

17
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,260
from the Bone-Deep Mirror.

18
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,610
To the current her,

19
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,940
it actually was a dream.

20
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,950
I don't know them.

21
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,729
It was really just a dream.

22
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,150
Since you're here, my demon friend,

23
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,600
why didn't you openly

24
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,870
ask for a duel with me?

25
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,700
It seems your spirit heart's power

26
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,880
has reached the fifth level of the Five Declines.

27
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,170
If you're here for this,

28
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,840
I advise you to forget it.

29
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,590
I don't mean to make things difficult for you.

30
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,720
I come from 100 years from now.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,990
I know the changes in the cultivation realm.

32
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,010
You'd lose your spirit heart.

33
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,750
Please be cautious at all times.

34
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,400
You love spouting nonsense

35
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,960
at such a young age.

36
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,590
I'm tired of hearing that.

37
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,810
Han nags me about it

38
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,550
a million times a day.

39
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,920
I'm not...

40
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,080
Are you engaged?

41
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,950
You're handsome

42
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,150
and highly skilled.

43
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,400
How about you let me

44
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,680
betroth my daughter

45
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,700
to you?

46
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,790
What do you think?

47
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,150
Chief.

48
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,660
How did you know

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,770
you'd have a daughter?

50
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,030
You didn't drink today.

51
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,640
Could it be...

52
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,570
An ill-fated relationship is hard to break.

53
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,500
You'll only find a way to survive in desperate times.

54
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,430
This is your fate.

55
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,900
Of course,

56
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,440
she's part of it too.

57
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,380
Senior.

58
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,650
Please take back the Seal of Romance.

59
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,990
A blessed relationship is fragile, but an ill-fated one is hard to break.

60
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,150
You'll only find a way to survive in desperate times.

61
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,280
From now on,

62
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,600
you are on your own.

63
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,690
By the way,

64
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,930
since it's a life-and-death vow,

65
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,280
you can't go against it.

66
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,540
So you

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,490
met me 100 years ago

68
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,770
and predicted my fate with Yan.

69
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,910
Looks like you've met each other.

70
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,040
How far have you gone?

71
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,470
You have great foresight.

72
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,670
But

73
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,730
for this question, I...

74
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,230
Forget it.

75
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,500
But don’t interfere

76
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,780
in my business.

77
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,180
From now on,

78
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,490
you'll have to rely on yourselves.

79
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,500
Chief Nan.

80
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,590
Without the old men around,

81
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,630
drinking is a pleasure.

82
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,870
Zewei will be the next premier.

83
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,700
Soon, you'll inherit Dragon Capital

84
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,230
and become the leader of a city.

85
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,240
How can you still

86
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,800
speak and behave so wildly?

87
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,000
Listen.

88
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,100
I'm going to let loose fully today.

89
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,630
Stop being

90
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,010
so pretentious.

91
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,440
Ying Zewei's already drunk it.

92
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,440
Why are you still dawdling?

93
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,590
Drink up. Drink up.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,790
Hurry up.

95
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,530
Fill his cup up.

96
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,040
Fill his cup up. Go on.

97
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,150
Yes.

98
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,130
Premier is ascending the throne?

99
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,580
Meng went to look for someone.

100
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,790
Why isn't he back yet?

101
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,830
Him?

102
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,670
You should know

103
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,070
what kind of person Nan Rao is.

104
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,110
She'll fight anyone she disagrees with.

105
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,980
That fool is no match for her.

106
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,380
I told him not to

107
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,640
bother about Nan Rao

108
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,270
and to just drink ourselves.

109
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,800
but he wouldn't listen.

110
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,670
Rao doesn't like lively events.

111
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,830
If there's really a fight,

112
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,090
it'll cause friction.

113
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,700
I'd better go take a look.

114
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,100
How about this?

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,720
We'll let this disciple go.

116
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,850
We can

117
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,600
discuss the Great Path's rules together.

118
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,310
Sure.

119
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,590
Yes.

120
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,510
Rao.

121
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,080
You don't have to open the door.

122
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,020
I'll just ask you one thing.

123
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,820
Do you really like Ying Zewei?

124
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,260
They said you agreed to

125
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,720
Great Path's engagement.

126
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,290
I don't believe it.

127
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,950
Rao.

128
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,930
A qualified sword cultivator's

129
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,310
lifetime partner...

130
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,810
is this sword.

131
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,850
I'll give it to you.

132
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,060
Will you marry me?

133
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,430
Master.

134
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,350
Dragon Lord asked me to get you

135
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,630
to go back for a drink.

136
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,630
Why are you

137
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,850
so sad?

138
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,850
Who are you?

139
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,820
I've lived here for a long time,

140
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,150
but I've never seen you.

141
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,250
Don't you know

142
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,180
who I am?

143
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,610
I...

144
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,180
You are...

145
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,320
Then

146
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,440
take a closer look at me.

147
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,080
I...

148
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,150
You...

149
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,600
Mother.

150
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,050
Mother!

151
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,390
Mother.

152
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,940
This is a forbidden place.

153
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,600
Outsiders are not allowed in.

154
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,810
Forbidden place?

155
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,430
This place is beside Soul River.

156
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,510
Premier has ordered

157
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,110
to bar people from entering.

158
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,300
Don't you know that?

159
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,550
I'm new here

160
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,630
and got lost.

161
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,720
Which hall are you from?

162
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,200
I haven't been assigned yet.

163
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,550
May I ask which hall you are from?

164
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,960
May I

165
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,450
cultivate under you?

166
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,890
I'm flattered.

167
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,080
Practice hard.

168
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,990
The next Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament is imminent.

169
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,830
You might get a chance.

170
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,540
Thank you, Senior.

171
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,000
But

172
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,710
why did they seal this place?

173
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,110
It's all because of

174
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,380
the Lunar Epiphyllum flowers Chief Nan wants...

175
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,760
I advise you not to pry.

176
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,920
Don't run around

177
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,550
in case you get into trouble.

178
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,750
Mother.

179
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,690
Don't cry.

180
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,730
Don't cry.

181
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,160
Who is your mother?

182
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,570
Mother.

183
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,010
Look.

184
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,580
Uncle gave this to me.

185
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,500
You are Yan?

186
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,050
Mother, how do you know?

187
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,490
Yan.

188
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,460
When you were still in my womb,

189
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,960
I'd already

190
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,300
named you.

191
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,400
I didn't expect

192
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,840
my Yan

193
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,670
to be so beautiful.

194
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,240
I also know

195
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,630
you've come from 100 years from now,

196
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,030
right?

197
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,230
Mother.

198
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,090
Have you met him?

199
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,640
Is he your beloved?

200
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,010
Why are you frowning again?

201
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,220
Did he bully you?

202
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,060
Did he fall for someone else?

203
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,950
Then he must be possessed.

204
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,070
Do you want some tips from me?

205
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,050
They're useful.

206
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,430
Teach me then.

207
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,510
if someone close to me

208
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,060
is possessed

209
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,360
and can't return,

210
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,480
what should I do?

211
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,490
Kiss him.

212
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,830
What if...

213
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,450
it doesn't work?

214
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,860
Kiss him hard.

215
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,150
Those who are possessed

216
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,820
kill without batting an eye.

217
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,040
Your life is more important.

218
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,310
You have to kiss even if it's dishonest.

219
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,660
You're smiling.

220
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,680
That's right.

221
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,720
Your smile is

222
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,950
as beautiful as mine.

223
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,310
Come on.

224
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,460
Mother.

225
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,180
I found you

226
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,180
by entering the Retrograde Bone-Deep Mirror

227
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,190
this time.

228
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,660
I'd guessed it more or less.

229
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,670
It is said that this mirror

230
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,530
can predict the past and present.

231
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,520
The fated one can go back to the past

232
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,480
through it

233
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,360
and even participate in the past.

234
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,230
You came to me this time.

235
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,960
But in 100 years,

236
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,300
I...

237
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,650
I'd be dead?

238
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't be sad.

239
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,550
Everyone dies.

240
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,280
Besides,

241
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,010
I've lived for 100 years.

242
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,120
It's enough.

243
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,480
But Mother,

244
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,370
you were killed.

245
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,570
Someone is trying to harm you.

246
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,730
Someone...

247
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,010
seized my heart?

248
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,870
Who seized your heart?

249
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,660
Yan.

250
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,040
I haven't told anyone

251
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,050
I've cultivated the spirit heart.

252
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,660
The Nirvana spirit heart

253
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,950
is

254
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,200
immortal.

255
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,030
Everyone in the cultivation realm wants immortality.

256
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,320
The Nirvana spirit heart

257
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,180
can transcend the limit of death.

258
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,770
If someone

259
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,240
knows about this heart,

260
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm afraid

261
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,270
there will be a fight to the death for it.

262
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,370
Right now,

263
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,860
I don't know who it is.

264
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,350
Mother.

265
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,460
I just want you to be safe.

266
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,650
I want us to return to Lunar Town

267
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,930
and live peacefully

268
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,000
like we did in the past,

269
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,830
okay?

270
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,310
Chief Nan.

271
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,510
Why did you

272
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,200
invite me here?

273
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,830
Master.

274
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,760
I know you've

275
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,710
long cultivated into a supreme being.

276
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,310
You must've already deduced

277
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,720
that I've refined

278
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,390
an immortal spirit heart.

279
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,720
A few days ago,

280
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,350
I went to hang out with Han.

281
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,140
I saw a mirror at his place.

282
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,750
It revealed that

283
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,040
I have a short lifespan.

284
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,110
Everything in the world

285
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,590
has a limited lifespan.

286
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,060
You caught a glimpse

287
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,490
of your death date by chance.

288
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,510
Even if you knew,

289
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,510
it couldn't be changed.

290
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,800
What if

291
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,160
I insist on changing it?

292
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,670
Your life and death

293
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,950
will implicate all beings in the cultivation realm.

294
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,490
But if you go against Heaven,

295
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,680
you'll suffer backlash.

296
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,470
Those who try to overturn life and death...

297
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,880
will definitely fail.

298
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,410
Yan.

299
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,620
In my life,

300
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,460
I've caused a lot of trouble

301
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,760
and killed many people.

302
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,290
I've never been afraid.

303
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,600
But since I had you,

304
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,100
I've only hoped

305
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,850
for my past karma

306
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,140
to not impede you.

307
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,540
Bone-Deep Mirror

308
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,660
is not a place for you to stay.

309
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
After you go back,

310
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,569
remember to let go of the past.

311
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,619
You must stay away from the disputes in the cultivation realm.

312
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,520
Mother!

313
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,349
Go live a normal life.

314
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,359
Yan.

315
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,670
Actually,

316
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,750
I've already figured out this divination.

317
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,720
Don't worry.

318
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,520
Even if it's fate,

319
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,830
I'm not one

320
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,010
to be manipulated by others.

321
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,830
Mother!

322
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,060
Mother!

323
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,610
Why are you here?

324
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,040
There are many rumors in the cultivation realm

325
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,240
that you eloped with Young Dragon Lord.

326
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,790
Such rumors

327
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,100
must be spread

328
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,470
by Mu Guanghan.

329
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,180
I heard even

330
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,220
your wedding gown's made.

331
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,390
He said he'd only marry me.

332
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,110
So I pulled out Phoenix's feathers

333
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,370
to let him weave a gown.

334
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,470
When his sight has deteriorated,

335
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,980
I doubt he'd be interested in me anymore.

336
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,550
Aren't you worried that teasing the future Dragon Lord

337
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,220
would breed gossip?

338
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,830
Are you jealous?

339
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,680
No such thing.

340
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,530
If you admit it,

341
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,270
I'll give this

342
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,510
to you.

343
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,190
This is...

344
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,130
Nine-eyed Seven-starred Jade.

345
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,990
This is so precious.

346
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,550
How did you find it?

347
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,840
I dived to the bottom of Nancang Sea

348
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,550
to find it.

349
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,230
Then I asked a craftsman in Dragon Capital

350
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,560
to refine it for 49 days

351
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,030
with the fire from the depths of the earth's veins,

352
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,690
supervising it day and night.

353
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,220
It was so painstaking that my hair turned white.

354
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,720
Look.

355
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,320
Look.

356
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,800
Look carefully.

357
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,240
You're smiling.

358
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,480
You look so pretty when you smile.

359
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,930
Why do you always pull a long face?

360
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,950
You worked so hard

361
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,470
just to give it to me?

362
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,870
Love tokens are popular in the mortal world.

363
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,230
It's said that with a token,

364
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,470
hearts won't change.

365
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,870
Although it's a bit tacky,

366
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,990
I'm doing this willingly.

367
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,230
You don't want it?

368
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,770
I'll take it back then.

369
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,600
Rao.

370
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,790
Thank you.

371
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,460
Since you've received the token,

372
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,460
you

373
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,220
are mine.

374
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,150
I...

375
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,750
don't mean to be rude.

376
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,470
Chief.

377
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,350
Please think it through.

378
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,440
Don't worry.

379
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,600
I've ruminated

380
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,100
about this for a long time.

381
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,210
At this point,

382
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,050
you should just be more open-minded.

383
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,650
Why are you so sleepy lately?

384
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,430
I just ate the Dream Tracing flower.

385
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,670
You were disturbing my beautiful dream.

386
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,610
Dream Tracing flower?

387
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,330
Were you reminiscing about the past?

388
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,440
Rao.

389
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,920
I know you haven't

390
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,320
accepted any engagement

391
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,080
because you don't want to be bound by rules.

392
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,380
But I don't want to be conflicted anymore.

393
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,460
Let me marry you.

394
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,060
At such a young age,

395
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,540
you already want a spouse.

396
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,840
Don't you want to transcend realms and ascend to Heaven?

397
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,150
For a man with great ambition,

398
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,670
a spouse impedes him.

399
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,920
A spouse you love

400
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,580
is also the obstacle to ascending to Heaven.

401
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,350
The Great Path is emotionless,

402
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,040
but

403
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,200
I'm not.

404
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,230
Rao.

405
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,140
Do you agree or not?

406
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,190
As long as

407
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,250
you treat me and my child well,

408
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,600
I'll agree.

409
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,260
Premier, you're here.

410
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,300
Rest in peace, my friend.

411
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,980
Who is in the Bone-Deep Mirror?

412
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,600
The rebel Shao Cang.

413
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,600
Also,

414
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,250
I don't know

415
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,270
how there are two spirit pearls.

416
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,020
I'm not asking you.

417
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,650
The former monarch

418
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,570
did go into the Bone-Deep Mirror.

419
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,320
Since Great Path Sect is tainted,

420
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
let me settle this

421
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,670
once and for all.

422
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,580
What's wrong?

423
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,040
You don't want this daughter?

424
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,240
Daughter?

425
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,610
My Chongming Bird clan

426
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,950
only have girls,

427
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,910
not boys.

428
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,640
Do you mean we have a daughter?

429
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,750
Rao.

430
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,810
There's something

431
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,450
I've been keeping from you.

432
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,270
I've...

433
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,420
cultivated a heart.

434
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,630
This heart

435
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,990
is

436
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,640
immortal.

437
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,690
It's a treasure

438
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,370
and a disaster.

439
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,050
I wouldn't be afraid before.

440
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,420
But now,

441
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,730
I have Yan.

442
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,540
I'm afraid

443
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,960
someone taking my heart

444
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,970
would hurt her.

445
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,500
How do you know

446
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,530
you'd lose your heart?

447
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,230
I saw Yan.

448
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,950
She went into

449
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,360
the Retrograde Bone-Deep Mirror too?

450
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,800
You're not him.

451
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,170
You're the Ying Zewei 100 years from now.

452
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,870
I...

453
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,940
Lightning decay?

454
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,380
This is the Heart-Destroying Curse.

455
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,790
It's a

456
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,300
bone-devouring blood curse

457
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,700
that's extremely cruel.

458
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,710
Only those with intense love or hate

459
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,560
can plant it.

460
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,660
With this curse,

461
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,210
once feelings grow,

462
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,030
the lightning attack will be triggered upon touch

463
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,890
and your bones and flesh will rot.

464
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:36,990
This curse...

465
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,980
was planted by me,

466
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,270
right?

467
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,080
What did you do to me?

468
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,480
Why did I do this to you?

469
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,350
You stole my heart.

470
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:57,950
Master.

471
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,320
It seems you are

472
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,940
the future heir of Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea.

473
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,740
Go.

474
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,890
Altering the wheel of life

475
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,200
is also another kind of fate

476
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,290
after all.

477
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,420
Thank you, Master.

478
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,820
Will you kill me?

479
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,630
Rao.

480
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,800
I have feelings for you.

481
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,900
You know it better than anyone.

482
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,690
So,

483
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,510
you'd even benevolently spare my life.

484
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,240
I didn't expect

485
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,800
the fate I want to change

486
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,960
is between you and me.

487
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,780
Good.

488
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,630
Very good.

489
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,120
As Master said,

490
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,990
you're indeed

491
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,240
the most outstanding disciple throughout the ages.

492
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,690
Rao.

493
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,750
Heart of the Six Realms,

494
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,470
Red Emperor's Heart,

495
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,890
and Zen Heart of Brahma Bones.

496
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,350
With three hearts united,

497
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,330
I can renounce the world and ascend to heaven,

498
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,020
truly breaking the barrier of the world.

499
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,250
But the chances are slim.

500
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,340
Rao.

501
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,960
Please guide me.

502
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,620
Should I choose to ascend on my own

503
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,860
or...

504
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,740
Ying Zewei.

505
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,890
If you seize my heart,

506
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,610
I will use all my might

507
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,250
to make an oath to the God of Life and Death.

508
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,130
In this life,

509
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,290
everyone you love

510
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,330
will suffer the pain of Heart-Destroying Curse,

511
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,730
which can't be undone forever!

512
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,300
I finally understand.

513
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,530
Even if the wheel of life is altered,

514
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,440
you won't forgive me.

515
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,710
Traitor.

516
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,480
So you're the one who killed Chief Nan.

517
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,670
Chief Nan.

518
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,250
Mother!

519
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,320
Mother.

520
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,960
Mother.

521
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,950
Mother.

522
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,770
[Bone-Deep Prison]

523
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,470
Shao Cang.

524
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,050
Are you still unrepentant?

525
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,240
My mistake is

526
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,620
not expecting

527
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,110
that you're the one trying

528
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,110
to overturn the cultivation realm.

529
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,030
I should be the best master in the world.

530
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,250
A master going against the path.

531
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,230
Then let the immortals and demons fight you together.

532
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,480
The immortal

533
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,290
Nirvana spirit heart?

534
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,630
You seized

535
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,560
Chief Nan's Nirvana spirit heart,

536
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,060
so you won't die.

537
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,110
Do you think

538
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,670
you can change everything

539
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,110
by entering Retrograde Bone-Deep Mirror?

540
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,780
It's just a waste of time.

541
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,700
No one can change

542
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,510
the past.

543
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,600
Not only are you two stupid,

544
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,580
that old Meng was

545
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,600
persistent too.

546
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,930
He thought he could revive Nan Rao.

547
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,250
Sword Master was also bewitched by you?

548
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,890
He was too obsessed.

549
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,680
He failed to win Nan Rao's heart back then.

550
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,770
After Nan Rao died,

551
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,600
he became even more obsessed.

552
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,790
You want me to use the resurrection spell?

553
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,120
This is the Great Path's forbidden spell.

554
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,670
I heard that before Master's ascension,

555
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,170
he taught you the forbidden spell.

556
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,260
Your wife's death

557
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,920
is a matter of Great Path Sect

558
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,700
and my Sword Sect has no right to intervene,

559
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,270
but there was

560
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,570
great camaraderie between Rao and I.

561
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,200
I can't

562
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,110
accept her

563
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,920
sudden unexplained death.

564
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,550
Please grant my wish, Premier.

565
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,470
I've thought about using

566
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,890
the resurrection spell.

567
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,110
Nan Rao is from Chongming Clan,

568
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,890
which has the secret treasure of Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

569
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,800
If it's opened by the hairpin,

570
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,000
there's a slim chance

571
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,290
of reviving Nan Rao

572
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,480
in Retrograde Bone-Deep Mirror.

573
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,980
She can cultivate a spiritual crystal

574
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,110
to sustain her life.

575
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,150
But it was lost

576
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,350
after Nan Rao

577
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,410
went to Filth Valley

578
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,670
to reinforce its seal.

579
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,240
The Blood Phoenix Hairpin's

580
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,700
whereabouts are unknown.

581
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,140
I'll try

582
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,010
to find it.

583
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:26,970
But...

584
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,680
If you use the forbidden spell

585
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,280
and violate the sect's law,

586
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,490
it may even harm the cultivation realm.

587
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,990
Once the forbidden spell is activated,

588
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,650
there will be no turning back.

589
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,280
I'll swear on this sword.

590
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,690
Let me cast

591
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,600
the forbidden resurrection spell.

592
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,200
Have you thought it through?

593
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,340
You knew from the start

594
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,560
that it was

595
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,370
impossible to revive Chief Nan.

596
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,690
Why did you lie to him?

597
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,690
It's easier to use

598
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,680
a sincere person.

599
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,310
What exactly do you want?

600
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,070
It's the same for the Heart of the Six Realms, right?

601
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,140
You'd mentored me for many years,

602
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,570
urging me to cultivate the Heart of the Six Realms...

603
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,270
It was just to get the elixir.

604
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,440
In the sky of the Great Path,

605
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,200
the monarch is akin to the sun and the moon.

606
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,030
Becoming the monarch

607
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,540
is just your beginning.

608
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,320
When you're enlightened of the righteous path

609
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,650
and cultivate the Heart of the Six Realms,

610
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,290
as your master,

611
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,780
I'd have no regrets.

612
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,190
Shao Cang!

613
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,270
What did you do?

614
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,990
Explain it to me!

615
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:53,950
I...

616
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,700
Master.

617
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,880
I didn't do this.
