00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,710
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,310
You'd better think carefully.

5
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,230
Is the life of these two young masters

6
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,289
more important...

7
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,289
or your pearl?

8
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,980
Yan...

9
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,539
You have to make your act convincing.

10
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,780
Yan!

11
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,979
Don't give her the pearl!

12
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,229
I've caused you

13
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,590
so much trouble for this pearl.

14
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,300
Now,

15
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,810
you can't give away the pearl

16
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,390
for me!

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,840
Let him go!

18
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:50,120
My patience is limited.

19
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,380
It's up to you.

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,860
If you won't give me the pearl,

21
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,960
I won't be nice.

22
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,690
She's not at the Lunar Sect?

23
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,800
Did that fox

24
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,350
lure her down the mountain?

25
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,320
The Elder of Evil Path Sect, Die Wan.

26
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,070
It seems that

27
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,040
she won't give up

28
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,690
unless she gets the pearl.

29
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,320
Two!

30
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,570
I'll give it to you.

31
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,230
You're smart.

32
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,070
What a good treasure.

33
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:21,960
I've given you the pearl. Why aren't you letting them go?

34
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,310
Didn’t we agree

35
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,800
as long as you get Lord Shao Cang and the silver mermaid pearl,

36
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,350
you will let us go?

37
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,700
Since you're here,

38
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,880
why don't you

39
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,430
be my puppet.

40
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,550
I

41
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,180
will treat you well.

42
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,329
How dare you use poison?

43
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,430
Just matching your pace.

44
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,910
If I really believed you,

45
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,140
I would be a fool.

46
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,770
Well done, Nan Yan!

47
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:58,950
Very well.

48
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,030
Leave this shrew to me.

49
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,040
I'll show her

50
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,530
Sun Fire Fairy's power!

51
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,850
Don't...

52
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,560
Don’t forget

53
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,269
this is my place.

54
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,450
There will be a way to deal with you.

55
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,750
If you want to live, don't move.

56
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,820
Otherwise, you'll die on the spot

57
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,260
from the Magic Candle.

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,490
You can't blame me for that then.

59
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,800
Before you show off,

60
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,930
why don't you check your wrist first?

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,240
If this poison

62
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,470
spread to your heart,

63
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,780
you're likely to be the first

64
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:51,670
to die.

65
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,590
How about you

66
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,120
remove the formation first?

67
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,330
Then, I can consider

68
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,370
detoxifying you.

69
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,070
Ridiculous.

70
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,160
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

71
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,870
I do.

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,480
I believe you.

73
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,570
I'll kill you!

74
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,610
Yan!

75
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,830
Little Fox!

76
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,470
I'm the karma talisman,

77
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,320
an enlightened genie!

78
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,390
Looks like she has

79
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,750
fully digested the Seven Sins Manual.

80
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,810
With this power...

81
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,610
Why don't I take this opportunity

82
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,140
to remove the demon subduing magic in her body

83
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,310
and eradicate this thread

84
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,450
for the Demon Clan?

85
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,780
Nan Yan...

Ji Yang.

103
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,930
Be careful! It's poisonous.

104
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,030
It's fine.

105
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,370
Let me do it.

106
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,300
Roaming and singing like a song across the wilderness,

107
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,340
with the sword's energy sweeping away all the world's evil.

108
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,370
Shao Cang.

109
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,530
I couldn't find you anywhere.

110
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,630
But you have just been beside me.

111
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,730
Are you sure that sick man

112
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,750
is Lord Shao Cang?

113
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,510
Nonsense! What sick man?

114
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,870
If you dare to disrespect the Lord,

115
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,990
I'll cut off your Internal Elixir

116
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,790
for Nan Yan to make guiding drug.

117
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,040
Singing while traversing the heavens...

118
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,880
There can only be one person in the world.

119
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,410
He must be Shao Cang!

120
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,100
It must be him. No doubt!

121
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,820
No wonder Yan kept reminding me

122
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,710
to hide the life-saving talisman

123
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,510
Chief gave me.

124
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,700
So it's because...

125
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,190
You're saying...

126
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,350
Nan Yan knew since a long time ago!

127
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,750
They're in cahoots to hide it from me.

128
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,470
The person I want to see the most

129
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,390
has just been by my side,

130
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,110
but it was kept a secret from me.

131
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,640
How could they do that to me!

132
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:19,590
Cang...

133
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,440
My Cang...

134
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,530
Do you have any discomfort?

135
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
I think I have a headache.

136
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,140
Let me see.

137
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,310
No need.

138
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,350
No need.

139
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,150
It seems...

140
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,050
it doesn't hurt anymore.

141
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,370
Are you okay?

142
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,400
Did you get hurt just now?

143
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,320
I'm fine.

144
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,080
I got you into trouble.

145
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,060
If it weren't for me,

146
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,340
you wouldn't be in such danger.

147
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,110
I...

148
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,740
I'm fine.

149
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,220
Look.

150
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,510
Do you regret

151
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,560
meeting me?

152
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,830
No.

153
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,120
Without you,

154
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,630
I would have been killed

155
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,490
by the Demon Clan at Filth Valley.

156
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,450
No Holy Master can save me.

157
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,760
Without you,

158
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,170
my climbing fig tree would've withered.

159
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,360
How could there be a spirit rain

160
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,730
to revive it?

161
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,370
So,

162
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,320
you went all the way

163
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,820
to Die Wan,

164
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,870
not caring that you expose your identity,

165
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,640
just

166
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,560
for a fight?

167
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,790
Well...

168
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,150
As a patient,

169
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,240
I should protect my physician.

170
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,220
Since you

171
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,380
value me so much,

172
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,350
can I

173
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,740
make

174
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,530
a bold guess?

175
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,270
What...

176
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,050
are you trying to say?

177
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,310
I want to say...

178
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,910
actually,

179
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,270
your so-called death curse

180
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,590
is fake.

181
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,099
Actually,

182
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,050
there's no such thing.

183
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,160
Nan Yan,

184
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,589
have I been too nice

185
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,940
to you these days?

186
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,829
My Lord.

187
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,520
Go ahead.

188
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,000
My Lord.

189
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,450
Actually...

190
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,490
you were wronged, right?

191
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,090
That day in the bamboo forest,

192
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,630
you didn't kill any

193
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,630
the disciple of the Great Path Sect.

194
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,760
Why do you think so?

195
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,150
I saw it with my own eyes.

196
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,080
So,

197
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,220
I guess

198
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,770
in your heart,

199
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,710
there is something more important

200
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,840
than anything else.

201
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,200
Something that you have to achieve

202
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,270
even if you have to be criticized

203
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,260
or go through much troubles for.

204
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,850
So,

205
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,560
you don't explain to anyone

206
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,940
nor is there a need to,

207
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,560
walking on this path

208
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,270
alone.

209
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,650
My Lord.

210
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,880
From now on,

211
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,870
you don't have to hide anything in front of me.

212
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,440
Just do as you wish.

213
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,950
I don't know

214
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,370
where you're going

215
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,690
and what you want to do.

216
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,070
But

217
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,190
I've decided.

218
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,340
I'm willing

219
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,190
to go with you.

220
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,990
Do you know

221
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,030
what troubles what you just said

222
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,720
would

223
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,750
bring you?

224
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,840
My Lord.

225
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,230
You helped me so much.

226
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,360
Of course I won’t

227
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,590
mind these troubles.

228
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,590
From now on,

229
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,460
we're people who have gone through life and death situations before.

230
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,080
Leave your illness to me.

231
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,150
I will repay your kindness

232
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,870
in tens and hundreds of times.

233
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,770
As for your identity,

234
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,160
I will never

235
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,530
tell anyone.

236
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,110
Here.

237
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,480
Acupuncture again?

238
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,630
By the way,

239
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,330
these days,

240
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,180
you must not abuse your spiritual power.

241
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,160
You must have a good rest.

242
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,710
You can't starve, tire yourself out

243
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,600
nor get angry.

244
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,710
In particular,

245
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,350
don't fight with that little fox.

246
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,100
Got it?

247
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,770
I'll listen to you.

248
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,830
But,

249
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,310
leaving that fox alone isn't included.

250
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,530
What is this?

251
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,570
Have a look.

252
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,910
[Xiangxiang]

253
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,460
This is Xiangxiang?

254
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,910
I'll remember your kindness

255
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,980
for saving my life.

256
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,950
Take it as a souvenir.

257
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,610
Seems like

258
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,790
you're not that good at woodwork.

259
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,310
Master has never taught it to me.

260
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,510
I learned it myself.

261
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,140
Thanks!

262
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,690
Although it's ugly,

263
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,680
I...

264
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,800
like it!

265
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,270
By the way,

266
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,960
what do you want for dinner?

267
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,780
Bronze cauldron hotpot.

268
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,630
Okay.

269
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,270
Her cultivation level is too low now.

270
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,230
She can't take on

271
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,390
Seven Sins Manual.

272
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,340
It's time for her to be able to protect herself.

273
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,590
She asked me to get the soup base

274
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,050
but disappeared herself.

275
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,370
Why is there only vegetables?

276
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,910
We went through so much.

277
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,440
Shouldn't we celebrate it.

278
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,030
Yes.

279
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,840
There are only vegetables.

280
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,570
Because we are going to

281
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,820
slice you up

282
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,120
for our hotpot.

283
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,070
How's that?

284
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,340
We prepared this for you.

285
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,170
It's the biggest plate we have.

286
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,050
Do you like it?

287
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,400
Why do you need such a big plate for?

288
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,580
For fox meat.

289
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,270
Uh...

290
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,680
We just survived

291
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,070
such a dangerous situation together just now.

292
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,300
It's inappropriate

293
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,760
for you to burn bridges.

294
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,880
Exactly.

295
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,550
As we cross the river, you're burning the bridge.

296
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,750
It'd be a miracle to not get into any dangerous situation.

297
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,670
It's fine that you turned your back on me,

298
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,270
but now you're still accusing me, an innocent.

299
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:10,900
Hey...

300
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,780
Tell me then.

301
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,780
Why did Elder Die Wan

302
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,750
take a liking

303
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,240
to my pearl?

304
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,640
I...

305
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,500
Could it be

306
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,190
you colluded

307
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,320
with that demoness

308
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,440
to put on a show.

309
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,970
You want Nan Yan's pearl,

310
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,300
and she wants Lord Shao Cang's life.

311
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,860
No.

312
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:37,920
Yan...

313
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,520
It's fine

314
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,230
that they don't trust me.

315
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,630
Why do you suspect me too?

316
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:42,970
I...

317
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,300
I'm so sad.

318
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,400
Fine...

319
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,670
I'll leave.

320
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,980
Leave? You want to run?

321
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,450
If I don't cook you today,

322
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,670
you can't go anywhere.

323
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,760
Don't...

324
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,530
But it's not a festival.

325
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,940
We can't finish eating

326
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,290
such a big fox.

327
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,490
It's okay.

328
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,190
Just turn him back to his original form.

329
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,000
His original form?

330
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,860
But he'd be too cute.

331
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,150
How can I bear to kill him?

332
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,760
Yan... Yan...

333
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,820
Please spare me.

334
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,430
I...

335
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,240
I'm just a weak person.

336
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,540
Please spare my life.

337
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,270
How about...

338
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,800
I will live as a fox

339
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,990
for the rest of my life

340
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,230
and make you happy every day,

341
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,030
making your worries disappear.

342
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,670
Forget it.

343
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,320
We just wanted to scare you.

344
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,950
This soup smells so good.

345
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,910
I don't want his fox fur

346
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,130
to get into my pot.

347
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,230
If it weren't for the fact that

348
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,990
you saved Nan Yan,

349
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,790
I would have killed you long ago.

350
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:41,950
Come on.

351
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,150
Sit down, everyone.

352
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,090
Time to eat.

353
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,090
Sit over there.

354
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,160
Be careful.

355
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,620
Here.

356
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,060
Little Fox.

357
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,520
Did it hurt when you fell

358
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,960
trying to save me today?

359
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,750
It hurt so much.

360
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,960
Eat more meat

361
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,250
and nourish yourself.

362
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,840
I'll go get the meat.

363
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,200
I haven't told you

364
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,300
where the meat is.

365
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,260
I have a sharp nose.

366
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,150
Go.

367
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,670
Why are you looking at me like that?

368
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,510
This darn fox

369
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,520
is full of evil ideas.

370
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,530
It’s fine that you don’t trust him.

371
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,720
I’m loyal to Lord Shao Cang.

372
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,410
Why did you hide it from me too?

373
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,990
I’m afraid he

374
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,900
would want to kill you.

375
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,620
Yes.

376
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,020
Why didn't you tell him?

377
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,100
Why not?

378
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,470
Don't you know why?

379
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,960
Forget it.

380
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,460
Don't bother explaining.

381
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,850
In that case,

382
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,430
I can only say that...

383
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
you did a good job.

384
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,060
I didn't understand at first.

385
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,530
Then I figured it out.

386
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,030
You wouldn't even let

387
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,350
your best friend in on it.

388
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,480
What does that mean?

389
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,640
It means you really care about

390
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,550
his safety!

391
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,970
After all,

392
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,260
it's less dangerous

393
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,180
for less people to know about it.

394
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,020
Why are you staring at me?

395
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,950
Didn't I already

396
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,290
explain it clearly?

397
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,890
All right, it's fine. Come on.

398
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,690
Bring the meat. Time to eat meat.

399
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,180
Wait.

400
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,390
Today,

401
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,630
I prepared this meal

402
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,970
to ask everyone for a favor.

403
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,550
Now the four of us

404
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,310
are

405
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,510
on the same boat.

406
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,480
If Ji Yang's identity is exposed,

407
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,270
the four of us

408
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,430
will suffer.

409
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,430
Of course.

410
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,030
If you dare to betray Lord Shao Cang,

411
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,510
I will–

412
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,640
I'm not that stupid.

413
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,240
I hope so.

414
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,630
All right, time for the meat!

415
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,160
Here.

416
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,250
I just realized

417
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,720
this is a split pot.

418
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,360
Yes.

419
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,430
The spicy broth is refreshing and the mushroom broth is flavorful.

420
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,030
They both have their merits.

421
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,200
Most importantly,

422
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,930
he

423
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,430
can’t eat spicy food.

424
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,470
All right.

425
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,300
Here.

426
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:35,880
Come.

427
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,020
A piece of

428
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,420
duck blood for each of us.

429
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,050
Come on.

430
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,960
No more, no less.

431
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,130
I announce

432
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,120
from now on,

433
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,290
we are tied in

434
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,470
a blood oath.

435
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,600
If anyone dares to

436
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,080
expose Lord Shao Chang,

437
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,160
you will be killed!

438
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,090
Eat!

439
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,900
You even like duck blood now?

440
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,470
Is there anything

441
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,920
I don't eat here?

442
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,050
I won.

443
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,100
Pay up.

444
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,680
Nice one, Meng.

445
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,100
You've improved.

446
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,910
It's all thanks to Yingying.

447
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,880
She gave me a guide book.

448
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,600
It's really useful.

449
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,970
You have to be careful from now on.

450
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,910
Meng,

451
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,380
do you know

452
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,670
who wrote that?

453
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,920
Who cares about that

454
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,560
as long as it's useful.

455
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,350
You'd better study it well,

456
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,450
or you'd embarrass the author.

457
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,930
Of course.

458
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,150
I’m the God of Wealth is with me today.

459
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,280
I must win more money.

460
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,890
I won.

461
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,760
So fast.

462
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,540
Is it big?

463
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,800
Just so-so.

464
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,620
Pure hand.

465
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,720
A pair of sevens.

466
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,230
It's all because you kept talking to me,

467
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,690
causing me to be careless.

468
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,690
You've read the guide book.

469
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,710
Don't you know

470
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,310
the highest level of mahjong

471
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,820
is diversion?

472
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,440
How do you know?

473
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,600
I forgot to tell you.

474
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,300
I wrote that guide book anonymously

475
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,430
cause I was bored.

476
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,310
Why do you

477
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,890
hold grudges so much?

478
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,590
Look at Little Fox.

479
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,910
He also helped a lot.

480
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,680
He didn't complain at all.

481
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,200
That's because

482
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,430
I always remember how good you are to me.

483
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,470
Yeah, right.

484
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,700
Eat more, Little Fox.

485
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,650
[Dragon Lord: Mu Guanghan]

486
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,050
Father?

487
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,140
Why are you here?

488
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,120
Ting.

489
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,200
Father, come over.

490
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:23,960
Come.

491
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,770
Father.

492
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,630
Let me introduce.

493
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,810
They are...

494
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,590
They are all members

495
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,240
of my poetry club.

496
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,000
This is

497
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,390
my best friend, Ji Yang.

498
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,990
This is my partner, Nan Yang.

499
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,300
Sir.

500
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,730
This...

501
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,800
This is my spirit pet.

502
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,970
Very well.

503
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,120
Father.

504
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,290
We are improvising poems.

505
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,160
How about I compose one for you?

506
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,230
You can compose poems?

507
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,320
Father, listen.

508
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,550
As the saying goes:

509
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,880
"Cook the split hot pot on low heat,

510
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,690
one can have both spicy and non-spicy broth.

511
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,260
I have my buddies everywhere,

512
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,220
it doesn't matter if it's two or three of them."

513
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,150
-Good!
-Good!

514
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:16,930
Good poem.

515
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,430
Good poem.

516
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,080
It's really a good poem.

517
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,110
Ting...

518
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,810
I didn't expect...

519
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,660
you could improvise poetry so easily!

520
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,460
Father.

521
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,070
It's all my fault.

522
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,150
I shouldn't have forced you to learn martial arts.

523
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:35,750
What a waste of your

524
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,910
literature talent.

525
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:40,910
Ting.

526
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,220
From now on,

527
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,610
I will leave you alone.

528
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,440
Go on your own path!

529
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,150
Father.

530
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,390
Father, you finally understand me.

531
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,270
You should have

532
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,270
told me earlier.

533
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,870
Father.

534
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,340
Why

535
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,130
do you have to endure until now?

536
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,510
Father, you finally understand me.

537
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,240
Father.

538
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,920
Father!

539
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,490
Father!

540
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,180
Are they drunk?

541
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,040
Little Fox.

542
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,150
Where did you

543
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,570
get this mushroom from?

544
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,790
From the backyard.

545
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,150
I asked you to use the dried mushrooms.

546
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,430
Who asked you to pick them?

547
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,550
These mushrooms are poisonous.

548
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,950
They can only be eaten after they are dried.

549
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,850
Will... Will we die?

550
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,430
We won't die.

551
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,890
But...

552
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,230
We will faint.

553
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,570
You treated me well.

554
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,280
Unfortunately,

555
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,190
I have to do this.

556
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,660
You saved me this time.

557
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,150
After I use the silver mermaid pearl,

558
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,350
I'll return it to you.

559
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,570
You're the same old.

560
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,710
Yan,

561
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,930
what do you mean?

562
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,990
Stop pretending.

563
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,960
Think you can use poison

564
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,140
on me?

565
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,790
You used these mushrooms

566
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,120
on purpose, right?

567
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,550
And you got Mu Zhanting

568
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,880
to pluck them together.

569
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,220
You haven't touched

570
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,240
the mushroom soup at all all night.

571
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,430
How dare you say it wasn't premeditated?

572
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,850
Yan, I'm innocent.

573
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,640
I grew up in Xichuan's Qingqiu.

574
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,230
I grew up eating spicy food.

575
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,360
The mushroom soup

576
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,270
is too bland for me.

577
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,240
I’d rather not have it.

578
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,960
Then why did you summon your

579
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,690
spiritual power just now?

580
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,760
I wanted to wake you up.

581
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,630
I didn't expect you...

582
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,290
You didn't expect that I wasn't poisoned at all.

583
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:00,950
Come!

584
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,000
Let's have

585
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,730
a duck blood

586
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,550
each.

587
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,280
Here.

588
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:15,610
Yan.

589
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,159
I'm glad you're fine.

590
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,409
If anything happened to you,

591
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,429
I would feel so bad.

592
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,620
Still denying it?

593
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,000
Tell me.

594
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,929
Why did you poison us?

595
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,920
To...

596
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,040
borrow your silver mermaid pearl.

597
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,510
I will return it immediately after using it.

598
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,110
I never wanted to

599
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,949
harm you.

600
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,040
You have been so persistant about it.

601
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,350
What are you trying to do with

602
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,880
this silver mermaid pearl?

603
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,989
To obtain the ancient magic,

604
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,150
Seven Sins Manual.

605
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,790
However, this thing

606
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,630
is hidden deep in the Filth Valley.

607
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,650
Rumor has it that

608
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,750
there is a kind of evil called Yin Zhu

609
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,710
that appears frequently

610
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,010
to devour souls.

611
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,490
That's so scary.

612
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,670
Only with a magical tool like the silver mermaid pearl

613
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,230
that can hide one's scent,

614
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,310
can one

615
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,180
possibly escape.

616
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,100
Do you know

617
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,800
what I came to the North for

618
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,310
this time?

619
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,810
How would I know?

620
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,070
There's an extraordinary martial arts within Filth Valley.

621
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,310
Once one gets it, everyone will be killed

622
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,150
and the five states will fall together.

623
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,350
He's just a Dragon Lord.

624
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,410
What can he do to me?

625
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,230
Is he also looking for

626
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,090
the Seven Sins Manual?

627
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,160
What's so special about it?

628
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,420
Why does everyone want it?

629
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,590
A hundred years ago,

630
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,890
the Spirit Clan was defeated.

631
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,030
The Great Path Sect

632
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,790
formed a formation with the Heaven Path Sect,

633
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,060
merging the 46 paths,

634
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,390
to suppress thousands of spirits.

635
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,790
To break this formation,

636
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,070
one would need to find a magic skill

637
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,480
that is beyond

638
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,540
the 46 paths.

639
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,630
Are you trying to use

640
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,890
this Seven Sins Manual

641
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,490
to break the Spirit-Sealing Formation?

642
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,180
But many people

643
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,480
would be after this

644
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,490
powerful skill.

645
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,350
Even if you have the silver mermaid pearl,

646
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,730
you may not succeed.

647
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,080
For my people,

648
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,230
even if I have to risk my life,

649
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,270
I have to try it.

650
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,060
Do you remember I told you

651
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,800
my parents died young.

652
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,230
My only family, my sister,

653
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,430
who brought me up

654
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,310
is also now within the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

655
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,820
These are all true.

656
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,720
However,

657
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,990
the 100-year sentence is up.

658
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,510
But Great Path Sect went back on their words

659
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,830
and refused to release the spirits.

660
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,240
I can only do it

661
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,290
on my own.

662
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,640
Do you know the consequences if you lie?

663
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,530
I swear with my life.

664
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,430
The fox clan

665
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,790
is still suffering

666
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,510
in the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

667
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,510
I will never lie to you

668
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,040
about something like this.

669
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,430
I had no choice

670
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,670
but to do something like this

671
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,790
today.

672
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,470
But I did let down

673
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,510
your trust in me.

674
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,350
I made a huge mistake.

675
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,750
Please,

676
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,580
on the sake of my clan,

677
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,950
let me live.

678
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,700
Hearing what you said,

679
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,230
I can sympathize

680
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,090
with with happened to you.

681
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,370
You want to save your clan,

682
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,030
just like how I want to

683
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,230
cure my mother's

684
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,130
heart disease.

685
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,960
But my pearl

686
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,360
is a gift from my mother.

687
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,850
There's no reason for me to give it to you.

688
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,390
If what you said is true,

689
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,560
the Fox Clan should be released.

690
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,360
In the future,

691
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,220
if you really want to save your clan,

692
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,680
and have to use this pearl,

693
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,220
then I will...

694
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,130
lend it to you.

695
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,700
When the fox clan is released,

696
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,230
I will return the silver mermaid pearl

697
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,510
to you in perfect condition.

698
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,100
Besides,

699
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,880
I'm willing to spend the rest of my life

700
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,970
to follow you

701
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,390
and do everything

702
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,510
at your disposal.

703
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,230
Wait.

704
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,430
You kept calling me your sister.

705
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,720
But you just said

706
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,260
you haven't seen your sister for a 100 years.

707
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,080
How old are you?

708
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,110
Before I leave Lunar Sect,

709
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,010
I swore to keep this a secret.

710
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,290
So,

711
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,020
the secret you risked your life to protect

712
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,130
is that

713
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,830
you are a fox spirit

714
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,270
who's over 100 years old.

715
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,680
Not really...

716
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,670
Well...

717
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,800
Humans and spirits have

718
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,850
different lifespans.

719
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,480
Then

720
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,590
don't call me sister anymore.

721
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,250
It's weird.

722
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:42,750
Okay, sis.

723
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,650
Here.

724
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,160
The antidote.

725
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,350
Let me tell you.

726
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,330
It's not as easy

727
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,880
to convince Lord Shao Cang.

728
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,000
Why did you have to

729
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,040
provoke him?

730
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,070
Got it, Yan.

731
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,120
Lunar Sect has been recruiting recently.

732
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,930
In the future,

733
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,420
hire those with

734
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,150
big eyes, high nose bridge,

735
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,220
and tall height.

736
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,710
Someone who looks reliable

737
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,840
but is actually full of thoughts.

738
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,160
That's not recruiting for the sect

739
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,630
but for your son-in-law.

740
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,800
How about

741
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,000
recruiting me?

742
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,820
Victor.

743
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,200

♫Our promise under the umbrella♫
