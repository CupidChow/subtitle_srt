[Love's Rebellion]

3
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,660
[Episode 27]

4
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,970
Being hit by the five Demon-Subduing Nails

5
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,070
is equivalent to being confined to the Five Prisons.

6
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,440
The more nails you receive, the more excruciating it is.

7
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,830
It is more painful

8
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,660
than rebuilding your demon body

9
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,970
back then.

10
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,520
Can you handle it?

11
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,380
Again!

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,310
Who are you to

13
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,130
Ji Ming?

14
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,580
How are you able to suppress me?

15
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,710
Back then, even Ji Ming

16
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,140
couldn't get rid of me.

17
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,430
Do you think you can do that

18
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,820
with mere nails?

19
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,630
If you stop now,

20
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,150
I can spare your life!

21
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,470
Otherwise, I will turn you

22
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,750
into ashes!

23
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,840
Uncle, is that you?

24
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,200
This is a restriction set by the Great Path.

25
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,130
Your demonic aura is very obvious.

26
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,960
I'll go in alone.

27
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,070
You're injured.

28
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,960
Be careful.

29
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,140
Uncle...

30
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,900
Are you

31
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,780
Nan Yan?

32
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,560
Yes, I am Nan Yan.

33
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,090
You are my sister's descendant.

34
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,510
Uncle!

35
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,290
Good child.

36
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,810
As soon as you entered the formation,

37
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,950
I sensed that your aura was the same

38
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,150
as my sister's aura.

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,720
So I led the way with the sound of the Qin.

40
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,840
Uncle, your eyes...

41
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,010
I was born this way.

42
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,040
It's fine.

43
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,310
This shackle...

44
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,060
I released the Fox Clan without permission.

45
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,560
This is a small punishment from the Great Path.

46
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,410
However,

47
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,920
your two brothers

48
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,210
are very interesting.

49
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,960
I thank you on their behalf.

50
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,080
Those two boys

51
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,510
were good for my tempers.

52
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,320
If I hadn't met them,

53
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,950
we wouldn't have met.

54
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,460
In the end,

55
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,300
it's all fated to be.

56
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,750
Uncle, you must be

57
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,900
in pain like this.

58
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,770
Don't worry.

59
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,580
I've been trapped here for 100 years.

60
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,270
It doesn't matter if I'm shackled or not.

61
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,700
I wasn't considerate enough.

62
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,760
I didn't even know that

63
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,850
you are

64
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,390
the guardian of the

65
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,970
Spirit-Sealing Formation.

66
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,120
What Guardian?

67
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,240
It's just a punishment.

68
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,910
I see you have

69
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,810
great cultivation.

70
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,400
How did you end up

71
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,960
with such a punishment?

72
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,890
Back then,

73
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,790
I massacred the Linglong Capital.

74
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,850
I should have died for my crime.

75
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,940
My brother, Nan Yi,

76
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,620
is kind in nature.

77
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,480
As the elder sister,

78
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,370
I failed to teach him well.

79
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,760
I feel guilty.

80
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,730
Even if he did this,

81
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,760
I pray for the Great Path's mercy.

82
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,680
I...

83
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,650
I'm willing to bear the thunder punishment.

84
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,890
I will also take responsibility

85
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,980
for the Linglong Capital case.

86
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,550
Sister.

87
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,240
Sister, it's my fault.

88
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,710
It has nothing to do with you!

89
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,980
Go, Sister!

90
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,360
Go!

91
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,920
Sister!

92
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,000
Leave!

93
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,140
It was my sister who sought help

94
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,720
and my friend who was accused of

95
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,780
favoritism towards me

96
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,480
that I managed to stay alive

97
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,300
and atone for my sins here.

98
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,030
All these years,

99
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,560
Sister never contacted me.

100
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,150
I couldn't ask your two brothers

101
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,210
about it either.

102
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,310
Is she

103
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,700
still mad at me?

104
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,140
I once asked Ying Zewei to find out how she was doing.

105
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,680
I was only told that she was in seclusion.

106
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,610
There was no mention of you either.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
Is she really

108
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,710
still mad at me?

109
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,440
No.

110
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,050
That's good.

111
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,430
By the way, Yan,

112
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,810
tell her when you go back.

113
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,120
Although I can't leave the

114
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,060
Spirit-Sealing Formation now,

115
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,260
I am always

116
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,840
thinking about her.

117
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,230
Uncle.

118
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,220
My mother...

119
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,990
My mother passed away

120
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,500
three years ago.

121
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,650
What did you say?

122
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,550
My mother was buried

123
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,990
at Lunar Town,

124
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,230
next to Filth Valley.

125
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,120
Impossible.

126
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,740
She won't die.

127
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,210
Impossible!

128
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,920
She won't die. She won't.

129
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,710
Come on, another nail. Come on!

130
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,120
The century-old grudge

131
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,980
is going to end today.

132
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,150
You want to trap me

133
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,950
with such a lame trick?

134
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,890
Dream on!

135
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,750
My mother had long suffered from heart disease

136
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,250
and couldn't recover.

137
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,920
She passed away

138
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,450
before I made the pill.

139
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,950
Heart disease? How is that possible?

140
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,870
She is a deity.

141
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,780
How could she have heart disease?

142
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,520
I've searched the medical books in the Lunar Sect.

143
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,540
My mother's illness

144
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,620
was indeed caused by weak heart circulation,

145
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,680
leading to blocked energy channels.

146
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,900
And my medicine

147
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,370
would be able to treat her illness.

148
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,910
Back then, Sister kneeled in front of the palace

149
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,370
for ten days and ten nights

150
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,770
to get the Great Path

151
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,590
to spare my life.

152
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,910
The thirty thunderbolts

153
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,230
struck her relentlessly.

154
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,230
If she weren't protected by the Nirvana spirit heart,

155
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,270
she wouldn’t have been able to get away unscathed.

156
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,840
Nirvana spirit heart?

157
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,520
Was that the Internal Elixir my mother cultivated?

158
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,870
More precisely, it was a spirit elixir.

159
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,100
My sister and I were half-siblings.

160
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,030
I'm the son of the Red Emperor

161
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,730
and Chief Yun of the Yao Palace.

162
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,990
I'm considered human.

163
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,340
Sister was the daughter of the Red Emperor and the Spirit Empress.

164
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,140
She was a descendant of the Chongming Bird Family.

165
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,020
So I have

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,470
spirit blood in me?

167
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,370
Looks like she

168
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,830
didn't tell you anything.

169
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,930
What would have happened

170
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
if she had the Nirvana spirit heart?

171
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,830
With the spirit elixir,

172
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,220
she would be undying.

173
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,550
She could have lived for 10,000 years.

174
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,280
Undying and lived for 10,00 years?

175
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,060
Then, why did she die?

176
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:41,370
The Nirvana spirit heart is undying.

177
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,870
Undying?

178
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,540
Yan.

179
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,040
Tell me everything about your mother's life.

180
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,080
The more detailed, the better.

181
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,230
A hundred years ago,

182
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,290
when you were hurt by the Holy Master,

183
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,010
was it as painful as now?

184
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:50,820
Come!

185
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,010
You crazy jerk!

186
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,930
I found a way

187
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,570
to enter Sen Luo's state of mind.

188
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,630
I believe Ji Yang can definitely

189
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,360
wipe out Sen Luo's remaining soul.

190
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,560
This is my ancestral secret technique.

191
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,230
You need to cast it yourself.

192
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,760
Although I've never used it before,

193
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,510
I've memorized the entire

194
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,570
secret technique.

195
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,440
I'm willing to risk my life to try.

196
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,230
Now he has five

197
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,200
Demon-Subduing Nails in his body.

198
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,800
They are suppressing Sen Luo's state of mind.

199
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,450
If we successfully enter,

200
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,140
we can take this opportunity to destroy Sen Luo.

201
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,710
The five Demon-Subduing Nails

202
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,330
will disappear with Sen Luo.

203
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,890
Ji Yang can also escape

204
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,050
the pain of having his soul consumed.

205
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,150
Let's start now.

206
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,660
My mother had always suffered from heart disease.

207
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,180
Since I can remember,

208
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,120
she never told me

209
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,990
her identity.

210
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,460
She just took me

211
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,130
to live in Lunar Town.

212
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,970
Every day,

213
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,780
she played cards and drank wine.

214
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,800
She had never shown

215
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,710
her power.

216
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,910
I devoted myself to

217
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,030
searching for a cure for her heart disease.

218
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,350
But she...

219
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,320
But she didn't seem to care.

220
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,490
As if she already knew

221
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,580
she couldn't be cured.

222
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,810
So...

223
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,830
If my mother

224
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,270
was really Chief Nan Fang of Yao Palace,

225
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,800
why did she do that?

226
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,190
Sister hid her identity

227
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,250
to hide you in a small town.

228
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,140
Why did she

229
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,940
do that?

230
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,670
My mother loved drinking.

231
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,340
She got drunk every day.

232
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,780
It was as if...

233
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,530
As if she wanted to forget

234
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,930
or avoid something desperately.

235
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,800
Could it be...

236
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,310
That she was

237
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,940
avoiding someone?

238
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,130
She was being hunted?

239
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,099
Heart disease?

240
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,609
Was she badly injured?

241
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,030
Mother never told me

242
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,599
about her cultivation.

243
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,300
Someone extracted

244
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,290
my sister's Nirvana spirit heart.

245
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,980
They took out her elixir?

246
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,360
That's why she died.

247
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,950
The so-called heart disease

248
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,720
was a symptom

249
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,010
of her severe injury.

250
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,560
Who would

251
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,530
do something so cruel to her?

252
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Only the Jiuzhuan Elixir Technique

253
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,610
can extract a spirit's spirit elixir.

254
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,530
This method is extremely cruel.

255
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,720
Sister...

256
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,950
What kind of person

257
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,590
could possibly steal the spirit elixir

258
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,720
from my sister?

259
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,220
Only a few people could do that.

260
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,580
Yan.

261
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,720
Do you have any clues about the person who killed her?

262
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,980
No.

263
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,580
But that day,

264
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,860
in Youquan Prison,

265
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,040
the person who took the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

266
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
seemed to know my mother.

267
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,130
The Blood Phoenix Hairpin?

268
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,070
It's the sacred object of the Chongming Clan.

269
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,070
It had always been with your mother.

270
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,330
The Blood Phoenix Hairpin

271
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,420
belonged to my mother?

272
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,670
No wonder...

273
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,070
You can summon the power of Chongming?

274
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,290
Who is Nan Rao to you?

275
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
Back in the Youquan Prison,

276
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,980
did the power of Chongming in my body

277
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,340
activate the Blood Phoenix Hairpin?

278
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,760
Any other clues that day?

279
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,620
He was wearing a mask.

280
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,670
But I fought him before.

281
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,730
His power was at the demigod level.

282
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,510
Demigod...

283
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,850
Recently,

284
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,750
I've been investigating

285
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,930
the whereabouts of the Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

286
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,720
But

287
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,270
there's no news yet.

288
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,720
That's not hard.

289
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,230
This is the Phoenix Tail Bell.

290
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,810
It belonged to my sister.

291
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,860
Yan.

292
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,600
Give me your hand.

293
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,400
With the Chongming bloodline as the guide,

294
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,340
the Phoenix Tail Bell

295
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,000
can find the scent of the Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

296
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,820
In the east.

297
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,670
Blood Phoenix Hairpin is in the Dragon Capital.

298
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,360
Uncle.

299
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,710
I'll go to the Dragon Capital now.

300
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,370
Yan.

301
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,320
Be careful and don't act rashly.

302
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,520
Sister is gone.

303
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,480
You must be safe.

304
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,870
Uncle, don't worry.

305
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,970
I will be careful.

306
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,700
Uncle,

307
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,240
this is left by my mother.

308
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,650
So you heard it too.

309
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,860
That's Sister's descendant.

310
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,940
If you meet her yourself,

311
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,930
you'll surely like her.

312
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Jiao Niang.

313
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,350
Who killed Sister?

314
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,120
Was it Mu Guanghan or him?

315
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,370
Wait for me.

316
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,000
After I handle my sister's matter,

317
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,700
I'll come to you.

318
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,710
There are countless evil thoughts

319
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,780
in Sen Luo's state of mind.

320
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,620
The backlash is very strong.

321
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,350
I can only

322
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,640
help you maintain the formation.

323
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,970
Whether you can withstand this evil power

324
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,460
depends on your own cultivation.

325
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,630
Cultivation?

326
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,100
I have

327
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,600
plenty of that!

328
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,810
This formation is complicated.

329
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,600
You have just learned the Ruxin Realm magic.

330
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,310
I'm afraid you can't break it.

331
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,170
If not, I'll break it by force.

332
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,100
Sister, I'm sorry.

333
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,450
I didn't listen to you.

334
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,400
But can I

335
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,860
ask you for another favor?

336
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,190
I'm worried about him going in alone.

337
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,420
Can you send me in too?

338
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,580
You've been obedient to me since childhood.

339
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,910
But I just realized that

340
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,220
the meaning of family is not obedience,

341
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,150
but to stand by each other forever.

342
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,540
Mr. Meng, my senior...

343
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,470
If you want to

344
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,800
plead for your senior,

345
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,350
there's no need.

346
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,590
Master.

347
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,950
A secret letter from Great Path.

348
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,130
You may leave.

349
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:39,530
Yes.

350
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,350
Read it.

351
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,080
[The Reincarnated Sen Luo has appeared. Take the Blood Phoenix Hairpin to Youquan Prison in Nancang.]

352
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,320
The Reincarnated Sen Luo?

353
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,340
That hairpin

354
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,940
is the key to absorbing the power of the Yin Zhu.

355
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,020
No one except him

356
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,360
would go after it.

357
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,230
So,

358
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,830
he is the murderer who killed my father?

359
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,810
Go and rest.

360
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,430
I'll think about it.

361
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,470
I won't let your father die in vain.

362
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,750
Thank you, Chief.

363
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,670
[Zuixiao Restaurant]

364
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,960
Don't worry.

365
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,510
You have the talisman with you.

366
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,270
No one will notice

367
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,570
your demonic aura.

368
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,060
Here, have some tea.

369
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,350
Did you see what happened that day?

370
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,010
Dragon Lord pretended to be sick

371
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,270
to lure Young Lord back

372
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,060
and beat him up at the city gate

373
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,710
for the whole afternoon.

374
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,670
Once the Dragon Lord gets angry,

375
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,350
even a Yuanying Soul Realm cultivator

376
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,630
dare not peep with their divine energy.

377
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,440
I didn't have the guts.

378
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,200
Exactly.

379
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,230
I heard that Young Lord's face

380
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:23,950
swelled up from the beating.

381
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,470
He's pretty much unrecognizable now.

382
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,230
He was even forced

383
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,790
to go on a blind date with Miss Yun.

384
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,020
He's grounded until he can

385
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,220
have a child with her.

386
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,520
That demon Sen Luo

387
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,530
caused a huge mess in Nancang.

388
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,630
The cultivation realm is in such a mess,

389
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,710
but Dragon Lord still has the mood to carry on the family line?

390
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,710
He’s so carefree.

391
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,200
I wonder how he is now.

392
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,780
Don't worry.

393
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,550
Once the Young Lord recovers,

394
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,350
he will come to you immediately.

395
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,020
I'll wait with you.

396
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,740
But...

397
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,950
Now that Young Lord Mu is locked up,

398
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,750
Will he come to meet us still?

399
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,390
I sent him a jade amulet yesterday.

400
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,710
I haven't received any reply yet.

401
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,550
The Phoenix Tail Bell hasn't reacted to anything either.

402
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,550
What should we do?

403
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,310
No matter how big Dragon Capital is,

404
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,030
I'll search it inch by inch.

405
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,000
I will find it one day.

406
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,260
Let's go.

407
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,360
Let's go.

408
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,610
It's the Sword Sect of the Western State.

409
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,110
Nan Yan.

410
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,920
Meng Ying.

411
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,500
Long time no see.

412
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,210
Yes.

413
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,430
By the way, Senior,

414
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,630
let me introduce her.

415
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,230
This is the former classmate

416
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,830
I told you about, Nan Yan.

417
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,520
I've heard a lot about you, Bloody-handed Asura.

418
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,500
It seems

419
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,430
you've entered the Sword Sect as you wished.

420
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,490
Congratulations.

421
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,520
Yes.

422
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,280
I'm here

423
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,230
on an errand

424
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,550
with Master and Senior.

425
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,090
I didn't expect

426
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,160
to meet you here.

427
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,430
Why are you here?

428
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,960
I heard that Big Brother was injured,

429
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,160
so I came to see him.

430
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,570
It seems that the whole world

431
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,310
knows about the

432
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,970
Young Dragon Lord's beating.

433
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,490
Who is this lady?

434
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,190
I met her in Nancang.

435
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,240
We happened to be traveling the same way,

436
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,640
so we came here together.

437
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:39,920
Meng Ying.

438
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,200
I'll catch up with you

439
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,600
after I see my Big Brother.

440
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,450
I'm leaving.

441
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,080
Wait.

442
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,660
Nan Yan,

443
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,200
I have a question.

444
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,830
You must answer me honestly.

445
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,360
What's wrong?

446
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,150
Do you know that

447
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,470
Ji Yang is the Reincarnated Sen Luo?

448
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,130
You really didn't know?

449
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,980
To think you ever took the thunder punishment for him

450
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,310
back in the Lunar Sect.

451
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,030
Even my father protected him.

452
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,910
But unexpectedly, he became demonic.

453
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,840
He even betrayed

454
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,060
and killed my father.

455
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,970
Are you sure

456
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,910
the murderer at Lunar Sect

457
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,160
was him?

458
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,130
You told me

459
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,410
the person who killed my father used a Yin Zhu.

460
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,590
Later, Ji Yang

461
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,670
used Yin Zhu to cause chaos in Nancang.

462
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,670
In this world,

463
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,370
no one else would use a Yin Zhu.

464
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,260
Tell me,

465
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,290
who else could have killed my father

466
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,230
if not him?

467
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Fellow cultivator,

468
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,750
if you know

469
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,710
where the demon is,

470
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,780
please tell us.

471
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,710
The Sword Sect will help Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea

472
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,640
slay the demon and uphold justice.

473
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,650
I don't have any news about him.

474
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,830
It's said that Bloody-handed Asura

475
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,040
is excellent at killing demons.

476
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,240
Now that I've met you,

477
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,010
I see that your acting skills are excellent too.

478
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,250
Although you're concealing your aura with a talisman,

479
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,580
you can't escape my Demon Subduing Sword!

480
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,440
It's you!

481
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,800
A demonic cultivator has entered the Dragon Capital!

482
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,540
Hurry!

483
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,560
Hurry!

484
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,110
Inform the guards!

485
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,930
Evil Path!

486
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,560
You're also an accomplice to my father's death.

487
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,230
Today,

488
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,490
I'll avenge my father!

489
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,400
Nan Yan...

490
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,060
Why did you help her?

491
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,230
She has left the Evil Path

492
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,010
and stopped doing evil.

493
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,710
My father treated you so well.

494
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,680
He treated you

495
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,790
as his own daughter.

496
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,520
I've treated you

497
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,820
as my real sister.

498
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,270
Why did you help her?

499
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,490
Why did you help someone

500
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,110
who killed my father?

501
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,310
Some people did not mean

502
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,340
to turn demonic.

503
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,370
If she has renounced her ways and done good deeds,

504
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,140
can you

505
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,530
spare her?

506
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,440
Spare her?

507
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,880
What about my father?

508
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,530
Who will pay for his death?

509
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,680
I've never forgotten

510
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,330
about Mr. Meng.

511
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,870
It's just that I haven't found out the truth yet.

512
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,880
Meng Ying, trust me.

513
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,290
I will kill our enemy.

514
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,160
You're making excuses.

515
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,870
Fine.

516
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,960
Kill her.

517
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,190
I'll trust you if you kill her.

518
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,120
Step aside.

519
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,310
The incident at Yumen Inn

520
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,390
was true, then.

521
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:58,840
They said

522
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,660
you've been hanging out with a demonic cultivator,

523
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,790
and you're already demonic yourself.

524
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,030
I tried my best to explain

525
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,560
and said it was impossible.

526
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,810
Looks like I trusted the wrong person.

527
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,000
If you want to kill someone,

528
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
come at me.

529
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,830
It has nothing to do with Nan Yan.

530
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,630
Stop!

531
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,160
This is the territory of the Dragon Capital.

532
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,360
We don't need to trouble the Sword Sect.

533
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,380
Leave the demonic cultivator

534
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,010
to the Dragon Capital.

535
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,600
No.

536
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,780
Report to the Dragon Lord now.

537
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,190
Put them in jail.

538
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,230
This place is guarded by a Spirit Lock.

539
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,650
Just stay put

540
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,290
and don't seek trouble.

541
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,280
Wait.

542
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,900
I want to see your Young Lord.

543
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,920
Please

544
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,600
give him this book of poems.

545
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,840
He will come to see me.

546
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,330
Nan Yan.

547
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,170
I'm sorry.

548
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,860
I got you into trouble.

549
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,480
It's okay.

550
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,060
This is Big Brother's place.

551
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,420
He will find a way

552
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,489
to save us.

553
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:25,880
Don't worry.

554
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,060
It hurts.

555
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,070
My father is so cruel.

556
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:36,909
How long has it been?

557
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,929
I'm still hurt!

558
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,110
I'm the Young Dragon Lord

559
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,020
and general of the 49 whaleboats.

560
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,710
[Mighty Dragon Pavilion]

561
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,110
In front of the whole city,

562
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,570
he hung me on the city gate

563
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,699
and beat me up.

564
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:48,270
No.

565
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,750
Have I no pride?

566
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,370
There you go again.

567
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,989
Do you still want to compete?

568
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,550
Fine.

569
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,300
I'll stop.

570
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,690
Let me make it clear first.

571
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,190
You are a girl.

572
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,680
I let you win in the previous rounds on purpose.

don't blame me for not being kind to you.

581

What a fun way to play.

00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,390
Okay.

Excuse me.

Got it!

586
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,760
No matter how skilled you are, you're still afraid of kitchen knives.

I'll buy you a new one.

592

Your words were barbaric and your grammar was flawed.

and get close to Zhanting again,

00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,510
don't blame me for being merciless.

Is true.
