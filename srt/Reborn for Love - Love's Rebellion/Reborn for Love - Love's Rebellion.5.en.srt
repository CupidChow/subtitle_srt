[Episode 5]

4
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,880
Were you

5
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,870
picking out a gift for me?

6
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,410
Of course.

7
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,930
I can't accept it.

8
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:25,110
The Mechanical Butterfly is from Xichuan.

9
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,370
It can track location.

10
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,550
You're surveilling me with it?

11
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,800
Where is it?

12
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,789
It's complicated around Xiagu Street Market.

13
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,590
It can protect you for me.

14
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,509
I...

15
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,830
You don't have to thank me.

16
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,190
Hey!

17
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,820
Where did it go?

18
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,680
Go! Don't get in the way!

19
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,070
Nan Yan.

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,200
Nan Yan!

21
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,870
I need to go down the mountain.

22
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,000
Is there anything you want me to bring?

23
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,790
Nan Yan?

24
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,669
Where is she?

25
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,300
Nan Yan!

26
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,630
Forget it.

27
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,610
I'd better go to the pleasure boat

28
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,010
to ask around about Lord.

29
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,880
Here you are.

30
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,410
Come again.

31
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:40,900
Move!

32
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,350
Move aside!

33
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,079
The people from Great Path are just outside.

34
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,730
This is a rare opportunity.

35
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,070
They are from the same sect.

36
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,520
They must have a way

37
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,960
to break the death curse.

38
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,780
Ma'am.

39
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,350
What you're holding

40
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,240
is a top-class lotus inkstone brush.

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,030
This lotus inkstone brush

42
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,820
can be used to both draw talisman and attack enemies.

43
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,870
Try it.

44
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,630
Try it on the paper.

45
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,550
It’s free.

46
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,840
Elder Zhu said

47
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,120
to search thoroughly.

48
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,030
We'd rather kill the wrong person than let them go.

49
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,460
Yes!

50
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,720
Kill the wrong person?

51
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,290
These people from Great Path...

52
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:23,579
[Lord Shao Cang is here, quickly]

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,660
making a mess searching everywhere.

54
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,750
Sir,

55
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,230
I would like

56
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,020
the best spiritual treasure here.

57
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,640
Sir.

58
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,490
Sure!

59
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,500
Sir.

60
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,570
This

61
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,430
is our treasure,

62
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,730
Green Phoenix Fan.

63
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,150
I want it.

64
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,070
You are really an expert.

65
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,530
But the price of this is...

66
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,079
I will take that too.

67
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:53,910
Sir,

68
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,070
I can tell

69
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,550
you love your wife.

70
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,530
Let me wrap it up for you.

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,160
Wife?

72
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,700
You have to

73
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,060
explain it to him later.

74
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,480
I'm not your wife.

75
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,030
Nonsense.

76
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,030
Are you sure

77
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,350
you really want me to explain

78
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,790
our relationship to him?

79
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,350
Well...

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,610
You can't let him say that

81
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,970
and ruin my reputation.

82
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,779
I remember

83
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,390
someone said

84
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,990
that they won't be affected by their reputation.

85
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,630
Why?

86
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,350
You've forgotten

87
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,850
what you said two days ago?

88
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,310
Sir,

89
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,680
let me make it clear.

90
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,990
This lotus inkstone brush

91
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,110
costs 800 spirit stones.

92
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,470
This Green Phoenix Fan is a little more expensive.

93
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,800
It costs a 1,000 stones.

94
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,140
Here you are!

95
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,730
Please! Come again!

96
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,560
I'm rich!

97
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,930
Is what I told you all for nothing?

98
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,420
It's so expensive.

99
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,550
You should've haggled for half the price!

100
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,950
That's too troublesome.

101
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,070
Whatever.

102
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,190
I can't stop you

103
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,200
from getting taken advantaged of.

104
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,790
You're giving it to me?

105
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,760
I saw you liked it. Think of it as a reward.

106
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,500
Consider it as hush money.

107
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,590
Hush–

108
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,180
I'm not the type to be

109
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,640
ungrateful.

110
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,550
But if this is because of

111
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,780
the Mechanical Butterfly just now,

112
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,790
you don't have to make it up with

113
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,710
such a big gift.

114
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,580
It seems like

115
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,570
there are people from Great Path everywhere.

116
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,300
How about

117
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,720
we head back first?

118
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,930
I need to go somewhere.

119
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,230
Where?

120
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,480
Come with me.

121
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:58,980
Here, sir.

122
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,840
Here, pour it.

123
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,200
Drink up!

124
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,130
Where could the pleasure boat be?

125
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,550
Good tea.

126
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:09,890
Yes.

127
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,060
Hey!

128
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,450
Can I ask for directions?

129
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,790
How do I get to the boats?

130
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,550
Boats?

131
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,670
Just...

132
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,770
go straight along this road.

133
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,150
Turn right at the fork and turn left.

134
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,990
When you see a willow by the river,

135
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,790
you're there.

136
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,580
Here!

137
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,450
Waiter!

138
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,410
This is for you.

139
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,550
Thank you, sir!

140
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,050
Sir, wait!

141
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,710
Even his money bag is

142
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,930
made of the expensive East Sea brocade.

143
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,350
Could he be the Young Dragon Lord

144
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,830
that ran away from home?

145
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,470
No wonder he's rich and dumb.

146
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,909
Sir.

147
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,240
Sir.

148
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,490
Thank you, sir.

149
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,470
Well...

150
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,510
let me remind you something.

151
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,400
The boat owner

152
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,600
is a beautiful lady.

153
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,930
If you dress up like this,

154
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,590
I'm afraid she'll target you.

155
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,130
It doesn't matter.

156
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,670
As long as her information is accurate,

157
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,410
I can give her

158
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,060
as much money

159
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,170
as she wants.

160
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,430
No, sir.

161
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,110
You're generous.

162
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,510
Of course money is not a problem.

163
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,640
The problem is the owner is beautiful.

164
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,230
I–

165
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,070
Don't worry.

166
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,250
I

167
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,590
am not interested in one's looks.

168
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,070
The only thing I love in this life

169
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,590
is poems and songs.

170
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,350
So,

171
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,570
I will never be interested

172
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,700
in her.

173
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,950
I'm afraid she'll be interested in you.

174
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,390
That's why you should

175
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,640
let me finish.

176
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,370
The owner is beautiful.

177
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,909
She likes men.

178
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,830
You are

179
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,050
so handsome.

180
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,760
She might

181
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,900
take advantage of you.

182
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,700
So I'm telling you to be careful.

183
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,390
That wouldn't be

184
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,570
so easy.

185
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,230
It's okay.

186
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,560
Just focus on your work.

187
00:07:59,310 --> 00:07:59,790
Come over!

188
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,380
Hank dresses that just arrived!

189
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,200
Miss, come and take a look!

190
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,240
Hey...

191
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,840
Why would someone

192
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,470
not pay up for just a cup of tea?

193
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,460
How could they do that?

194
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,400
Where are we going?

195
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,860
In this barrier,

196
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,130
no one can see you.

197
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,650
I saved your life!

198
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,550
Is this how you treat your benefactor?

199
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,590
That's why I set a barrier

200
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,630
to protect you.

201
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,630
I have something to do.

202
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,230
Stay still.

203
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,290
Don't go anywhere.

204
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,010
Wait!

205
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,870
What if I'm get into danger

206
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,800
when you're leaving me alone here?

207
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,230
Do you think I don't know

208
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,710
how much poison you have hidden

209
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,960
in your pouch?

210
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,230
Even if there are bad guys,

211
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,890
they will be the one in danger.

212
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,990
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

213
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,890
The Mechanical Butterfly is also known as the Ever-changing Machine.

214
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,110
It's much more interesting

215
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,790
than the Great Path Sect's Candlelight Beetles.

216
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,480
No matter what tricks you play,

217
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,860
it will adapt to it.

218
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,250
Stop bluffing.

219
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,190
If you really want to die,

220
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,080
you can try.

221
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,430
Go straight along this road.

222
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,890
Turn right at the fork and turn left.

223
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,670
When you see a willow by the river,

224
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,600
you've arrived.

225
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,780
Isn't this the willow?

226
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,070
Are you here to ask for information?

227
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,400
Yes.

228
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,780
I want to know

229
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,170
where the Great Path's Lord Shao Cang is.

230
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,460
People would normally present spiritual treasures as tribute.

231
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,760
But you, sir,

232
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,410
are straightfoward.

233
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,450
Here.

234
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,780
They're exchanged for with spirit stones anyway.

235
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,330
I don't want to guess what women like.

236
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,330
You can just go to Treasure Pavilion

237
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,850
to pick what you like.

238
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,030
Thank you, sir.

239
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,830
But Lord Shao Cang

240
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,470
is a great figure.

241
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,230
If I

242
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,730
expose his whereabouts,

243
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,670
I'll become enemies with him.

244
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,270
I'm afraid I can't afford to offend him.

245
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,870
In that case,

246
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,500
we can't do this trade?

247
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,500
Not necessarily.

248
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,040
As long as...

249
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,400
I won't sell my body!

250
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,680
Sir, you're thinking too much.

251
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,580
I'm just interested in

252
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,810
your money bag.

253
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,150
Fine!

254
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,370
You can tell me where

255
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,190
Lord Shao Cang is now, right?

256
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,100
Where is my information?

257
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,750
It's a rule of mine to provide information for treasures given to me.

258
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,410
Are you afraid I'll lie to you?

259
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,610
You're cheating?

260
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,630
You are too.

261
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,640
When did you find out?

262
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,120
The waiter said

263
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,550
the boat owner loves men.

264
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,830
I am a tall and

265
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,690
handsome young man

266
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,950
yet you just kept talking about money.

267
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,620
Of course you're a fraud!

268
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,350
How arrogant.

269
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,830
I thought you were something more.

270
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,940
You're a man.

271
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,830
Yet you're flirting

272
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,870
just for some money.

273
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,260
Aren't you ashamed?

274
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,510
People like you who were born rich

275
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,310
and have no worries

276
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:43,990
in life.

277
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,310
What do you know about the sufferings of the world?

278
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,060
Hey–

279
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,550
Stop!

280
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,510
Darn fox.

281
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,670
I'll peel off your fur if I catch you.

282
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,080
Greetings, boat owner.

283
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,720
You came alone.

284
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,590
I wonder what you're looking for me

285
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,550
for?

286
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,940
For the map of Filth Valley.

287
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,870
Filth Valley

288
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,990
has countless treasures.

289
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,430
But it's very dangerous.

290
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,860
You're so handsome.

291
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,150
Why would you

292
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,090
go get yourself killed?

293
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,170
Of course I must go.

294
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,310
I can give you

295
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,990
whatever you want.

296
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,510
Why don't you

297
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,890
just stay here

298
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,160
and be a playboy.

299
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,420
Wouldn't that be better?

300
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,510
Green Phoenix Fan?

301
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,010
That's a good treasure.

302
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,340
It even has remnants of Green Phoenix's soul!

303
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,460
This is a token of appreciation.

304
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,620
How do you know

305
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,150
I have the map?

306
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,260
People say

307
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,410
the boat owner of

308
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,470
Xiagu Street Market

309
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,980
knows everything

310
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,040
in the world.

311
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,570
You're smart.

312
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,510
You won't be able to return

313
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,730
after going to somewhere like Filth Valley.

314
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,090
I am indeed the only one

315
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,390
who came out alive.

316
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,540
Where is the map?

317
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,510
You're hurting me...

318
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,990
The map

319
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,740
is on me.

320
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,390
Sir,

321
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,030
look carefully.

322
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,230
This is the injury

323
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,040
Yin Zhu caused when I was

324
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,829
searching for treasures in Filth Valley

325
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,589
when I was young and reckless.

326
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,569
Although I escaped,

327
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,500
Yin Zhu

328
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,460
is scarier than you think.

329
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,090
If anything happens to you,

330
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,310
if anything happens to him,

331
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,660
it will hurt my heart.

332
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,510
Don't test my patience.

333
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,760
Why are you so boring?

334
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,600
You have a good looks for nothing.

335
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,130
Fine, I'll show you the map.

336
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,820
Friend!

337
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,110
Friend!

338
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,030
Friend!

339
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,250
Can you see me?

340
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,780
Help!

341
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,710
Can you see me?

342
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,130
Is anyone there?

343
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,560
Can you see me?

344
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,910
She's wearing around her neck...

345
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,670
Friend!

346
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,730
Is silver mermaid pearl?

347
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,810
Can you see me?

348
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,780
I'm in luck!

349
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,270
Good things are coming one after another.

350
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,390
Come over!

351
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,300
Please.

352
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,170
How did you do that?

353
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,870
I know some magic

354
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,190
Breaking this barrier

355
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,720
is nothing difficult to me.

356
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,400
Thank you for your help.

357
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,730
Be careful!

358
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,300
Someone is watching you?

359
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,330
Yes.

360
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,850
Some ungrateful bastard.

361
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,070
Such a big grudge?

362
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,030
We're sworn enemies.

363
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,610
Search carefully.

364
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,390
Check over there!

365
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,830
Yes!

366
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,270
Friend.

367
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,230
My name is Nan Yan.

368
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,470
I'm a disciple of Lunar Sect.

369
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,150
Please

370
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,510
leave me your address and name.

371
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,580
I will definitely

372
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,710
visit you to thank you.

373
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,470
That'll be too much trouble.

374
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,990
How about you

375
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,520
pay it back now?

376
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,770
I shall take

377
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,430
this pearl.

378
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,850
You thief!

379
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,390
You want to steal my pearl?

380
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,550
I'll be honest with you,

381
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,480
no one can

382
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,610
steal my pearl

383
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,790
unless I give it to them.

384
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,670
Count yourself unlucky

385
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,950
for trying to rob me.

386
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,120
I-I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

387
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,270
Please be the bigger person

388
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,030
and forgive me.

389
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,430
Do you dare do this again?

390
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
If you do it again,

391
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,550
I'll cripple your legs.

392
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,660
I'll definitely take

393
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,240
the silver mermaid pearl!

394
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,360
What do you mean?

395
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,310
I want to

396
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,230
raise the price.

397
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,830
Go ahead.

398
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,510
It's my rule that

399
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,550
I trade information for treasures.

400
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,710
But

401
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,470
when I saw you today,

402
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,760
I took a liking to you.

403
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,700
I don't want to let you go.

404
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,790
From now on, the rules have changed.

405
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,370
You have to

406
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,120
stay and be my furnace.

407
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,770
As an elder of the Demon Clan,

408
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,110
you've been going around this street market hiding your aura for many years.

409
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,910
The money you've earned

410
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,370
is enough for you to live a peaceful life for many many years.

411
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,170
I advise you to cherish your life

412
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,330
in case you have the money but no life to spend it.

413
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,760
You have a sharp eye.

414
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,310
I’ve been in this street market for years.

415
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,890
You are the first one

416
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,830
who found out about my identity.

417
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,230
What a pity.

418
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,370
At first,

419
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,520
I wanted to spend the night with you.

420
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,910
Now I can only

421
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,150
kill you.

422
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,860
[Treasure Pavilion]

423
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,030
Candlelight Beetles?

424
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,670
He's Great Path Sect's Lord?

425
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,400
The previous lord of Great Path Sect

426
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,820
is now colluding with the Demon Clan.

427
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:33,920
Shao Cang,

428
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,890
you are being self-destructive.

429
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,410
You're just

430
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,490
accusing me.

431
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,370
The demonic energy is still here.

432
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,370
That was

433
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,070
obviously

434
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,870
Die Wan of the Five Evil Ghosts.

435
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,470
All the disciples here

436
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,610
saw it with their own eyes.

437
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,010
You're still denying it?

438
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,150
All disciples, listen!

439
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,870
Yes!

440
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,040
Rebel Shao Cang joined hands with the demon,

441
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,810
and the evidence is solid.

442
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,990
He should be executed

443
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,630
for his sins!

444
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,890
He should be executed!

445
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,730
It's not too late to leave now.

446
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,040
You're about to die.

447
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,600
How dare you be so arrogant?

448
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,790
You think you're still

449
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,390
the superior Lord Shao Cang?

450
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,670
The Candlelight Beetles are working up in my body.

451
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,990
Nan Yan.

452
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,430
Drawing the sword, the wind and rain cease;

453
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,910
Sheathing the sword, the blood river clears.

454
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,900
Sheath.

455
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:03,930
After him.

456
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:04,810
Yes.

457
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,180
Yes!

458
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:05,690
Yes.

459
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,990
Excuse me.

460
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,330
What happened over there?

461
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,630
The elder of the Great Path is after someone.

462
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,750
They are fighting.

463
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,110
Look. It's in that direction.

464
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,880
How did the people of the Great Path Sect

465
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,270
find him?

466
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,630
The candlelight is still nearby!

467
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,060
He must not have gone far!

468
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,330
Hurry and search!

469
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,710
Leave. Stop looking around.

470
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,430
Great Path Sect rebel Shao Cang!

471
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,340
Killed his fellow disciples

472
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,630
and escaped!

473
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,930
Now he's seriously injured and hiding here.

474
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,820
Anyone who has a clue

475
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,040
will be rewarded.

476
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,390
Those who hide it

477
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,170
will be punished together.

478
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,180
Lord Shao Cang?

479
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,310
He's also in the street market?

480
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,270
No.

481
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,310
I can't let

482
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,470
these nobodies who don't know the truth

483
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,670
catch Lord Shao Cang.

484
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,850
Looks like he was lucky

485
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,270
and hasn't been captured yet.

486
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,730
I was worried for nothing.

487
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,620
Wh-Why are you here?

488
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,090
Why are you still here?

489
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,220
Why?

490
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,590
Are you disappointed

491
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,650
I wasn't captured.

492
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,830
What are you talking about?

493
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,790
They're all after you.

494
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,470
Why aren't you running?

495
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:54,870
Go!

496
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,850
♫Can you hold my hands tightly?♫

497
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,780
♫No matter if it's a fair or gloomy day♫

498
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,680
♫From the beginning♫

499
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,970
♫Till the end, oh♫

500
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,960
♫Let me keep going forward with you♫

501
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:23,930
♫Let all the bright fireworks stop for you, oh♫

502
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,290
♫When the wind blows♫

503
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,070
Excuse me!

504
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,140
Watch where you're going!

505
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,600
How dare you block our way!

506
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,690
What are you doing?

507
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,820
How could you break my stuff?

508
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,470
Pay up!

509
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,490
Who are you?

510
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,350
How dare you block the Great Path Sect's way?

511
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,210
You want to die?

512
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,810
Stop!

513
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,730
Do you know how powerful I am now?

514
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,820
Sir,

515
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,440
you're from East Sea's Dragon Capital?

516
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,230
Why aren't you apologizing now that you know that?

517
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,640
I often heard that Dragon Lord Mu Guanghan

518
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
has a virtuous son

519
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,910
who's both talented and handsome.

520
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,750
I wonder

521
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,360
if it's you?

522
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,910
D-Don't try to chum up to me.

523
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,170
How dare you

524
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,050
call my father by his name?

525
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,790
You are indeed the Young Dragon Lord.

526
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,040
My apologies.

527
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,070
I am the Great Path's Zhu Sui.

528
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,430
I'm here on the order to capture Shao Cang.

529
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,440
Please

530
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,560
forgive us.

531
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,910
I don't care who you're arresting.

532
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,230
It's none of my business.

533
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,870
But you have to pay

534
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,100
for my things first.

535
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,080
This is the compensation.

536
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,630
Please be the bigger person

537
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,570
and forgive us

538
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,470
for offending you today.

539
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,020
Look at you.

540
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,080
You...

541
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,390
I'm the Young Dragon Lord.

542
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,990
So you apologized and compensated immediately.

543
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,920
What about them?

544
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,110
You're trying to leave just after

545
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,970
bullying these innocent people?

546
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,240
So people from the Great Path

547
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,650
are such bastards

548
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,730
and give people differential treatment.

549
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,460
How dare you!

550
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,550
How dare you talk to our elder like that?

551
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,030
Shut up.

552
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,420
You're right.

553
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,670
Today,

554
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,200
I was really thoughtless of me.

555
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:43,990
Guards.

556
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,350
Give them all the spirit stones.

557
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,630
Yes.

558
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,160
-Yes.
-Yes.

559
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,470
Yes.

560
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,170
Young Master, is this

561
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:53,910
enough?

562
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,510
Barely.

563
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Don't do it again.

564
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,670
You too,

565
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,170
be careful in the future. What are you doing?

566
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,280
With your strength,

567
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,630
even if you fight them face to face,

568
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,960
you might even win them.

569
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,480
I saved you out of kindness,

570
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,010
but you're making fun of me?

571
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,940
Did you come back

572
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,030
to escape

573
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,160
from the Great Path?

574
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,470
Right.

575
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,590
What am I doing?

576
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,310
I was impulsive.

577
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,370
I regret it now.

578
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,870
Why are you laughing?

579
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,920
What about this?

580
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:49,910
[Lord Shao Cang is here, quick]

581
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,410
Why didn't you report me just now?

582
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,800
I'm afraid of death.

583
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,050
Afraid of whose death?

584
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,630
Afraid of–

585
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,190
If you die,

586
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,560
who's going to remove my

587
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,370
death curse?

588
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,620
So you're

589
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,110
afraid that I'll die?

590
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,720
I'm talking about the death curse!

591
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,720
What's wrong?

592
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,790
You lied to me.

593
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,050
What did I lie to you about?

594
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,600
I overestimated myself.

595
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,870
I forgot what kind of person you are.

596
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,790
I don’t need to worry about you.

597
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,230
Elder Zhu.

598
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,230
We've searched everywhere.

599
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,520
He's not around.

600
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,590
If we can capture him easily,

601
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,270
he won't be Shao Cang.

602
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,250
Greetings, Elder Zhu.

603
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,880
Did you summon me over

604
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,679
cause there is news about Lord–

605
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,190
Shao Cang's wehereabouts?

606
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,929
He was severely injured

607
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,429
after we fought just now.

608
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:44,230
He's also poisoned by Candlelight Beetles.

609
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,760
He shouldn't have gone far.

610
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,250
[Disciple of the Great Path Sect:
Mo Xingzheng]

611
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,400
Let's split up and search!

612
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,469
We must capture him!

613
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,150
Yes!

614
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,280
Xingzheng

615
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,690
You're the Premier's close disciple.

616
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,310
If you can capture the rebel Shao Cang,

617
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,030
it will be a great merit.

618
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,520
You will have a bright future.

619
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,910
I understand.

620
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,100
Let's go.

621
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,670
Why are we here

622
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,510
instead of going back to the Lunar Sect?

623
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,600
I changed my mind.

624
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,970
Instead of hiding,

625
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,990
we might as well kill off

626
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,320
these flies here.

627
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,080
Leave now.

628
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,240
Don't get in the way.

629
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,620
You want to kill

630
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,000
all of them?

631
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,410
Before I take you hostage,

632
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,460
you can still run away.

633
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,780
You don't look well.

634
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,230
Let me take a look.

635
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,020
I'm fine.

636
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,790
The evil fire has entered your body.

637
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,030
Your internal organs are burning,

638
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,390
causing the heart disease to worsen.

639
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,110
That's why you're coughing up blood nonstop.

640
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,440
You need treatment now.

641
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,170
I don't need it.

642
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,590
You'll only get in my way.

643
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,360
Leave now.

644
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,230
Stop talking about this.

645
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,100
You're telling me to leave

646
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,550
because you know it will be dangerous.

647
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,480
You're afraid of implicating me, right?

648
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,670
How could a doctor leave the patient

649
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,550
and run away alone?

650
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,670
It's urgent, you have to listen to me.

651
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,670
It's not up to you.

652
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,340
I'm afraid it's too late to go back to

653
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,400
the Lunar Sect to get the medication.

654
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,750
It's the mountainous wilderness out there.

655
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,150
The deep forests is full of grass.

656
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,410
There will definitely be Spirit Thorn Grass around

657
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,870
that can help with fever and heart diseases.

658
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,760
You really are indeed hiding here.

659
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,430
Xingzheng

660
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,730
Long time no see.

661
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,390
Speak.

662
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,080
Did you do it?

663
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,210
Does it matter?

664
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:20,910
Yes!

665
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,310
The you I know

666
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,060
is kind

667
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,280
and intelligent.

668
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,600
You would never kill innocent people.

669
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,610
Everyone has a conception

670
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,710
of what kind of person I am already.

671
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,380
What if those conceptions are wrong?

672
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,440
Why do you have to bear the injustice?

673
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,120
Are you hiding something?

674
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,660
You can tell me.

675
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,620
I'll help you ask for Master's forgiveness.

676
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,310
Master loves you the most.

677
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,240
He even spent his lifespan

678
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,550
to treat you.

679
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,510
If you didn't do anything wrong,

680
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,510
he will definitely clear your name.

681
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,730
Xingzheng

682
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,070
You just need to remember

683
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,330
we've never met today.

684
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,030
How dare you, rebel!

685
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,560
How dare you kill Senior Mo?

686
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,460
Just you guys?

687
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,920
You can't do anything to me.

688
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,900
Don't be afraid!

689
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,670
He's seriously injured now.

690
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,660
There's nothing to be afraid of!

691
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,450
Attack!
