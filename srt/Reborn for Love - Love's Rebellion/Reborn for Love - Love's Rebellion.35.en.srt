[Love's Rebellion]

00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,670
[Episode 35]

4
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,590
Master, have you heard of

5
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,860
the Zen Heart of Brahma Bones?

6
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,510
The Zen Heart of Brahma Bones

7
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,030
was a sacred object created by the Holy Master

8
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,360
after experiencing the Nine Calamities.

9
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,300
You have heard of it too, Shao Cang?

10
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,000
I have a reckless guess.

11
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,580
You first

12
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,590
acquired the Nirvana spirit heart

13
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,750
and the Heart of the Six Realms.

14
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,280
Then, you plotted for years

15
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,000
for a chance to get the

16
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,490
Zen Heart of Brahma Bones.

17
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,200
What makes you think so?

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,100
You keep Yan by your side

19
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,310
because

20
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:41,310
the only person who can receive that heart

21
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,120
is Yan.

22
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,460
You think I'd harm her?

23
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,840
Gather the Five Prisons

24
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,180
and the three hearts

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,350
to ascend beyond limits

26
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,830
and control reincarnation.

27
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,800
That is

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,990
your goal.

29
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,070
You plan to slander

30
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,430
the Master of All with your mere statement.

31
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,650
Do you think Yan will believe you?

32
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,940
But if she knows that

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,300
you became the Master of All

34
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,160
by killing your master

35
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,130
and your family,

36
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,240
will she still believe you?

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,990
What did you say?

38
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,940
Have you forgotten

39
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,810
how you became

40
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,940
the monarch and premier back then?

41
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,850
The Bone-Deep Mirror.

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,250
When the Retrograde Bone-Deep Mirror broke,

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,400
I used the power of Shanhai

44
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,280
to get this fragment

45
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,650
from Ying Zewei

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,079
when I fought him.

47
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,600
Greetings, Great Path Master.

48
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,870
Have you

49
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,560
comprehended the Great Path Chant recently?

50
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,230
I practiced day and night

51
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,640
and got better at the moves

52
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,900
"All-Heaven Recital"

53
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,390
and "Cloud-Piercing Charge."

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,260
But

55
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,610
I lack a breakthrough in the

56
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,210
"Great Path's Will" move.

57
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,030
The Great Path's Will

58
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,990
is the highest form of magic in Great Path.

59
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,670
It prioritizes understanding over form.

60
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,910
You couldn't break through

61
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,440
because you're burdened by your inner demon.

62
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,510
Please enlighten me.

63
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,290
Do you know that

64
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,150
there is a forbidden book in the cultivation realm

65
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,210
called the "Book of Forbidden Path"?

66
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,360
There is such a book?

67
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,320
This book was written by Sen Luo.

68
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,560
I was worried that this book

69
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,680
would cause endless disasters

70
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,140
in the cultivation realm.

71
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,050
After defeating Sen Luo,

72
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,470
I searched his palace for the book to destroy it,

73
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,110
but I couldn't find it.

74
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,790
I will find out the whereabouts of this book

75
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,650
and return it to the Justice Hall.

76
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,550
Your enrollment into the sect was an exception.

77
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,150
Therefore, you were not qualified to be the monarch.

78
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,980
If you keep your mind straight,

79
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,870
you still have a chance to cultivate.

80
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,590
If you want to go against the heavenly will,

81
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,150
you will lose your place in this world,

82
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,329
let alone become the premier.

83
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,600
Master, I am indebted to you.

84
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,060
I dare not think about becoming the premier.

85
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,740
All evil begins with oneself,

86
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,470
and all evil shall be punished.

87
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,010
You can only save yourself.

88
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,630
Great Path Master,

89
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,610
what do you mean?

90
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,159
Hard work can make up for a lack of talent.

91
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,640
But you harmed your family

92
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,740
to improve your cultivation.

93
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,390
Since you know it,

94
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,470
do you want to kill me?

95
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,040
It was fate that

96
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,490
you became my disciple.

97
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,790
Although you made a big mistake,

98
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,900
I'm willing to give you a chance.

99
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,820
If you can come to your senses

100
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,540
and save yourself,

101
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,510
you don't have to die.

102
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,050
But you should return

103
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,140
the title of the monarch.

104
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,340
Dishonest people

105
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,510
do not deserve great power.

106
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,850
Thank you for your advice.

107
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,900
I

108
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,080
understand.

109
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,480
The banned book was missing for years.

110
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,210
But now, it's in my possession.

111
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,390
This is my destiny.

112
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,220
You don't get to decide

113
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,909
if I deserve it or not.

114
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,070
The Great Path Master had unparalleled cultivation.

115
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,330
He was ambushed by him.

116
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,670
I'm afraid he didn't expect that

117
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,720
he was already the master of one prison's Yin Zhu.

118
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,120
But Yin Zhu has a strong knockback.

119
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,030
With his cultivation back then,

120
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,310
he couldn't have resisted it.

121
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,640
What about the Spirit-Sealing Formation?

122
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,100
Yes.

123
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,240
Yes.

124
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,300
All these years,

125
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,930
only the secret spirit prison

126
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,460
could be supplying him with

127
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,720
an endless flow of

128
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,010
spiritual power.

129
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,440
Looks like this Master of All

130
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,330
has been planning for a long time.

131
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,720
The Book of Forbidden Path

132
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,870
details all the forbidden spells in the world.

133
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,480
Although he was ordinary,

134
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,510
he was very ambitious.

135
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,360
Therefore, he was eager to succeed.

136
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,409
His first risky move

137
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,630
was to use the blood of his closest relative

138
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
to help him improve his cultivation

139
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,320
and win Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament.

140
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,420
As soon as he joined the sect,

141
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,230
he committed two serious crimes

142
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,830
of killing his family and breaking sect rules.

143
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,310
He knew it himself.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,130
If the Great Path master knew about it,

145
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,380
he would never make him the premier.

146
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,810
So,

147
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,500
whoever stood in his way

148
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,020
was wiped out by him.

149
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,720
According to the Book of Forbidden Path,

150
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,780
cultivate Yin Zhu,

151
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,470
gather the three hearts,

152
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,120
ascend beyond the limit,

153
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,870
and control reincarnation.

154
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,000
You killed your parents,

155
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,450
your wife, and your disciple.

156
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,100
You killed your master and harmed your friend and the spirits.

157
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,480
What a respectable

158
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,590
premier you are.

159
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,610
Shao Cang.

160
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,220
What I hate the most

161
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,260
is your intelligence.

162
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,480
It was my mistake

163
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,040
to keep you around.

164
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,700
Master, you've plotted for so long.

165
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,640
I'm sure Yan is already within your grasp,

166
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,240
and you don't plan to give up.

167
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,480
Then you can tell her everything

168
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,870
when you meet her in the underworld.

169
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,470
Don't speak too soon;

170
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,910
the winner hasn't been decided yet.

171
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,460
Do you want to compete with me?

172
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,230
For my own sake,

173
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,380
I won't let you harm Nan Yan.

174
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,360
For the world's sake,

175
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,450
I won't let you spread your chaos.

176
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,830
Today,

177
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,830
I'll finish this game with you.

178
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,330
How can you defeat me?

179
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,740
I can do it alone.

180
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,110
Then, let us fight.

181
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,210
You did something

182
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,440
to the jade.

183
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,800
Do you really think

184
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,770
I would be so stupid

185
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,140
to give this jade to you?

186
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,000
If you kill me,

187
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,880
the world will think

188
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,440
Sen Luo is dead for good.

189
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,520
You're really scheming.

190
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,670
The Demon-Subduing Nails?

191
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,360
You cannot use this jade.

192
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,030
Why not?

193
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,610
This jade has been cast with a reverse spell.

194
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,000
Once it is activated,

195
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,790
it will suck out all the Yin Zhus

196
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,270
in your body.

197
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,060
You went through the trouble of giving me the jade.

198
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,190
Naturally, I had to

199
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,630
return the Demon-Subduing Nails to you.

200
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,790
You!

201
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,470
Protect the Premier with me!

202
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,520
You want to kill your master?

203
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,290
The evil should be eliminated.

204
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,590
I dare not forget

205
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,280
your teaching, Master.

206
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,960
The Demon-slaying Order has been issued.

207
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,360
How dare you harm the Premier of Great Path?

208
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,510
Do you think Great Path and all the sects in the world

209
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,700
are all pushovers?

210
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,550
Do you really think so, Father?

211
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,650
You're not hurt?

212
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,740
I've known Ji Yang for three years.

213
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,500
I know him best.

214
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,940
Do you think you can provoke me

215
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,130
with just a few words?

216
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,240
Big Brother.

217
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,110
I came to you

218
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,200
to discuss

219
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,490
something important.

220
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,710
Look.

221
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,050
Isn't this Uncle's...

222
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,030
Isn't this his silver mermaid pearl?

223
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,810
Yes.

224
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,760
Uncle was investigating my mother's death.

225
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,050
He knew that

226
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,820
she and Ying Zewei

227
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,250
were deeply entangled.

228
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,320
He must have come to Great Path

229
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,450
to interrogate him.

230
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,350
But today,

231
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,440
when I asked Ying Zewei

232
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,030
about my uncle's whereabouts,

233
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,230
he insisted that

234
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,460
he never saw him.

235
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,040
I knew something was fishy.

236
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,780
Besides, that day,

237
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,880
I vaguely sensed

238
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,170
a familiar scent

239
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,170
consistently guiding me.

240
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,130
As expected,

241
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,000
I found this by the river.

242
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,610
That old man Ying

243
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,070
is indeed suspicious.

244
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,770
In that case,

245
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,750
there must be more to the case of Ji Yang

246
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,950
murdering my father than meets the eye.

247
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,830
But you have given the

248
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,090
demon-slaying order.

249
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,240
Proceed with everything as planned.

250
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,370
When we finally talk to my uncle,

251
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,430
we can find out the truth.

252
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,600
Okay.

253
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,500
Could Uncle already be...

254
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,310
No.

255
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,290
The silver mermaid pearl

256
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,220
still contains Jiao Niang's aura.

257
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,340
If my uncle dies,

258
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,890
Jiao Niang's soul will surely perish

259
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,430
with him.

260
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,490
So I speculate that

261
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,720
Uncle is in the Great Path Sect.

262
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,180
I'll go find him now.

263
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,320
Big Brother.

264
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,980
Great Path has many eyes and ears.

265
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,720
If we make a scene,

266
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,060
we'll alert them.

267
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,200
Don't worry.

268
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,560
Let's make a

269
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,780
bigger scene.

270
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,390
He killed my father,

271
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,910
but you're still defending him?

272
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,670
Fine!

273
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,620
Let's cut ties from now on!

274
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,530
What's wrong?

275
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,720
Why are you arguing?

276
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,600
So what if you're a monarch?

277
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,200
You're still a blind fool

278
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,020
who can't tell right from wrong!

279
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,090
Step aside!

280
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,960
I'll kill him!

281
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,650
Leave me alone.

282
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,080
I'll kill Ji Yang.

283
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,400
My Lady.

284
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,040
Shall I...

285
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,760
It's fine.

286
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,120
He's still frustrated at heart.

287
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,090
It's good for him to vent his anger.

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,110
As long as he doesn't bother the Premier,

289
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,240
just ignore

290
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,350
whatever he does.

291
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,960
Yes.

292
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,790
Ji Yang!

293
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,310
I was blind to believe you!

294
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,970
Ji Yang.

295
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,080
I was blind to...

296
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,610
Don't touch me!

297
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,570
I want revenge!

298
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,300
I want revenge against Ji Yang!

299
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,690
I want to kill him!

300
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,560
Kill him!

301
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,840
Kill him.

302
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,380
I want revenge!

303
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,700
Revenge...

304
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,740
Uncle...

305
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,580
You killed my sister.

306
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,830
You're here.

307
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,780
I don't care what you

308
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,240
want this evil thing for.

309
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,290
I only know if you

310
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,790
didn't have the Nirvana spirit heart,

311
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,790
you wouldn't be able to escape the backfire

312
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,120
and survive to this day.

313
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,540
Nan Yi.

314
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,590
You led a pitiful life

315
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,570
all because of your emotions.

316
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,800
The great path is void of emotions.

317
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,930
You still failed to understand that.

318
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,570
I've had countless troubles in my life.

319
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,910
I need to make it count

320
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,040
and protect at least

321
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,110
one person dear to me.

322
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,190
So,

323
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,270
Shao Cang isn't the only one

324
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,730
with the power of Yin Zhus.

325
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,880
The Premier too,

326
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,590
right?

327
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,710
Then, what happened on the whaleboat today...

328
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,440
Big Brother and I hid in the dark

329
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,200
and confirmed it with our own eyes.

330
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,730
So today,

331
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,690
Premier deliberately sent us away

332
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,770
because he wanted to blame everything on Senior.

333
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,220
Not only today.

334
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,630
I'm afraid that, from the beginning,

335
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,270
he had framed Shao Cang

336
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,200
for becoming demonic

337
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,490
and killing his fellow sect members.

338
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,850
All disciples, listen up.

339
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,990
Protect the Great Path Sect!

340
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,240
Yes.

341
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,780
Elder Zhu,

342
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,960
I'm willing to go with you.

343
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,530
Li Chi.

344
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,190
How have you been?

345
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,430
Formation!

346
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,400
Mo was right.

347
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,560
He is indeed Li Chi.

348
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,210
Formation!

349
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:09,800
Li Chi!

350
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,210
Give my father back!

351
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,350
All sects have been ordered

352
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,890
to uphold righteousness together

353
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,240
and eliminate demonic forces.

354
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,820
But now,

355
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,220
haven't you already confirmed

356
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,770
who is

357
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,080
a demon and

358
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,350
who is righteous?

359
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,170
You've been lying to me.

360
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,110
You deceived me first.

361
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,040
In the Bone-Deep Mirror,

362
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,080
didn't you make me misunderstand Ji Yang

363
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,740
and help me become the monarch

364
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,910
so that you could

365
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,440
turn us against each other?

366
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,060
So,

367
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,660
you've never accepted me as your father.

368
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,220
My mother said

369
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,430
I don't have a father.

370
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,550
Yan.

371
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,410
My mother was right.

372
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,320
I don't have a father.

373
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,350
Because from the moment you

374
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,080
snatched her Internal Elixir,

375
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,360
I no longer needed

376
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,580
a father like you.

377
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,960
She truly hated me.

378
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,780
She loved you,

379
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,700
respected you,

380
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,420
and willingly entrusted herself to you.

381
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,200
But you lied to her

382
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,980
and hurt her.

383
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,440
You made her suffer

384
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,500
the pain of a damaged heart every day.

385
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,440
She suffered with every breath

386
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,000
for a hundred years.

387
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,990
She lived so pitifully.

388
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,930
Why wouldn't she hate you?

389
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,810
She disrupted my mind

390
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,640
and obstructed my great cause.

391
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,510
I don't regret

392
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,030
killing her!

393
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
I don't regret it.

394
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,900
Have you ever, even for one moment,

395
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,650
thought of sparing her life?

396
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,400
Of course I have.

397
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,640
If I hadn't been too conceited,

398
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,430
I wouldn't have fallen for her.

399
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,750
I already wanted to kill her,

400
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,830
but she told me

401
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,550
she would marry me.

402
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,220
If you don't want it, I'm taking it back.

403
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,870
Rao.

404
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,150
Thank you.

405
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,850
Since you've received the token,

406
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,800
you

407
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,550
are mine now.

408
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,750
You still didn't let her go.

409
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,270
You've turned soft.

410
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,170
Yes.

411
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,400
I regret it.

412
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,710
Forget being the best

413
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,840
or becoming the master of the Netherworld.

414
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,100
I don't want that anymore.

415
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,300
I only want Nan Rao...

416
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,520
To live.

417
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,960
You cannot achieve greatness

418
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,990
if you let your emotions overtake you.

419
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,050
You must pass

420
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,070
this trial.

421
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,420
You're not Ying Zewei.

422
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,900
You don't belong to yourself.

423
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,700
You belong to the Netherworld.

424
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,010
You're the master of the Netherworld.

425
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,300
I'm Ying Zewei!

426
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,830
Who are you?

427
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,930
I'm Ying Zewei!

428
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,600
Who are you?

429
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,580
I am...

430
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,170
the master of the Netherworld.

431
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,390
I've sworn to my inner demon.

432
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,560
A sword hung from my head

433
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,430
and kept driving me forward.

434
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,520
Your mother's death

435
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,390
was not up to me.

436
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,470
Yan.

437
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,420
I had no choice.

438
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,070
I couldn't choose.

439
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,620
But when you hurt my mother,

440
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,090
you were conscious,

441
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,480
right?

442
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,850
The inner demon will never die.

443
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,300
It was her,

444
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,440
or me.

445
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,160
Enough!

446
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,760
Stop making excuses.

447
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,570
My mother was pursuing someone she loved,

448
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,240
but you framed her for

449
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,700
seducing you and ruining your cultivation.

450
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,410
And Uncle.

451
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,600
He treated you as his best friend.

452
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,600
When you killed him,

453
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,420
did you show him any mercy?

454
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,150
If you didn't have a demon in your heart,

455
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,080
you wouldn't have sworn anything!

456
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,110
You killed your wife and went against the path.

457
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,110
Not only did you take

458
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,850
Chief Nan's Nirvana spirit heart

459
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,510
and my Heart of the Six Realms,

460
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,190
now you want to kill your own daughter?

461
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,680
What's there to deny?

462
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,680
My mother was right.

463
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,200
You have

464
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,080
never thought of

465
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,990
letting me go.

466
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,750
I wanted to spare her life

467
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,290
and watch the world with her.

468
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,840
But she took

469
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
what I wanted.

470
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,930
And you.

471
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,320
Why did it have to be all of you?

472
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,780
My mother had me

473
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,070
hundreds of years ago.

474
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,600
But at that time,

475
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,030
she was badly hurt by you.

476
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,170
She wandered the cultivation realm for decades.

477
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,750
She only dared to stay in

478
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,400
the North when you stopped hunting for her

479
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
and finally gave birth to me.

480
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,220
The second half of her life

481
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,040
seemed carefree on the surface,

482
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,280
but she was planning her

483
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,540
every move and step

484
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,460
to protect me and keep me alive.

485
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,570
But today,

486
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,900
her efforts

487
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,640
will be disappointed again.

488
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,570
I've wronged her

489
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,680
and you.

490
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,060
It's too late.

491
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,590
There's no turning back.

492
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,100
To love someone

493
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,500
is to live and die for them.

494
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,310
But you abandoned my mother.

495
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,150
She must

496
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,730
abandon her love.

497
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,240
But I will never forget

498
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,030
to avenge her death.

499
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,420
Thank you for telling me the truth, Premier.

500
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,550
Today,

501
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,590
as long as I can take revenge

502
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,920
for my mother and uncle,

503
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,490
I shall die with no regret.

504
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,780
Even the people from the Sword Sect

505
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,320
and Yao Palace

506
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,130
are just toys in my hands.

507
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,610
You think the two of you

508
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,920
can kill me?

509
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,440
And us!

510
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,450
You

511
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,180
really put on a good show.

512
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,620
In my life,

513
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,600
I despise people like you

514
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
who are sinister and hypocritical.

515
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,840
You even tried to sow discord

516
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,370
between me and my siblings.

517
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,430
You blind fool!

518
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,480
How dare you weaklings

519
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,090
try to stop me?

520
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,310
No one can break Evil Path's

521
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,440
forbidden barrier.

522
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,430
None of you can escape

523
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,580
from my hands today.

524
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,580
All of you will die!

525
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,470
Brother.

526
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
You finally recognize me.

527
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,870
Brother.

528
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,850
I've completed

529
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,810
Master's order.

530
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:25,950
Nan Yi is dead.

531
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,490
The silver mermaid pearl is the proof.

532
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,880
Mian.

533
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:45,690
You...

534
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,200
I'm sorry, Brother.

535
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,820
Although you've changed your body,

536
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,950
you're still affected

537
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,210
by your heart disease.

538
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,360
Mr. Nan Yi was righteous.

539
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,840
He transferred the last half of his power

540
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,160
into the silver mermaid pearl

541
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,560
to help me get rid of evil.

542
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,720
Don't blame me.

543
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,100
Mian!

544
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,190
Brother.

545
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,630
Look.

546
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,800
This is what happens when you disobey me.

547
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,640
Brother.

548
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,330
I took that hit for you

549
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,950
because I want you to

550
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,720
return to the right path.

551
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,160
I hope you can...

552
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,770
Return to the right path?

553
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,000
I'm afraid it's impossible

554
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,180
for me in this lifetime.

555
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,130
Brother.

556
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,240
What are you doing?

557
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,520
Return to the right path.

558
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,200
If this is really what you want,

559
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,890
I'll let you be willful this time.

560
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,980
Don't regret it.

561
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,130
I'm sorry.

562
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,740
By the way,

563
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,270
your right-hand assistant, Fu Lang,

564
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,900
has been trapped by

565
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,240
Elder Zhu and the others.

566
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,240
I'm afraid he can't come now.

567
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,090
Mu Guanghan.

568
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,470
I respected him.

569
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,480
You are a willful playboy

570
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,880
who writes poems all day.

571
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,160
Now you're talking big in my sect.

572
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,940
Do you really think you're the Dragon Lord?

573
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,910
The Heavenly Fire?

574
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,440
I really underestimated you.

575
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,620
You are very calculating.

576
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,960
You locked the spirits

577
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,560
in the Spirit-Sealing Formation for 100 years

578
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,080
to absorb all their spiritual power

579
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,480
and let them die in there.

580
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,050
Today,

581
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,530
I'll avenge all of them.

582
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,780
Only one person in this world can become a god.

583
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,240
You can't beat me!

584
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,530
You can't take him away!

585
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,730
The Zen Heart of Brahma Bones?

586
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,790
The Nirvana spirit heart

587
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,250
and Heart of the Six Realms

588
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,050
never belonged to you.

589
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,740
Don't think about getting

590
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,340
the Zen Heart of Brahma Bones either!

591
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,430
Then, let's die together.

592
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,260
If I win,

593
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,610
Heaven and Earth will coexist.

594
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,300
If I lose,

595
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,670
I'll drag everyone down with me!

596
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,260
I've broken his ability to regenerate.

597
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,020
When Sen Luo reappears,

598
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,340
all things will perish.

599
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,340
I was right about everyone

600
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,130
except you.

601
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,250
You lost

602
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:32,100
because you miscalculated yourself.

603
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,460
There is no strongest in the world.

604
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,870
If you want to save her,

605
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,610
the only way

606
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,969
is to gather the Five Hells

607
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,730
to combine all of Yin Zhu's power

608
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,110
and eliminate Seven Sins.

609
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,560
That's how you can save her.

610
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,070
I’ll entrust my

611
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,070
great cause to you.

612
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,320
Ji Yang!

613
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,300
The Netherworld's river flows.

614
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:23,060
♫When the moon rises and the sun sets, who is singing their loneliness softly♫

615
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,490
Feng Capital appears again.

616
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,180
Ji Yang.

617
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,100
It's me.

618
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:29,710
♫The heart cries, complaining♫

619
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,050
Ji Yang.

620
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,900
Look carefully.

621
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,430
♫Bind oneself up♫

622
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,990
I'm Nan Yan!

623
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:37,180
♫I turn a blind eye for you♫

624
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,460
Calm down.

625
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,690
You want to stop me too?

626
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:43,670
♫My heart belongs to someone, so I'm not afraid of loneliness♫

627
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,900
I'm Nan Yan.

628
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:51,400
♫When I can't find my way back in the world♫

629
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,740
Ji Yang.

630
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,950
Are you really going to kill them

631
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,280
and me?

632
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:58,130
♫You are my only way back♫

633
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,380
Why not?

634
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,490
When the four seas are submerged in the Netherworld,

635
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:05,490
♫Time will engrave the love into my bones♫

636
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,610
everyone

637
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,990
can be immortal.

638
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,840
You won't.

639
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,020
You won't.

640
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:12,160
♫Will you still remember your roots?♫

641
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,530
Why?

642
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,660
Can you kill me?

643
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,260
♫Go through your day♫

644
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,780
♫And my night♫

645
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,560
♫Before I wake up♫

646
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,370
♫Follow the fate of my previous life♫

647
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,960
♫Travel through time♫

648
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,300
I won't kill you.

649
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,520
♫To see♫

650
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,490
♫The firefly of love♫

651
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,920
I won't exorcise you either.

652
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,090
♫Transforming into a butterfly♫

653
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,660
This time,

654
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,770
♫Landing at your fingertips♫

655
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,440
I won't do anything.

656
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,520
♫Make a wish before the light♫

657
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,070
I'm not going anywhere.

658
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,320
♫May life be♫

659
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,690
I'll stay here with you,

660
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,360
okay?

661
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,180
♫Like the first meeting♫
