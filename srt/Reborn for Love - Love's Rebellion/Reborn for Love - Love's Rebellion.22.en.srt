We're almost home.

00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,090
Almost home.

6
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,110
Yes, we're almost home.

7
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,830
Are you happy?

8
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,110
Yes.

9
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,070
Seeing how carefully you are dressed,

10
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,710
I know there must be

11
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,530
someone waiting for you at the dock.

12
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,730
Don't talk nonsense.

13
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,870
It's just arriving at the destination,

15
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,880
so elated about the

17
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,800
The destination itself

18
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,630
is a joy.

19
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,940
It means the return of the beloved,

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,680
reunion after parting,

21
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,680
and the patient waiting of those expected.

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,140
Each and every one of these

23
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,990
is a blessing in the world.

24
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,280

Why are you still downcast?

29
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,410
Yes.

30

It seems that

Since we're here,

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,079
we might as well pay a visit.

Here is the fine bronze ware.

the blood centipede just now

88
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,740

But it's okay.

98

99
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,130
I'll make up for it.

What he didn't have time to do,

101
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,550
I'd do it for him.

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:05,950
Three years ago,

197
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,750
Zhu Sui was already relentless.

198
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,780
If we were to encounter him now,

199
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,710
it would only create more trouble.

200
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,870
I'll beat him up.

201
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,560
Zhu Sui was the

202
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,260
troublemaker before,

203
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,830
and I've been wanting to teach him a lesson.

204
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,160
Now that he's come to me,

205
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,810
I'll teach him a lesson.

206
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,440
No.

207
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,730
We haven't found the culprit yet.

208
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,930
Let's not tip him off.

209
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,110
How about this,

210
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,270
you stay here

211
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,400
and see who comes in and out.

212
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,670
I'll go check out the Great Path

213
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,770
to find out

214
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,290
what brought them here.

215
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,270
W...

216
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:41,870
Well,

217
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,830
how can you deal with them alone?

218
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,510
If they take advantage of

219
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,370
what happened three years ago...

220
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,140
You both are leaving?

221
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,260
What should I do?

222
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,170
Gentlemen, please sit.

223
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,040
Waiter, give us a pot of tea.

224
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,640
Elder Zhu,

225
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,000
long time no see.

226
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,320
You're the girl

227
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,400
of Lunar Sect

228
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,240
who covered for the rebel back then.

229
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,030
Elder Zhu, you

230
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,490
had no evidence back then,

231
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,190
but you still applied the thunder punishment.

232
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,990
Now,

233
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,710
three years have passed.

234
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,990
Elder Zhu,

235
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,860
you haven't changed at all.

236
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,290
Three years ago,

237
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,290
Shao Cang died at the bottom of Filth Valley.

238
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,600
There is no way we can find out what happened.

239
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,690
We should

240
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,180
let bygones be bygones.

241
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,310
We also heard

242
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,090
Lunar Sect was massacred.

243
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,030
I wonder

244
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,480
why you came to Nancang.

245
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,620
Now I'm Zhen Yuan, a disciple

246
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,390
of Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea.

247
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,750
I have been eliminating demons along the way.

248
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,880
I'm just passing by.

249
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,790
You're Bloody-handed Asura?

250
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,970
I've admired you for a long time.

251
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,350
Since we are on the same side,

252
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,200
why don't we eat together later?

253
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:10,960
If you encounter problems

254
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,180
when you eliminate demons in the future,

255
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,110
maybe Great Path can help you.

256
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,180
Xingzheng,

257
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,020
we still haven't taken care

258
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,150
of our own business.

259
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,330
Don't be nosy.

260
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,660
You came with so many men.

261
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,630
It must be something important.

262
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,190
Why have I never heard of it

263
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,660
along my way here?

264
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,430
Friend, no need to panic.

265
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,150
This has nothing to do with eliminating demons.

266
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,400
The Spirit-Sealing Formation

267
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,390
was set up 100 years ago.

268
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,630
Now the formation is unstable.

269
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,370
So Master sent us

270
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,760
to reinforce the seal.

271
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,710
That's why we are resting here.

272
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,160
Since it's been 100 years,

273
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
you should release the spirits as promised.

274
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,680
But you still have failed to keep your promise.

275
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,600
I thought

276
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,650
you just didn't care

277
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,680
about the spirits' lives.

278
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,810
But you actually are

279
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,750
making great efforts to strengthen the seal.

280
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,430
Great Path's behavior is indeed unjust.

281
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,250
I wonder why you're doing this.

282
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,350
We're just following the order.

283
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,350
We haven't asked about the specific reason.

284
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,200
I think you know the reason.

285
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,190
You just don't dare to admit

286
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,950
you've openly broken the promise

287
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,150
and you want to torture the spirit clan!

288
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,230
How come you don't dare to admit

289
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,800
you are a fox spirit?

290
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,840
Shao Cang?

291
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,560
You're not dead?

292
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,230
You know me?

293
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,080
So you guys

294
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,380
put on a show together

295
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,980
to let everyone know

296
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,460
you died in Filth Valley.

297
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,230
Interesting.

298
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,260
Looks like the fact

299
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,030
is far more interesting than I thought.

300
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,880
You don't recognize us?

301
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,570
You don't remember

302
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,220
what happened in Great Path?

303
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,920
Three years ago,

304
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,820
when Master said you went astray,

305
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,520
I should have believed it.

306
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,680
-A man who lost his mind after practicing the skills of demons
-I went astray three years ago?

307
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,350
will forget everything.

308
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,480
In the end, he'll only have

309
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,550
a heartless demonic heart.

310
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,640
Array!

311
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,240
Catch the rebel!

312
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,650
[Yumen Inn]

313
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,990
He doesn't remember,

314
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,930
but I remember!

315
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,400
You guys leave first.

316
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,680
[Order]

317
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,060
Look what this is.

318
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,100
Dragon Lord is not here,

319
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,830
but I have Dragon Lord's token.

320
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,130
If you let go

321
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,620
of what happened today,

322
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,980
[Order]

323
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,980
Dragon Capital will pretend

324
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,510
that nothing has happened.

325
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,150
[Order]

326
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,730
Oh no.

327
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,740
The Blood Phoenix Hairpin is missing.

328
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,790
The cargo receiver

329
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,320
must know

330
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,120
when the whaleboat would reach the shore.

331
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,910
We've been waiting in ambush here for a long time.

332
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,070
But the hairpin receiver

333
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,340
has never shown up.

334
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,440
When we were dealing

335
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,700
with Great Path,

336
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,550
they took the chance to take the Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

337
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,390
So,

338
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,830
our ambush plan

339
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,600
has been seen through.

340
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,340
Looks like

341
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,950
the enemy is much smarter

342
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,120
than we thought.

343
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,870
Damn Great Path.

344
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,350
They ruined our plan.

345
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,119
I made

346
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,950
the fake Blood Phoenix Hairpin painstakingly

347
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,910
for nothing.

348
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,109
In other words,

349
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,829
our method of finding the mastermind

350
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,619
won't work anymore?

351
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,520
They don't know

352
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,790
they took a fake one?

353
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,579
I don't think so. We prepared a fake hairpin

354
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,770
to lure them out.

355
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,119
Although the fake hairpin is gone,

356
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,069
we still have a backup plan.

357
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,510
If they find out

358
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,680
the hairpin is fake,

359
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,430
we won't need to look for them.

360
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,060
They'll look for us.

361
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,660
In other words,

362
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,820
we can still invite them into our trap.

363
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,820
In other words,

364
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:40,580
no matter what,

365
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,350
everything is under our control?

366
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,490
Then...

367
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,270
Dismissed. Let's go eat.

368
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,470
How about this? I'm going to compensate

369
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,590
for the inn owner's loss.

370
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,490
You go back to your rooms and rest.

371
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,120
I'll tell you

372
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,210
when the meal is ready.

373
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,070
Let me help you.

374
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,670
You go back to your room and rest first.

375
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,480
I need

376
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,670
to meet someone.

377
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,580
I didn't expect

378
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,320
you would come to me.

379
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,610
You didn't finish your story.

380
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,510
You were the monarch of Great Path.

381
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,030
You were the successor

382
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,790
appointed by Master.

383
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,970
But you lost your mind overnight

384
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,600
and slaughtered your seniors and juniors.

385
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,430
You saw it with your own eyes?

386
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,910
The person who witnessed it

387
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,370
is Master who loved you the most.

388
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,140
He is your master after all.

389
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,610
I advise you to turn back.

390
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,650
It's boring to turn back.

391
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,980
It's not as good as

392
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,070
the fresh and unknown scenery ahead.

393
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,100
If so,

394
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,740
it's Great Path's duty

395
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,930
to eliminate demons!

396
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,930
Eliminate demons.

397
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,350
You're willing to risk your life

398
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,990
to do such a thing.

399
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,260
You're foolish,

400
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,990
but you're not hypocritical at least.

401
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,530
I'll let you go today.

402
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,150
What did you say?

403
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,510
I said I'll go with you to the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

404
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,160
Great Path

405
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,880
wants to strengthen the formation, right?

406
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,640
If we can

407
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,190
get there before they strengthen it,

408
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,190
we can have a chance

409
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,510
to save your clansmen.

410
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,110
You still haven't avenged Chief Meng.

411
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,870
How can you delay it

412
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,670
because of me?

413
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,650
Revenge is a dish

414
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
best served cold.

415
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:29,960
But...

416
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,200
this is

417
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,230
your only chance.

418
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,860
If you miss this chance,

419
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,800
we don't know

420
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,510
how long you'll have to wait.

421
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,750
This is the fox clan's business.

422
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,420
I'll go break the Spirit-Sealing Formation myself.

423
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,150
But now,

424
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,600
you still don't have seven tails.

425
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,640
It's too dangerous

426
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,830
to go alone.

427
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,150
You can rest assured.

428
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,280
This is why I've been wandering around

429
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,240
for the past 100 years.

430
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,240
If I can't succeed,

431
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,350
I can't have freedom.

432
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,610
Why don't I just put up a desperate fight?

433
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,680
If I can succeed,

434
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,670
I can be free.

435
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,450
If I can't succeed,

436
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,600
I can be free too.

437
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,770
Stinky Fox,

438
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,180
I'll go with you.

439
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,310
You want to avenge

440
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,190
Chief Meng too, right?

441
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:24,790
What's more,

442
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,530
Nan Yan's situation

443
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,030
is more dangerous than mine.

444
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,890
Don't worry.

445
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,540
With me here,

446
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,230
Nan Yan will be safe.

447
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,400
The outcome of this journey is unpredictable.

448
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,230
Don't worry.

449
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,200
Now, Zhu Sui

450
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,230
is no match for me.

451
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,830
Besides,

452
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,170
I am the Young Dragon Lord.

453
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,300
I'm distinguished.

454
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,540
Even if we are in danger...

455
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,230
we can play it by ear.

456
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,150
Right?

457
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,750
Okay.

458
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,000
Since Big Brother will go with you,

459
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,830
I can rest assured.

460
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,330
What about you?

461
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,910
What do you plan to do next?

462
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,460
You have the real Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

463
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,150
Do you plan

464
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,420
to wait for him here?

465
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,830
If they fail to find out

466
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,960
they took a fake one,

467
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
your waiting will be in vain, right?

468
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,100
Who was the demon just now?

469
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,070
I only know the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

470
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,200
can open the formation eye of Youquan Prison in Nancang.

471
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,770
You must catch up with him and get the hairpin back.

472
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,770
Don't let others get the upper hand.

473
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,670
That demon covets it.

474
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,780
It must be because he wants

475
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,430
to gather the power of Yin Zhu

476
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,170
to bring chaos to the cultivation realm.

477
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,320
Before Chief Meng died, he said

478
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,510
the demon wants the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

479
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,510
because he wants to enter

480
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,820
Nancang's Youquan Prison

481
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,480
to gather the power of Yin Zhu.

482
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,120
So,

483
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,580
if we want to meet him,

484
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,120
we plan to go to Youquan Prison first.

485
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,370
In this way,

486
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,550
we won't miss him again.

487
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,730
If we want to go to Spirit-Sealing Island,

488
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,990
we should leave early tomorrow morning.

489
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,150
Consider this

490
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,640
as farewell wine.

491
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,130
Nan Yan,

492
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,350
you can drink tea.

493
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,260
I hope we'll drink wine

494
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,640
to celebrate

495
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,880
when we meet next time.

496
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,760
I hope

497
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,760
we can avenge Lunar Sect

498
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,950
and the fox clan can return to Qingqiu.

499
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,670
Bottoms up.

500
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,680
It takes two days

501
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,710
to reach Spirit-Sealing Island

502
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,110
at the soonest.

503
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,230
You must get there

504
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,950
before Zhu Sui and the others.

505
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,790
Sister, don't worry.

506
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,830
There are many of them.

507
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,270
They have to take a big ship.

508
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,110
It's not as convenient or fast as a small boat.

509
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,830
We definitely can

510
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,510
arrive at the Spirit-Sealing Formation

511
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,350
before them.

512
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,650
That's good.

513
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,230
It's been three years since we parted.

514
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,710
We've only been reunited for a few days.

515
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,190
I didn't expect

516
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,070
we're going to part again so soon.

517
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,000
As the saying goes, reunions and partings are inevitable,

518
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:16,860
and the sorrow of partings...

519
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,000
As long as we are alive,

520
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,360
we will meet again.

521
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,930
You two, take care.

522
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,130
If anything happens,

523
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,410
send me the jade amulet immediately.

524
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,690
You didn't let me finish my words.

525
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,820
I can't believe you.

526
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,000
You should be careful too.

527
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,400
Let's go.

528
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,030
Let's go.

529
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,190
A man who lost his mind

530
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,620
after practicing the skills of demons

531
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,680
will forget everything.

532
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,070
In the end, he'll only have

533
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,080
a heartless demonic heart.

534
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,910
You were the monarch of Great Path.

535
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,790
You were the successor

536
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,350
appointed by Master.

537
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,200
But you lost your mind overnight

538
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,620
and slaughtered your seniors and juniors.

539
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,980
What's wrong?

540
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,520
Nothing.

541
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,420
The road ahead is dangerous.

542
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,300
If there is anything wrong,

543
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,930
you must tell me.

544
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,430
Okay.

545
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,030
I promise you.

546
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,350
You know this.

547
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,290
What I've always wanted...

548
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,150
I know.

549
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,780
You want me to be safe.

550
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,180
I will be careful.

551
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,670
By the way,

552
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,980
this mysterious man

553
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,670
killed Chief Meng so easily

554
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,360
and even massacred all the Lunar Sect's disciples.

555
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,550
We shouldn't underestimate his ability.

556
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,230
Even if we work together,

557
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,430
I'm afraid

558
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,620
we can't defeat him for sure.

559
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,560
If we can't

560
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,150
arrest him this time,

561
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,740
I'm afraid after he gains the power of Yin Zhu

562
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,010
in the next prison,

563
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,230
it will be harder for us

564
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,890
to deal with him in the future.

565
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,960
If we wait until he becomes stronger,

566
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,640
who knows who will be the next victim

567
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,840
after the Lunar Sect?

568
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,270
Are you not letting him go

569
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,280
not just because

570
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,770
you want to avenge your sect and your master?

571
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,550
If he continues to be strong,

572
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,110
he will slaughter many people

573
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,770
and create chaos everywhere.

574
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,400
I must stop him.

575
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,750
That's easy.

576
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,410
We have the Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

577
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,950
I'll take over the Youquan Prison first.

578
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,480
In this way, we can stop him.

579
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,880
But Yin Zhu is an evil power.

580
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,630
If you take over one more prison,

581
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,630
I'm afraid you'll be hurt by Yin Zhu.

582
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,600
You're by my side.

583
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,070
Not only have you mastered the "Seven Sins,"

584
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,550
but you are also a physician.

585
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,410
I'm not afraid.

586
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,600
I'm not afraid

587
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,150
to be with you

588
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,390
and do what you want to do.

589
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,890
Let's go.

590
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,540
How is it?

591
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,590
The second prison is hidden nearby.

592
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,510
Neither birds nor beasts are living here.

593
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,650
Also, the terrain is complicated.

594
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,380
There must be something fishy.

595
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,200
We should be careful.

596
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,250
Let's go.

597
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
The second prison

598
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,140
is called Youquan Prison.

599
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
It's hidden here.

600
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,290
I wonder

601
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,030
when the murderer will come.

602
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,020
Why don't we put him in jail first?

603
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,950
Maybe

604
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,590
he will show up after hearing the news.

605
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:37,790
Be careful.

606
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,150
These

607
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,260
seem to be Creeping Bloodthorns

608
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,790
that suck blood to survive.

609
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,000
Help!

610
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,090
Help!

611
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,040
Is anyone there?

612
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,920
Help!

613
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,310
Help me!

614
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,350
Help me!

615
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,120
Help me!

616
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,180
You're safe now.

617
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,510
I'll go and start the formation.

618
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,710
There's a secret magic seal on the formation.

619
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,020
Neither the demonic aura nor the magic can break it.

620
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,900
Even if

621
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,360
the Grand Master of the cultivation realm is here,

622
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,020
he can't do anything about it.

623
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:35,840
Who is it?

624
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,380
Who are you?

625
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,750
Why did you break into the formation?

626
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,590
Sir,

627
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,220
we just passed by

628
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,990
and heard someone asking for help.

629
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,520
It was a misunderstanding.

630
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,080
[Chief of Chidi Fort, Huo Wushuang]

631
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,480
Not only did you break into the formation, but you also hurt someone.

632
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,780
Do you want to die?

633
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
Please calm down.

634
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,840
You'll know the truth

635
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,820
when the young lady regains her consciousness.

636
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,450
Are you trying to buy time?

637
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,440
I won't be fooled.

638
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,320
You two foreigners

639
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,860
were sneaking around in our forbidden area.

640
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,140
You must be up to no good.

641
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,750
You don't listen when we talk nicely,

642
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,510
right?

643
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,370
Calm down.

644
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,010
Sir, please be patient.

645
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,480
We mean no harm.

646
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,700
Chief.

647
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,430
They just saved me.

648
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,750
What happened?

649
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,840
I wanted to come and see

650
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,760
what's here

651
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,250
before the sacrificial ceremony tomorrow.

652
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,070
But then,

653
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,780
I accidentally entered the formation.

654
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,670
If she hadn't saved me,

655
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,230
I would have died.

656
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,560
Nonsense!

657
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,510
How many times have I told you?

658
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,470
This formation

659
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,810
was set using magic skills

660
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,030
in our clan.

661
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,720
Even a deity

662
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,080
can't break through it.

663
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,950
I won't do it again.

664
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,170
You can leave now.

665
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,840
Sir.

666
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,270
We just

667
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,030
strayed into this wilderness.

668
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,360
It's hard to find a way out.

669
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,220
Can we take a break at your place?

670
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,060
Leave as soon as I tell you to.

671
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,030
You two

672
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,150
strangers

673
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,570
suddenly showed up here.

674
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,760
I let you go

675
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,170
only because

676
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,740
you saved her just now.

677
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,440
If you keep pestering us,

678
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,440
don't blame me for being rude.

679
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,310
Chief.

680
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,020
To be honest,

681
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,910
we ran away from our marriage.

682
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,000
We have nowhere to go now.

683
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,880
You ran away from your marriage?

684
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,080
Yes.

685
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,620
We had no choice,

686
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,040
so we hid in the mountain.

687
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,400
If we go out now,

688
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,040
we'll be dead soon.

689
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,190
Chief.

690
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,380
They saved me just now.

691
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,210
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to see Huixiang.

692
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,890
Since they are in trouble now,

693
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,640
I can't leave them alone.

694
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,360
I'm sure Chief

695
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,030
won't sit by as well.

696
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,290
Chief,

697
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,600
judging from your look,

698
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,950
you must be a righteous man.

699
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,750
Could you please show your mercy

700
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,690
and let us stay overnight?

701
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,760
It's true that you don't have any spiritual power.

702
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,070
As a man,

703
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,950
you know nothing

704
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,340
but married

705
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,590
such a great woman.

706
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,060
You'll suffer a lot in the future.

707
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,530
I'm willing to do so.

708
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,060
Fine.

709
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,970
Just one night.

710
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,030
You must leave tomorrow.

711
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:31,880
Thank you, sir.

712
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,960
Good plan, Chief.

713
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,040
What's good?

714
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,580
If Mian hadn't been a busybody,

715
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,850
so what

716
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,630
if the formation is hard to deal with?

717
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,280
These villagers

718
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,790
are just some country bumpkins.

719
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,940
Once we kill them one by one,

720
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,040
I believe

721
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,340
their chief

722
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,050
will start the formation.

723
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,530
Brother.

724
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,070
They are just

725
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:24,929
some simple-minded

726
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,719
barbarians.

727
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:27,710
You don't have to do it yourself.

728
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,070
Tomorrow,

729
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,790
I'll enter the formation

730
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,830
and you just need to

731
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,650
sit idle and enjoy the fruits of my work.

732
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,960
Sit idle and enjoy the fruits?

733
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,790
Sister,

734
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,060
you have to act well.

735
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,030
Don't ruin my plan.

736
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,800
I won't let you down.

737
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,520
[Chidi Fort]

738
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,600
Chief.

739
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,700
This village

740
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,160
is quite unique.

741
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,380
What do you think, my lady?

742
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,950
You came at the right time.

743
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,190
Tomorrow is the Bloodthorns Worship Festival.

744
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,320
Don't talk too much about the village.

745
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,890
Sister, we're here.

746
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,640
Let's go.

747
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,590
Chief.

748
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,500
I have another request.

749
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,070
Why are you so troublesome?

750
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,600
Can we talk in private?

751
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,960
Ba Jiao.

752
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,460
Your family is so poor.

753
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,870
You haven't even tasted

754
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,670
the taste of star anise, have you?
("Star anise" and "Ba Jiao" sound the same in Mandarin)

755
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,310
Why don't you and your sister change your name?

756
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,710
One should be called Mantou,

757
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,350
and the other should be called Pickles.

758
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:16,880
Exactly.

759
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,730
Don't mock my sister!

760
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,970
Let him go!

761
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,200
Let go of my brother!

762
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,590
Who dares to bully my brother?

763
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,420
Kid.

764
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,750
If you bully others,

765
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,370
you'll be beaten up.

766
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:42,980
We...

767
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,150
We're not afraid of you.

768
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,740
Let's go.

769
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,080
Does it hurt?

770
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,250
Sister, it's so late.

771
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,580
Where have you been?

772
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:52,800
They bullied you

773
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,240
because I wasn't at home.

774
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,800
If I'm gone one day,

775
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,200
what will happen to you?

776
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:00,900
Sister.

777
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,110
Who is she?

778
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,040
She's my guest.

779
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
She's staying at our place tonight.

780
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,800
Ba Jiao.

781
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,240
I'm Nan Yan.

782
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,040
What is it?

783
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,440
I ran away with my wife and came here.

784
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,440
All this way,

785
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,530
we've survived

786
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,780
by relying on my wife's magical skills.

787
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,610
Of course.

788
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,030
You triggered the mechanism.

789
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,710
Yet you're a man

790
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,170
without spiritual power,

791
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,110
how could you survive?

792
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,890
Was the formation in the cave

793
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,340
set by you?

794
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,250
Those formations and mechanisms

795
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,710
have nothing to do with me.

796
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,760
It happened hundreds of years ago.

797
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,040
Don't you ever go near there again.

798
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,270
Behave yourself

799
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,550
and live a normal life

800
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,080
with your wife.

801
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,690
Otherwise, you'll lose your life.

802
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,310
By then, even I can't help you.

803
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,240
Is it that scary?

804
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,270
Do you know

805
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,870
what's inside?

806
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,500
I can tell you about it.

807
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,490
Chidi Fort

808
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,920
has been here since ancient times.

809
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,320
Until a hundred years ago,

810
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,780
the Creeping Bloodthorns in the cave

811
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,920
suddenly grew

812
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,440
all over the mountains.

813
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,040
They were so bloodthirsty.

814
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,550
No matter if it's a flying creature

815
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,590
or a terrestrial animal,

816
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,940
two-legged

817
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,590
or four-legged,

818
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,510
none of them survived.

819
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,710
Even a lot of people in our village

820
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,860
died.

821
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,320
Creeping Bloodthorns?

822
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,240
The elders said

823
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,380
the Evil Lord

824
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,730
was living there.

825
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,110
Later on,

826
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,080
Chidi Fort gave all out

827
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,210
to set up a formation with secret skills

828
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,210
so that no one

829
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,690
could go near the Creeping Bloodthorns.

830
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,140
I've indeed never heard of it.

831
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,910
Aren't you curious

832
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,790
who the Evil Lord is?

833
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,220
I never care about

834
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,390
those trivial matters.

835
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,130
What a chief should do is to

836
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,680
start the formation every year at a certain time

837
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,010
to worship the Evil Lord

838
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,510
to ensure the safety of our village.

839
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,070
That's how it has been for these hundred years.

840
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,010
I don't care

841
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,520
whether it's a human or a ghost living there.

842
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,590
Worship?

843
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,750
How?

844
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,350
Don't ask about this.

845
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,980
After tonight,

846
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,680
leave at once.

847
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,180
Don't make things difficult for me.

848
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:52,970
Of course.

849
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,210
After my parents died,

850
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,230
only my brother and I live together.

851
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,390
I work for many families every day,

852
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,790
but I still can't support this family.

853
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,700
Does the chief not care about you?

854
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,630
Even if he can take care of us for a while,

855
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,190
it's not forever.

856
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,430
But tomorrow is the sacrificial ceremony.

857
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,470
I can finally let my brother

858
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,550
live a good life.

859
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,620
My lady.

860
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,000
Give me your spirit stone.

861
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,670
Spirit stone?

862
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,990
Give it to me.

863
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,430
Huixiang, take this.

864
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,710
Sister, this...

865
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,570
Take it.

866
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,160
If it weren't for you,

867
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,270
the two of us

868
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,910
would have been homeless.

869
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,860
I will never forget

870
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,160
your kindness.

871
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,160
Sit down.

872
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,450
Take care of your brother.

873
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,600
Tonight's the Bloodthorns Worship Festival.

874
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,820
It's lively outside

875
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,040
and full of lanterns.

876
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,230
I heard that couples who watch lanterns together

877
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,630
can accompany each other for a long time.

878
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,920
You should go too.

879
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,500
My lady has spent all the money.

880
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,900
It seems that

881
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,230
we will have nothing to eat in the future.

882
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,480
Tell me.

883
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,170
What information did you get?

884
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,310
I've been socializing with him for a long time.

885
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,350
I'm thirsty.

886
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,780
Here, have some tea.

887
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,620
There's no outsider.

888
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,380
What information did you get?
