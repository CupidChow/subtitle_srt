[Episode 9]

4
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,790
Father.

5
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,430
You finally understand me.

6
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,780
You must keep your word.promise.

7
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,650
When my poetry club

8
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,510
become famous throughout the world

9
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,130
and leave a mark in history...

10
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,320
You want to leave a mark in history

11
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,950
with that terrible poem of yours?

12
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,830
More like a bad reputation that will transcend it all.

13
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,340
The Dragon Lord

14
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,450
won't go back on their word.

15
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,450
You did.

16
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,870
If you keep nagging,

17
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,670
I'll shape you into a ball

18
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,990
and kick you out.

19
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,270
No.

20
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,400
Why are you so heavy?

21
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,440
Did he eat weights?

22
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,480
My waist

23
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,730
is breaking.

24
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,370
Why are you here?

25
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,870
Do you think

26
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,760
I should faint too?

27
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,250
You were not poisoned.

28
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,690
Father.

29
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,350
The poison of the mushroom

30
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,420
is taking effect.

31
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,850
Lord Shao Cang.

32
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,050
You pretended so well.

33
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,029
So just now,

34
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,690
you heard my conversation

35
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,600
with her?

36
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,790
You think

37
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,480
you can get the Seven Sins Manual?

38
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,390
You can think about why I can't.

39
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,550
You stayed in Lunar Sect

40
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,580
not just to see a doctor, right?

41
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,710
Then what do you think

42
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,950
I did it for?

43
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,909
Of course it's for

44
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,110
when the day Filth Valley opens up

45
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,110
for you to enter and gain this skill.

46
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,640
But Yin Zhu appears around Filth Valley

47
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,360
and there are dangers everywhere.

48
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,030
Whether you can get the Seven Sins Manual

49
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,220
depends on luck.

50
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,550
Even if your level

51
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,270
is higher than me,

52
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,230
so what?

53
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,310
Maybe I'm the one

54
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,080
who will have

55
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,690
the last laugh.

56
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,800
How arrogant.

57
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,510
It's none of my business

58
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,270
if you want to end your life by entering Filth Valley.

59
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,650
But let me remind you.

60
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,230
As long as you are in Lunar Sect,

61
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,950
stop thinking of pulling any tricks

62
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,090
and be a good and sensible fox.

63
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,520
It's none of your business.

64
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,610
Since Nan Yan has promised me

65
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,670
that she will lend me

66
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,190
the silver mermaid pearl,

67
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:28,790
I won't

68
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,790
disappoint her

69
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,130
by pulling any tricks.

70
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,740
You wouldn't dare.

71
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,790
Good morning.

72
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,390
Good morning my butt!

73
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,590
Let me ask you!

74
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,860
Why did you poison me?

75
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,030
What?

76
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,230
You were poisoned.

77
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,130
We can't let that slide.

78
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,390
You need to go

79
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,760
have Yan take a look at you.

80
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,590
Enough.

81
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,070
Keep pretending.

82
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,100
Keep it up.

83
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,910
The mushroom in the hotpot yesterday

84
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,660
was poisonous.

85
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,880
You brought it over. Of course you knew.

86
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,300
The mushroom looks ordinary.

87
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,130
How would I know it's poisonous?

88
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,030
After all, I'm too young

89
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,000
and I've seen too little world.

90
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,080
I almost harmed Yan.

91
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,230
If anything happened to her,

92
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,270
I'm afraid I'd be so upset

93
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,130
I would eat ten catties of poisonous mushrooms raw.

94
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,340
In that case,

95
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,930
it's true?

96
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,000
It's more real than a pearl.

97
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,430
However,

98
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,880
if I were poisoned to death,

99
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,909
let alone Yan would be upset,

100
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,630
even you, who are so kind,

101
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,230
wouldn't agree to it, right?

102
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:57,750
Listen.

103
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,790
I'm not interested in your life.

104
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,520
However,

105
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,660
since you want to repent...

106
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,400
Then,

107
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,730
I shall make up for my mistake now.

108
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,450
How about this?

109
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,080
I'll make a cup of

110
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,490
r-refreshing tea

111
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,760
to detoxify you.

112
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Stop right there!

113
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,950
Listen!

114
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,630
If you treat me like a fool again,

115
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,060
I'll really get mad!

116
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,110
Fine.

117
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,340
Then tell me

118
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,920
what should I do

119
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,730
for you to let it go?

120
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,220
I can forgive you

121
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,480
for poisoning me.

122
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:37,950
But,

123
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,909
I have one condition.

124
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,110
Shouldn't I be sleeping on the floor?

125
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,480
You sleepwalked last night

126
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,730
and slept on my bed.

127
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,210
I slept on your bed–

128
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,480
Make it clear.

129
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,800
What's going on?

130
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,830
What are you

131
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,870
thinking of?

132
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,390
In order to prevent you from sleepwalking today,

133
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,120
come with me.

134
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,970
What for?

135
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,210
Practice.

136
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,360
Practice?

137
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm not interested.

138
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,140
If you want to go to the Filth Valley to find the Blood Branch,

139
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,430
you might encounter the demonic cultivator,

140
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:48,990
you know?

141
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,600
Then I'll bring more poison.

142
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,510
The type that can

143
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,710
kill the devil.

144
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,080
With your cultivation,

145
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,670
if you meet

146
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,590
a master-level demonic cultivator,

147
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,450
the one who will get killed is you.

148
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,010
Besides,

149
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,070
if you can improve your cultivation

150
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,670
to the Core Formation Realm,

151
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,110
it won't be a problem for you to

152
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,670
bring thunder, rain, or protect yourself from fire.

153
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,910
It will help you with creating poison

154
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,240
in the future, you know?

155
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,470
Really?

156
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,390
Of course.

157
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,740
Let's go.

158
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,880
From now on,

159
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,480
I'll teach you personally.

160
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,150
Okay.

161
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,370
But your left leg on top of your right.

162
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,670
Palms facing the sky.

163
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,800
Lunar Sect

164
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,510
didn't teach you

165
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,970
meditating?

166
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,550
I prefer certain classes over others.

167
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,070
I only have full attendance for my pill cultivating class.

168
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,270
I don't really listen

169
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,720
in other classes.

170
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,510
But you should know a little about

171
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,110
foundational magic, right?

172
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,430
Magic?

173
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,080
Oh right.

174
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,230
I remember Chief

175
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,720
taught us two formulas.

176
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,050
Catch up on sleep and work less.

177
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,350
Taking a walk after dinner is important.

178
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,390
Don't stay up late and have more foot bath.

179
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,120
Your meridians will be smooth until you grow old.

180
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,870
Forget it.

181
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,560
I'll teach you

182
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,800
the formula used in the five states to circulate spiritual energy.

183
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,730
Anyone can do it. Remember it well.

184
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,110
Remember it carefully.

185
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,960
I will.

186
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,880
The divination is spiritual,

187
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,310
pure and upright.

188
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,460
The invader is metal;

189
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,770
the living being is wood;

190
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,430
the solidifier is earth;

191
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,070
and the floater is fire.

192
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,390
Mortal life extends to

193
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,870
at most 60 to 70 years.

194
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,830
It's different for cultivators.

195
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,430
Even if it's just refining spiritual energy,

196
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,450
one can live

197
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,040
20 years more than a mortal.

198
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,390
Making their base lifespan 100 years.

199
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,350
One at Core Formation Realm would live for 150,

200
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,810
those at Yuanying for 300,

201
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,450
and Demigod for 500.

202
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,350
This is the so-called

203
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,600
to live as long as heaven and earth.

204
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,110
You're already

205
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,560
at Yuanying Realm,

206
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,880
You have to practice till you get to the Demigod Realm in the future.

207
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,390
Then you'll become

208
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,700
a 500-year-old monster.

209
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,570
Are you going to practice or not?

210
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,140
Yes.

211
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,470
The essence of moving the energy into your body

212
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,840
lies in manipulating it

213
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,130
and moving your body along to the energy.

214
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,680
When you feel

215
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,440
you're in control of the power,

216
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,570
it's that you've already felt the tempo of the energy.

217
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,630
If I can use the heaven and earth's energy

218
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,430
to your own use

219
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,650
and form your own spiritual power

220
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,040
you would reach

221
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,190
the first realm.

222
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,110
Refine your energy.

223
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,020
How is it?

224
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,450
Do you understand?

225
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,500
My Lord.

226
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,740
The Filth Valley is opening up in a few days.

227
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,230
As the Lord Shao Cang, you are knowledgeable.

228
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,230
Don’t you have

229
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,950
a quick way to learning this?

230
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,710
If you're not afraid of being caught,

231
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,070
there are three quick ways

232
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:52,870
in this world.

233
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,950
What are they?

234
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,110
Having one pass the power over to you,

235
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,570
going against the path...

236
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,300
What else?

237
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,470
Forget it.

238
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,810
It's nothing good.

239
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,650
I shouldn't talk about it.

240
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,470
We've gone through

241
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,550
life and death together.

242
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,210
What's there to hide?

243
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,920
What is it?

244
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,960
Pass it on to me.

245
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,590
It's inappropriate.

246
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,070
It's inappropriate?

247
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,760
Is it inappropriate or do you not know how to do it?

248
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,560
I thought you

249
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,650
were very capable.

250
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,950
There's something you can't do?

251
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,380
Fine.

252
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,140
Listen carefully.

253
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,690
The third is double cultivation.

254
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,640
Sounds good!

255
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,570
How do you do it?

256
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,310
Hey!

257
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,230
How can you, a lady be...

258
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,090
Be what?

259
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,190
You have no principles!

260
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,190
Success is my principle!

261
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,940
As long as I can master the skills quickly,

262
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,540
I'm willing to try anything.

263
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,760
Willing to try

264
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,950
anything?

265
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,510
Yes.

266
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,190
Those who achieve great things don't care about trifles.

267
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,140
There are only things you don't dare to think about,

268
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,600
but none I don't dare to do.

269
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,050
Unreasonable!

270
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,000
Why are you leaving?

271
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,790
Come back.

272
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,360
Why are you leaving?

273
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,030
Come on, let's do it!

274
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,160
Why are you leaving?

275
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:17,850
Look at you.

276
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,250
You're no match for me.

277
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,620
♫Gazing at the distant sky♫

278
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,770
♫The clouds roll in as the wind rises♫

279
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,740
♫The faces we passed by♫

280
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,530
♫Met each other in fate♫

281
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,310
♫Like the vast starry sky♫

282
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,400
♫Falling into my eyes♫

283
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,390
♫Thousands of mountains apart♫

284
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,830
♫I hug you amongst a sea of people♫

285
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,080
♫At the Riverbank of Forgetfulness♫

286
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,480
♫I am willing to be a lone boat♫

287
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,940
♫Through the storms and cold♫

288
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,110
♫Just to wait for you♫

289
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,900
♫I break through the curse of fate♫

290
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,960
♫And pierce through the dark clouds♫

291
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,340
♫May heaven and earth last forever♫

292
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,470
♫May our love be eternal♫

293
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,660
♫The impermanent years have never stopped♫

294
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,170
♫We spend this lifetime hand in hand♫

295
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,650
♫Billions of light beams converge into a galaxy♫

296
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,630
♫But still can't compare to the moment you look back♫

297
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,120
♫The past is mottled with old memories♫

298
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,510
Keep practicing.

299
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,760
♫As long as you're by my side♫

300
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,720
♫Over the hills, seeing through the world♫

301
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,250
♫I'll hold your hand till we grow old♫

302
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,230
My Lord.

303
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,440
How is my practice going?

304
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,470
In just seven days,

305
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,830
you've already brought the energy into your body

306
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,760
and broke through the foundation.

307
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,820
If you keep practicing every day,

308
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,950
you can get to Core Formation Realm soon.

309
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,830
In the future, you will be able to suppress demonic aura too.

310
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,760
Core Formation?

311
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,920
If I want to

312
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,830
get to Yuanying Soul Realm like you,

313
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,630
how long more will I need to take?

314
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,190
Ordinary practitioners

315
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,830
would take a 100 or 80 years.

316
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,860
But if it were you,

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,060
it'd be different.

318
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,510
Because I'm very talented.

319
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,520
Right?

320
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,810
You are indeed very talented.

321
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,359
There aren't many like you in the Five States.

322
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,829
You can be called

323
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,290
an evil spirit.

324
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,310
I didn't know I was so powerful.

325
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,230
Am I the Chosen One

326
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,750
like my mother said?

327
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,790
What did she say?

328
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,910
She said

329
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,590
there is a kind of people who can find magical herbs on the mountain,

330
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,350
obtain precious pearls in the sea,

331
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,710
embrace beautiful women when drunk,

332
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,430
and control the world when awake.

333
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,350
Even if these people

334
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,060
may have a rough life,

335
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,050
it's just a temporary suffering.

336
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,220
After that,

337
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,140
they can be reborn

338
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,910
and can enter both heaven and mortal realm.

339
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,240
The immortals and demons can't stop them.

340
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,930
That's Chief Nan Fang.

341
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,490
Let me remind you.

342
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,190
Don't get carried away.

343
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,050
Practice harder from now on.

344
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,510
Once you take it lightly,

345
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,310
you won't be able to fend yourself against the Demon Clan.

346
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,370
Thank you for your reminder, My Lord.

347
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,020
Also,

348
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,470
your spiritual power

349
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,990
is close to Core Formation Realm.

350
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,710
When you use

351
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,110
poison needles and weapons of such,

352
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,350
it will be way more powerful than before.

353
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,910
If it isn't a critical moment,

354
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,870
only use

355
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,020
half of your power.

356
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,550
Remember to hide your power

357
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,480
so that there won't be any trouble.

358
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,060
I got it.

359
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,240
So I gotta act like you,

360
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,830
hiding your true powers.

361
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,630
The Solar Mountain and Solar Sect

362
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,490
are all made up.

363
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,790
You're slandering your master.

364
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,550
You're punished to a day of practice.

365
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,020
That can't do.

366
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,850
My Lord.

367
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,840
I want to take a day off.

368
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,920
Where are you going?

369
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,270
The market.

370
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,700
[Treasure Pavilion]

371
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,630
Bravo!

372
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,540
Bravo! Bravo!

373
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,990
S-Sir!

374
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,090
I'm flattered that you are

375
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,710
in a mood good enough to come to the market

376
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,390
with me today.

377
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,820
You're here.

378
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,400
Boss,

379
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,440
do you have a good blood centipede?

380
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,550
You came at a good time.

381
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,750
I just got a new batch.

382
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,810
I'll get it for you.

383
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,060
Look.

384
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,070
Why are you buying this?

385
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,630
Filth Valley is dangerous.

386
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,630
We can't be careless.

387
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,950
It won't go wrong if we prepare more

388
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,390
elixirs to protect ourselves.

389
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,520
Especially for you.

390
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,370
Me?

391
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,620
Yes.

392
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,830
Although your heart disease

393
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,180
has stabilized a lot,

394
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,160
you were

395
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,510
injured by Die Wan

396
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,030
and haven't recovered fully yet.

397
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,990
The Filth Valley is about to open.

398
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,200
The danger is unknown.

399
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,390
Preparing more medication

400
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,630
that can save your life

401
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,630
is better than going empty-handed.

402
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,350
Sir, is there anything else?

403
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,350
Show me another box.

404
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,140
Yes.

405
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,750
Let me see.

406
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,860
Have a look at this.

407
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,180
You said

408
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,270
there is an amazing skill

409
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,880
hidden in Filth Valley.

410
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,470
I'm sure many people

411
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,370
will be heading over to snatch it.

412
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,030
Although you’re at Yuanying Soul Realm,

413
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,140
don’t forget

414
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,980
you're also ill.

415
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,780
A single tiger can't defeat a pack of wolves.

416
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,210
If we don't prepare well,

417
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,050
how can we be at ease?

418
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,310
It doesn't matter.

419
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,710
I'll make it a quick trip.

420
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,030
Easy for you to say.

421
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,740
That's Filth Valley you're talking about.

422
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,200
Sir,

423
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,380
I want this box.

424
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,450
Sure.

425
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,870
Don't worry.

426
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,750
I have to come back

427
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,280
to be your medicine tester.

428
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,000
Without me,

429
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,710
I'm afraid your mom's recovery

430
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,260
will be delayed.

431
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,490
Okay.

432
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,530
Odd...

433
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,270
Why is he alway so indifferent

434
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,070
when we talk about Filth Valley.

435
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,710
But why do I

436
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,570
feel so anxious about it?

437
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,540
We meet again!

438
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,310
You're shopping with your wife again?

439
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,800
You love her so much.

440
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,770
He's so glib-tongued.

441
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,110
He thinks he can earn even more from us.

442
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,940
He's glib-tongued?

443
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,260
I don't hear it.

444
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:43,810
By the way,

445
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,200
we have new magical weapons.

446
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,220
Bring your wife over to have a look if you have time.

447
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,840
My wife said

448
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,520
your shop sells things at exorbitant prices.

449
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
She told me to check out other shops.

450
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,600
Hey!

451
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,390
Huh?

452
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,660
Yan!

453
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,620
Ji Yang!

454

Time waits for no man.

455
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,590
Sly fox,

456
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,470
I'm looking for you.

457
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,000
Let's go.

458

Where are we going?

459
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,150
For you to fulfill your promise.

460
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,880
My poetry club has been recruiting

461
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,760
for a long time.

462
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,440
I finally

463
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,440
came up with a way

464
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,900
to attract talents.

You're really using me as a spirit pet

472
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,290
to recruit people?

473
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,510
It'd be more accurate to call you

474
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,710
my mascot.

475
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,390
You are the face

of our poetry club.

477
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,240
I'm not going.

478
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,870
A soldier can be killed but not humiliated.

I'm a fox with a bottom line.

480

Stand there!

481

You have a bottom line?

Yeah, right!

483
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,390
You have to go since you agreed.

484
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,120
Get back to your original form.

485
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,790
I'm willing to apologize.

486
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,150
Apologize. You...

Apologize!

If apologies are useful,

00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,680
then why do we need the Hall of Justice?

490

Fine.

Eat this.

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,990
Say yes.

573
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,910
Do you like me or not?

574
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,310
Say yes.

575
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,510
How was the performance?

576
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,110
Every year at the temple fair,

577
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,230
my mom would bring me to

578
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,200
watch puppet shows.

579
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,970
So I can recite

580
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,010
all these lines.

581
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,230
Do you want me to act out the play of

582
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,090
the White Snake repaying a favor?

583
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,270
No need.

584
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,750
Let's go back earily.

585
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,070
I need to visit my mother.

586
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,280
Do you want to

587
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,240
go back with me?

588
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,650
Let's have dinner.

589
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,500
If I go to your place,

590
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,540
your mother might not want to eat.

591
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,310
I'll wait for you on the mountain.

592
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,990
See you.

593
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,910
You see,

594
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,930
I do need you after all.

595
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,650
Everyone loves you.

596
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,030
In such a short time

597
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,130
so many people came to sign up.

[Free fox petting if you register for the Mighty Dragon Poetry Club]

599
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,790
Y-You scared me.

600
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,430
How many of those who signed up just now

601
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,970
will really join the club?

602
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,870
I'm telling you, it's none of them.

603
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,570
They just want

604
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,650
to pet me.

605
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,260
Fine.

606
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,690
Now you're embarrassed.

607
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,890
Now you know shame.

608
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,400
Now you can feel

609
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,030
how I felt that day.

610
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:41,960
Let me tell you.

611
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,070
When I held your leg

612
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,110
and called you my dad,

613
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,350
I was also

614
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,990
really humiliated.

615
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,630
So this was a prank?

616
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,840
There's no recruitment at all.

617
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,570
You just want to embarrass me.

618
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,230
It's enough for the Mighty Dragon Poetry Club

619
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,320
to have Nan Yan

620
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,090
and Ji Yang.

621
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,070
It's enough.

622
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,160
Why didn't I realise

623
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,560
you are so cunning?

624
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,000
I have no choice.

625
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,910
Who told you

626
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,830
to be so cunning yourself?

627
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,200
I had to think of a way

628
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,430
to teach you a lesson.

629
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,570
Chinese New Year's Eve.

Chinese...

631
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,190
All right.

632
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,630
Don't be angry.

633
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,520
In the society,

634
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,660
there is always give and take.

635
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
You should know that better than me.

636
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,490
So,

637
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,400
do we call it quits?

638
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,820
Yes.

639
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,440
Of course.

Yan.

642
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,930
Why did you fall asleep outside?

643
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,250
It's so cold.

644
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,800
What if you catch a cold?

645
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,290
I wanted to see the stars

646
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,530
and fell asleep.

647
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,600
It's late autumn.

648
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,060
It's cold all day.

649
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,540
There are no stars.

650
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,590
Yeah.

651
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,970
I won't be able to see it again.

652
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,900
You're saying such ominous things again.

653
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,460
Did you drink in secret again?

654
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,410
No.

655
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,330
I was making wine,

656
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,050
not drinking wine.

657
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,810
I was just half done

when I got lazy

659
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,490
so I wanted to rest here.

660

Since you're back,

00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,480

663

and bury it under the tree.

Didn't we agree?

665
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,960
We agreed not to drink.

666
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,950
Yet you're asking me

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,610
to toss the wine lees with you.

668
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,280
If you toss the wine lees today,

you won't be able to suppress your desire to drink tomorrow.

get me

672
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,870

Then, drink whatever you want.

or East Sea,

687
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,590

even in East Sea and Middle City,

691
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,240
no one would look down on it.

Great Path Sect and Dragon Capital

693
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:34,880

countless delicacies.

695
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,920
You're bragging again.

696
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,900
You're an amateur.

697
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,880
You can't taste the wine properly.

698
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,340
If you give my wine

699
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,000
to Lord Shao Cang

700
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,870
to have a taste,

701
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,000
he will definitely know how good it is.

Mother.

703
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,040
You know everything?

704
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,030
Why didn't he

705
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,950
come with you?

706
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,830
He...

707
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,230
He got hurt while protecting me.

708
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,710
So I asked him

709
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,940
to go back first.

710
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,630
How many times

711
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,020
has he protected you?

712
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,470
Well...

713
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,930
Two, three, or four times.

714
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,550
He's fallen

715
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,820
for you.

716
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,580
Men who don't speak that much

717
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,940
always cares about you the most.

718
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,110
Your kindness towards him paid off.

719
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,140
Mother.

720
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,280
Don't talk nonsense.

721
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,070
Since when did I treat him...

722
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,650
Did you come back

723
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,270
because you like me?

724
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,840
Say yes.

725
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,830
It seems that Yan

726
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,250
has grown up.

727
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,850
Good.

728
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,080
Do you think

729
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,210
your youth used to be like flowing water?

730
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,110
Now you're suffering from the bitter wine entering your mouth

731
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,310
and your heart hurts?

732
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,659
The word "wine" keeps appearing in things you say.

733
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,929
That's a bad habit.

734
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,820
All right.

735
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,750
I'm going back to Lunar Sect.

736
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,710
Aren't you going to stay with me for a little longer?

737
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,429
The sect have ordered

738
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,909
that it's not safe down the mountain

739
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,040
so we can't stay out.

740
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,330
I'll come back in a few days

741
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,600
and make you something delicious.

742
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,000
Don't come back.

743
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,510
You're holding me up from playing mahjong.

744
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,040
Go ahead.

745
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,540
I'm leaving.

746
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,389
Don't drink in secret.

747
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,270
Yan!

748
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,150
Do you know

749
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,790
why I like this wine?

750
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,760
Didn't you say

751
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,050
this wine

752
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,910
is brewed during the time of cicada chirps and dew.

753
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,300
So

754
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,790
the taste of alcohol is the most mellow?

755
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,140
I'll tell you

756
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,110
when you come back next time.

757
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,640
Be good.

758
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,080
Cicadas lament the dew;

759
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,210
as the blossoms fade and the cicadas' cries become rapid,

760
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,220
the weather shifts from warm to cold,

761
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,470
and the sorrowful sounds bid farewell to the hometown.

762
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,070
Hometown?

763
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,950
I'm afraid that sir

764
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,490
from Middle City won't be able to drink it again.

765
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,360
Why are you sleeping on the floor again?

766
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,600
Your bed is too hard.

767
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,670
I can't sleep well.

768
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,420
This guy

769
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,510
has fallen for you.

770
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,460
Men who don't talk that much

771
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,400
always cares about you the most.

772
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,970
♫There is endless scenery to be seen♫

773
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,620
♫There are too many topics to talk about♫

774
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,690
Today really is a good day.

775
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,890
♫I'll be with you until it's sunny♫

776
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,290
One should go out when they need to.

777
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,350
I'm tired from the day out

778
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,950
but I have this young sir here

779
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,290
who would warm up my bed.

780
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,970
You're cold, right?

781
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,670
You can use this blanket.

782
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,690
I'm feeling quite warm.

783
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,130
I can tell.

784
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,720
Your ears are red.

785
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,750
Bundle up.

786
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,830
♫The sound of rain♫

787
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,840
♫I hold my breath♫

788
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:29,790
♫Our promise under the umbrella♫

789
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,830
How is it? Is it warm?

790
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,210
♫When I'm with you♫

791
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,370
♫It becomes clear♫

792
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,270
♫I'll hold up for you♫

793
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,210
Go to sleep

794
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,140
♫Even if it's pouring rain♫

795
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,180
♫The blurry world is now clear♫

796
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,520
♫I won't give up♫

797
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:51,040
♫I'll protect you♫

798
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,270
♫I weave through the crowd♫

799
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,740
♫Rain passes by, leaving traces♫

800
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:06,580
♫How lucky I am to meet you♫

801
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,430
It's less than two days to the opening of Filth Valley.

802
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,650
We still can’t capture Shao Cang.

803
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,140
How do I explain

804
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,360
how ineffective you have been with your jobs to Premier?

805
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,040
Xingzheng.

806
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,330
I heard

807
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,410
a few days ago after Shao Cang

808
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,030
left the market,

809
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,040
you fought with him?

810
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,220
I was

811
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,440
not good enough.

812
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,480
Lord Shao Cang

813
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,020
is in Lunar Mountain.

814
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,470
Xingzheng and Marui,

815
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,640
the both of you

816
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,660
follow the Candlelight Beetles and continue searching.

817
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,540
The rest of you,

818
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,700
check each room with me.

819
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,640
Even if we have to dig three feet down,

820
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,970
we must catch Shao Cang.

821
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,730
-Yes!
-Yes!

822
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,480
How dare you break into our Lunar Sect!

823
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,010
Why did you hit him?

824
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,730
Senior.

825
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:04,660
Here.

826
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,480
Yan, take a rest.

827
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,680
Leave these to me.

828
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,490
You can do this.

829
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,760
Nan Yan!

830
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,760
Nan Yan!

831
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,800
The people of the Great Path have come here.

832
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,670
They said they received

833
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,550
an anonymous report letter.

834
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,270
They insisted that

835
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,640
Lord Shao Cang is in Lunar Sect.
