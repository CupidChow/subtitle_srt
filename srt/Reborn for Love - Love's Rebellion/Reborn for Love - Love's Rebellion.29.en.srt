[Episode 29]

4
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,070
Since everyone that is present today

5
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,550
shares the same understanding,

6
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,350
I shall be the

7
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,830
host for this year.

8
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,120
The Dragon Capital will send an announcement

9
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:20,870
that the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament

10
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,530
should open in three days time

11
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,300
to elect the new monarch.

12
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,789
Yun Nian.

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,180
Miss Yun.

14
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,650
Why did you run away as soon as you saw me?

15
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,520
Let me introduce you two.

16
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,070
This is Chief Yun's granddaughter

17
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,310
of the Yao Palace,

18
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,410
Yun Nian, Miss Yun.

19
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:48,950
Nan Yan.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,229
Miss Nan is here to accompany the Young Lord

21
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,560
for the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament?

22
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,370
I have no such intention.

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,150
I don’t want to get involved in such a fuss.

24
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,940
That's true.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,270
The Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament consists of two challenges,

26
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,310
which are the Nine Calamities Sea and Ten Percepts Mountain.

27
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,040
Both are extremely dangerous.

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,840
Someone with a one-track mind and

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,270
is only capable of spewing fire like you

30
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,729
won't even make through a single challenge.

31
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,230
Did I offend you again?

32
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,160
You're speaking with barbs again.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,230
I shouldn't have come to bother you.

34
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,510
You two were having a nice chat,

35
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,470
and now I have to stand here and listen to you lecture me.

36
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,340
When did I ever lecture you?

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,000
You...

38
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,740
The both of you…

39
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,030
I heard that your grandmother, Chief of Yao Palace,

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,490
was chosen as a second wife

41
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,790
from the daughters of the Red Emperor's distant relatives

42
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,920
after the death of the Spirit Empress.

43
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,910
In that case,

44
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,310
she's a generation younger than Chief Nan,

45
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,300
so you should be addressing Miss Nan Yan as…

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,100
Grandmother?

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,540
Right!

48
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,770
The Young Dragon Lord

49
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,300
is protecting his beloved.

50
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,230
I shouldn't be staying in your

51
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,560
Mighty Dragon Pavilion

52
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,390
out of respect of the Dragon Lord.

53
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,560
I have to see the both of you every day

54
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,510
and just get annoyed every time.

55
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,760
Beloved? You mean the both of us?

56
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,550
You've misunderstood.

57
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,910
He's my Big Brother.

58
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,560
We’ve known each other for many years and have never crossed any boundaries.

59
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,320
Yes.

60
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,110
We are sworn brothers and sisters.

61
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,590
Besides,

62
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,910
Nan Yan has already…

63
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,640
Nan Yan has her heart on someone else.

64
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,250
Who cares about that?

65
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,090
Then why are you so fierce?

66
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,630
Can you tell me more

67
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,790
about Chief Nan?

68
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,700
Young Master, Miss Yun.

69
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,530
Young Master.

70
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,460
The Dragon Lord has instructed me

71
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,040
to bring the both of you

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
back to the Mighty Dragon Pavilion immediately

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,840
to train for the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament.

74
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,470
What?

75
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,530
Who said I'm going?

76
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,650
Just go as you're ordered.

77
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,250
Practice diligently.

78
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:48,690
Okay, let's go.

79
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,810
I'll come find you later.

80
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,380
Okay.

81
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,430
Senior.

82
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,510
Fu Lang is now under my sect.

83
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,850
The Sword Sect is different from he Great Path Sect.

84
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,580
Please mind your words,

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,510
young lady.

86
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,640
Elder Zhu.

87
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,130
I just wanted to speak with

88
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,600
Fu Lang privately.

89
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,690
It's okay.

90
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,300
There's nothing to hide from Elder Zhu.

91
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,530
Just speak as you want.

92
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,830
I've been worried

93
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,430
about your whereabouts ever since

94
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,030
you've been expelled by Master.

95
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,430
Why did you suddenly join

96
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,909
the Great Path—

97
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,210
I'm slow-witted.

98
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,400
It’s natural that the Sword Master doesn't like me.

99
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,880
Fortunately, Master pitied me

100
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,090
and helped me rebuild my cultivation,

101
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,720
even giving me the opportunity to come here

102
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,220
and broaden my horizons.

103
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,080
You will take place in

104
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,050
the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament,

105
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,330
right?

106
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,220
Elder Zhu has great cultivation.

107
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,010
He is the perfect candidate to be the monarch.

108
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,310
I’m just here

109
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,590
to join in on the fun.

110
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,380
Be sure to take care then.

111
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,330
Be careful.

112
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,690
Thank you.

113
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,040
Goodbye.

114
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,010
You're a new disciple.

115
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,950
You shouldn't have the qualifications to come here.

116
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,610
It is only because of our Master's instructions

117
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,850
that allowed you

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,340
the opportunity to join the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament.

119
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,240
It is best to be cautious,

120
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,100
when interacting with other sect female cultivators,

121
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,500
in order to not invite unnecessary gossip.

122
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,920
Thank you, Elder Zhu,

123
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,330
for your guidance.

124
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,250
I heard that

125
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,830
you have become a disciple

126
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,560
under the Master of Endurance.

127
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,140
I'm Zhen Yuan, from the ' Zhen' generation

128
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,170
of the Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea。

129
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,090
The Bloody-handed Asura，

130
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,370
that must be you.

131
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,570
It’s nothing but an empty reputation.

132
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,090
As expected, Nan Rao's daughter is exceptional.

133
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,150
Chief Nan and I

134
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,590
are old acquaintances.

135
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,409
My reprimand earlier at the conference

136
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,150
was for the greater good of the cultivation world.

137
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,810
Please don't take it to heart.

138
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,940
I certainly won't.

139
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,040
What brings you here to the Dragon Capital?

140
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,690
My mother has passed away,

141
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,640
and I

142
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,200
don't have many relatives left in this world.

143
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,190
I heard that

144
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,310
the Dragon Lord and my mother were close,

145
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,970
so I came here seeking refuge.

146
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,660
The Dragon Capital is a good place.

147
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,040
Song Zhu,

148
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,300
let's go.

149
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,550
Sword Master, please wait.

150
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,340
Since leaving the sect,

151
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,160
I have made it my duty to eliminate demons and uphold the Dao.

152
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,470
I heard that the Sword Sect

153
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,400
was also founded

154
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,740
on its outstanding

155
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,960
demon-elimination techniques.

156
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
I would be honored

157
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,370
to learn from the Sword Master.

158
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,050
Follow me then.

159
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,100
Yes.

160
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,790
This is the key technique

161
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,600
of my sect’s founding swordsmanship.

162
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,440
Even though it differs from the Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea teachings

163
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,970
but the technique can complement each other.

164
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,050
I dare not accept this kind of honour.

165
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,020
Nan Rao and I

166
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,950
both studied under

167
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,170
the former sect leader of the Great Path

168
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,920
at the same time.

169
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,530
This sword technique was also taught under the Master's teaching,

170
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,610
so it's not a gift you're unworthy of.

171
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,070
Thank you, Sword Master.

172
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,710
I know very little

173
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,430
about my mother’s past.

174
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,520
Since you were old friends,

175
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,320
could you tell me more

176
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,230
about my mother's past?

177
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,059
I have deep memories of your mother's past.

178
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,570
The academy was only open

179
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,110
for half a year,

180
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,500
but your mother repeatedly skipped classes.

181
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,230
She skipped classes?

182
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,140
She was very talented.

183
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,590
She only attended classes for appearances.

184
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,720
It's even rarer that she engaged in sword discussions

185
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,910
with a nerd like me.

186
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,920
She spent most of her time out

187
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,940
with Mu Guanghan,

188
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,500
exploring the world.

189
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,760
My mother was always free-spirited.

190
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,140
It's a surprise that she found common interests

191
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,340
with the Dragon Lord.

192
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,350
Common interests?

193
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,030
Back then, they were so close with each other that

194
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,980
their relationship was the talk of the cultivation world.

195
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,650
As disciples,

196
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,370
we heard the gossip,

197
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,420
but we just treated it as idle chatter

198
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,280
or just a story they passed around.

199
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,750
That certainly fits my mother’s personality.

200
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,680
Thank you, Sword Master.

201
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,210
I’ll take my leave now,

202
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,870
and return another day to learn more about sword techniques.

203
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,990
Yan.

204
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,680
Yun Nian?

205
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,960
Why are you here?

206
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,490
I needed your help,

207
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,790
so I sneaked out.

208
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,750
I heard you've moved into the Chaoyu Pavilion.

209
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,480
Could you take me to see

210
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,280
Chief Nan's former residence?

211
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,750
Why?

212
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,230
I heard a lot about her

213
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,910
growing up in the Yao Palace.

214
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,190
I’m particularly curious

215
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,650
and want to know more about her.

216
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,380
Is that okay?

217
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,170
Okay.

218
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,960
Come with me.

219
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,430
Okay.

220
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,640
Chief Nan was indeed free-spirited,

221
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,880
just like a celestial being.

222
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,470
Although I was born in the Yao Palace,

223
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,200
I've never

224
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,440
seen her in person.

225
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,870
Yan,

226
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,720
what was she like later in life?

227
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,070
Ever since I could remember,

228
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,450
I've never seen her like

229
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,590
how's she depicted in the painting.

230
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,090
She never fussed over food, clothing, or material things,

231
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,710
but when it came to gambling and drinking,

232
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,040
she was quite generous.

233
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,000
That's more like it.

234
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,160
If I were Chief Nan,

235
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,370
I wouldn't want to be confined

236
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,030
in the secluded chambers too.

237
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,070
I'd rather use the pen as a sword

238
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,860
to write poetry

239
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,830
and wander around in the world.

240
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,380
When I first met Mu Zhanting,

241
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,190
he was running away from home

242
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,390
and fled to the North.

243
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,470
He said that

244
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,310
he was realizing this dream.

245
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,120
Run away from home?

246
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,540
That sounds like a good idea!

247
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,690
That's not something you should imitate.

248
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
Mu Zhanting,

249
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,990
he's passionate,

250
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,660
and pretty loyal too.

251
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,450
It's just that his poems are a little

252
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,340
inconsistent.

253
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,230
Everyone is good at something different.

254
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,490
That way we can all learn from each other.

255
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,820
Unfortunately,

256
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,000
my grandmother sent me a letter

257
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,290
telling me to attend the

258
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,220
Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament.

259
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,030
This concerns the dignity of the Yao Palace.

260
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,290
I can't go against her.

261
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,400
Don't worry. We have Mu Zhanting.

262
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,430
He will make sure that you are safe.

263
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,920
We can continue to converse about poetry

264
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,380
when the two of you are out.

265
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,910
But I've heard that the dangers of the

266
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,760
Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament are exceptional.

267
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,290
Only Lord Shao Cang was able

268
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,770
to charge straight ahead.

269
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,910
While 90% of the rest of the disciples

270
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,210
were still wandering about

271
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,300
in the Nine Calamities Sea,

272
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,190
Lord Shao Cang has already

273
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,240
started fighting

274
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,130
under the Ten Percepts Mountain.

275
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,190
With my current cultivation,

276
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,240
there's no way that I can catch up with that.

277
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,640
Did you see Lord Shao Cang

278
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,160
ascend to the throne in person?

279
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,070
I didn't see it in person.

280
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,190
But Grandmother told me

281
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,550
the monarch's selection

282
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,410
usually takes more than ten days.

283
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,030
Only Lord Shao Cang was able

284
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,490
to come out in just one day.

285
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,160
The Premier Ying Zewei

286
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,510
personally crowned him

287
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,780
of the lands and seas.

288
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,870
So he used to carry the world

289
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,050
with such pride.

290
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,530
Yes.

291
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,030
Lord Shao Cang

292
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,280
was a person with so much pride.

293
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,870
He was once the Heavens favored one.

294
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,620
I can't believe that

295
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,760
he would descend to become a demon by his own will.

296
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,970
Yan,

297
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,150
is there something wrong?

298
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,980
Nothing.

299
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Maybe

300
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,040
I'm just a little tired.

301
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,730
You have a good rest then.

302
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,880
I'll come find you another day.

303
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,070
Okay.

304
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,870
This person's heart rate is unstable.

305
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,980
Why are his symptoms

306
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,750
just like Mother's

307
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,040
when her heart disease

308
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
acts up?

309
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,470
Mother,

310
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,630
your heart disease is just a side effect.

311
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,950
Once I've successfully made the

312
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,670
Five-Poison Heart Pill,

313
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,480
you won't have to eat these anymore.

314
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,080
The so-called heart disease

315
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,990
is actually the after-effect

316
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,180
of a serious injury.

317
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,260
You both were stranded in the North,

318
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,860
and you both lost your heart.

319
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,150
Who was the one

320
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,390
that caused this?

321
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,880
There is something that

322
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,850
Mother once told me.

323
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,390
Please speak freely.

324
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,960
The Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

325
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,280
Even the Sword Master knows all about

326
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,210
the Dragon Lord and Mother's past.

327
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,740
Why is the Dragon Lord

328
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,780
hiding it from me himself?

329
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,800
I would rather shatter as jade than remain whole,

330
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,230
fearing I might betray the trust placed in me.

331
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,140
Good poem.

332
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,600
Big Brother.

333
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,150
It's alright.

334
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,350
There's no one here.

335
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,410
They are all busy.

336
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,760
Big Brother,

337
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,570
can you do me a favor?

338
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,760
You want me to investigate my father?

339
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,200
I...

340
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,280
I'll do it.

341
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,920
As soon as the Dragon Lord's

342
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,450
suspicions are cleared,

343
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,130
I will never mention it again.

344
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,740
I believe in my father's innocence,

345
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,560
so I'll work with you this time.

346
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,270
Wait here.

347
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,830
Look at what I have.

348
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,010
This is...

349
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,300
I knew that

350
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,990
you would be up to something this time.

351
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,990
Snacks, sleeping powder, and stealth attire.

352
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,730
I have all of these ready.

353
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,690
As the saying goes,

354
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,330
on a full moon night,

355
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,910
at the peak of the Dragon Court,

356
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,270
we venture in the dark and

357
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,290
sneak under their noses.

358
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,480
Hurry up.

359
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,810
Don't worry.

360
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,630
I've asked Yu Que

361
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,350
to draw the guards

362
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,960
away.

363
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,890
Let's split up.

364
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,859
There's nothing.

365
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,130
I knew it.

366
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,000
My Father

367
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,140
has nothing but money.

368
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,480
He's definitely not the type to

369
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,430
linger on old attachments

370
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,589
and hide treasures.

371
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,990
Could it be...

372
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,670
I really wronged the Dragon Lord?

373
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,900
It doesn't matter.

374
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,630
Let's go somewhere else.

375
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,500
At worst, we'll search the whole of Dragon Court.

376
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,120
[Rao]

377
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,280
This sizing.

378
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,640
Could it be my mother's wedding dress?

379
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,820
Could it be...

380
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,840
The Dragon Lord and Mother were wedded?

381
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,890
Impossible.

382
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,670
Then I...

383
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,720
You keep making trouble

384
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,920
and sneaking around.

385
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,000
Are you leading Yan astray too?

386
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,900
No.

387
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,750
You're the one who's feeling guilty.

388
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,510
What other things are you hiding

389
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,430
from me?

390
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,120
Do I still have to report

391
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,850
to my own son?

392
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,520
What about Mother?

393
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,670
She has been gone for so many years.

394
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,160
How many times have you mentioned her?

395
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,950
Look at this.

396
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,150
You're hiding Chief Nan's things here.

397
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,710
That's all in the past.

398
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,820
Dragon Lord.

399
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,120
I would also like to know

400
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,130
what happened

401
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,810
between you and my mother?

402
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,720
Gosh.

403
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,700
Could it be that

404
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,890
Nan Yan and I

405
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,180
are half-siblings?

406
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,280
Your mother has always does as she pleased.

407
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,000
She never had any concerns.

408
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,720
Your mother and I

409
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,070
were engaged under the decree

410
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,070
of the Spirit Empress and my father.

411
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,270
But

412
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,090
she refused to marry.

413
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,700
Then that wedding dress…

414
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,580
That wedding dress

415
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,140
was called the Phoenix Crowing Sky Skirt.

416
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,450
One day,

417
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,390
your mother took the fallen feathers

418
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,450
that fell off the Phoenix and used it to spin gold thread

419
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,790
which she tossed to me and told me

420
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,950
to make the wedding dress as soon as possible,

421
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,410
to be ready when she comes to marry with wine.

422
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,760
Phoenix's fallen feathers.

423
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,710
Phoenix Tail Bell.

424
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,760
Is it why it rang?

425
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,520
What happened after that?

426
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,470
After that

427
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,440
I rushed day and night

428
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,080
to make this wedding dress.

429
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
So much that I was going cross-eyed.

430
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,570
The wedding dress is made,

431
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,840
but your mother

432
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,710
never showed up again.

433
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,670
So you didn't get your heart's desire.

434
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,130
No wonder she was always on your mind.

435
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,130
How dare you!

436
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,210
Then,

437
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,680
where did my mother go?

438
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,340
Where did she go?

439
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,640
She ran away with someone else!

440
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,290
Later I found out

441
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,960
your mother went to speak with the Spirit Empress

442
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,360
to cancel this marriage.

443
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,870
As for asking me to make the wedding gown,

444
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,790
it was just her way

445
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,420
of tricking me.

446
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,900
Then

447
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,910
do you really don't know

448
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,910
where the Blood Phoenix Hairpin is?

449
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,720
Blood Phoenix Hairpin?

450
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,150
That was the engagement token

451
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,350
given to us back then.

452
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,440
Since the engagement has been cancelled,

453
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,240
the token was then returned too.

454
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,780
After that,

455
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,910
you never saw it again?

456
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,250
Why?

457
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,500
You seem to be interested

458
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,650
in the Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

459
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,220
I'm just curious.

460
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,630
Do you know

461
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,670
where it is now?

462
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,400
I got it taken from me by accident

463
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,850
by someone else.

464
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,750
Since you don't know it's whereabouts,

465
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,080
I will take my leave now.

466
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,880
Alright.

467
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,200
since everything has been made clear,

468
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,230
you should go back early.

469
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,270
Father.

470
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,610
Dragon Lord.

471
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,820
What are you doing?

472
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,930
[Dragon Court]

473
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,130
Young Master.

474
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,140
The dishes are all served.

475
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,740
Please eat it while it's hot.

476
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,030
Who can eat now?

477
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,270
It's so cold at night.

478
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,790
Who has the appetite to eat?

479
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,700
Go get my father.

480
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,510
I haven't finished speaking with him.

481
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,310
Young Master,

482
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,670
don't make it hard for me.

483
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,260
This is all the orders of the Dragon Lord.

484
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,660
I'll take me leave first.

485
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,040
Stop there!

486
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,760
I'm not finished!

487
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,910
Where are you going?

488
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,380
Listen.

489
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,900
I'll take the—

490
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,680
I'll take the responsibility!

491
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,110
Just punish me!

492
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,070
Nan Yan is guest!

493
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,600
Why should she be grounded?

494
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,170
Do you hear me?

495
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,190
I'm so angry.

496
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,520
Big Brother.

497
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,550
After the Dragon Lord found out

498
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,550
that I was particularly interested in the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

499
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,280
his face changed immediately.

500
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,230
It seems like

501
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,690
he doesn't want me

502
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,590
to continue the investigation.

503
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,830
You mean my father

504
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,440
he feels guilty?

505
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,880
Impossible.

506
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,990
Although my father

507
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,600
looks domineering,

508
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,810
but he actually...

509
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,390
He's definitely not a sinister person.

510
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,250
How could he...

511
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,870
Maybe there's more to it.

512
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,880
We shouldn't make a conclusion so hurriedly.

513
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,880
Do you have another way

514
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,450
to prove his innocence?

515
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,600
The Dragon Lord

516
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,100
is wary of me now.

517
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,480
We can only work indirectly.

518
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,490
I think the Sword Master

519
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,670
doesn't mind talking about the past with me.

520
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,320
Maybe

521
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,390
I can get more clues

522
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,690
from him.

523
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,430
What are we waiting for?

524
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,760
Let's go find him now.

525
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,330
But the Dragon Lord

526
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,690
just grounded us.

527
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,290
He can ground us all he wants,

528
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,490
we'll just go our way.

529
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,220
I have experience

530
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,590
running away from home.

531
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,950
Come.

532
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,300
-Come on.
-Running away from home?

533
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,860
Do you usually

534
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,510
run away from home like this?

535
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,110
This is a big one.

536
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,610
I have other smaller ones.

537
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,030
You really are experienced.

538
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,280
Young Master,

539
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,580
the soup the kitchens made is ready.

540
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,030
[Cold Remedy]

541
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,150
I also prepared some cold medicine.

542
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,610
Let me send them in for you.

543
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:41,720
Oh no.

544
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,670
It's okay. You go first.

545
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,400
Go find the Sword Master first.

546
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,380
Well,

547
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,870
just leave it at the door.

548
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,520
No.

549
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,030
The Dragon Lord ordered me

550
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,790
to make it for Miss Nan personally.

551
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,610
Miss Nan!

552
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,630
Miss Nan!

553
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,900
I'm a vegetarian.

554
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,840
Take it back and cook another one.

555
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,110
Looks like she really is unwell.

556
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,010
Even her voice has changed.

557
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,340
I'd better cook another one.

558
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,200
He can't even tell the difference?

559
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,250
Why are you here?

560
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,180
Is the Sword Master here?

561
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,380
I would like to see him.

562
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,350
You colluded with demons,

563
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,870
do you think you deserve to see my Master?

564
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,910
Let her in.

565
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,830
Young lady,

566
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,110
you're really diligent.

567
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,370
You're here to ask for advice on swordsmanship so soon.

568
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,070
The Shanhai barrier

569
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,200
will be opened the day after tomorrow.

570
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,220
By then,

571
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,560
the Sword Master is certain to be busy,

572
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,380
so I want to seize the chance

573
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,320
to learn from you.

574
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,310
You came to me

575
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,000
to ask about

576
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,160
your mother, right?

577
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,400
You're wise.

578
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,280
Mu Guanghan had the opportunity

579
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,150
to spend time with her,

580
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,820
and is closer to your mother.

581
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,110
Why don't you ask him?

582
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,900
The Dragon Lord seems to be keeping something from me,

583
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,440
so I have no choice but to find another way

584
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,940
to find the truth.

585
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,430
In the Dragon Capital, other than the Dragon Lord,

586
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,920
only you

587
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,280
are my mother's old acquaintance.

588
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,430
The truth?

589
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,920
There's something you may not know.

590
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,200
Actually, my mother didn't die of illness.

591
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,380
She was murdered.

592
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,700
It this true?

593
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,020
I also only found out

594
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,910
through my uncle Nan Yi’s deduction.

595
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,590
That’s why I came all the way to the Dragon Capital.

596
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,190
Judging from your reaction,

597
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,900
you seem to be close to my mother.

598
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,830
I had a few more drinks today.

599
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,240
I'm showing an embarrassed sight.

600
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,960
My old classmate was murdered,

601
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,520
and I had no idea.

602
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,110
I truly feel ashamed.

603
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,480
I swear in the name of the sect leader of the Sword Sect,

604
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,270
to find out the truth about your mother.

605
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,120
I wonder if the breakthrough you mentioned

606
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,410
is at the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament Grounds?

607
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,470
Being drunk

608
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,940
will hurt the heart of the sword.

609
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,410
Not drinking,

610
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,670
hurts the heart too.

611
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,990
If it's you,

612
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,030
what will you choose?

613
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,250
I

614
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,780
have no answer for this question.

615
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,400
Having seen the vast sea, all else is but water.

616
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,060
This wine is nothing.

617
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,110
Can't even compare.

618
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,540
Get her!

619
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,160
Get out of my way!

620
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,740
Who are you?

621
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,450
How dare you stop the Dragon Court from catching a criminal?

622
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,250
Criminal?

623
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,610
Is this how you treat her?

624
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,450
What do you want?

625
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,900
The higher-ups urgently ordered us to arrest her.

626
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,220
What else could she be?

627
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,240
I think you're an accomplice.

628
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,400
Die!

629
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,200
Who are you to decide

630
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,150
whether she dies or not?

631
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,760
You found me long ago.

632
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,600
Why are you avoiding me?

633
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,390
Why didn't you come to see me

634
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,380
when you're already in the Dragon Capital?

635
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,180
I'm sorry.

636
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,160
You're sorry?

637
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,980
Is that all

638
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,630
you have to say?

639
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,950
Sen Luo has been sealed completely.

640
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,170
Both your Master and Yin Ya can attest to it.

641
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,720
That's not what I wanted to hear.

642
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,410
Isn't there anything else you wanted to tell me?

643
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,130
Why do you always

644
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,680
decide everything by yourself?

645
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,120
Every time you leave

646
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,120
it's all your own decision.

647
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,100
Have you ever asked me

648
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,760
whether I want it or not?

649
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,810
Have you ever asked

650
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,330
if I can bear all this?

651
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,470
We've experienced so much

652
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,510
together,

653
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,190
spent so many good times together.

654
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,600
Now,

655
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,700
the Seven Sins Manual

656
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,810
has been completed.

657
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,990
In the future,

658
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,780
no matter what difficulties we face,

659
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,540
I can stand by your side.

660
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,670
No matter you're Ji Yang or Yin,

661
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,950
what I want

662
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,920
all along,

663
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,910
is just to be able to be with you.

664
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,800
How can you leave me

665
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,120
again and again

666
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,950
without considering my feelings?

667
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,070
I'm sorry.

668
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,030
I know that

669
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,280
no matter what I say,

670
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,870
you will always think that

671
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,980
you're right.

672
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,960
I always told myself that

673
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,190
you have your choices,

674
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,420
that you have your concerns,

675
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,390
and that I should choose to respect you,

676
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,910
and trust you.

677
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,160
But now,

678
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,210
I want to tell you

679
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,460
I'm tired.

680
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,850
From now on,

681
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,830
you don't have to follow me around

682
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,490
like today.

683
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,600
You and I

684
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,200
part here.

685
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,850
I saw what happened between

686
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,510
you and Nan Yan just now.

687
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,850
Don't be too sad.

688
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,969
She's just too angry.

689
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,360
She doesn't really want to say goodbye to you.

690
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,620
I know.

691
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,790
Sooner or later,

692
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,620
she'll know the truth,

693
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,550
but it's not the time yet.

694
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,870
She finally got you to come back,

695
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,350
but she couldn't get

696
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,310
an explanation.

697
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,690
Think about it.

698
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,130
Compared to the truth,

699
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,150
what does Nan Yan really care about?

700
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,160
She cares if

701
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,520
you have given her

702
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,750
all your honesty, respect, and trust

703
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,830
like she did

704
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,350
with you.

705
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,510
Would you rather

706
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,340
that she resent you

707
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,990
until you sacrifice your life for her,

708
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,950
and let her live

709
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,970
the rest of her life

710
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,430
in deep guilt towards you?

711
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,100
I didn't meet Nan Yan just now,

712
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,510
because

713
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,240
I don't know how to face her.

714
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,220
You know this feeling better than me.

715
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,400
I'll promise you

716
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,460
to keep your secret from Nan Yan,

717
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,110
so can you promise me

718
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,810

00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,590
How can you leave me

760
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,340
♫And my night♫

761
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,120
again and again

762
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,160
♫Before I wake up♫

763
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,670
without considering my feelings?

764
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,660
♫Follow the fate of my previous life♫

765
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,380
♫Travel through time♫

766
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,870
♫To see♫

767
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,860
♫The firefly of love♫

768
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,290
♫Transforming into a butterfly♫

769
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,070
♫Landing at your fingertips♫

770
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,800
♫Make a wish before the light♫

771
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,590
♫May life be♫

772
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:06,670
♫Like the first meeting♫

773
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,750
Father,

774
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,460
I was wrong.

775
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,290
I understand you now.

776
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,590
You must be worried about

777
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,710
the safety of Nan Yan and I,

778
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,800
that's why you grounded us.

779
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,770
I'm worried about Nan Yan too.

780
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,650
Cut the crap!

781
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,160
You've led Yan astray time after time.

782
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,070
There's a higher chance of me seeing a ghost

783
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,510
than trusting you again today!

784
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,010
Father, please believe me.

785
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,610
I also want to know where Nan Yan is.

786
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,310
I also want to know

787
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,710
how she escaped!

788
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,050
If that's the case,

789
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,690
should I also praise you

790
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,050
for being considerate and sensible?

791
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,130
No need.

792
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,190
It's my biggest wish

793
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,670
for Father to calm down.

794
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,120
Calm down?

795
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,520
If I don't teach you

796
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,470
a lesson today.

797
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,030
Ouch!

798
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,090
I...

799
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,340
can't calm down!

800
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,290
Dragon Lord, please show mercy.

801
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,530
Nian, why are you here?

802
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,950
You wanted

803
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,800
Young Master Mu and I

804
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,030
to go to the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament together.

805
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,330
I'm just worried that

806
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,790
if Young Master Mu is injured,

807
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,830
it would interfere with your plans.

808
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,640
That's why I came to stop you.

809
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,390
I just want to scare

810
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,470
this unfilial son.

811
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,360
I'm sorry you had to see this.

812
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,620
I also heard that

813
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,110
Young Master was grounded again.

814
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,430
I wonder if this is true.

815
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,400
It's almost time for the tournament.

816
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,600
You can send him to do anything you want.

817
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,610
No need to bother

818
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,050
about the confinement.

819
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,620
Thank you, Dragon Lord.

820
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,000
You unfilial son.

821
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,400
Look at Nian,

822
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,260
see how thoughtful

823
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,540
and considerate is she.

824
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,590
Listen.

825
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,300
After entering the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament,

826
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,490
if anything happens to Nian,

827
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,710
I'll settle both scores with you

828
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,960
after you come out.

829
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,870
My goodness.

830
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,410
Who is your real child?

831
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,990
You better thank me.

832
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,190
Let me be clear.

833
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,560
This is just a temporary plan.

834
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,870
I have no wishes to enter

835
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,000
the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament.

836
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,390
Hold on.

837
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,010
Why are you so kind

838
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,100
to save me today?

839
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,000
Let me tell you,

840
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,960
someone begged me to come save you.

841
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,920
Nan Yan.

842
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,880
What happened?

843
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,920
Did the Dragon Lord punish you again?

844
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,930
Of course not.

845
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,920
My father

846
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,560
won't hit me for something so small.

847
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,290
Don't worry.

848
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,010
When I arrived,

849
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,770
someone's ears

850
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,290
were nearly yanked off.

851
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,950
I let him

852
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,040
yank it on purpose.

853
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,150
I'm glad you came out safely.

854
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,660
Today,

855
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,350
I have another request.

856
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,240
What are you talking about?

857
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,030
What do you mean by request?

858
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,370
Your business is my business.

859
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,540
Just tell me.

860
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,170
I want you

861
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,030
to get me

862
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,010
a jade amulet.

863
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,410
I want to participate in the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament.

864
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,070
The Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament?

865
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,830
Weren't you not going to participate?

866
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,430
Why did you change your mind?

867
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,340
Do you know

868
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,920
that there's a Retrograde Bone-Deep Mirror

869
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,460
in the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament Grounds?
