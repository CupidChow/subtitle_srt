It's normal that you don't know about me.

160
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,210
Growing up,

166
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,930
to my home today?

167
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,830
Before I tell you

168
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,920
why I'm here,

169
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,180
answer my question first.

170
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,150
Did you kill him?

171
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,750
Yes.

172
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,520
How did you do it?

173
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,790
Poison.

174
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,090
Where did you put it?

175
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,720
You don't need to be so guarded with me.

176
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,770
I didn't get along with him.

177
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,440
In a way,

178
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,680
I had a grudge against him.

179
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,700
So I came to see him,

180
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,030
not for a friendly chat.

181
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,660
The reason I tied you up

182
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,060
is so you would calmly

183
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,590
listen to what I have to say.

184
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,920
I mean no harm.

185
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,410
Understand?

186
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,100
I put the poison in his cup.

187
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,440
I planned to die with him.

188
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,210
But then I changed my mind.

189
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,920
I washed the cup,

190
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,190
but he still died afterward.

191
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,530
Maybe I didn't clean the cup thoroughly.

192
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
Is today a special occasion?

193
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
He even brought a bottle of wine.

194
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,330
If what you said is true,

195
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,480
the person who killed Su Muxin

196
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
might not be you.

197
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,920
Was the wine he drank

198
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,160
brought from outside?

199
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,760
How do you know?

200
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,470
I followed him from Hesheng Street,

201
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,110
where Su Muxin's

202
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,270
lover lives,

203
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,590
all the way here.

204
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,310
When he came back,

205
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,510
he brought a bottle of wine.

206
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,000
So what poisoned Su Muxin

207
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,960
might not be your cup,

208
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,290
but that bottle of wine.

209
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,310
Then let's call the police.

210
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,880
No,

211
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
we can't call the police.

212
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,880
You had a motive to kill,

213
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,270
and you actually attempted it.

214
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,270
You won't be able to explain yourself
to the police.

215
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,310
It's also bad for me,

216
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,310
who suddenly appeared at the scene.

217
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,610
Now both of us need to save ourselves.

218
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,320
We need to

219
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,160
find the real killer.

220
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,620
If you agree,

221
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,310
I can untie you.

222
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,950
I can't see anything,

223
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,300
and I'm not familiar with this place.

224
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,630
You need to help me clean this up.

225
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,400
Moving him today isn't realistic.

226
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,860
We have nowhere to put him.

227
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,080
We need to preserve the body

228
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,510
and not damage it.

229
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,550
This is the top floor.

230
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,950
Is there a rooftop above?

231
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,400
And is there a water tank?

232
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,790
I think there's one

233
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,050
for flushing toilets.

234
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,880
We can only keep it there
for three days at most.

235
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,940
The weather is hot,

236
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,960
so the body will decompose quickly.

237
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,020
Within three days,

238
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,850
I'll find a suitable place

239
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,790
to move him.

240
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,710
Take off his clothes.

241
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Do I look like him?

242
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,790
Very much.

243
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,570
The clothes we removed

244
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,120
must all be disposed of.

245
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,030
If possible,

246
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
burn everything.

247
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,590
After securing all the evidence,

248
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,190
thoroughly clean the house.

250
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,240
Okay.

251
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,940
Do you have any Baijiu at home?

252
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,840
Put it on.

253
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,640
Double-check it again.

254
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,260
Is it at 10 o'clock?

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,750
The power will be out at 10 tonight.

257
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,680
Will you come back and stay with me?

258
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,890
What time is it now?

259
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,160
9:30.

260
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,850

Where...where are we going now?

264
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,890
To do a DNA test.

265
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,440
The one you mentioned before?

266
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,890
Right.

Just need to draw some blood.

268
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,680
Su Muxin's records don't show

269
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,750
that he has a twin brother,

270
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,590
and none of the people
around him know either.

271
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,440
How old were they
when they were separated?

272
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,400
Two or three years old.

273
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,460
Very young anyway.

274
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,890
Do you know

275
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,120
the specific circumstances back then?

276
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,730
It's pretty much what you'd expect.

277
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,330
My brother...

278
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,350
He loved to drink.

279
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,680
It was a real shame.

She couldn't take Mufan with her,

282
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,810
so she ran away with Muxin.

283
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,470
Back then,

284
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,480
traveling wasn't convenient,

285
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,440
so my brother didn't go looking for them

286
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,300
and just raised Mufan by himself.

floating population records here?

294
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,550
Our computer system

295
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,110
was just acquired this year,

296
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,310
and currently only contains

for permanent residents.

The floating population records

haven't been organized yet,

300
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,510
so you have to check the archives.

301
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
If we search that way,

302
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,040
it's going to be a huge project.

appeared in Yunzhou.

305
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,350

with his mother, Chen Li.

So, for information about him,

309
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,240
we might be able to find clues

310
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,170
from his mother.

311
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,010

All these years,

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,740

about Su Mufan's situation?

324
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,630
No, I haven't.

325
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,920
After I got married, I was transferred

326
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,180

327
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,550

saw Su Mufan once after that,

the funeral himself.

00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,150
Why are you so stubborn?

576
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,510
You've been like this
ever since Xiaowei left.

577
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,400
If you're worried about him,

578
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,840
why don't you ask about him again?

579
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,480
Why would I worry about him?

580
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,450
He's off enjoying himself.

581
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,000
I don't have time for such nonsense.

582
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,190
I'm looking at these accounts.

583
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,520
We're making less money again this month.

584
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,890
Alright,

585
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,160
from now on,

586
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,740
I'll do more massages.

587
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,490
Miss,

588
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,110
would you like a massage?

589
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,070
Come in, please.

590
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,150
I'm looking for Xue Xiaowei.

591
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,300
Xiaowei?

592
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,680
Xiaowei, um,

593
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,760
doesn't work here anymore.

594
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,360
He also learned from our Master Xue.

595
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,510
You should try Xue's massage.

596
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,320
His technique is authentic,

597
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,000
right?

598
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:36,760
Come.

599
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,190
Customer,

600
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,290
this way, please.

601
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm looking for Xue Xiaowei.

602
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,930
Please call him.

603
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,420
I need to see him urgently.

604
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,470
I understand.

605
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,040
Were you the one

606
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,870
who just called Xiaowei, right?

607
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,510
Well, I called him,

608
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,370
but there's no signal where he is.

609
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,480
Call him again.

610
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:53,920
No,

611
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,590
I called him, but he's not answering.

612
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,630
The signal is poor where he is.

613
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,430
He... he's not

614
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,190
answering.

615
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,360
Call him again.

616
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:00,800
No.

617
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,280
Try again.

618
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,810
I know.

619
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,000
I've already called him,

620
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,760
but he's not answering.

621
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,360
Listen, young lady,

622
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,510
what exactly do you want?

623
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,890
Just tell me, you're...

624
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,260
What are you doing?

625
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,000
Put the knife down,

626
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,480
you could get killed like this.

627
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,320
Put it down now.

628
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,600
Put it down quickly. Put the knife down.

629
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,000
You might hurt yourself.

630
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,360
Please call

631
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,880
Xue Xiaowei.

632
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,360
Well...

633
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,960
Call him!
