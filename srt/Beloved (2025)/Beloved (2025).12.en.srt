I've explained the situation very clearly

391
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,200
in the materials.

392
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
The organization will definitely

393
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,500
give me and my parents a fair outcome.

Tong.

397
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,570
I don't know if your father

398
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,030
will show you this letter.

399
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,440
You're still young.

400
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,650
you may not understand mom yet.

401
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,440
But

402
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,700
finally waiting for the storm to end,

403
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,680
I must leave temporarily,

404
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,400

406
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,480
a better life for us.

407
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,270
Coming!

408
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,750
Hello.

409
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,960
I'm Shen Jing,

410
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,980
we contacted before.

[Good Fortune]

412
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,240
Han Qiao called me.

413
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,400
He said he was busy recently,

414
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,030
he doesn't have time to see you.

415
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,510
Wait!

416
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,960
Would it be convenient for you,

417
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,820
to let me contact him personally?

418
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,750
If we can't meet,

419
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,840
a phone call would be fine too!

420
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,550
[Fortune]

421
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,240
Shen Jing.

422
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,920
What do you mean by that?

423
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,600
Do you think I did it?

424
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,240
I didn't mean that!

425
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,750
You've misunderstood.

426
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,270
I...

427
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,310
I...

428
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,960
I really don't know

429
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,790
what to do.

430
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,110
Please help me. Okay?

431
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,900
I really...

432
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,680
at the end of my rope.

433
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,520
Forget it.

434
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,230
Let me tell you the truth.

435
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,960
Don't count on him.

436
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,310
It was him

437
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,840
who reported your parents.

438
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,030
And you're still counting on

439
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,360
that little bit of feeling you had before?

440
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,110
You were fooled by him.

441
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,360
Alright.

442
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,550
Go back now.

443
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Don't come again.

444
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,680
My life is ruined.

445
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,110
But I still have you.

446
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,550
For you to get

447
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,950
everything you deserve,

448
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,110
and a happy future.

449
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,480
Mom will try my best.

450
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,970
No matter how long I'm away,

451
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,740
you must remember,

452
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
mom love you.

453
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,270
In this life,

454
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,140
we can only rely on ourselves.

455
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,750

457
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,110
Although you've recovered,

458
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,110
but this medicine

459
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,640
keep taking it for a while.

460
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,300
It's very important

461
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,280
for your mood,

462
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,920
and your sleep.

463
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
I'll say it again.

464
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,510
Don't drink.

465
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,440
We had a fight that day.

466
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,270
He drank a bottle of wine he brought,

467
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,680
and suddenly...

468
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,110
Don't drink.

469
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,880
You'll easily get into big trouble.

470
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,960
He drank a bottle of wine he brought.

471
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,960
How did you find me?

472
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,070
Is Tong with you?

473
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,110
No.

474
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,040
Don't think I don't know.

475
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,090
She has been

476
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,350
with you these days.

477
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,320
Where is she?

478
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,130
I can't tell you.

479
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,200
Outside there're

480
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,930
so many people looking for her.

481
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,240
She can't show up or go home.

482
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,590
You should know that.

483
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,850
None of your business!

484
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,360
Where were you earlier?

485
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Back when you and your brother

486
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,680
swapped identities.

487
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,270
Why didn't you

488
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,330
tell her the truth?

489
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,160
Later, when she got married,

490
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,290
where were you then?

491
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,240
If you had shown up earlier,

492
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,310
would it be like this today?

493
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,550
Her dad went in.

494
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,830
She was also hunted by the police.

495
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,480
Now that you're here,

496
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,270
continue to harm her.

497
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,150
Why won't you let her go?

498
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,920
Give her back to me.

499
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,510
I'm sorry.

500
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,640
I can't do that.

501
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,830
Let's eat.

502
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,200
Let's eat first.

503
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,070
Here.

504
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,240
I’ll get some paper.

505
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,350
Captain Zhou.

506
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Here is Yunzhou,

507
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,750
the highway,

508
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,960
the docks, bus stations, train stations,

509
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,290
have all been notified.

510
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,240
Several necessary roads out of Yunzhou

511
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,880
have already

512
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,940
set up checkpoints

513
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,000
Do you think Qu Tong

514
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,720
and Su Muxin

515
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,770
didn't leave Yunzhou, right?

516
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,920
The day before yesterday,

517
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,240
on July 25,

518
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,790
I used Shen Jing's phone

519
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,440
to have a brief phone call

520
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,590
with Qu Tong.

521
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,000
At that time, there was a lot of sounds

522
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,720
mixed together in the background noises.

523
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
The sound of a ship's whistle,

524
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,720
There's...

525
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,870
the vibrating sound of the

526
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,070
train crossing the track,

527
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,680
The sound of them constantly passing by.

528
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,340
These sounds were very close.

529
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,290
Based on your opinion,

530
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,610
what places in Yunzhou

531
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,240
meet these

532
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,640
several conditions?

533
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,550
Yunzhou

534
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,510
is a port city.

535
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,720
Things like waterborne

536
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,650
ship transport,

537
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,400
and train transportation

538
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,460
are very advanced.

539
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,720
If you put it this way,

540
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,440
the search range

541
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,500
is indeed smaller.

542
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,350
But there are

543
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,440
there are also several counties and cities

544
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,750
that fit this condition.

545
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,110
How can you be sure that...

546
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,640
they didn't leave Yunzhou?

547
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,240
Su Muxin's blind.

548
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,720
He's most likely moving together

549
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,480
with Qu Tong.

550
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,920
And since the day before yesterday,

551
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,320
in order to find Qu Lijun,

552
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,640
We set up surveillance in

553
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,920
Yunzhou and Dongjiang.

554
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,850
It should be hard for them to leave.

555
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,810
Then that way we can

556
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,940
carry out a one by one investigation.

557
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,450
Looking for me?

558
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,400
Captain Zhou, this is her.

559
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,240
Officer Zhou.

560
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,370
You're here.

561
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,750
Shen Jing

562
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,550
You're here to report a case?

563
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,030
Yes.

564
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:58,730
Have a seat.

565
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,370
[Reception Room]

566
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,880
Tell me.

567
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,060
My daughter Qu Tong is missing.

568
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,710
It's already been more than five days,

569
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,909
she hasn't come home.

570
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,360
I'm worried about

571
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,310
her whereabouts and safety.

572
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,080
There are some things

573
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,190
I haven't said all along.

574
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,190
Before Tong Tong went missing,

575
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,920
she was already very abnormal.

576
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,440
Secretive.

577
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,929
She went out alone several times,

578
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,199
didn't tell me what she was going to do.

579
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,920
I guess.

580
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,100
she was bewitched by bad guys.

581
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,469
Now she's missing and can't be contacted,

582
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,770
It must be controlled by that person.

583
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,440
Do you know who this person

584
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,840
you're talking about is?

585
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,000
Is it the one

586
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,280
you asked her on the phone last time?

587
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,110
Named...

588
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,230
Su Mufan.

589
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,880
I don't know the details.

590
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,910
But I found something

591
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,070
at home.

592
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,230
I think it should

593
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,690
be related to this person.

594
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,030
You can look into it.

595
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,000
Tong has never liked eating chili

596
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,060
since she was little.

[Qiaofang Chili Paste]

598
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,620
She suddenly bought

599
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,750
so many chili sauce.

600
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,960
And moreover

601
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,290
it's also a non-product item.

602
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,280

Hurry, mentor

606
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,590
I remember there was

607
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,550
a modified three-wheeler

608
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,710
that entered the residential area.

609
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,550
On the outside metal sheet,

610
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,670
a few words were printed.

611
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,400

612
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,490
What a coincidence.

The exact time is...

618
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,510

I can definitely remember.

622
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,230

623
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,690

Qu Tong is at home.

629
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,000
If the chili sauce is for Qu Tong,

630
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,620
then there must be

631
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,760

Landline numbers are all divided by area.

635
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,480
If I remember correctly, it should be near

636
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,070
the South Cross Street.

637
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Memory still needs strengthening.

However, being able to remember

639
