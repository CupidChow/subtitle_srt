I'm afraid you might be disappointed.

Nowadays, when handling cases,

As long as the evidence is sufficient,

is JAT0059.

you went to an hourly hotel

You insisted on not registering your ID.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,600
And for that,
you paid an extra 100 yuan in cash.

66
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,920
that you were alone,
looking quite disheveled.

Your clothes were soaking wet

68

and you smelled unpleasant.

69
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,160
You then went

to a 24-hour convenience store nearby,

went back to the hotel room and
stayed there for an hour.

Next, you took a shower,

74

changed into the new clothes and left.

75
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,190
Near Lianyang Street,

76
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:38,830
there was no convenient place

It seemed like the lead had gone cold.

79

But then we found

80
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,760
a rather interesting police report.

81
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,370
The caller claimed

82
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,270
that in the early hours of July 18th,

83
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,950
the bicycle he had parked
outside his home

84
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,870
was stolen.

Stop now!

86
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,570
The theft happened

87
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,600
in Qiaotou Town, Yunzhou.

88
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720

90
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,190
had already rushed there to investigate.

Just now, they informed me

that by the river in Qiaotou Town,

obvious traces were found.

in the river,

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,190

If you confess voluntarily,

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay?

193
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,550
She's my only daughter,

194
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,960
you know?

195
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,790
Fine.

196
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,110
I'll leave.

197
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,940
[Called: Tong]

198
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,490
[Calling: Tong]

199
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,910
Sorry.

This responder you dialed is powered off.

201
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,310

202

Who are you looking for?

203
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,960
Qu Tong!

204
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,140
Qu Tong is not here.

205
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,270
Qu Tong!

206
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
What are you doing?

207
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,150

208
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,720

209
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,790
Get down!

210
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,050
Qu Tong is not here.

211
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,720
Tell me what you want.

212
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,970
Call Qu Tong back right now.

213
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,240
I went to the police station.

214
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,510
The police told me

215
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,150
she is the suspect!

216
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,830
She is the murderer!

217
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,120
Didn't the police tell you this?

218
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,930
This matter

219
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,860
has nothing to do with Qu Tong!

220
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,740
Nothing to do with her?

221
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,360
If this has nothing to do with her,

222
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,160
why didn't she answer my phone?

223
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,900
She even turned off her phone!

224
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,130
Stop hiding.

225
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,940
She must feel guilty.

226
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,200
Listen.

227
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,750
Since the first day

228
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,380
my daughter met yours,

229
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,750
my daughter's life

230
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,550
has been ruined by your daughter!

231
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,390
Nonsense!

232
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,240
There's no basis for that at all.

233
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,500
You're just guessing.

234
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,770
Let me tell you.

235
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,510
I hate

236
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,950
people like you the most.

237
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,320
Without any evidence,

238
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,380
without any logic,

239
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,370
you just throw a fit for no reason!

240
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,150
How dare you judge me?

241
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,500
You are educated and logical,

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,550
yet you've raised

243
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,870
such a murderer!

244
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,550
I'm uneducated, but I'm a victim!

245
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,510
Your daughter is a murderer!

246
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,480
Didn't the police tell you

247
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,080
how your daughter died?

248
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,300
You want to know the truth, right?

249
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,000
Your daughter

250
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,120
was scared to death.

251
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,360
Scared to death,

252
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,160
do you hear me?

253
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,430
Nonsense.

254
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,260
The police said she was murdered!

255
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,630
That's because the police don't know

256
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,270
who scared her to death!

257
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,210
Back then,

258
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,520
your daughter hit someone with a rock.

259
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,840
The man who was hit

260
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,870
is now back.

261
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,610
He was looking for your daughter.

262
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,620
Don't you dare pretend

263
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,360
you don't know who your daughter

264
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,160
was trying to hit with that rock!

265
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,670
No.

266
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,460
I killed someone.

267
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,030
You must never tell anyone.

268
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,290
Got it?

269
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,200
No.

The mock exam is coming soon.

274
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,270
And this is the most stressful time.

275
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,270

No.

284
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,560
I don't need to hope.

285
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,790

290
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,330
Why are you here?

291
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,400
I didn't know

292
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
the riverbank behind the school

293
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,350

295
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,610
You followed me here, didn't you?

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,560
I have something to ask you.

297
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,310
You ignored me when I called you.

298
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,640
So I followed you.

299
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,680

304
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,320
I haven't figured it out yet.

I don't think we're a match.

If there's nothing else,

314
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,780
maybe you should head back first?

315
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,480
Or

316
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,880
you can stay here a little longer.

317
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,030
I'll go back first.

318
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,920

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,880
No reason.

321
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,680
Did you make an appointment

322

to meet her here?

323
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,050
This is my own business.

00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,460
Never tell anyone.

383
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,880
Never tell anyone.

384
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,240
Mom.

385
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,920
The job was very important

386
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,480
to Mother and me.

387
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,840
Dad has passed away.

388
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,980
And Mother and I

389
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,110
did not have enough

390
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,270
to live

391
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,200
on those hard present years.

392
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,510
Meili.

393
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,160
Mom.

394
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,840
How is it?

395
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,440
I saw Qu Tong just now.

396
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,910
She was with her mother.

397
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
I think she's fine. Don't worry.

398
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,340
Are you sure, mom?

399
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,240
Yes.

400
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,830
But that day...

401
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,030
Was that someone else

402
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,640
with an umbrella that looked like hers?

403
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,510
Or

404
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,110
she was actually fine,
but she was just faking it?

405
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,000
Sit down.

406
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,160
Listen to me.

407
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,880
Just pretend it never happened

408
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,720
and never mention it again, okay?

409
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,660
Remember that.

410
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,750
But...

411
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,000
Who else could it be?

412
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,550
Then...

413
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,070
Well,

414
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,000
you have an uncle who lives abroad.

415
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,410
Go abroad.

416
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,030
Go to college there
and take the exam again.

417
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,360
Your English is so good.

418
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,960
I'll save money for you.

419
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,680
But...

420
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,680
But studying abroad is expensive,

421
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,240
Mom.

422
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,920
It's okay.

423
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,300
I'm with you. Don't worry.

424
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,780
I'll borrow money from someone else.

425
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,920
That's it.

426
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,690
Alright.

427
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,230
Mom.

428
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,960
No.

429
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,880
Su Muxin.

430
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,100
I still didn't see you today.

431
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,690
This is

432
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,030
the fifteenth day.

433
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,150
Every time the sun sets,

434
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,440
the river is always beautiful.

435
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,310
I want to watch

436
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,990
this lovely scenery with you.

437
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,110
But unfortunately,
every day there's only me

438
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,000
and the beacon tower,

439
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,790
forming two lonely shadows.

440
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,510
No matter

441
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,010
whether you're avoiding me
on purpose or not,

442
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,960
I'll still come and wait

443
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,820
under the beacon tower every day,

444
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,640
until you show up.

445
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,350
I'll always wait for you.

446
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,510
Always.

447
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:19,960
Always.

448
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,160
Meili.

449
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,960
Study hard and make progress every day.

450
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,930
You can't drink the tap water.

451
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,030
Muxian, you...

452
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,440
Where are you going at this hour?

453
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,110
Meili went to school.

454
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,290
It's getting dark.

455
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,830
And she still hasn't come back.

456
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,640
She's such a naughty kid.

457
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,270
She deserves a spanking.

458
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,510
Didn't Meili...

459
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,740
She went to school.

460
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,880
I can do it myself.

461
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,510
I can do it myself.

462
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,110
Let's go.

463
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,070
Muxian.

464
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,550
Go home.

465
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,240
Xiaowei.

466
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,250
Time to eat.

467
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,350
Coming.

468
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,110
Qu Tong.

469
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,080
Do you have no appetite?

470
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,690
I'm not hungry.

471
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,480
Don't worry.

472
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,160
Give me two more days.

473
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,680
I'll get everything arranged

474
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,340
for the trip to the northwest.

475
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,960
Let's go take a look at the beacon tower,

476
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,510
okay?

477
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,730
We might not get another chance
in the future.

478
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,720
Are we there yet?

479
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,640
Yes.

480
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,590
It's okay.

481
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,490
I'll wait for you two here.

482
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,240
Okay.

483
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,300
By the ancient path,

484
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,590
green grass stretches to the sky.

485
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,570
It has been so long
since I last came here.

486
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,320
Everything here is different from before.

487
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,640
But the beacon tower is still the same,

488
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,960
only a little more worn out.

489
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,270
It's on your left.

490
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,310
Doesn't it

491
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,350
just stand there firm and steady

492
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,550
like my walking cane?

493
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,670
The ground here

494
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,250
is different from before.

495
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,640
There used to be so many cobblestones.

496
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,400
But now,

497
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,510
it's all small gravel.

498
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,590
Is this it?

499
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,350
Yes.

500
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,640
But

501
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,020
we need the kind

502
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
that's round and flat.

503
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,540
Is this the right one?

504
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,520
This is good.

505
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,410
Watch closely.

506
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,070
How is it?

507
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,840
One, two, three.

508
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,690
I haven't been this happy in ages.

509
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,510
16 years.

510
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,110
Time flies.

511
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,110
The world has changed.

512
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,400
But you're the only one
who hasn't changed.

513
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,630
If you hadn't

514
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,880
met me again,

515
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,440
you would have stayed
at the massage parlor,

516
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,040
living a happy life forever.

517
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,389
Do you still remember

518
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,690
what we used to play

519
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,739
here?

520
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,120
Hide-and-seek.

521
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,020
Do you want to play now?

522
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,400
Now?

523
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,760
Well, why not?

524
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,230
No.

525
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,950
It's not fair.

526
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,230
I'm blind. I can't see.

527
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,550
You dare not?

528
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
I dare not?

529
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,800
Have you ever defeated me
in hide-and-seek?

530
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,110
I won every time!

531
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,000
To be fair,

532
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,830
let's cover our eyes this time.

533
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,710
Come on.

534
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,860
I'm not afraid.

535
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,030
Come on.

536
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,230
Okay.

537
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,690
How do we cover our eyes?

538
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,010
Use my clothes?

539
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,880
No need.

540
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,490
I brought it.

541
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,550
You cover my eyes.

542
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,550
What about yours?

543
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,870
I brought two.

544
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,600
You're well prepared, huh?

545
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,360
Come on.

546
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,150
I'll cover your eyes first.

547
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,680
Go ahead.

548
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Is it necessary

549
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,100
that you cover my eyes?

550
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,670
Only this is fair.

551
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,920
Are you done?

552
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,240
Are you done?

553
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,830
Yes.

554
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,960
Count slowly.

555
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,280
Okay.

556
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,710
One.

557
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,110
Two.

558
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,230
Three.

559
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,480
Four.

560
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:13,760
Five.

561
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,800
Six.

562
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,110
Seven.

563
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,000
Eight.

564
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,230
Nine.

565
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,840
Ten.

566
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,710
I'm coming.

567
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,760
The sound went this way,

568
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,480
right?

569
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,230
Qu Tong.

570
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,840
Give me a hint.

571
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,960
Qu Tong.
