00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,250
You'll know

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,280
when you see Tong.

5
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,430
Don't worry.

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,180
She's much better now.

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,240
Has she gone out recently?

8
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,370
Take her out for a walk.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,430
It's

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,030
good for her emotions.

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,840
She seldom goes out.

Momo's birthday,

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,470
she stayed at her grave

15
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,200
for a while.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,390
Besides that,

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,850
she doesn't want to go out.

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,519
Here's what I think.

19
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,930
Let's step by step.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,480
We can't force her

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,970
to become a normal person.

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,960
To be honest,

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,620
she is willing to communicate with me

24
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,000
and gets close to me occasionally.

25
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,950
I'm satisfied.

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,539
Let's take it slow.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,230
No hurry.

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,950
You're right.

29
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,930

36
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,960
Mom,

37
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,660
what made you think of treating me to tea?

38
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,440
How long has it been?

39
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,160
Two years? Three?

40
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,410
It's just a show.

41
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,520
I don't have to remember it so clearly.

42
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,570
I'll give you a chance.

43
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,980
Break up with her soon.

45
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,540
You know

46
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,659
how Tong treats me.

47
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,240
I need some personal space.

48
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,750
I think

49
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,150
that's understandable.

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,690
Please understand.

51
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,520
Since you don't want to,

52
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,950
get a divorce.

Live with whoever you want.

57
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,480
If that's the case,

58
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Mom, I think

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,600
you are not generous enough.

60
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,120
Don't be greedy.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
You were the one who cheated.

62
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,510
I can have Tong sue for divorce.

63
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,580
Let me put it this way, Mom.

64
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,850
For eight years,

65
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,750
I turned your family's company

66
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,680
from a quiet, unknown

67
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,510
county-level business

68
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,630
into a well-known jewelry brand

69
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,950
in the city.

70
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,680
The next step is provincial expansion.

71
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,190
Then national expansion.

72
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,680
Now the company's revenue

73
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,560
has multiplied several times
compared to before.

74
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,070
Mom,

75
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,680
you don't think

76
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,680
Zhuo'er is still the small workshop

77
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,080

78
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,600
Zhuo'er needed

79
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,600
to expand its business map,

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,510
so many companies

81
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,680
have joined.

82
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,970
You and Dad

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,920

84
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,240
every stock contract.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,630
If you want to kick me out of the company,

86
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,490
you should ask the shareholders.

87
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,800
What do these shareholders

88
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,430
have to do with you?

89
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,950
There is a relationship,

90
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,310
but to

91
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,310
what extent,

92
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,310
I don't think it's necessary

93
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,190
to let you know.

94
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,430
I'm afraid

95
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,510
you'll get angry.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,870
Back then,

97
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,240
you did this for that?

98
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,960
How can you not understand?

99
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,450
I don't want to do this, Mom.

100
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,200
I don't want to divorce Tong.

101
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,070
But I really didn't expect

102
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,680
in the end

103
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,120
you would do this,

104
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,390
backstabbing me.

105
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,240
Fortunately,

106
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,100
I left a way out.

107
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,600
A way out?

108
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,680
Ridiculous.

109
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,310
You're severing ties.

110
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,310
Severing ties?

111
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,060
Call it severing ties?

112
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,220
Okay, okay,

113
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,510
we're here today to see

114
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,070
who can say worse things,

115
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,600
right?

116
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,150
Alright, then I'll speak about

117
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,550
the things you have done.

118
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,040
Mom,

119
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,080
what's the difference between you and me?

120
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,159
Neither of us is good person.

121
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,750
Why did you

122
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,680
marry Qu Lijun?

123
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,680
Because you had a purpose.

124
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,260
Your purpose wasn't pure.

125
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,790
Wasn't it just to

126
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,240
crawl back to the county town

127
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,950
from that stinky mountain valley?

128
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,010
Wasn't that why you

129
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,020
sold yourself?

130
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,070
Look at you now,

131
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,360
you're living well,

132
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,470
but you're always frowning.

133
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,960
Who are you showing it to?

134
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,310
I know why

135
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,710
you married Qu Tong to me;

136
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,040
wasn't it because I was

137
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,390
a deputy section chief
in the bureau at the time?

138
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,490
Back then, many people

139
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,480
wanted me to

140
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,809
join their companies.

141
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,320
As long as they used my connections,

142
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,360
their companies could improve

143
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,960
by hundreds or thousands of times.

144
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,840
But why

145
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,600
did I choose your family?

146
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,600
Have you ever thought about it?

147
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,600
You sold your daughter,

148
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,460
so stop playing the virtuous one.

149
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,360
From now on,

150
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,840
you'll make the decisions at home,

151
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,810
and I'll listen to you.

152
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,630
You're

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,670
threatening me now,

154
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,720
using those

155
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
old, useless things.

156
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,610
Does it still work?

157
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,000
Mom,

158
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,080
you're being foolish.

159
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,910
Don't deny it.

160
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,750
After all, in this family,

161
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,230
you know me the best.

162
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,240
In fact,

163
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
we are the same.

164
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,670
Since

165
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,840
you don't truly love like Tong,

166
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,560
why are you holding onto her?

167
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,510
Who says I don't love her?

168
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,960
I love Tong.

169
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,390
I would love her

170
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,240
with my life!

171
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Who can do it?

172
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,870
Can you?

173
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,510
Listen,

174
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,220
if you want me to leave Tong, fine,

175
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,600
unless she dies,

176
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,510
or I die.

177
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,440
From the moment

178
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,150
I met Tong,

179
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,550
I knew she belonged to me.

180
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,840
Everything I have now

181
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,840
is given by God.

182
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,740
Because God owes me.

183
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,840
Why

184
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,910
could he escape back then,

185
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,480
and I had to stay there?

186
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,030
Why could he study,

187
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,750
go to college,

188
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,480
but I couldn't?

189
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,240
Why does everyone love him

190
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,840
but no one cares about me?

191
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,180
Including Tong.

192
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,330
Over the years,

193
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,690
I've stopped being myself.

194
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,850
But why

195
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,230
can't she forget him?

196
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,750
So, Mom,

197
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,510
I

198
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,240
want Tong to belong to me,

199
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,750
from head to toe, body and heart,

200
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,110
only to me.

201
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,630
Are you crazy?

202
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,750
Are you crazy?

203
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,000
Mom.

204
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,440
Do you remember

205
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,700
what I told you before?

206
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,240
I will always

207
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,840
treat Tong well.

208
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,440
I'll let her live a good life.

209
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,640
In the future,

210
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,550
I'll have another baby with her.

211
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
I will be with her.

212
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,500
I'll always be with her

213
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,580
until she dies.

214
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,330
Don't worry.

215
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,390
All right.

216
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,270
Okay, Mom.

217
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,120
If there's nothing else,

218
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,670
I'm going back to the company.

219
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm busy.

220
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,550
I'll pay the bill.

221
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,760
Su Muxin.

222
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,670
Don't push me too hard.

223
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,720
If you push me,

224
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,750
I'll do anything.

225
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,020
Mom.

226
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,240
Mom.

227
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,440
I'm Su Mufan.

228
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,150
I only have one name.

229
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,270
My name is Su Muxin.

230
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,570
Over there.

231
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,230
Go ask whose car it is.

232
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,780
Boss.

233
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,670
Xue, where is Xiaowei?

234
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,700
He went back to his hometown.

235
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
He went back home?

236
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,320
No wonder he isn't in the shop.

237
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:08,980
I'm done.

238
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,780
It's comfortable.

239
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,290
Your waist is not good.

240
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,670
Don't do

241
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,930
heavy work.

242
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,790
Yes, yes.

243
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,750
See you.

244
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,730
I'll write it down for you.

245
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,270
Sure.

246
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,290
Make an appointment in advance next time.

247
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,090
OK. Bye.

248
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,150
Xiaoling is so naughty.

249
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,880
After Xiaowei left,

250
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,790
she's been out all day.

251
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,360
I need to teach her a lesson
when she comes back.

252
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,750
I'm so worried.

Hello.

258
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,800
Come in, please.

259
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,790
We're police officers from the Dongjiang

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,810
I'm Zhou Mi.

This is Wu Dong.

263
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,750
Take a look.

264
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,010
Do you know
these two people in the photo?

265
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,440
Why...

266
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,390
why are you looking for them?

267
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,080
Who are you looking for?

These two people
are involved in a criminal case.

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,600
Have you seen them?

270
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,530
Do you know them?

271
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,120
No, I don't.

272
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
Sit down.

273
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,580
How many people

274
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,240
live here?

275
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,470
Three people.

276
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,360
Only our family.

277
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,580
My name is Xue Zhong.

278
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,240
This is my wife,

279
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,640
Sun Qiaofang.

280
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,200
And we have a daughter,

281
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,030
Xue Xiaoling.

282
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,640
She went out just now.

283
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,030
Our place is simple,

284
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,750
very normal,

285
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,150
it has nothing to do

286
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,630
with your case.

287
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,150
You just said

288
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,850
you have a daughter, right?

289
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,150
These two razors are...

290
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,200
Well,

291
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,390
I bought a new one

292
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,760
for Xue.

293
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,100
And didn't want to throw the old one away.

294
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,240
How many technicians do you have?

295
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,200
Just me.

296
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,880
Okay.

297
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,650
Wu Dong,

298
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,270
take that photo

299
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,880
and ask the neighbors.

300
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,589
They don't recognize them;

301
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,310
maybe the neighbors do.

302
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:16,839
Let's go.

303
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,460
Wait.

304
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,680
What are you doing?

305
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,329
What are you doing?

306
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,960
I've already told you,

307
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,790
we've worked hard

308
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,849
to open this shop.

309
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,750
It's not easy.

310
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,349
You show a photo,

311
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,680
suddenly suspecting them,

312
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,400
and then calling them criminals.

313
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,410
If this

314
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,480
gets out,

315
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,170
how can we

316
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,480
operate

317
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,000
here?

318
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,980
I'm on duty,

319
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,410
please step aside.

320
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,480
No, sir.

321
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Sir, I beg you.

322
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,410
Please, don't investigate anymore.

323
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,500
Please.

324
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,510
This...

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,590
this case

326
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,830
has nothing to do with us.

327
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,590
Our kids

328
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,870
are good kids.

329
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Your kids?

330
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,400
Officer,

331
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,750
let me tell you,

332
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,920
Xue.

333
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,600
Can...

334
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,570
can you stop talking?

335
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,880
It's useless now.

336
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,440
Go ahead.

337
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,640
Officer,

338
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,230
if I'm not mistaken,

339
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,520
one of the two people

340
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,060
you're looking for

341
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,920
is Xue Xiaowei of our home.

342
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,550
Xue Xiaowei.

343
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,390
He is my nephew.

344
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,030
Biological Nephew?

345
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,550
No.

346
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,310
No.

347
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,510
We found him

348
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,620
from the river.

349
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,200
He wouldn't tell us his name.

350
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,030
I have a nephew

351
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,510
who died in an accident in 1986,

352
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,590
and his household registration
wasn't cancelled.

353
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,270
We used

354
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,830
his identity.

355
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
That's how it is.

356
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,270
We've been living together

357
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,680
and treated him like our own son.

358
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,510
Take another look at this photo.

359
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,040
Do you recognize the woman?

360
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,960
I don't recognize her,

361
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,490
but she has been here twice.

362
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Our Xiaowei

363
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,840
would never do anything bad.

364
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,030
The Yunzhou police

365
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,880
have already set up checkpoints

366
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,590
around the intersections

367
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,850
and sent three teams for reinforcement.

368
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,880
Hello?

369
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,560
Speak.

370
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,750
We found them.

371
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,070
They're at a cargo transshipment station

372
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,310
under the Cross-River Bridge.

373
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,510
They should be there.

374
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,990
We're heading there now.

375
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,150
Alright, I'll be there soon.

376
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,770
Let's go.

377
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,880
In a moment, you guys

378
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,480
help take them back to the station.

379
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,000
Thanks.

380
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,720
Okay.

381
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,480
The distance is not far,
about ten minutes.

382
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,610
Alright, you guys control them first.

383
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,140
Set up the block.

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,770
[Police]

385
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,900
Li, we've located the car.

386
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,570
It's a white Toyota Hiace.

387
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,660
White Hiace.

388
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,290

Sure.

478
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,200
I mean,

479
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,760
did I break the law?

480
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,680

I don't know which part of my answer

483

might have gotten me involved in this.

484
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,360
I can't guarantee that.

If you're not sure,

486
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,850
just ask the police.

would it be a crime?

490
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,730

is not a crime.

a police investigation

492
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,240
is another matter.

Then I'll tell you the truth.

494
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,240
Xiaowei told me to do it.

495
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,720
He told me to drive the car alone,

496
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,480
and when I saw the intersection,

497
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,160
I should rush through.

498
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,920

499
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,780
to be careful,

500
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,690
don't get hurt,

501
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,000
and don't crash the car.

502
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,310
Otherwise, I'll have to pay
the company back.

503
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,350
The most important thing is,

504
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,160
don't crash into other cars

505
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,440
or people.

506
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,030
As for what Xiaowei is up to,

507
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,270
I really don't know.

508
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,210
I'm just helping a friend.

509
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,240
He asked me to drive,

510
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,200
so I drove.

511
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,340
It wasn't intentional.

512
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,110

513
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,640

if you help him

and obstruct the police investigation,

557
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,160
that's also a crime.

558
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,010
Xiaowei wouldn't kill anyone.

Don't be nervous,

00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,320
just answer truthfully.

562
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,550
What's your relationship

563
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,610
with Chen Shuncai?

564
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,230
When we checked
the household registration,

565
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,510
we found that you're not
from the same village,

566

but you both moved to
South Cross Street at the same time.

was raised by us.

573
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,360
He's a relative of Xiaofang's family.

574
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,230
By bloodline,

575
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,760
he should be her grandnephew.

576

His mother died young,

577
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,800
the family was poor,

so Xiaofang often brought him

580
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,460
into the house to eat and stay.

581
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,920
It was just

582
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,880
eating here,

583
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,410
sleeping there,

584
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,850
and he lived like that.

585
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,890
Do you know where Xue Xiaowei

586
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,320
and Xue Xiaoling are now?

587
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,760
Xue Xiaowei

588
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,280
has been with your family for 16 years,

589
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,000
didn't you ever ask about his past?

590
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,840
When we found him,

591
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,670
he was barely alive.

592
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,870
Hurry up!

593
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,670
Hurry, Mom!

594
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,630
Hurry, Mom!

595
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,710
Hurry, Mom!

596
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,210
Hurry, Mom!

597
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,160
Chen Shuncai,

598
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,630
put him down!

599
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,210
Chen Shuncai,

600
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,440
let him go!

601
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,760
No!

602
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,840
The water's rushing
in this season.

603
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,640
And you dare touch a drowned man?

604
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,030
I'm talking to you.

605
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,150
Let go or not?

606
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,210
No!

607
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,670
Put him down!

608
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,750
I won't!

609
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,360
It's okay. Don't be afraid;
don't be afraid.

610
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,160
Don't be afraid; don't be afraid;
don't be afraid.

611
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,550
A blind man,

612
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
barely able to survive,

613
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,630
is already doing better than expected.

614
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,800
If it weren't for Xiaoling,

615
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,510
following him every day,

616
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,960
he'd have died long ago.

617
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,110
I know why

618
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,770
he hasn't committed suicide.

619
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,230
He's afraid Xiaoling would be hurt.

620
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,230
A person who thinks about dying every day,

621
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,630
what do you want me to ask?

622
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,360
What do you want me to ask him?

623
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,440
Like this,

624
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,590
it went on for years.

625
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
Until later,

626
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,960
I saw him laughing more and more.

627
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,400
I knew then,

628
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,280
this child

629
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
came back to life.

630
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,760
So,

631
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,020
who was Xue Xiaowei closest to

632
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,150
in your family?

633
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,550
It was

634
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,150
Xiaoling.

635
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,630
Does she know

636
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,320
his past?

637
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,890
She probably doesn't know.

638
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,030
Where is she now?

639
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,070
Has she shown any

640
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,670
unusual behavior recently?

641
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
She hasn't shown anything unusual.

642
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,590
Xiaoling is a good child.

643
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,510
She's just

644
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,000
unlucky,

645
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,230
Unlucky?

646
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,960
Xiaofang and I

647
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,550
don't know which one of us is at fault

648
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,320
but we've been unable to
have our own child.

649
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,410
[Video recording]

650
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,110
Xiaoling.

651
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
She's an orphan from our village.

652
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,510
We saw that this child was pitiful,

653
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,280
so we took her in and raised her.

654
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,690
Xiaoling doesn't know about this.

655
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,880
She always thought

656
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,940
she was our biological child.

657
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,440
Xiaoling has nothing

658
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,030
to do with your case.

659
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,230
These three children

660
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,360
are all adopted by you?

661
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,590
Yes.

662
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,450
I can't have children,

663
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
but I'm lucky.

664
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Heaven

665
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,440
gave me three children.

666
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,030
Our family,

667
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,880
though poor,

668
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,680
with one disability,

669
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,430
and

670
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,440
I don’t have much education,

671
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,630
but I think we live pretty well.

672
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,070
I never dared to imagine

673
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,210
that I could have such a family.

674
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,360
Our family

675
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
has no bad people.

676
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,360
My children

677
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,230
won't do bad things.
