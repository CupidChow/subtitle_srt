Qu Lijun had an alibi.

193
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,650
Based on these facts,

194
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,270
Qu Lijun is more likely

195
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,070
to be covering for someone else.

196
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,440
Qu Tong.

197
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,080
Mom.

198
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,480
You're not so stupid after all.

199
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,210
Can you tell the truth now?

200
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,500
What exactly happened

201
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,630
that night?

202
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,360
We had a fight that day.

203
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,580
You've thought about killing me.

204
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,360
In your mind,

205
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,680
you've killed me 10,000 times already,
haven't you?

206
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,360
He drank a bottle of wine he brought,

207
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,650
and suddenly...

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,910
I don't know.

209
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,810
But I don't think I killed him.

210
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,840
So

211
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,270
those pieces of evidence are crucial now,

212
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,080
the things that were

213
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,360
found with the body.

214
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,600
Mom,

215
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,550
did Dad tell you

216
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,400
how he disposed of the evidence?

217
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
He threw everything into the river.

218
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,530
No matter what,

219
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,560
you shouldn't have moved the body,

220
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,870
let alone the evidence.

221
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,060
So, putting the body in the water tank

222
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,550
would solve the problem,

223
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,240
and nobody would find it?

224
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,600
We were planning to take care of it.

225
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,270
We?

226
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,000
Was it Su Mufan?

227
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,670
When the police told you,

228
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,390
I was shocked too.

229
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,320
Su Muxin

230
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,030
actually has a twin brother.

231
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,040
These past few days,

232
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,440
you've been with him.

233
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,420
On the day of the incident,

234
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,240
he was at the scene.

235
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,340
That's too much of a coincidence.

236
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,750
As soon as Su Muxin dies,

237
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,910
his brother, who hasn't been seen
for over 20 years,

238
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,970
suddenly appears.

239
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,670
Mom,

240
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,610
it wasn't Su Mufan.

241
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,840
How do you know it wasn't him?

242
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,600
Officer Zhou said

243
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,340
he was the real suspect

244
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,600
in Shi Yue's case.

245
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,980
He also killed Shi Yue.

246
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,790
He killed them both.

247
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,630
Mom,

248
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,580
he didn't kill Shi Yue.

249
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,020
It was an accident.

250
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,840
If he really killed Su Muxin,

251
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,500
he could have easily framed me

252
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,980
instead of helping me.

253
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,520
Is she out yet?

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,720
Not yet.

255
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,930
He was at the scene.

256
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,350
He's the killer.

257
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
That makes sense.

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,680
He's not the killer.

259
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,120
I can't tell you

260
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
too much right now,

261
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,000
but I can tell you

262
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,530
he really didn't kill them.

263
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,510
And I can't

264
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,550
pin a murder charge

265
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,870
on an innocent person.

266
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,360
Don't be so confused.

267
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,910
Is he threatening you?

268
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,970
No,

269
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,640
he's really not threatening me.

270
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,900
He's truly helping me.

271
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,510
Why can't you

272
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,790
believe me just once?

273
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
He fundamentally

274
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,839
hated Su Muxin.

275
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,660
He absolutely had the motive.

276
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,839
You've been deceived by him.

277
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,200
Stop talking.

278
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:19,829
I know him.

279
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
What do you know?

280
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,589
Don't be so emotional.

281
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,550
Do you think it's still

282
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,810
your high school days?

283
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,570
What did you say?

284
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,960
You know?

285
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,270
How did you know?

286
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,210
I'm asking you.

287
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,310
How did you...

288
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,000
Right now,

289
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,370
that's not the point.

290
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,000
Answer me.

291
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,590
We need to quickly figure out

292
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,110
Tell me.

293
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,450
a plan of action.

294
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,350
When did you find out?

295
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,880
Do you want everyone

296
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,830
to hear this?

297
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,480
Tell me!

298
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,280
The umbrella.

299
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,790
Wait.

300
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,750
That umbrella.

301
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,960
So it was you...

302
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,170
16 years ago.

303
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,140
I still want to study meteorology.

304
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,480
[1986]

305
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,740
Meteorologists can work in many places.

306
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,440
The mountains and the sea...

307
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
I want to see them all.

308
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,780
What about you?

309
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,350
Me?

310
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,130
I definitely want to study design.

311
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,830
You love drawing so much.

312
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,960
So,

313
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,310
can we still go to

314
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,270
the same city?

315
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,400
Yes.

316
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,480
I'll ask around

317
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,520
which schools have both majors.

318
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,490
It should be far from Yunzhou.

319
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,070
Okay.

320
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,720
Quick.

321
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,310
What's wrong?

322
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,590
My neighbor.

323
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,160
I should go now.

324
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,350
Let's meet tonight to discuss more.

325
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,350
It's about to rain.

326
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,110
Take this.

327
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,830
Let's meet at the beacon tower tonight.

328
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,560
I'm leaving.

329
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,400
Shen Jing.

330
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,920
Today I saw your daughter Qu Tong

331
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,050
with her boyfriend.

332
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,750
What nonsense are you talking about?

333
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,200
Qu Tong may be young,

334
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,790
but she's quite capable.

335
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,110
That boyfriend of hers
looks quite handsome.

336
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,880
She has much better taste than you.

337
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,010
That's ridiculous.

338
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,170
She doesn't have a boyfriend?

339
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,030
Then why were those two talking

340
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,200
so intimately?

341
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,730
What kind of logic is that?

342
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,980
Just because they talked
doesn't mean they're dating.

343
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,640
You're quite good at
jumping to conclusions.

344
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:52,920
Mom.

345
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,790
Aren't you going to the movies with Dad?

346
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,350
We go to the movies.

347
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,720
So you can

348
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,590
meet with that Su Muxin,

349
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,680
right?

350
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,680
Tonight you're

351
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,720
staying at home.

352
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,290
You can't go anywhere.

353
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,550
Mom.

354
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,880
I need to get my umbrella.

355
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,880
I lent it to my classmate,

356
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,480
a female classmate.

357
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,440
Don't make excuses with me.

358
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,440
I know exactly what you're thinking.

359
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,000
Dad.

360
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,350
Dad.

361
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,760
Did you find him?

362
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,480
Let's talk inside.

363
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,000
Did you find him?

364
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,480
Tong.

365
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,350
Dad went to that place

366
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,410
just like you said,

367
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,640
but

368
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,360
I didn't meet anyone there.

369
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,330
Do you think it's because

370
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,240
the rain was too heavy

371
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,720
and he couldn't come out?

372
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,110
That's impossible.

373
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,960
We had already made a promise.

374
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,620
He would definitely be there.

375
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Then maybe

376
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,620
Dad went to the wrong place

377
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,000
and missed him.

378
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,820
Dad, please help me again.

379
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,240
I've already done my best.

380
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,240
You can't keep pushing me like this.

381
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,200
This umbrella needs to be hidden.

382
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,070
No matter what,

383
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,730
we can't let this affect Tong.

384
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,830
Tong.

385
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,480
Now, it's not the time to cry.

386
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,690
Listen to me.

387
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,550
I won't hurt you.

388
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,640
You've ruined

389
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,790
my entire life.

390
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,550
Everything I've done

391
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,340
has been for your own good.

392
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,200
I am your mother.

393
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,510
I am the one in this world

394
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,200
who cares about you the most.

395
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,110
All you care about

396
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,670
is yourself.

397
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:15,750
You.

398
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,000
When I was eight years old,

399
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,680
you left.

400
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,480
You came back when I was nine.

401
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
Everyone said

402
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,350
you came back for me.

403
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,350
That you couldn't bear
to be away from your child.

404
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,510
It was Dad. He sent you a telegram

405
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,620
saying I was sick.

406
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,510
All these years,

407
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,510
that's what you've been telling me.

408
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,200
It's as if I'm the one

409
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,750
who forced you to stay in this small town,

410
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,160
like I owe you something

411
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,450
and should make it up to you.

412
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,440
But the truth is,

413
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,200
you failed to get that transfer.

414
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,610
Those people you counted on

415
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,510
turned their backs on you;

416
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,810
you had nowhere else to go,

417
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,920
and you had no money,

418
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,180
so you had to come back.

419
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,270
You came back
with your tail between your legs

420
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,430
to this small Yunzhou county,

421
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,680
living by controlling me and Dad.

422
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,960
You're never satisfied.

423
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,900
You didn't approve of

424
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,430
my relationship with Muxin

425
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,640
just because

426
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,170
his family was poor, right?

427
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,960
But eight years ago,

428
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,790
you knew perfectly well

429
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,390
that person was an impostor,

430
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,310
yet you forced me to marry him.

431
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,780
You thought he could be useful to you.

432
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,240
He became a resource at your disposal.

433
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,240
Someone who could
help you hold your head high

434
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,510
and make you feel superior to others.

435
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,310
For your own benefit,

436
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,070
you're capable of anything,

437
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,320
never caring about what happens to others!

438
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,920
Now,

439
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,190
the real Muxin has returned,

440
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,950
and you want him to take the blame for me.

441
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,840
So you won't have to be

442
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,280
the mother of a murderer.

443
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,400
Look,

444
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,560
how amazing my mother is.

445
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,680
Having a mother like this,

446
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,550
who cares about me so much,

447
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,680
is truly my honor.

448
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,200
Let me tell you.

449
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,140
Muxin didn't kill anyone.

450
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
His eyes

451
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,510
were blinded by Hao Meili.

452
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Shi Yue is Hao Meili.

453
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,880
She was discovered

454
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,110
for that thing back then

455
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,440
and got scared to death.

456
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,310
He got involved in this mess

457
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,510
entirely because of me.

458
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,450
I will never let you use him,

459
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,510
never!

460
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
I don't deserve to be your daughter.

461
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,010
Don't contact me anymore.

462
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,720
[1994]

463
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,960
Do you really not know

464
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,030
what issues Tong

465
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,270
has with you?

466
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,680
I really don't know.

467
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,120
She said

468
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,150
you were different from before.

469
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,550
Understand?

470
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,470
You're not like

471
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,830
the Su Muxin from high school.

472
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,590
Mom, for saying this,

473
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,350
I don't understand.

474
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,900
I'm even more confused.

475
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,830
In 1986,

476
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,070
Su Muxin had an accident

477
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,130
and lost his sight in both eyes.

478
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,660
I've asked the doctor.

479
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,070
He said this kind of nerve damage

480
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,110
was impossible to recover from.

481
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,310
So that's the reason.

482
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,840
But science is so advanced now,

483
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,750
so you can't use this

484
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,070
to say I'm not Su Muxin,

485
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,880
right?

486
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,450
I didn't say you were not Su Muxin.

487
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,740
What I meant was...

488
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,110
You could have

489
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,370
done a better job impersonating him.

490
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,400
I have something for you.

491
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,200
I'm afraid that the physical evidence

492
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,600
is difficult to recover.

493
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,850
As for your father,

494
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,590
you don't need to worry too much.

495
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,860
If he cooperates,

496
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,580
the charges won't be too serious.

497
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,170
Let's go back to Chen's place now.

498
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,440
He said he had a relative
in the Northwest,

499
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,080
and it was all arranged.

500
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,680
We can go stay with them.

501
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,110
Okay.

502
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,790
Sweetie.

503
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:43,550
[1999]

504
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,840
Mommy misses you.

505
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,280
Will you come back to see Mommy?

506
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,070
Meili.

507
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,070
Meili.

508
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,310
Why don't you answer when I call you?

509
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,310
Meili, what's wrong?

510
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,290
Why did you lie to me?

511
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,750
This?

512
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,180
She may look impressive,

513
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
but she's just a housewife.

514
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,690
She's nowhere near as good as you.

515
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,400
Meili.

516
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,610
I've told you

517
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,160
not to call me Meili!

518
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,010
You gave up a good job abroad,

519
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,070
throwing away your promising future,

520
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,800
and came back to be...

521
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,370
I just wanted them to get divorced.

522
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,400
I never planned to be with him forever.

523
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,680
Shameless!

524
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:51,970
Mom,

525
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,860
what are you talking about?

526
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,660
I'm better now.

527
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,240
I won't try to kill myself again.

528
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,110
Here.

529
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,590
Here.

530
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,160
Sweetie.

531
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,260
You don't come to see Mommy.

532
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,060
You blame me because I'm useless,

533
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,720
right?

534
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,070
I'm sorry.

535
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,550
My sweet child.

536
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,680
This time,

537
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,200
I won't let her get away.
