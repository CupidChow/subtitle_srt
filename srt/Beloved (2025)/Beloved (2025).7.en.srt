105
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,070
he was being cautious
because he feared I might harm him.

166

On the 18th,

167
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,870
the property management
sent Qu Tong a text message,

168
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,130
notifying her about water tank
maintenance that evening.

169
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,600
Was there any special reason

170
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,860
for this maintenance?

171
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,180
Some residents have reported

172
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,750
that the water pressure
in their bathrooms is low

173
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,640
and the toilet refill is extremely slow.

174
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,750
So we suspect

175
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,960
there might be a blockage

176
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,320

or somewhere in the pipes.

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,840
do you notify the residents?

185
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,510

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,300
Goodbye.

194
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,890
Goodbye.

195
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,350
I understand.

196
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,390
So that means her accomplice,

197
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,000
Su Mufan,

198
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,230
disposed of the body together with her.

199
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,800
That's right.

200
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,630
Qu Tong.

201
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,080
Stop right there.

202
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,320
But Shi Muxian's appearance

203
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,650
disrupted their plans.

204
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,990
Qu Tong was taken to the police station.

205
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,510
So Su Mufan moved the body alone.

206
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,589
Can we take Qu Tong

207
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,589
into custody now?

208
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,240
Not yet.

209
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,510
Su Muxin's DNA test results

210
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,720
aren't back yet.

211
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,960
And the water tank was cleaned

212
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,790
on the 18th,

213
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,240
so all traces on the rooftop

214
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,440
have been destroyed
by maintenance workers.

215
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,569
We have no evidence.

216
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,400
So what do you plan to do?

217
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,109
We still need to start

218
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,550
with the body disposal site.

219
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,310
Last night I simulated

220
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,550
their body disposal route.

221
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,070
It must meet several conditions.

222
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,690
First,

223
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,830
it needs to start from Dongjiang

224
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,750
and end between Wangjiatuo

225
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,810
and another backwater bay upstream.

226
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,700
Second,

227
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,400
it needs to be relatively close

228
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
to Qu Tong's home.

229
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,880
The security guards
at Qu Tong's residential complex

230
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,240
start their break at midnight.

231
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,200
So during that time period,

232
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,030
there's no record
of vehicles entering or leaving.

233
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,440
The body was likely dumped

234
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,240
sometime between midnight

235
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,510
and dawn on the 19th.

236
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,550
Additionally,

237
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,480
it needs to completely avoid

238
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,400
all traffic surveillance cameras.

239
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,800
So locations meeting all these conditions

240
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,720
are only these four.

241
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,320
[Map of Yunzhou]

242
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,920
But there's one thing

243
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,400
I still can't figure out.

244
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,350
Based on the current river flow rate,

245
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,310
the body should have appeared

246
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,770
in Tangchuan Town between

247
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,790
Dongjiang and Yunzhou on the 20th.

248
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,350
Why did it appear in Yunzhou?

249
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,130
This is a backwater bay, right?

250
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,610
Is that upstream area Dongjiang?

251
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,350
Yes.

252
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,310
I haven't figured this out yet.

253
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,720
It's okay.

254
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,410
Let's try your approach first.

255
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,280
There might be

256
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,580
a breakthrough
at these four locations,

257
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,180
right?

258
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,490
Alright.

259
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,270
Then you and Li Siyi take the map

260
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,530
and coordinate with the Yunzhou police.

261
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,060
What about you?

the former village secretary
of Chen Village.

266
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,350
I'll go interview him

267
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,200
and see if I can find

268
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,000

269

is sort of my distant niece.

302
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,240
I remember,

303
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,510
back in 1966

304
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,360
when I just became the village secretary,

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,310
Li

306
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,000
married someone from the city.

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,590
her husband died.

309
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,280
Being a widow with a child,

310
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,790
she didn't have an easy life.

311
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,510
So

312
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,390

and a good student too.

00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,190
In those years, he was

322
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,400
our village's

323
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,110
first college student.

324
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,370

for his college education back then

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,000

In the summer of 1986,

336
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,210
Li did bring that child

337

back here.

338
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,190
That's when we found out

339
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,680
that Li had actually given birth

340
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,000
to a pair of twins.

341
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,400
Those two children

342
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,460
looked exactly alike.

It's just a pity

344
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,830
that Su Mufan

345
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,780

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,640
It seems

359
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,380
she was forced to drink it.

360
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,330

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,600
Erzhuang!

386
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,050
Take two men with you

387
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,550
and bring him back right now!

388
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,200
Got it!

389
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,920
You two, come with me!

390
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,450
Let's go!

391
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,090
I'm going to the clinic.

392
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:56,610
Okay.

393
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,490
Su Mufan!

394
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Stop right there!

395
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,200
Uncle.

396
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,800
You bastard!

397
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,020
What happened to Su Mufan afterward?

398
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,030
At first, everyone took turns
watching him.

399
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,480
But then the police said

400
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,240
that Li drank the pesticide herself,

401
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,410
so Su Mufan wasn't charged with murder.

402
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,160
A few days later,

403
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,720
everyone let their guard down

404
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,480
and didn't watch him closely enough.

405
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,440
Su Mufan

406
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,640
still managed to escape.

407
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,960
His brother said

408
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,960
he jumped into the river.

409
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,920
Found something!

410
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,830
Don't move!

411
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,420
Based on these drag marks,

412
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,640
it was right from here

413
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,830
that the body was dragged
and dumped into the river.

414
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,090
The grass over there has been flattened.

415
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,670
Mr. Zhang.

416
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,510
Your map

417
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,960
makes a lot of sense.

418
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,880
This must be where the body was dumped.

419
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,210
Alright.

420
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,000
I'll call the technical team

421
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,400
to secure the scene.

422
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,070
Good.

423
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
What did you find?

424
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,750
Found a set of footprints.

425
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,610
Leather shoes.

426
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,590
Size 42.

427
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,640
Based on the size and depth,

428
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,270
I'd say

429
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,160
the suspect

430
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,480
is about 180 cm in height,

431
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,140
weighing between 75 and 80 kg.

432
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,260
What else?

433
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,030
There's also a set of tire tracks.

434
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,930
The wheelbase is slightly wider

435
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,200
than a standard family car.

436
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,920
It's likely

437
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,320
a business-class sedan.

438
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,920
The tire treads are quite common.

439
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,480
We'll need to go back

440
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,280
to compare the results further.

441
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,070
Zhou Mi.

442
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,400
Come.

443
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,570
Perfect timing.

444
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,770
This is our eyewitness.

445
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,910
Hello.

446
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,000
Tell us,

447
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,040
what did you see?

448
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,200
I was just here

449
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,370
with my girlfriend

450
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,370
on a date that day.

451
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,080
Run! Run!

452
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,050
Hurry!

453
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,680
Luckily, he didn't chase

454
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,790
after us in his car.

455
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,410
What did the car look like?

456
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,510
It was too dark.

457
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,270
I could only tell

458
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,600
it was probably a sedan.

459
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,090
What brand?

460
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,660
Couldn't see clearly.

461
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,570
What about the man?

462
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,120
What did he look like?

463
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,960
I only saw he was wearing a raincoat

464
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,910
and had a hat on.

465
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,480
Couldn't see his face.

466
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,920
He was carrying a shovel. Really scary.

467
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,720
Exact time?

468
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,250
Just before 2:30.

469
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,540
How can you remember so precisely?

470
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,310
My girlfriend had bought

471
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,050
a train ticket for the next day

472
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,250
to go work elsewhere,

473
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,210
so we couldn't stay out too late
that night.

474
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,030
That's why I specifically checked
the time.

475
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,230
I'm certain about it.

476
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,830
Where was your girlfriend going?

477
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,490
Jiangyuan.

478
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,570
The 19th.

479
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,700
The train from Yunzhou to Jiangyuan.

480
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,240
No, that's not right.

481
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,040
She bought a ticket for the 18th.

482
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,940
So was it early morning on the 18th

483
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,670
or the 19th?

484
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,110
The 18th.

485
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,770
The body was likely dumped

486
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,480
sometime between midnight

487
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,920
and dawn on the 19th.

488
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,000
Zhou Mi.

489
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
What do you think?

490
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,270
The time of body disposal
doesn't match our deduction.

491
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,640
And Su Mufan is blind.

492
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,920
There must be a third person involved.

493
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,880
Chen.

494
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,320
Help me confirm something.

495
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,030
Is this cigarette butt

496
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,310
the same as the two

497
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,510
I collected earlier?

498
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,030
Yes, identical.

499
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,490
Even the brand is the same.

500
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,130
Xiaowei.

501
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,200
Why did you ask me
to collect this cigarette butt?

502
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,030
And where did you

503
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,760
get these two cigarette butts?

504
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,550
So according to what you're saying,

505
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,920
these cigarette butts are almost

506
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,520
certainly from Fu Wenjiang.

507
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,030
This kind of cigarette is imported,

508
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,560
hard to find and expensive.

509
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,070
Whether in Yunzhou

510
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,110
or Dongjiang,

511
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
I've never seen anyone smoke these.

512
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,920
This is the surveillance footage

513
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,310
from the secondhand phone store
on Hongmiao Street

514
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,200
from July 20th.

515
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,400
Based on our previous

516
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,670
investigation,

517
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:35,920
[South Counter]

518
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,750
Su Mufan had already lost

519
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,750
his sight due to injury

520
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,960
before his mother Chen Li

521
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
found him in 1986.

522
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,880
Look carefully here

523
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,530
at how he enters and exits.

524
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,270
[South Counter]

525
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,480
There's a hand guiding him

526
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,740
from outside the door.

527
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,070
This shows they're very familiar

528
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,260
with the surveillance blind spots,

529
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,270
[July 20th, 2020]

530
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,440
which means

531
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,140
they must have scoped out the place
beforehand.

532
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,330
He's now looking up at the camera,

533
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,200
[July 20th, 2020]

534
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,590
allowing us to see his face.

535
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,720
This is deliberate.

536
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,550
[July 20th, 2020]

537
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
I understand now.

538
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,270
He can't see.

539
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
In unfamiliar places,

540
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,480
he can't orient himself.

541
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,000
So he is...

542
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
He's a blind person.

543
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm more inclined to believe
he's Su Mufan,

544
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,480
not Su Muxin.

545
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,850
The hand outside the door

546
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,720
must belong to the third person
in this case.

547
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,650
Let's follow this line of thinking

548
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,000
to analyze the case.

549
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,920
According to the forensic autopsy,

550
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,720
Su Muxin

551
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,480
died on July 15th.

552
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,970
So on the morning of July 16th,

553
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,440
the suspect who left

554
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
Shi Yue's home

555
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,210
at Hesheng Street in Dongjiang

556
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,880
was Su Mufan.

557
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,930
The crime scene conditions
at Hesheng Street

558
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,110
actually point

559
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,510
to the suspect's unfamiliarity

560
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,830
with the place.

561
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,240
And it also explains

562
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,110
why the two of them

563
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,240
got into a conflict.

564
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,400
The crime scene at Shi Yue's case

565
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,200
also has many unusual aspects.

566
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,640
When the case details

567
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,880
weren't clear,

568
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,830
I was always confused

569
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,030
about the suspect committing the crime

570
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,350
while intoxicated.

571
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,270
If he was

572
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,160
pretending to be drunk,

573
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,110
why would he do that?

574
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,480
So there's

575
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,740
another possibility.

576
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
I understand now.

577
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,270
Su Mufan is blind.

578
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,480
He wanted to impersonate Su Muxin

579
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,920
without revealing any flaws.

580
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,960
The only way

581
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,880
was to use drunkenness as a cover,

582
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,750
to hide the fact

583
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,720
that his eyes couldn't see.

584
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,310
From

585
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,830
having security call him a taxi

586
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,680
to Shi Yue coming down

587
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,590
to meet him at Hesheng Street,

588
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,510
all of this

589
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,680
was to conceal the fact

590
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,640
that he was immobile.

591
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,400
Isn't that right, Captain Zhou?

592
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,810
So on the evening of the 15th,

593
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,920
the person who left

594
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,830
Oujin Garden

595
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,350
was already Su Mufan.

596
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,110
That means

597
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,070
Qu Tong and Su Muxin's home

598
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,880
is the primary crime scene

599
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,200
of Su Muxin's death.

600
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,640
Has Qu Tong and Su Muxin's home

601
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,350
been searched?

602
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,960
No.

603
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,030
There's insufficient evidence at present.

604
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,750
Before the DNA results come back,

605
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,070
the identity of the floating corpse
in Yunzhou

606
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,000
cannot be confirmed.

607
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,920
Everything is still
at the speculation stage.

608
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,480
But that doesn't mean

609
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,680
we can't do anything.

610
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,830
Based on our current chain of evidence,

611
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,640
I believe there are two

612
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
directions we can investigate.

613
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,750
First, how the body was

614
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,830
dumped in Yunzhou,

615
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,440
and who exactly did it.

616
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,150
According to eyewitness testimony,

617
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,790
the body was dumped

618
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,650
in the early morning of July 18th.

619
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,440
The person who dumped the body was male.

620
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,200
That day, my mentor and I

621
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,110
were following Qu Tong the whole time.

622
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,720
She had no time or opportunity,

623
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,110
and Su Mufan is blind,

624
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,920
so neither of them

625
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,310
could have dumped the body.

626
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,310
So identifying the third person
in this case

627
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,040
becomes extremely important.

628
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,890
Our technical team

629
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,780
has just matched the tire tracks.

630
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,750
The vehicle used to dump the body

631
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,410
is most likely a Toyota Camry.

632
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,590
It was probably manufactured

633
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,680
in 2000

634
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,270
or in 1999.

635
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,070
This is also an important breakthrough.

636
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,310
First, we need to check if Zhuo'er Company

637
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,400
has such a vehicle.

638
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,990
Second, we need to locate

639
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,400
Su Mufan and Qu Tong.

640
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,110
The Yunzhou team has informed us

641
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,790
that Qu Tong hasn't returned
to her parents' home.

642
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,430
She hasn't gone back to Oujin Garden
in Dongjiang either.

643
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,590
She seems to have disappeared.

644
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,400
It's also possible that both of them

645
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,350
are hiding together.

646
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,720
From all indications,

647
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,530
Su Mufan and Qu Tong

648
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,570
