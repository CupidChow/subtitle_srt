calling Fu Wenjiang three times.

I'll just take a cab and leave, okay?

176
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360

386
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,680
Are Qu Tong and Fu Wenjiang close?

387
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,010
Do they interact often?

388
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,080
What do you mean?

389
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,250
Just its literal meaning.

390
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,120
Please answer truthfully.

391
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,770
They don't interact much.

392
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,100
They're just acquaintances.

393
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,510
Do you know about Qu Tong

394
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,010
contacting Fu Wenjiang

395
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,070
last night?

396
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,110
No.

397
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,680
Shen Jing.

398
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,880
Today is July 25th.

399
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,750
And your son-in-law Su Muxin

400
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,680
has been missing

401
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,350
for ten days since July 16th.

402
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,290
Do you have any thoughts

403
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,400
about his whereabouts?

404
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,240
I thought he committed a crime

405
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,900
and fled to avoid punishment.

406
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,930
Isn't that what you implied

407
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,240
when you came to my house last time?

408
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,440
I've dealt with many families

409
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,240
of people involved in cases.

410
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,440
Some pressure us to solve the case.

411
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,700
Some claim innocence.

412
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,820
Some voluntarily provide leads.

413
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,510
Some obstruct the investigation.

414
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,680
Most of them will actively

415
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,750
contact the police

416
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,410
to learn more about the situation.

417
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
After the police come to their door,

418
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,790
few people are as calm

419
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,880
as you.

420
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,720
What do you

421
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,070
mean by that?

422
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,590
I just feel like

423
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,340
you don't seem very concerned

424
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,310
about his whereabouts.

425
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,110
I just don't want

426
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,750
to bother you police officers.

427
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,550
Besides,

428
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,790
he ran away.

429
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,960
Isn't that

430
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,240
your conclusion?

431
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,940
Based on our current investigation,

432
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,720
I believe

433
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,310
Su Muxin didn't flee.

434
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,440
He has been murdered.

435
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,310
Your daughter

436
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,310
is not only a major suspect,

437
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,750
but now

438
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,110
she seems to be in danger too.

439
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,770
What happened to my daughter?

440
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,000
Sorry.

441
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,640
This responder you dialed is powered off.

442
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,240
Sorry.

443
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,310
This responder you dialed is powered off.

444
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,000
Officer Zhou.

445
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,240
I don't know

446
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,470
how you came up with

447
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,320
such a ridiculous conclusion.

448
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,810
First you imply

449
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,510
she has a relationship with Fu Wenjiang.

450
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,660
Then you say

451
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,050
she killed Su Muxin.

452
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,370
Now she's missing.

453
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,270
Her phone is off.

454
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,790
Instead of looking for her,

455
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,450
why are you wasting time here?

456
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,880
We're going up the hill.

457
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,590
Right.

458
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,000
Buddy.

459
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,050
What do you want to say?

460
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,200
Buddy.

461
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,720
Your brother used to mention you
to me a lot.

462
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,350
I know you've lost your brother

463
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,200
and you're feeling bad about it.

464
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,200
How about I be your brother from now on?

465
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,790
From now on,

466
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,640
you're my brother.

467
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,830
I'll do whatever you ask.

468
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,790
Just tell me what to do.

469
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,510
Please don't hurt me, okay?

470
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,450
I'll give you one last chance.

471
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,480
Let me ask you something.

472
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,940
Brother, go ahead and ask.

473
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,030
That brand of cigarettes you smoke,

474
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,020
besides you,

475
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,920
who else smokes them?

476
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,560
Cigarettes?

477
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,920
Those cigarettes belong
to Qu Tong's father,

478
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,310
your brother's father-in-law,

479
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,000
you know?

480
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,400
He smokes those cigarettes.

481
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,550
He did business

482
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,440
in Guangdong years ago.

483
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,920
He got a taste for them there.

484
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,880
Those cigarettes are hard to find.

485
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,680
I had someone bring them for him.

486
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,320
I figured it was on the company tab,

487
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,670
so I might as well take some for myself.

488
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,640
I didn't know you liked them too.

489
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,280
I could have gotten you some.

490
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,760
How about I get some for you too?

491
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,200
No! I'll tell you!

492
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,530
I'll tell you the truth!

493
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,720
Qu Tong definitely knows

494
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,880
what cigarettes her father smokes.

495
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,280
Don't you even know that?

496
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,720
She's so close to you

497
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,050
and she didn't tell you?

498
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,720
Are you...

499
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,570
Stop it! That hurts!

500
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,440
When you see the police,

501
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,550
do you know what to say?

502
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,240
I know!

503
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,420
Your blackmailing

504
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,120
led to this kidnapping.

505
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,990
Don't say anything stupid

506
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,130
and land yourself in jail.

507
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,950
I understand.

508
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,790
Remember

509
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,200
your car is at the bottom of the hill,

510
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,130
by the roadside.

511
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,440
You don't need to say anything else.

512
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
You're a good man.

513
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,680
Don't rush.

514
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,750

518
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,880
You even left me a knife.

519

How can I cut off the rope?

522
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,350
It can't be Muxin.

523
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,130

00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,610
What about you?

577
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,280
I didn't either.

578
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,510
Do you believe me?

579
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,860
[Harmony]

580
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,720
Shen Jing.

581
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,070
Do you know Su Mufan?

582
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,440
I don't know him.

583
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,450
I'm just curious.

584
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,920
This name

585
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,270
seems to be related with Su Muxin.

586
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,310
Oh, it's you two officers!

587
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,210
Do you need something from me?

588
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,880
[Fu Wenjiang went back to the hotel.]

589
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,290
[Also, the vehicle recipient is Qu Lijun.]

590
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,680
Officer Zhou.

591
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,440
You seem quite busy.

592
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,220
Let me walk you out.

593
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,780
No need to rush off.

594
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,530
I actually have one more question for you.

595
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,510
What is it?

596
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,790
Zhuo'er Jewelry owns

597
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,000
a Toyota Camry.

598
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,030
Qu Lijun is using it now, right?

599
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,960
Where's the car?

600
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,560
I don't know.

601
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,110
Where's Qu Lijun?

602
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,480
He went out.

603
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,970
On the evening of July 17th,

604
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,550
where did Qu Lijun go,

605
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,750
and what was he doing?

606
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
I don't remember.

607
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,790
Fine.

608
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,000
No problem.

609
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,030
We'll find out.

610
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Please take care.

611
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,210
Sorry for the disturbance.

612
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,030
Hello.

613
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,360
Why haven't you left yet?

614
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,880
Isn't your flight at 1:10?

615
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,990
The flight is delayed.

616
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,970
The police just came to the house,

617
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,030
looking for you.

618
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,440
You need to leave now.

619
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,620
I got it. Don't worry,

620
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm about to board.

621
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,590
Alright.

622
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,400
Officer.

623
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,920
How many more times
do you want me to say it?

624
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,960
I've already told you

625
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,360
my phone died yesterday.

626
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,950
Do you think I'm psychic?

627
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,350
How was I supposed to know
the police were looking for me?

628
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,010
Where did you stay last night?

629
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,440
You didn't go back to the hotel?

630
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,900
I drank too much yesterday

631
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,890
and slept in the car.

632
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,250
Don't move.

633
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,720
What happened

634
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,090
to your wrist?

635
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,270
This was from

636
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,310
playing games with

637
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,030
my girlfriend yesterday.

638
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,070
What?

639
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,000
It's a personal preference.

640
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,880
I enjoy it.

641
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,400
It's legal, isn't it?

642
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,400
What's your girlfriend's name?

643
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,660
Tell me so I can verify.

644
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,890
That's private,

645
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,720
you know?

646
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,640
Did you take

647
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,940
these photos?

648
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,580
Officer.

649
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,010
Did you have a search warrant?

650
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,070
What gave you the right to search my bag?

651
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,470
Do you know where you are?

652
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,890
Watch yourself.

653
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,390
Can you answer the question now?

654
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,660
Come on,

655
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,680
tell us.

656
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,850
What's going on

657
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,960
with your company's

658
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,640
vehicle requisition records?

659
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,440
Why did you
have the administrative manager

660
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,400
alter them

661
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,270
and

662
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,200
hide the originals secretly?

663
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,920
I do whatever my boss

664
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
tells me to do.

665
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,750
Which boss?

666
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,160
Qu Lijun,

667
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,360
the founder of Zhuo'er.

668
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,160
When was the last time

669
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,440
you saw Qu Lijun?

670
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,270
The day before yesterday.

671
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,240
Where do you think Qu Lijun

672
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
might have gone?

673
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,130
I don't know.

674
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,610
Fu Wenjiang, right?

675
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,920
I'm Zhou Mi.

676
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,560
Fu Wenjiang.

677
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,850
This is our captain.

678
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,410
The boss, right?

679
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,390
Good timing you're here.

680
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,070
[Personal Information]

681
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,730
I've already said everything

682
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,280
so many times.

683
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,909
If there's nothing else,

684
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,150
I'll be going now.

685
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,880
Sit down.

686
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,510
Don't rush.

687
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,830
Let's chat a bit more.

688
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,760
We have

689
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,710
some information about you.

690
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,320
You're diligent at work,

691
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,880
claiming you don't even know
how to play cards.

692
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,989
But in reality,

693
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,300
few people know

694
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,770
that you're a gambler.

695
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,150
The stock market was turbulent in 1999.

696
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,000
You lost all

697
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,880
your money.

698
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,710
In 2000, you started following

699
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,030
your stock trading friends

700
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,440
and went to a private casino

701
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,770
in Dongjiang to gamble.

702
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,750
At first, you won quite a bit,

703
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,650
but later you lost everything.

704
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,340
And now you still owe the house
over 100,000.

705
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,590
Am I right?

706
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,480
That's completely fabricated.

707
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,800
Regarding your gambling activities,

708
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,510
our colleagues in Dongjiang

709
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,670
have evidence.

710
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,320
The administrative punishment

711
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,650
is unavoidable for you.

712
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,710
If you cooperate

713
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,030
with our police investigation

714
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,320
and voluntarily contribute,

715
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,450
it will benefit you.

716
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,800
Stay seated.

717
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,080
You still owe over 100,000.

718
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,620
It's hard to pay back on just your salary,

719
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,440
isn't it?

720
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,980
With the photos

721
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,450
and the vehicle requisition records,

722
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,230
what are you trying to do?

723
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,960
Let me think.

724
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,150
What's it called again?

725
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,920
Blackmail.

726
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,260
To blackmail someone!

727
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,220
You're talking nonsense!

728
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,590
Do you have any evidence?

729
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,520
Why don't you think about it again?

730
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,490
You talk to him.

731
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,150
Captain!

732
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,230
Sit down.

733
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,210
Please sit.

734
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,000
If you sit, I'll sit too.

735
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,590
Sit down!

736
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,000
Talk!

737
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,670
It's not that I can't talk.

738
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,410
I just don't know

739
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,480
where to

740
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,400
begin.

741
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,510
I just don't want to waste

742
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,440
your time,

743
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,590
right?

744
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,480
The most important thing is

745
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,150
your attitude is really great.

746
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,880
Just because of your attitude,

747
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,150
I'll tell you everything,

748
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,400
whether I should or shouldn't.

749
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,070
Okay?

750
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,670
But where

751
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,630
should I start from?

752
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,430
Just say whatever comes to mind.

753
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,570
Mr. Qu originally arranged
to meet me today.

754
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,630
What did he want from you?

755
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,360
He probably wanted

756
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,290
the vehicle requisition records.

757
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,110
Where was he going to meet you?

758
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,840
At the hotel.

759
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,480
He knows I'm staying there.
