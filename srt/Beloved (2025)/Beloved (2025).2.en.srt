There's high vehicle turnover.

194
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,390
Then Su Muxin probably

195
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,390
didn't take a bus.

196
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes.

197
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,270
It seems

198
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,670
highly likely now.

199
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,020
We've checked all four buses,

200
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,380
and no one saw Su Muxin.

201
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,390
It must be Su Muxin's diversion tactic.

202
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,480
He probably left

203
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,670
by car from that parking lot.

204
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,470
I understand.

205
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,370

You think Su Muxin is still in Yunzhou?

Qu Tong disappeared

for two hours this afternoon.

210
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,910
She and Su Muxin are both from Yunzhou.

211
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,550
So,

212
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,600
Qu Tong returned to Yunzhou

213
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,330
specifically to meet Su Muxin?

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,510
It's very likely.

215
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,510
