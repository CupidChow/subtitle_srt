00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If the environment were as you said,

195
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,640
there should be no trace.

196
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,440
I see.

197
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,480
Okay.

198
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,120
Also,

199
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,120
we found

200
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,000
a wool glove.

201
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
It's from the right hand.

202
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,120
I wonder

203
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,790
if there is a connection.

204
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,600
It belongs to Shi Muxian.

205
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,160
She did go there.

206
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,920
It matches Chen Shuncai's testimony.

207
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,250
Let him go first.

208
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,420
Get someone to keep an eye on him.

209
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,020
[Mentor is sad.
Come back and persuade her.]

210
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,860
But even if

211
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,270
Shi Muxian did come here,

212
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,200
that wouldn't

213
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,950
confirm that

214
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,290
Qu Tong was dead.

215
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,390
After all, we have to see the corpse.

216
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,870
How about this? In a few days,

217
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,670
we'll go back here and check out.

218
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,120
Take it easy first, okay?

219
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,400
Besides,

220
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,720
Zhou Mi,

221
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,470
I think,

222
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,760
don't blame yourself too much.

223
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,750
Her death wasn't

224
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,250
your fault.

225
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,280
Don't always...

226
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,980
Follow me closely.

227
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,680
Follow me closely.

228
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,110
This is fun.

229
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,050
Watch out for rocks.

230
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,940
Watch out for rocks.

231
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,570
This way.

232
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,000
This way.

233
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,840
There are no rocks here.

234
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,550
There are no rocks here.

235
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,610
I'm a bad guy.

236
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,840
I did something very bad.

237
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,280
I don't deserve to be your brother.

238
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,110
Thank you.

239
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,040
You're welcome.

240
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,400
Mentor.

241
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,830
We've been searching all night.

242
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,710
Eat something.

243
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,550
Our way

244
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,390
is to find a needle in a haystack.

245
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,750
That grey van

246
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,550
probably has a fake license plate.

247
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,550
Moreover, Su Muxin

248
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,830

He'll avoid

251
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,960
those road surveillance cameras.

252
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,620
It's normal that it can't be found
at the moment.

253
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,200
Mentor,

254
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,860
you can't starve all the time.

255
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,130
Mr. Zhang told me...

256
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,020
Stop it.

257
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,660
-Have a bite.
-Shut up.

258
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,460
I won't eat either.

259
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,350
Hello.

260
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,020
Who went there?

261
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,720
I'll be right there.

262
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,830
Let's go.

[Reception Room]

All night,

265
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,010
you didn't answer your parents' calls

266
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,710
or our calls.

267
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,010
Where have you been?

268
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,490
I was sitting by the river.

269
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,120
I didn't go anywhere.

270
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,720
Did you drive

271
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,750
to send Xue Xiaowei away yesterday?

272
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,490
Yes.

273
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,180
Where did you send him?

274
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,420
He hid

275
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,310
in the dormitory building

276
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,000
of Eastside Abandoned Machinery Factory.

277

Yes.

I thought about it all night.

291
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,540
I decided to come to you.

292
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,220
Besides Xue Xiaowei's whereabouts,

293
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,400
I have

294

something more important.

I'm sure.

named Su Muxin

302
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,200

But you know what?

310
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,350
Before 1986,

311
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,790
I was the real Su Muxin.

313
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,190
pushed me into the river,

almost killed me,

315
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,830
and took my place.

who made me blind

is a designer of Zhuo'er Jewelry.

319
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,770
Her name is Shi Yue.

320
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,030
She and my twin brother

321
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,510

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,590
I can't let it go.

324
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,310
So later, I planned

325
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,510
to kill them.

326
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,250
Now both of them

327
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,680

You're lying.

331
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,920
Why should I remember

332
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,680
these lies?

333
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,940
I'm telling the truth.

334
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,080
That's impossible.

I'm really a murderer.

He always pretended

339
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,490
he didn't care.

340
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,500
He never talked about the past.

341
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,960
But he hates

342
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,490
the two people who hurt him.

343
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,310
At the beginning of July,

344
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,640
he was ready.

345
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,110
He was ready to take action.

346
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,430
He told my mom and me

347
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,540
that he wanted to find a relative

348
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,650
to live a good life.

349
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,320
After a few days, he came back.

350
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,000
I was worried
that he would do something bad.

351
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,200
So I kept an eye on him.

352
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,350
He couldn't see.

353
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,270
He just didn't notice

354
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,670
that I was in the room too.

355
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,920
I saw him

356
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,000
hiding something.

357
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,440
What is it?

358
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,310
I didn't see it clearly.

359
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,440
Where did he hide it?

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,680
Under the bed.

I heard it.

363
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,000
A woman named Qu Tong came to our house.

364
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,080
She was very angry.

365
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,500
She held a knife to herself

366
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,400
and forced my mom

367
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,790

00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,110
Then the two of them

370
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,750
quarreled in the room.

371
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,110
I heard a lot.

372
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,110
They said
that my brother killed two people

373
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,000
and even wanted to frame Qu Tong.

374
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,340
So Qu Tong was very angry.

375
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,640
She... she couldn't make it clear.

376
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
She could only be used by my brother.

377

00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,400
Yes.

387
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,160
Thank you.

388
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:06,910
[Dongjiang City Yunzhou County
Public Security Bureau]

389
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:18,880
Captain.

390
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,480
You're not wearing a police uniform.
Why are you saluting?

391
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,210
Captain Gao.

392
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,440
Serve our comrades.

393
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,240
Captain.

394
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,460
Tell us about the situation.

395
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,160
Based on the current evidence,

396
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,680
the cases of Shi Yue's death

397
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,810
and Su Muxin's death

398
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,160
both point to one suspect

399
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,920
called Xue Xiaowei.

400
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,680
Xue Xiaowei

401
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,030
was called Su Muxin before.

402
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,590
And the General Manager

403
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,480
of Zhuo'er Jewelry, Su Muxin,

404
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,680
was his twin brother.

405
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,490
Also,

406
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,920
according to Chen Shuncai,

407
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,020
on July 26th,

408
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,400
Qu Tong was pushed into the river

409
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,200
by Shi Muxian,

410
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,240
probably dead.

411
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,070
July 27th,

412
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,830
the next day,

413
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,920
Shi Muxian committed suicide at home.

414
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,550
According to the physical evidence,

415
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,280
his confession should be true.

416
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,960
Also,

417
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,720
we did find out the sodium cyanide

418
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,510
at Xue’s massage in South 3 Street.

419
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,270
The suspect's fingerprint is on it.

420
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,740
The suspect, Xue Xiaowei,

421
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,740
or Su Muxin,

422
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,090
is still running away.

423
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,350
Have you found any clues after he left

424
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,110
the dorm room of Machinery Factory?

425
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,350
Not yet.

426
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,880
Did he leave Yunzhou?

427
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,370
Probably in Yunzhou.

428
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,440
Every road in Yunzhou

429
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,160
has been

430
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,160
set up.

431
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,210
Captain Gao,

432
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
according to the procedures,

433
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,110
should we

434
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,270
release an official wanted notice?

435
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,130
Get the people to help us find him.

436
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,690
Captain Gao,

437
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,000
I think

438
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,860
that at this time, we'll alert him

439
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,360
by releasing the wanted,

440
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,270
so that he won't dare to show up.

441
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,130
Think about it.

442
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,200
If he wants to escape from Yunzhou,

443
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,400
he will definitely move.

444
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,350
He is also blind.

445
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,400
Qu Tong is gone.

446
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,920
He needs help.

447
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,270
You mean he might

448
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,910
contact the massage parlor?

449
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,510
Mentor.

450
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,580
I request to return to Dongjiang.

451
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,750
Dongjiang Detention Center

452
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,630
called me,

453
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,510
saying Qu Lijun is on a hunger strike.

454
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,720
He wants to
see Shen Jing as soon as possible.

455
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,750
I want to go back

456
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,940
and let him see her.

457
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,890
Does Qu Lijun have

458
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,410
anything hidden?

459
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,590
I feel something is off

460
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,530
about him and his wife.

461
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,640
But I don't know

462
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
what exactly it is.

463
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,830
You don't know.
And you wanna go back to Dongjiang?

464
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,360
There...

465
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,550
there are a lot of things here.

466
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,480
Who's in charge?

467
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,270
Me?

468
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,930
I take care of it?

469
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,410
The case is clear now.

470
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,830
The chain of evidence is complete.

471
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,290
I think Mr. Zhang can do it.

472
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,640
Come on.

473
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,440
Tell me

474
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,160
why it's clear.

475
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,880
According to Xue Xiaoling's statement,

476
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,800
Su Muxin killed two people

477
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,750
on purpose

478
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,750
and threatened

479
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,080
and used Qu Tong's help.

480
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,240
All these years,

481
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,070
he has been waiting for

482
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,110
the time for revenge.

483
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,200
Qu Tong is dead now.

484
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,310
He doesn’t care about her death.

485
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,680
I just want to know...

486
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,590
Do you believe it?

487
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,790
Do you?

488
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,270
Now,

489
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,570
this is what the evidence tells us.

490
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,370
When did you learn

491
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,240
to only look at evidence?

492
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,590
You were not like this

493
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,920
about Su Muxin.

494
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,340
The death of Shi Muxian and Qu Tong

495
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,000
disproved all

496
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,010
your judgments.

497
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,840
You were shocked.

498
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,750
And you just want to escape.

499
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,440
Am... am I right?

500
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,640
Well,

501
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,360
forget the evidence.

502
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,200
I just want to know

503
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,350
your real thoughts.

504
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,510
I think

505
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,790
these two cases shows

506
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,830
contradictory

507
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,090
suspect personality.

508
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,600
But this can't be evidence.

509
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,610
I don't understand.

510
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,930
I don't know.

511
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,600
Then find out the truth

512
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,360
so that it can make sense.

513
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:02,960
Mentor.

514
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,070
Let me finish.

515
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,880
Whether Xue Xiaowei killed them or not...

516
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,920
We need to control him

517
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,180
before we know, right?

518
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,100
Dongjiang Detention Center.

519
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,140
Send someone you trust there.

520
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,130
You stay

521
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,770
and host the arrest.

522
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,970
Wu Dong could be the one.

523
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,110
Wu Dong...

524
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,020
Yeah.

525
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,160
It hasn't been long

526
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,220
for him being here,

527
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,810
and he's improved a lot.

528
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,420
You've improved, too.

529
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,240
By the way,

530
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,830
Second Detachment wants him.

531
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,480
No.

532
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,440
He belongs to our detachment.

533
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,100
They can't just transfer him.

534
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,960
I didn't say I would.

535
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,730
There's a telephone booth.

536
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,840
Watch the stairs.

537
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,110
Lift your leg.

538
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,060
We're here.

539
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,550
Qu Tong,

540
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
can I borrow

541
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,830
your 200,000 yuan?

542
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,790
I know.

543
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,360
Who are you looking for now?

544
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,900
The people you know

545
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,500
are under the police's eyes.

546
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,790
Trust me.

547
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,510
Okay.

548
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,590
I can't see.

549
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,110
Go to that place

550
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,240
and guard for me.

551
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,590
Okay.

552
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,960
Watch the steps.

553
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,790
Xiaoling.

554
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
Don't be nervous.

555
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,410
It might not be him.

556
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,650
But if it was him,

557
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,160
just talk normally.

558
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,440
We talked about it before.

559
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,370
Do you remember?

560
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,070
I do.

561
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:51,870
Answer it.

562
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,750
Hello?

563
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,190
Xiaoling, it's me.

564
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:11,350
Brother.

565
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,870
Are you alone at home?

566
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,530
No one else is here.

567
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:29,980
That's good.

568
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,230
When I call you,

569
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,980
if our family were here,

570
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,210
you should answer me honestly.

571
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,960
If there were an outsider beside you,

572
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,030
you should just say,

573
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,190
"No one else is here."

574
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,179
No one else is here.

575
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,360
No one else...

576
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,100
If I were wanted,

577
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,489
you should just say,

578
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,520
"Brother,

579
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,030
come back."

580
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,080
Come back.

581
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,630
If I were not wanted,

582
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,280
you should just say,

583
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,070
"Brother,

584
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,480
where are you?"

585
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,190
Brother,

586
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
where are you?

587
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,320
I can't

588
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,050
tell you now.

589
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,080
Xiaoling.

590
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,160
Thank you for trusting me

591
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,460
and for helping me.

592
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,280
I left some money

593
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,690
at Big Brother's place.

594
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,590
I left in a hurry.

595
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,070
I didn't arrange it well.

596
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,750
You have the key to his place.

597
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,050
Take it out for me tonight.

598
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,160
I'll go find you.

599
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,600
I'm leaving Yunzhou.

600
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,710
I've arranged everything.

601
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,000
I need the money now.

602
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,960
I think

603
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,480
we're going to be apart

604
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,340
for a long time.

605
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,460
Uncle has a waist problem.

606
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,340
In the past,

607
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,890
I used to give him
moxibustion every day.

608
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,670
You should learn acupoints

609
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,840
and give him the treatment.

610
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,700
Don’t break it.

611
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,090
Tell Aunt,

612
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,190
don't be reluctant to spend money.

613
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,440
Be good to yourself.

614
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,880
Don't be mad at me.

615
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,590
It's not worth it.

616
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,490
And you.

617
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,680
After learning the guitar,

618
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,510
you just become a singer.

619
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,320
and dress up

620
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,280
every day.

621
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,690
Although I can't see it,

622
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,040
I can

623
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,120
imagine it.

624
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,240
You must be very beautiful.

625
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,550
I... I'm sorry.

626
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,070
I owe you a lot.

627
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,940
If there is a chance in this life,

628
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
I'll pay you back.

629
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,430
Xiaoling.

630
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,670
Don't cry.

631
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,920
Don't be sad.

632
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,450
You still have things to do.

633
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,110
Listen to me.

634
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,690
At 10 p.m.,

635
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,160
we'll meet at Big Brother's place.

636
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,220
When you meet me,

637
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,360
be careful

638
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,600
and avoid the police.

639
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,310
Remember.

640
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,440
Be good.

641
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,370
Why did you hang up?

642
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,980
I forgot!

643
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,400
I forgot! What's wrong?

644
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,550
I don't want him to be like this.

645
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,400
I don't want him to be like this!

646
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,070
I regret it!

647
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,070
I quit.

648
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,800
What happened?

649
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,920
I quit!

650
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,150
What's going on?

651
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,200
What happened?

652
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,150
All right.

653
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,430
Quit. Quit. Quit.

654
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,320
What are you doing?

655
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,840
All right. Let's quit.

656
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,140
Leave now.

657
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,140
I'm sorry.

658
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,840
I...

659
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,020
didn't mean that.

660
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,220
I'm not blaming her.

661
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,110
Mr. Zhang.

662
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,760
Okay, don't cry.

663
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,710
Xiaoling.

664
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,640
What you did won't hurt him.

665
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,640
It'll only help him.

666
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,440
We, the police,

667
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,610
appreciate your cooperation.

668
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,070
Have you found the phone's location?

669
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,230
It's a public phone.

670
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,120
It's

671
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,320
the magnetic card phone
in the old town in the eastern suburbs.

672
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,050
We're going.

673
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,150
Send me the location.

674
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,680
Let's go.

675
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,000
I request

676
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,910
to control the main streets

677
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,800
around this booth

678
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,500
and sieve each street.

679
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,670
The population density
of the old town is high.

680
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,670
Don't act too much.

681
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,960
Don't disturb the crowd.

682
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,590
Yes, sir.

683
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:43,510
[Dongjiang Detention Center]
[CCTV Report Center]

684
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,800
Qu Lijun, sit here.

685
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,260
Yes.

686
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,130
Officer Zhou said...

687
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,830
We only have 20 minutes.

688
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,410
If you have anything to say,

689
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,960
just say it.

690
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,230
How is our family?

691
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,230
I know

692
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,440
you are always strong.

693
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,810
Even if something happened

694
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,290
in the family,

695
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,360
you wouldn't

696
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,880
tell me the truth.

697
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,710
Right?

698
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,960
Jing.

699
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,930
I like to call you that.

700
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,200
But you don't like it.

701
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,890
You don't want to be that Jing anymore.

702
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,310
You wanted to get rid of everything
in the past.

703
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,670
That's why

704
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,880
you married me.

705
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,120
I remember,

706
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,800
that time,

707
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,440
I followed

708
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,500
our movie screencast

709
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,880
to your production team

710
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,780
to play a movie.

711
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,360
I liked you

712
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,960
at first sight.

713
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,280
I knew you didn't like me.

714
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,150
You married me

715
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,310
because you were desperate.

716
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,400
I knew you didn't plan

717
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,760
to live with me forever.

718
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,070
But I didn't mind at that time.

719
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,920
I just thought

720
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,480
as long as

721
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,810
I devoted myself to you,

722
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,830
one day,

723
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,800
we would be happy together.

724
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,110
Rabbit.

725
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,800
likes radish.

726
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,960
I think the meat is good,

727
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,550
so I fed it meat.

728
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,150
The rabbit didn't eat well.

729
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,140
It felt awkward

730
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,510
and never truly happy.

731
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,760
Jing,

732
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,510
I've never grown radish

733
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,710
in my life.

734
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,760
I'm sorry.

735
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:48,840
Sorry.

736
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,480
Rabbit?

737
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,920
But then again,

738
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,720
this rabbit

739
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,260
didn't

740
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,000
leave this nest.

741
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:05,710
Right?

742
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,440
It didn't plan to leave.

743
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,440
You should thank me.

744
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,930
Our baby.

745
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,640
From the day she was born,

746
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,840
you've been thinking of

747
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,520
giving her all the love

748
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,150
you didn't have.

749
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,370
You were so strict with her.

750
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,450
Others didn't understand,

751
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,030
and Tong didn't.

752
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,280
But I knew

753
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,400
that you've put all your hope

754
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,440
on your child.

755
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,640
I firmly believe

756
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,040
you love her

757
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,710
more than yourself.

758
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,400
You can protect her,

759
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,510
right?

760
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,150
[2002, 14:15]

761
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,370
Protect...

762
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:37,450
Hello, Mentor.

763
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,550
It's done?

764
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,440
Yes.

765
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,190
What did they say?

766
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,540
I didn't hear anything special.

767
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,080
I think

768
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,280
Qu Lijun wanted to say goodbye.

769
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,890
He has been recalling

770
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,590
his feelings for Shen Jing.
