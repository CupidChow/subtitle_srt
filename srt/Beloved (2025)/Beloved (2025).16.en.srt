Yes, we do.

not to destroy the evidence,

198
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,300

209

that the wine was indeed
brought by Su Mufan

00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,660
moved to another province.

426
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,990
They called you, right?

I know.

428
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,470
Sun Qiaofang wanted to pick you up,

437
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,190
asked me to help first.

438
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,500
Thank you, Officer Zhou.

439

Officer Zhou has other matters.

456
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,810
But it doesn't matter.

457
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,290
From now on, I'll be with you.

458
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:17,910
For a lifetime?

Who's bold enough

460
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,640
to make that promise?

461
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,220
