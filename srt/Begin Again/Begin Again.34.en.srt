[Episode 34]

4
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,390
A proposal?

5
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,320
Right.

6
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,240
What do you think if it's public?

7
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,400
Is it touching? Is it romantic?

8
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,550
Let me think about it.

9
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,350
Proposing in public…

10
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,520
One proposes

11
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,950
in front of a crowd.

12
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,320
He must kneel on one knee,

13
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,960
hand the ring

14
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,790
and say loads of cheesy lines.

15
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,000
The crowd would cheer for them

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,110
and say,

17
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,740
"Marry him, marry him!"

18
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,710
What does it have to do with them?

19
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,990
It's none of their businesses.

20
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,200
Marriage is supposed to be

21
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,840
an important decision

22
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,480
made by two people

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,070
after thinking rationally.

24
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,040
When did it

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,880
become a fancy show?

26
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,160
Proposing in public

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,550
is using the pressure from the crowd

28
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,430
to force the other one to say yes.

29
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,000
It's too arrogant to be romantic.

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,040
It's just for show.

31
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,630
Are these people enough?

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,400
Who else can I invite?

33
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,670
Give it another thought.

34
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,430
Both parties are willing.

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,880
Think about it,

36
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,280
the grass,

37
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,710
the balloons,

38
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,840
the curtains.

39
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,320
And...

40
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,640
And…

41
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,350
Candles.

42
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,390
Candles.

43
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,230
In a dark room,

44
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,600
candles are arranged

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,990
in the shape of a heart.

46
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,960
So are the balloons.

47
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,870
Right!

48
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,950
The rose petals should be arranged

49
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,030
in the shape of heart, as well.

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,760
That's so cheesy.

51

[Daily special offers! A special gift for your loved one at 26.66 yuan!]

52
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,870
So people

53
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,190
need these for a proposal.

54
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,870
These are not important.

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,079
What's important is

56
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,600
the love behind the surprise.

57
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,470
That's important, of course,

58
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,230
but it's bad that

59
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,510
the surprise turns into a shock.

60
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,760
There's a man

61
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,150
who hid the ring

62
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,520
in a piece of cake for the proposal.

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
But his girlfriend swallowed the ring

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,390
while eating the cake.

65
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,990
If the ring's stuck in her windpipe,

66
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,240
it will be such a tragedy.

67
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,320
Another guy

68
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,720
in his wound.

70
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,560
Then he went to

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,630
his girlfriend who's a nurse

72
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,560
to get it out.

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,920
Just picture it.

74
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,440
His girlfriend picked the ring out of

75
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,550
the bloody wound

76
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,390

How could he do this?

83
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,310
How creative.

85

What?

86
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,240
Wait,

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,280

88

89

Where is the food?

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,080

with you two?

94
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,990
Why are you asking me so many things

95

96

-She has a proposal scene!
-She writes about a proposal!

99

101

That came out of nowhere.

102
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,510
Not to mention they gave strange answers.

103
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,480
They specifically asked me

104
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,790
about proposals…

105
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,870
And Ling Rui…

106

Didn't I say yes ages ago?

109
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,680
It's a waste of money.

What should I do?

111

About what? Let me see it.

115

It's for the hospital.

116
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,910
It's very boring.

Let me have a look.

118

There's nothing to see. Let it go.

-Don't be so stingy!
-I told you.

121

It's nothing.

122
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,720
Just forget it.

Trust me.

124

You're overreacting.

Are you messaging someone?

126
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,630
No. Who would I message anyone?

127
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,550

00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,360
at the head.

179
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,230
Give HR a call.

180
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,350
They can handle the rest.

181
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,760
Fire him, fined him, and make it a public announcement.

182
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,760
Do it now.

183
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,950
Don't make me repeat myself.

184
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,120
Yes, Mr. Gao.

185
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,190
Those jerks.

186
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,630
How dare they hurt my delicate arm!

187
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,880
Fortunately, justice is never late.

188
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,750
They are finally arrested.

189
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,659
What's wrong?

190
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,480
They've got caught.

191
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,630
Why do you still look upset?

192
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,950
I'm happy.

193
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,390
And someone else

194
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,590
is going to pay for his medical bill.

195
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,870
It doesn't count as work injuries.

196
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,790
I know you're mean with your words.

197
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,040
You still care about me, right?

198
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,640
That's enough. I don't care.

199
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,560
You're worried about my arm, right?

200
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,000
Come on.

201
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,270
My arm!

202
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,480
This is the precious arm

However,

208

I think you got the wrong guy.

209
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,240
I can confront him as I please.

210

00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,960
I didn't know

215
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,480
you were such a lousy person

216
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,320
who would resort to petty tricks.

217
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,990
Do you think

218
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,830
you're the most pitiful

219
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,590
and the greatest person alive?

220
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,430
Is that why you think

221
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,190
we must play along

222
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,640
with your overdramatic story?

223
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,880
I've warmed some milk for you.

224
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,840
Drink it.

225
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,680
Thank you.

226
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,760
That's all?

227
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,030
What's wrong?

228
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,280
The problems are all solved.

229
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,960
The park is ready for businesses.

230
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,470
Don't worry about it.

231
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,590
Have some rest.

232
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,240
I just think

233
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,990
I've wronged him.

234
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,040
When did you ever regret

235
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,230
scolding others?

236
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,150
I don't

237
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,120
regret it at all!

238
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,990
What I said when I scolded him

239
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,750
was all reasonable.

240
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,320
You know that.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,150
I might have been

242
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,280
a little harsh on him.

243
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,710
But essentially, I wasn't wrong.

244
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,280
You're so naughty.

245
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,670
What was that for?

246
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,400
Stopping you from overthinking.

247
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,750
Especially from

248
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,150
thinking about another man.

249
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,960
You consider Gao Erfan a man?

-And now?
-No. No.

It's useless to think about him.

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,990
Why should I do what he asks?

353
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:48,110
♫ The rose petals have a potent fragrance ♫

354
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,810
♫ I don't mind walking on the streets alone ♫

355
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:07,220
♫ The movies are always full of disappointment and farewells ♫

356
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:15,069
♫ But who will watch them with me ♫

357
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,260
♫ Slowly, we get closer ♫

358
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,000
♫ I like you ♫

359
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,710
♫ Only you ♫

360
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,450
♫ You're my one and only ♫

361
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:37,670
♫ Tonight, I'll let my mind wander ♫

362
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,600
[Will the rain ever stop?]

363
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,640
[Is she coming?]

364
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,600
[What if she can't find me?]

365
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,160
[No.]

366
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,660
♫ I want to travel to Paris and Tokyo, and eat chocolate by the sea ♫

367
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,980
♫ As long as I'm with you ♫

368
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:30,340
♫ We can lie on the beach and count the stars ♫

369
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:39,150
♫ I like you because you put up with me ♫

370
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,500
♫ My unyielding stubbornness ♫

371
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,280
♫ It's all because of you ♫

372
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,870
Why're you standing in the rain?

373
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,750
I was afraid you couldn't find me.

374
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,070
How long have you been waiting?

375
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,110
Not that long.

376
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,070
You arrived soon after me.

377
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,190
This is for you.

378
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,200
I realized

379
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,520
I've never given you any flowers.

380
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,920
But sadly,

381
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,880
they are drenched now.

382
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,520
[Is this]

383
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,750
[part of his trick?]

384
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,350
You don't like it?

385
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,960
Why are you giving me flowers?

386
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,350
It's been six years.

387
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,510
You helped me realize

388
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,320
one can't have love

389
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,790
without working hard for it.

390
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,910
I didn't deserve

391
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,670
your love

392
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,870
six years ago.

393
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,150
Six years have passed,

394
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,710
I still don't deserve

395
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,880
your greatness.

396
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,270
Therefore,

397
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,400
I want to give it another try.

398
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,350
Siyu,

399
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,360
I like you.

400
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,720
Please be my girlfriend.

401
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,920
It's raining again.

402
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,600
Hello, I'm here to

403
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,440
pick up the cake I ordered.

404
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,030
Okay, just a minute.

405
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,680
What are you doing here?

406
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,960
It's you?

407
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,640
Did you order the cake?

408
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,480
Yes.

409
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,990
We've ordered

410
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,470
the same cake, right?

411
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,160
There're so many bakeries on this street,

412
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,190
but we picked the same one.

413
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,880
Fate has brought us together.

414
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,270
Very well.

415
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,710
The cake is for Lu Fangning anyway.

416
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,750
It doesn't matter who got it.

417
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,120
I'll leave it to you. I must go now.

418
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,310
Wait!

419
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,920
I haven't seen you in days.

420
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,510
Why are you leaving so soon?

421
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,440
Well,

422
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,080
I have to buy so many things

423
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,520
for Ling Rui.

424
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,800
Time is running out.

425
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,270
Then let me go with you.

426
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,510
Well.

427
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,680
You don't have to do this.

428
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,160
We should

429
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,030
shop separately.

430
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,750
No.

431
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,830
I won't let

432
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,630
Lu Fangning's birthday party

433
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,840
become a disaster.

434
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,190
It can't be that bad.

435
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,640
Well, not all hopes are lost.

436
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,720
At least you have a good eye for cakes.

437
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,470
Your sense of aesthetic

438
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,880
is pretty impressive.

439
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,830
I've seen her in some ads!

440
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,110
Who's the man next to her?

441
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,150
Her boyfriend?

442
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,670
What's wrong?

443
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,200
Let's go now.

444
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,360
So why did you turn me down?

445
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,920
Where are we going?

446
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,310
-Let's go.
-Shall we go to…

447
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,270
We didn't pick up the cake.

448
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,400
Pick it up later.

449
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,510
Goodness.

450
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,150
Luckily, no one took pictures of us.

451
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,400
You should be more careful next time.

452
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,680
-Be careful of what?
-Take it.

453
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,400
Come here.

454
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,200
No.

455
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,230
I just told you about this.

456
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,470
Are you coming or not?

457
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,310
I won't use it if you won't.

458
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,080
Come on. Cover yourself.

459
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,440
Stay under it.

460
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,350
What do you think?

461
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,270
Do you feel the love in the air?

462
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,000
Your heart is beating so fast.

463
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,150
Pingping,

464
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,950
the rain stopped.

465
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,030
Pingping, that was uncalled for.

466
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:49,920
Right?

467
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,110
You...

468
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,160
You have a bright future

469
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,030
in your career.

470
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,910
Dating an ordinary guy

471
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,790
will only get you

472
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,960
into troubles.

473
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,680
I'm not afraid of trouble.

474
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,720
There's not a relationship

475
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,910
without troubles.

476
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,680
Besides,

477
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,920
I don't mind at all.

478
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:11,870
Pingping,

479
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,120
let's not see each other again.

480
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,440
Since we can't be friends,

481
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,630
allow me

482
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,430
to be a fan,

483
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,200
and you can carry on with your career.

484
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,470
My feelings for you are

485
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,560
nothing more than

486
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,120
a fan's admiration.

487
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,480
Bye.

488
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,030
I'm still so beautiful.

489
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,560
Thank you.

490
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,910
You're welcome.

491
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,070
You're gorgeous.

492
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,320
You heard it outside.

493
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,440
You don't need these compliments.

494
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,390
You're beautiful

495
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,670
all the time.

496
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,560
I think so too.

497
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,960
What are you laughing about?

498
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,150
It just occurred to me

499
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,510
that you've done something

500
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,680
I've always

501
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,600
wanted to do

502
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
but never succeeded.

503
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,840
Good.

504
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,760
It's a great start for today.

505
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,990
What else

506
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,150
have you not realized?

507
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,590
Are you willing to

508
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,560
play along with my requests?

509
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,670
It's enough.

510
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,600
I was just joking.

511
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,150
You're still the same.

512
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,270
You lack the courage to do what you want.

513
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,640
I had enough courage

514
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,430
to make you my man.

515
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,400
That's enough.

516
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
Stop it.

517
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,800
I must go to work.

518
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,270
I'll play with you later.

519
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,920
Our store is opening soon.

520
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,710
I don't know

521
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,510
what kind of mess

522
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,920
Shen Zhuo might cause over there.

523
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,430
No.

524
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,790
You can't go to work today.

525
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,880
Let's go to the theme park.

526
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,080
[That was a little sudden.]

527
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,280
[Is he going to

528
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,270
[propose to me there?]

529
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,200
Sure.

530
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,040
Then let me check

531
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,160
if Youyou is ready.

532
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,670
Is Youyou coming with us?

533
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,040
Sure.

534
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,950
Youyou has never gone

535
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,200
to a theme park with us.

536
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,990
He will be very happy.

537
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:09,870
What's wrong?

538
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,990
Sure. Let's go.

539
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,270
Make it lower.

540
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,400
Lower.

541
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,230
Well, lower more.

542
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,390
It's not level.

543
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,310
Now?

544
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,710
Can you handle it or not?

545
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,830
Do I know…

546
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,240
Do it yourself if you're so great.

547
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,670
Why don't you do it?

548
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,710
I just told you

549
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,680
not to be rude to others.

550
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,280
Do you want me

551
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,230
to give your arm a twist?

552
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,560
You were barely

553
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,000
useful.

554
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,150
But you won't stop nagging

555
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,560
now that we have no use for you.

556
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,670
Well?

557
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,040
Shut up.

558
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,110
Hello, Dr. Peng.

559
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,400
Hello, Ms. Tang.

560
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,030
I'll set up the candles.

561
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,520
Welcome!

562
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,440
Sir, Madam, you're back.

563
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,350
You got here early.

564
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,630
Right. Yiyao has

565
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,710
picked us up at the airport.

566
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,000
We came here right away.

567
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,960
Where's Lu Fangyu?

568
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,070
He's waiting for the luggage.

569
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,790
Where's Youyou?

570
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,360
Where's my sweet Youyou?

571
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,670
He's out with Fangning

572
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,680
and Ling Rui.

573
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,760
They'll be back soon.

574
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,230
Take your time,

575
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,680
I must pick up my girlfriend.

576
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,720
Your girlfriend?

577
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,520
Sir, Madam, have a look.

578
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,280
You could tell me

579
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,400
if there's any problem.

580
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,350
Everything's fine.

581
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,150
I have to take a look.

582
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,360
Who hung this?

583
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,830
The balloon is flaccid.

584
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,000
Take it down.

585
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,480
Move this aside.

586
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,470
Okay, okay.

587
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,950
Yang Yi, it already looks great.

588
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,520
Young man,

589
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,030
don't lift the can.

590
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,590
It would be very dangerous if you drop the can.

591
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,630
Leave it to me.

592
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,830
Tang Ping, you…

593
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,400
Here, come and have a look.

594
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,670
This is too wrinkly.

595
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,070
Yang Yi.

596
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,350
Just leave it to them.

597
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,760
Let me do it.

598
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,310
Don't just stand there.

599
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,440
Come here and give us a hand.

600
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,270
Our in-laws are here!

601
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,230
Auntie!

602
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,320
Long time no see.

603
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,910
Long time no see.

604
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,880
You've become prettier.

605
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,600
I miss you so much.

606
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,120
In-laws.

607
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,080
Right.

608
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,560
What are you saying?

609
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,910
What are you doing?

610
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,080
Good.

611
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,000
Show some manner. They're our in-laws.

612
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,720
Hello, in-laws.

613
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,440
Hello, in-laws.

614
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,750
It's been years.

615
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,470
You're so beautiful now.

616
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,600
Your skin looks great.

617
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,640
Look at me.

618
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,710
I have freckles on my face.

619
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,680
She got it from the beaches.

620
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,270
What products do you use?

621
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,270
It's a secret.

622
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:30,830
Well,

623
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,110
let's take a break inside.

624
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,480
Leave the work to them.

625
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,230
-Right.
-Carry on with the work.

626
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,440
Don't listen to her.

627
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,430
Follow your plans.

628
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,710
Okay.

629
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,080
Let's get working.

630
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,230
Why aren't you working?

631
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:43,830
Carry on.

632
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,550
You're always so bossy.

633
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,160
Pingping.

634
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,990
What took you so long?

635
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,880
Is Fangning here?

636
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,630
Not yet.

637
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,600
So why are you so worried?

638
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,920
There are so many things to do.

639
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,270
What took you so long?

640
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,550
Why should I tell you?

641
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,360
Hand it over.

642
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,030
The flowers.

643
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,280
I forgot about you.

644
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,200
Can you manage? Let me help you.

645
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,520
No, I can handle it.

646
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,360
Okay then.

647
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,510
Come on, quickly.

648
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,640
Make haste.

649
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,280
You two.

650
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,360
Idiot.

651
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,550
Your girlfriend doesn't know you.

652
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,240
President.

653
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,630
Hold it yourself.

654
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,150
Give me a hand.

655
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,910
Hold it yourself.

656
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,390
Get that here.

657
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,320
Move it there.

658
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,240
Okay.

659
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,670
Here you are.

660
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,190
Be careful with it.

661
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,760
Hang it there.

662
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,630
Enough.

663
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,550
You can be sweet when you're home.

664
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,270
Can't you do it yourself?

665
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,230
Your waist…

666
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,990
Good for you.

667
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,670
Can you not make it so ugly?

668
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,310
I…

669
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,350
Everything is boring

670
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,190
when you're around.

671
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,240
Coming.

672
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,000
It's super beautiful.

673
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,790
Put it on.

674
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,950
It's so pretty.

675
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,800
I bought the cake.

676
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,710
I bought it.

677
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,150
I bought it.

678
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,910
They're back!

679
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,320
-They're coming!
-Coming.

680
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,190
What should we do?

681
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,370
-What should we do?
-What should we do?

682
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,280
-What should we do?
-What should we do?

683
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,230
-What should we do?
-What should we do?

684
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,170
I'm asking you. What should we do?

685
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,070
-What should we do?
-What should we do?

686
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,880
Turn the lights off.

687
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,040
Turn the lights off.

688
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Dad.

689
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,920
Did you have fun today?

690
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,160
Yes.

691
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,000
Really?

692
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,520
They are coming.

693
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,760
If you don't have so many snacks,

694
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,510
we will

695
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,600
take you to the theme park again, okay?

696
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,280
-It's Youyou's voice.
-Right.

697
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,520
Nothing happened when Youyou's around.

698
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,510
Just as I expected.

699
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,400
This is…

700
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,990
What a coincidence.

701
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,960
Someone else is

702
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,870
celebrating their birthday here today.

703
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,230
Who did all this?

704
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,630
I have no idea.

705
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,550
Let's have a look then.

706
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,990
Sure. Let's have a look.

707
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,350
Come on. Let's have a look.

708
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,590
[It's so dark.]

709
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,870
[He has really changed.]

710
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,240
[He even knows to surprise me.]

711
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,920
Why are we hiding?

712
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,560
We could have just waited for them there.

713
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,040
Why are we standing here?

714
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,310
Turn the lights on.

715
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,200
Lights on.

716
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,520
Lights on.

717
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,470
Lights on.

718
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,110
Lights on.

719
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,760
Lights on.

720
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,480
Lights on.

721
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,590
You just asked me to turn the lights off,

722
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,840
not to turn it on.

723
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,720
-What?
-Oh, come on!

724
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,280
You turned the lights off.

725
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,200
Of course, you should turn it on.

726
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,880
What are you doing?

727
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,030
How could I turn the lights on?

728
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,830
Who knows?

729
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,830
Only you know.

730
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,640
How could I know?

731
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,640
Just send someone

732
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,320
to go turn the light on.

733
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,560
Where's the switch?

734
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,640
-Don't move.
-Who's been moving?

735
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,520
-Who's under the table?
-It's okay.

736
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,640
Slow down.

737
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,150
What's happening?

738
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,720
The table is moving!

739
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,160
What are they doing?

740
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,600
Don't move.

741
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,790
Don't move.

742
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,390
Get out.

743
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,440
Come on.

744
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:09,790
You…

745
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,750
How did you fit in there?

746
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,219
Why were you hiding under the table?

747
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,139
This is your fault.

748
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:20,989
What?

749
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:21,610
Did you spill it?

750
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,199
Yeah.

751
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,070
Sorry.

752
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,960
Let's go.

753
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,590
Come on. Let's go.

754
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,760
What does it have to do with me?

755
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Someone grabbed

756
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,949
my arm just now.

757
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,909
Was it you?

758
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,960
It hurt so much.

759
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,389
Fangning.

760
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,219
I planned this

761
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,949
myself.

762
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,920
I asked them to celebrate your birthday.

763
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,139
I didn't expect this to happen.

764
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,790
It's all your fault.

765
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,370
Wait? How it is my fault?

766
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,790
Mum, Happy Birthday!

767
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,510
Happy Birthday!

768
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,590
Happy Birthday!

769
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,000
-Happy Birthday!
-Sister!

770
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,550
Happy Birthday!

771
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,910
I can finally say this.

772
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:19,920
Happy Birthday!

773
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,910
Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday!

774
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,480
You're so noisy.

775
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,710
Thank you.

776
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,760
What are you doing?

777
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,440
You haven't said anything.

778
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,870
Happy Birthday!

779
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,870
Happy Birthday!

780
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,800
Happy Birthday, Fangning.

781
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,100
Happy Birthday!

782
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,060
-Happy Birthday!
-Thank you.

783
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,240
Thank you.

784
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,320
Mom.

785
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,320
Thank you.

786
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,040
Thank you for all.

787
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,880
It's nothing.

788
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,200
Happy birthday!

789
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,830
Mom, Aunt.

790
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,790
Thank you.

791
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,230
Happy Birthday.

792
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,280
Happy Birthday.

793
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,080
Thank you.

794
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,990
Okay, okay.

795
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,110
People are watching.

796
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,190
Go ahead.

797
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,040
It's okay.

798
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Happy Birthday.

799
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,880
Happy Birthday.

800
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,320
You knew it, didn't you?

801
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,790
We did it.

802
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,910
But you found out anyway.

803
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,120
You are

804
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,840
very observant.

805
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,910
Thank you.

806
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,110
Have you prepared

807
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,040
more of these things?

808
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,600
Sure.

809
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,640
That's a relief.

810
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,520
Start cleaning up now.

811
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,320
Sure. Let's go.

812
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Come on, this way.

813
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,080
Thank you.

814
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,760
Mom.

815
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,590
Wonderful.

816
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,680
There is only one cake.

817
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,550
It's okay.

818
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,390
Come on.

819
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,990
This is…

820
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,320
It's amazing.

821
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:43,950
Is it pretty?

822
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,720
Of course.

823
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,600

What are you doing here?

837
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,120
Long time no see.

838
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,750

841

I invited him.

Thank you for coming.

843
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,320
Happy Birthday.

844
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,430
Where's my gift?

845
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,790
I forgot.

846
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,920
How could you forget the present?

847
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,890
-Yeah.
-How could you forget the present?

848
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,500
How could you forget?

849
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,440
How could you forget?

850
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,180
How could you forget?

851
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,060
I'm sorry.

852
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,050
Forget the present...

853
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,150
Hit him.

854
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,990
Okay, that's enough.

855
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,200
Stop it.

856
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,840
Come here.

857
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,080
Dismiss!

858
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,520
Just kidding.

859
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,670
Come on, let's continue.

860
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,400
One more friend.

861
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,990
Come on.

862
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,480
Who's that?

863
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,120
He's a good friend of mine.

864
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,710
Who's he?

865
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,640
Mr. Lu.

866
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,830
Okay, let's continue.

867
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,590
Change it.

868
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,510
We ran out of candles.

869
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,710

Mom.

875
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,240
Make a wish.

876
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,230
Make a wish.

877
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,600
Thank you.

878
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,220
♫ The rose petals have a potent fragrance ♫

879
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,310
Get lost. Dance if you want.

880
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,720
Go now.

881
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,000
Hurry.

882
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:05,330
♫ I don't mind walking on the streets alone ♫

883
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:13,180
♫ The movies are always full of disappointment and farewells ♫

884
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,370
♫ Slowly, we get closer ♫

885
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,360
Are you alright?

886
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,560
I didn't mean it.

887
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:22,870
I'm okay.

888
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,600
♫ I like you ♫

889
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:35,860
♫ Tonight, I'll let my mind wander ♫

890
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,230
♫ Tonight is the night ♫
