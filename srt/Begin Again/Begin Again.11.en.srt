[Episode 11]

4
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,990
Don't catch a cold.

5
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,229
To be honest,

6
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,000
this is much better.

7
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,880
Are you not going to sleep?

8
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,310
I'm in so much pain,

9
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,550
how can I fall asleep?

10
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,670
How are you supposed to fall asleep

11
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,950
when you are looking at me like that?

12
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,350
How about...

13
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,190
you sing to me?

14
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,030
Okay?

15
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,230
You're not a kid anymore.

16
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,190
Why do you need others to sing to you?

17
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,390
Since you like kids so much,

18
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,840
you're surely good at singing

19
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,880
children's songs,

20
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,560
lullaby or something like that.

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,510
Just sing a few lines.

22
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,430
I don't sing.

23
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,270
Just a few lines, come on.

24
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,750
I don't sing.

25
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,920
Sleep now.

26
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,000
Then you must sing out of tune.

27
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,040
Fine,

28
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,190
I won't put you on the spot.

29
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,680
Read me a book, then?

30
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,829
There's one beside you,

31
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,310
the one on the top.

32
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,310
Read it to me,

33
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,070
I'm sure I'll fall asleep soon.

34
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,310
That's where I stopped.

35
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,829
The upbringing of a newborn.

36
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,270
Go ahead.

37
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,910
Lu Fangning,

38
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,550
why do you

39
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,870
want a kid so much?

40
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,670
Right.

41
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,150
Why?

42
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,230
Kids...

43
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,270
are troublesome

44
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,550
and annoying.

45
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,550
But,

46
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,950
I don't know.

47
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,310
Maybe it's because

48
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,670
I've lived alone for so long.

49
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,390
Sometimes, I think that

50
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,390
if I come back to an empty house

51
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,270
and there's a kid

52
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,390
with snot and tears on his face,

53
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,830
crying and shouting,

54
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,510
"Mom, Mom".

55
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,269
Life would be pretty interesting.

56
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,750
If you are not reading to me,

57
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,230
can I sleep in your arms?

58
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,790
I'll be asleep in a minute

59
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,150
with your smell.

60
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,470
It hurts suddenly.

61
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,310
Holding my arm works, too.

62
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,110
Fine if you don't want to.

63
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,790
I'm not picky.

64
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,580
Just sleep.

65
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,390
Why do you

66
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,470
want a kid so much?

67
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,070
Maybe it's because

68
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,430
I've lived alone for so long.

69
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,230
Sometimes, I think that

70
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,430
if I come back to an empty house

71
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,150
and there's a kid

72
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,110
with snot and tears over his face,

73
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,590
crying and shouting,

74
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,230
"Mom, Mom".

75
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,020
Life would be pretty interesting.

76
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,350
Life is full of obstacles.

77
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,230
It was such a great opportunity.

78
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,590
He even hugged me.

79
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,230
The atmosphere was just right.

80
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,790
I could at least try,

81
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,180
but my period came.

82
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,510
Morning.

83
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,350
Morning.

84
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,430
I made you breakfast.

85
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,470
Help yourself.

86
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,150
Thank you.

87
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,270
Well...

88
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,270
You don't have to watch me eat.

89
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,900
You can go to work.

90
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,630
It'll take me a long time to finish.

91
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,830
After you finished your breakfast,

92
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,990
I'd like to talk to you about something.

93
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,340
All right, I'm not going to eat.

94
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,860
Go ahead, you're going to say it anyway.

95
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,630
In any case,

96
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,710
I won't agree if it's about

97
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,790
getting a divorce or breaking up.

98
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,630
Back then,

99
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,710
-the thing failed...
-Sorry.

100
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,830
Why...

101
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,470
Why are you apologizing all of a sudden?

102
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,750
Back when

103
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,909
we were in the amusement park,

104
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,550
I actually had a good time.

105
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,260
However, this happiness

106
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,900
came from something wrong,

107
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,550
so I got angry with you.

108
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,940
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,830
If you hadn't told me, I didn't even know

110
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,910
you were angry.

111
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,260
You can be angry.

112
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,470
You can tell me off.

113
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,310
I'm not that vulnerable.

114
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,180
Besides,

115
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,470
I've thought it through.

116
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,310
I shouldn't have judged you arbitrarily that

117
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,670
you were not qualified to have a child.

118
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,299
Maybe you're more suitable than anyone else

119
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,419
to have a child

120
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,750
and be a good mother.

121
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,460
But that's not

122
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,700
in my life plan.

123
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,510
The shooting stars are splendid,

124
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,510
but they do not last long.

125
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,510
If that's what you're really

126
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,540
getting married for,

127
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,060
I don't think I am

128
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,190
the right person.

129
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,060
So,

130
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,550
I think it would be better for us

131
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,790
to call off the engagement.

132
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,620
I'm willing to bear

133
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,940
all of the consequences.

134
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,230
I disagree.

135
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,740
What if I insist?

136
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,060
I don't want a baby.

137
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,990
You don't have to do this.

138
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,190
I know what I'm saying now

139
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,230
will make you think I'm lying to you.

140
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,700
But to tell you the truth,

141
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,390
I didn't marry you

142
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,950
just because I want a kid.

143
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,990
I also want to promote

144
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,990
Infinity.

145
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,780
Now, the brand

146
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,470
is not officially launched yet.

147
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,020
If we got divorced,

148
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,830
Lu Wenbin will not

149
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,590
let me off,

150
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,430
let alone the others.

151
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,710
Keeping me from making money,

152
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,190
that's the worst thing ever.

153
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,300
Besides,

154
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,710
I can have a baby after a year.

155
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,180
My previous behaviors

156
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,430
have caused you trouble,

157
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,630
I'm so sorry.

158
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,540
Starting from today,

159
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,460
we'll formally continue

160
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,700
our relationship within the contract.

161
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,580
By the way,

162
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,100
remember to come home early tonight.

163
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,430
Don't let them get suspicious.

164
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,500
I got him, right?

165
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
He must have bought my words.

166
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,510
I pretended to be so pure-hearted.

167
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,140
Right. Just make him stay for now.

168
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,350
Lu Fangning, you did a great job.

169
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,420
You acted well.

170
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,900
As long as he stays,

171
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,710
you'll definitely get to have a baby.

172
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,500
Money will come as well.

173
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,580
Ling Rui,

174
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,390
you can't get away.

[dolls bring a sense of security]

177
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:25,980
[and ease loneliness.]

178
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,180
[Let it stay with you.]

179
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,660
[I went to work.]

180
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,940
[See you at home tonight.]

181
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,260
To ease loneliness

182
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,550
and bring a sense of security?

183
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,700
What's the point of having a bear doll?

184
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,070
I need to order an adult edition.

185
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,940
Let me see.

186
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,630
Pingping,

187
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,780
what's wrong?

188
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,260
I'm heartbroken.

189
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,660
You drank all of these?

190
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,550
The pool.

191
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,780
You...

192
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,180
This could bring out the mood.

193
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,990
Dad,

194
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,900
I'm heartbroken.

195
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,380
I feel so terrible.

196
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,580
How about this?

197
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,620
Think about it.

198
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,700
How are you

199
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,380
better than Fangning?

200
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,420
Let's turn the feeling of heartbreak

201
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,310
into motivation for life.

202
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,100
How's that?

203
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,180
Better than Lu Fangning?

204
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,980
Yes.

205
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,190
For example,

206
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:02,980
work,

207
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,870
studies,

208
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,100
hobbies,

209
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,780
and...

210
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,180
It seems like there's nothing

211
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,540
you can compare with her.

212
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,940
Dad!

213
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,340
Okay, okay.

214
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,380
It's my bad.

215
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,860
I was wrong. I...

216
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,100
It's my fault.

217
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,670
Pingping.

218
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,940
Pingping.

219
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,420
Dad,

220
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,980
I want to learn to dance.

221
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,020
Good, maintain your posture.

222
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,420
Raise your hands steadily.

223
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,340
Yazhi,

224
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,540
I thought you have enjoyed

225
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,190
your ballet classes with us.

226
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,620
With your own experience,

227
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,020
you may be able to attract more students.

228
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,900
That's why I agreed

229
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,300
to hire you

230
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,340
as our course consultant.

231
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,460
But for the past few days, your...

232
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,140
your attire...

233
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,140
This is genuine.

234
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,340
It's from my nephew's wife.

235
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,270
She's particularly wealthy.

236
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,420
It's not fake.

237
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,660
That's the problem.

238
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,780
Think about this.

239
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,420
When people come to us for inquiries

240
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,700
and they saw you dressed up

241
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,900
in luxury brands.

242
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,380
They may think that

243
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,460
we overcharge our students.

244
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,020
Look.

245
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,780
Up until now,

246
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,850
you haven't closed a deal yet, have you?

247
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,700
Headmaster,

248
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,260
I don't think

249
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,420
this is about my attire.

250
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:23,940
Hi.

251
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,980
Hi, I'd like to ask about

252
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,380
the dance lessons here.

253
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:26,740
Okay.

254
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,940
-I'll get back to work.
-Please wait a moment.

255
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,260
Hi, there.

256
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,700
I'm the course consultant here.

257
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,250
Which courses

258
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,180
would you like to know more about?

259
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,540
Miss,

260
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,130
you look very familiar.

261
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,420
Have we met somewhere before?

262
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,740
It's...

263
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,100
Are you a fan of mine?

264
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,500
I'll give you my autograph later.

265
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,500
You're a celebrity?

266
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,140
She's a celebrity.

267
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,380
No, not yet.

268
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,740
I'm just a little famous.

269
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,490
Your dress...

270
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,460
The latest collection.

271
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,140
It's authentic.

272
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,100
But it... Well...

273
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,500
It had a discount.

274
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,660
I choose here.

275
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,140
You'd like to register for a membership?

276
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,770
Even a saleswoman

277
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,380
wears famous brands from top to toe.

278
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,020
That means this is a high-class institution

279
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,380
with a good taste.

280
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,580
It's just right for me.

281
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,940
Ms. Tang,

282
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,210
we have various

283
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,220
kinds of courses here.

284
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,380
Ballroom dancing,

285
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,140
samba,

286
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,860
rumba,

287
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,100
Latin dance,

288
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,980
ballet, belly dance...

289
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,660
I want the one that

290
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,730
looks particularly elegant,

291
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,100
graceful

292
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,540
and difficult.

293
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,020
The kind that few people can learn.

294
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,300
You don't have it here?

295
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,540
Ballet?

296
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,060
Ballet?

297
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,450
The most expensive class.

298
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,770
I see.

299
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,780
You must think that

300
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,690
I have long hands and feet.

301
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,620
Even my neck as well.

302
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,010
Just like a graceful white swan.

303
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,020
Am I right?

304
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,980
That's what my dad always says about me.

305
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,940
Yes, yes, Ms. Tang.

306
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,819
Don't call me Ms. Tang.

307
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,900
Too polite.

308
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,859
Can I call you

309
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,020
Tangtang?

310
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,940
Tangtang instead of Pingping.

311
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,940
I like you so much.

312
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,619
What's your name?

313
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,690
My surname is Ling.

314
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,060
Ling?

315
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,380
I like you more now.

316
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,900
Ms. Tang, no, Tangtang.

317
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,780
You're making me feel shy.

318
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,730
We have a times card,

319
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,180
monthly card, quarterly card, and annual card.

320
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,100
VIP cards as well.

321
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,700
Would you like to

322
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,740
go for a trial class first?

323
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,980
Just get me an annual card.

324
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,180
The VIP card, the most expensive one.

325
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,300
I like you, too!

326
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,820
Me too!

327
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,890
By the way,

328
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,570
I've asked the Design Dept to

329
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,410
try to adjust

330
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,890
the production technique of the main series.

331
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,930
The outcome should be out

332
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,900
in a few days.

333
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,020
All right.

334
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,980
I have an appointment.

335
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,300
You may go first.

336
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,090
Don't drink too much.

337
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
What are you looking at?

338
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,890
Nothing.

339
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,050
How is the partnership

340
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,460
between Ms. Qin and Deer Sing?

341
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,460
I'll take care of that.

342
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,940
I'm busy. I have to go now.

343
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,700
[Who would dare touch his woman?]

344
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,890
What is making you so happy?

345
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,580
The company's financial statements.

346
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,220
Earlier on,

347
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,700
I ran into Simon downstairs.

348
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,180
He came back with me.

349
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,500
He's busy so he left.

350
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,970
By the way,

351
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,220
Ms. Qin said that

352
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,010
she and Lu Yiyao went on a blind date.

353
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,980
You were there as well.

354
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,730
Why did you ask?

355
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,220
Nothing, I'm curious.

356
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,340
How should I put it?

357
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,660
It's not like I was there

358
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,210
when they went on a blind date.

359
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,210
To be precise,

360
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,180
I was present

361
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,690
when Simon went on

362
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,700
all of his blind dates.

363
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,620
I was still young at that time.

364
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,170
My dad was busy with his business.

365
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,460
He left me with my uncle.

366
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,380
But my uncle

367
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,380
was not any older than me.

368
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,770
He was busy with his company

369
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,850
and he had to take care of me.

370
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,940
He had no time to date

371
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,620
so he had to go to these blind dates.

372
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,540
If I hadn't helped him

373
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,820
deal with those girls

374
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,970
on his blind dates,

375
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,370
Simon would have

376
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,020
suffered a lot more.

377
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,970
He really listens to you.

378
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,380
How do I put it?

379
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,980
Sometimes,

380
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,060
only a woman

381
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,460
can see a woman better.

382
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,450
If I don't like the girl,

383
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,780
Simon won't like her, either.

384
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,050
What about you?

385
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,370
Do you like him?

386
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,850
Of course.

387
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,220
I prefer the way Simon looks after me

388
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,410
than that of my dad.

389
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:25,900
Back then,

390
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,210
he even took me to have a drink.

391
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,410
I think...

392
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,610
What's the matter?

393
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,490
I think we've lived here

394
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,860
long enough.

395
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,890
Let's move back to the apartment tomorrow.

396
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,330
It's kind of like

397
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,460
resuming our contract.

398
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,500
A new start.

399
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,460
Really?

400
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,010
You don't want to?

401
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,170
I...

402
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,410
I don't mind

403
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,620
if we are moving or not.

404
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,170
Well then...

405
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,610
Okay. Let's do that.

406
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,860
I'll pack my stuff

407
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,930
and tell my dad about it.

408
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,580
Newlyweds.

409
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,020
Only us two.

410
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,180
Should I see them off?

411
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,100
Should I not?

412
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,370
I should.

413
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,010
Why can't they stay here?

414
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,130
If you live here, I'll feed you

415
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,410
and you don't have to pay the rent.

416
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,890
Did we bother both of you?

417
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,410
I should not.

418
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,300
I should.

419
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
Should not.

420
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,180
It's a good idea for you to go back there.

421
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,010
It's more convenient for you two.

422
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,650
Hurry up.

423
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,490
I'll be waiting for your good news.

424
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,370
Thank you, Aunt Yang. I hope the same, too.

425
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,610
Well...

426
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,450
Where's Mr. Lu?

427
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,330
Where's your dad?

428
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,690
How would I know?

429
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,490
I'll check on him.

430
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,490
Take care.

431
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,300
Okay.

432
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,570
Come back and eat with us sometimes.

433
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,770
Fangning,

434
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,210
remember to come home more often.

435
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,260
Fangning,

436
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,450
take care of yourself.

437
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:15,780
Don't worry.

438
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,130
I had been living alone

439
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,370
over the years.

440
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,810
And now she has me.

441
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,580
I'll take good care of Fangning.

442
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,290
Where's she?

443
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,170
-What?
-Where's she?

444
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,010
Fangning?

445
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,130
She left a while ago.

446
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,330
They left?

447
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,090
What a nice weather.

448
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:02,690
Aunt Gao,

449
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,210
please get the quilts to air them out.

450
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,140
Wait, wait.

451
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,580
Wait.

452
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,330
Am I that unreasonable?

453
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,330
No, no.

454
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,820
The old saying is right.

455
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,340
A grown girl can't be kept at home.

456
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,130
If you insist on keeping her,

457
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,010
she'll come to hate you.

458
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,490
That's right.

459
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,970
Go in. What are you thinking about?

460
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,530
"The CEO and Her Doctor."

461
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,210
A sweet holiday.

462
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,770
It's just a book title.

463
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,850
My recent hobby.

464
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,050
It was an unintentional situation

465
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,450
the last few times

466
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,530
you came to my house.

467
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,450
My house is usually

468
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,690
this clean and tidy.

469
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,850
I cleaned it the day before yesterday.

470
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,090
Really?

471
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,700
When you came the day before yesterday,

472
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,180
don't you think that

473
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,770
there was not much cleaning to be done?

474
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,210
It was pretty much the same as now, right?

475
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,610
I'll put the luggage away.

476
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,580
What are you doing?

477
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,890
Are you really sleeping in the guest room?

478
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,330
Where else then?

479
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,970
No.

480
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,340
If we have guests

481
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,330
visiting our home,

482
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,530
they'll find out.

483
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,730
Do you have many guests?

484
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,970
Not that many.

485
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,850
If we do have guests coming over,

486
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,370
we can just tidy up the place.

487
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,130
My work schedule

488
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,170
is different from your schedule.

489
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,410
We shouldn't disturb each other

490
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,850
so that you can sleep better.

491
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,530
I'd like to be disturbed by you.

492
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,690
What are you doing?

493
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,450
I'm putting my luggage in.

494
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,250
You...

495
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,810
Put it somewhere else.

496
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,330
Why?

497
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,210
No reason.

498
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,690
Is there anything in here?

499
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,130
Nothing.

500
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,410
Why can't I put it in?

501
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,730
You can't keep stopping me.

502
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,090
Where else can I put it?

503
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,570
You...

504
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,090
Do you really want to open it?

505
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:52,730
Yes.

506
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,570
Are you sure?

507
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,290
Okay.

508
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,810
Open it if you want.

509
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,490
I've warned you.

510
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,290
You insisted.

511
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,210
He looks so good even when he folds clothes.

512
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,330
It's okay for us to sleep in separate rooms.

513
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,730
We're married.

514
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,890
It's just a matter of time.

515
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,450
Are you done?

516
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,770
Let's do some grocery shopping

517
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,930
in the supermarket later.

518
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,690
It's because...

519
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,450
It had always been just me

520
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,610
in this house.

521
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,730
So I only prepared the daily necessities

522
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,730
for myself.

523
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,970
This is kind of like our new home.

524
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,850
Why don't we replace them with new ones?

525
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,440
Fangning,

526
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,890
I have something to tell you.

527
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,370
What's the matter?

528
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,200
From now on, the living expenses,

529
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,210
management fees,

530
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,290
utility bills,

531
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,530
and the cost of hiring a helper...

532
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,210
This house is mine.

533
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,730
You don't have to worry about that.

534
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,810
Didn't you say

535
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,960
it's our new home?

536
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,280
Although our marriage is a contract,

537
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,450
the marriage certificate is real.

538
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,530
And we're living together.

539
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,530
Even housemates who live together

540
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,170
share the expenses as well.

541
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,930
Not to mention that

542
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:33,810
I need to carry out my responsibility

543
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,450
as a good husband.

544
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,770
So in the future,

545
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,210
I'll pay these expenses on time every month.

546
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,810
I can't believe

547
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,210
I'm being financially supported.

What's wrong with that?

553

I'll go on a business trip tomorrow.

there are so many furniture malls in the city.

Why did you choose to come here?

In our city,

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,610
this is the largest, most luxurious mall

00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,560
are all part of my life,

699
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,560
I don't need to avoid them."

700
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,440
Didn't he say anything else?

701
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,250
Lu.

702
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,000
Ling Rui is good in every way,

703
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,520
except for one thing.

704
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,239
He is softhearted,

705
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,480
quiet,

706
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,080
and way too sensible.

707
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,080
He keeps everything to himself.

708
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,719
Don't be mad at him.

709
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,010
Please bear with him.

710
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,719
Okay?

711
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,280
Ling Rui had been through a lot

712
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,840
when he was a kid.

713
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,639
He...

714
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,880
Since elementary school,

715
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,600
he'd go to the hospital to see his father

716
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,239
every day after school.

717
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,120
His father was ill in the hospital.

718
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,920
And his family was poor.

719
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,480
He couldn't pay for his school meals.

720
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,560
So...

721
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,160
I brought him the leftover bread

722
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
from other students.

723
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,920
I didn't know

724
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,000
he would only eat that every day.

725
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,120
He was so sensible.

726
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,120
He's trying to get her sympathy?

727
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,520
Nice trick.

728
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,040
That's not all.

729
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,320
There are more?

730
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,880
In high school,

731
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,040
Ling Rui spent only a year and a half

732
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,920
with his classmates.

733
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,040
Do you know why?

734
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,520
Why?

735
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,080
Well,

736
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,560
when he was a child,

737
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,720
his dad passed away

738
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,560
because of

739
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,240
pancreatic cancer.

740
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
So from then on,

741
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,760
his mother took it really hard.

742
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,840
She got ill then.

743
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,880
During his second year in high school,

744
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,760
his mother's illness

745
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,720
was getting worse and worse.

746
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,560
Ling Rui didn't tell anyone

747
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,520
and took his mother

748
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,450
back to his hometown

749
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,290
so she could get better.

750
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,640
During the college entrance exam,

751
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,600
he was admitted to

752
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,120
the national key medical university.

753
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,240
That's why I think

754
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,240
Ling Rui

755
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,040
is really awesome.

756
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,480
Extraordinary.

757
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,560
Why did you tell me these

758
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,720
all of a sudden?

759
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,880
Well... That's because

760
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,600
we don't want you

761
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,450
-to quarrel with Ling Rui.
-Yes, yes.

762
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,040
Exactly.

763
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,520
Why would I quarrel with Ling Rui?

764
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,880
Ling Rui is a good husband.

765
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,040
Well, I'll go to work.

766
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,200
Mr. Yu,

767
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,120
are you here to buy furniture?

768
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,520
Yes.

769
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,440
Don't pay. Remember, don't pay.

770
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:30,840
But...

771
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,240
Fangning,

772
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,440
if something happened between you two,

773
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,520
you can always tell me,

774
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:34,880
all right?

775
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,960
I'm on your side.

776
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,720
Can you give me
a set of furniture for free, too?

777
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,480
Hello,

778
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,680
what can I do for you?

779
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,880
Are you all right, miss?

780
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,440
Pack me all your

781
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,480
best kinds of bread

782
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,560
in your shop.

783
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,400
No.

784
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,080
All kinds of bread.

785
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,760
One of each, all of them.

786
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,560
Are you sure?

787
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,760
Yes.

788
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,280
Ms. Liu.

789
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,560
I think there's something wrong
with these moves.

790
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,760
Look,

791
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,160
I have long hands, feet, and neck.

792
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,120
Those basic exercises

793
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,710
will hinder me from

794
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,800
doing elegant moves.

795
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,030
Only the most graceful moves

796
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,800
are suitable for me.

797
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,400
I want graceful moves.

798
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,390
Well then...

799
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,200
Let me think about it.

800
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,950
That's right. Think about it.

801
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,480
Think about it.

802
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,640
I'll take a break.

803
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,920
Okay, okay.

804
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,120
I'll head out for a minute.

805
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:09,840
Bye.

806
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,230
Lu Fangning,

807
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,440
just wait.

808
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,080
I'll definitely beat you

809
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,360
in dancing.

810
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,080
Lu Fangyu?

811
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,990
What's he doing here?

812
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,640
Okay,

813
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,720
our break is over.

814
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,630
Let's get started.

815
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,840
Feet to the fifth position.

816
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,230
Hands get into the first position. Get ready.

817
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,440
Keep your eyes straight ahead.

818
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,160
Look at yourself in the mirror.

819
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,880
Good. Five, six, seven, eight.

820
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,880
One, two, three, four.

821
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,760
Five, six, seven, eight.

822
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,080
Good. Keep your posture.

823
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,480
What are you doing?

824
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,840
You almost scared me to death.

825
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,080
How's that?

826
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,640
How is Ms. Liu's lesson?

827
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,720
Come with me, come on.

828
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,350
Come. Let me...

829
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,520
Let me tell you something.

830
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,600
It's okay. Let's talk here.

831
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,640
Well...

832
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:28,960
Tangtang.

833
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,320
The instructors in our studio

834
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,760
are actually...

835
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,880
all excellent dancers.

836
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,350
Are you trying to change an instructor for me?

837
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,960
You knew?

838
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,280
My current instructor is terrible at teaching.

839
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,920
I was planning to get a new instructor anyway.

840
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,710
I can recommend one for you.

841
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,520
How about that?

842
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,760
Even though he's a man,

843
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,950
Mr. Lu teaches very well.

844
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,390
A man?

845
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:53,840
Mr. Lu?

846
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,630
Tangtang, to be frank with you.

847
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,360
Although Mr. Lu

848
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,950
is the brother of my nephew's wife,

849
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,680
that's not why

850
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,120
I recommended him.

851
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,600
He's one of the

852
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,880
best instructors here.

853
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,400
And he is a nice person.

854
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,710
When I was in trouble,

855
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,590
he lent me money without hesitation.

856
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,400
Where can we find such a good man?

857
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,640
Is your nephew surnamed Ling?

858
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,640
It's Ling Rui?

859
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,790
Do you know him?

860
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,310
Lower your voice.

861
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,560
What's wrong?

862
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,120
Hey.

863
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,750
I was wondering

864
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,040
what smells go well.

865
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,270
It turns out it's Ms. Cai

866
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,150
eating some fancy food.

867
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,440
It's not even the end of the month.

868
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,440
You can tell me if you run out of money.

869
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,550
You'll lend me money?

870
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,640
No.

871
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,990

It tastes so bad.

Why is life so hard?

Hello, Cai Siyu, Planning Department.

Come to my office.

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,470
I'll treat you to dinner.
