[Episode 16]

4
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,530
Where are you going?

5
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,280
Where are you going?

6
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,080
Where am I going?

7
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,710
I'm going to…

8
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,430
Because the

9
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,870
toilets upstairs are all full.

10
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,750
I want to go to the one on the first floor.

11
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,430
How about you?

12
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,230
You… Where are you going?

13
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,360
I think you are too busy working overtime.

14
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,259
So I want to go out

15
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,110
to buy you

16
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,080
something to eat.

17
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,430
I'm not hungry.

18
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,510
No need for that.

19
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,630
What are you doing?

20
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,750
No, I'm not hungry.

21
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,990
I won't eat, I won't eat.

22
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,670
Well…

23
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,710
I have a lot of things to do.

24
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,750
If you're hungry,

25
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,550
just go buy yourself

26
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,829
something to eat.

27
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,030
Really, you don't have to wait for me.

28
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,910
Go ahead, go.

29
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,910
I'm leaving now.

30
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,150
What are you doing?

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,310
I just want to go on a date with you.

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,800
Ling Rui,

33
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,480
put your cards on the table.

34
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,829
Are you trying to

35
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,829
use dating as an excuse?

36
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,880
Let me tell you.

37
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,990
I am

38
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,870
very clever.

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
I know what you are thinking.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,880
Is there no next meal

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,950
after this one?

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,120
I can eat this meal

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,870
with you.

44
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,470
But I'll never talk with you

45
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,480
about this matter.

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,190
Don't even think about it.

47
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,430
It's impossible, definitely.

48
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,320
Really?

49
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,440
Are you not going to date me?

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,150
No.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,790
Date?

52
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay.

53
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,200
Listen,

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,950
I am a person that

55
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,030
will take things seriously.

56
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,960
You can't

57
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,630
eat your words,

58
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,470
you know?

59
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,440
Lu Fangning,

60
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,910
previously,

61
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,750
I've been denying your feelings.

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,240
It was not because I'm apathetic.

63
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,750
Indeed, I dared not admit it before this.

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,910
Because for me,

65
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,320
order

66
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,790
is a very important thing.

67
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,360
You can think of it like this.

68
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,950
A surgeon who loses his order

69
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,070
is like a person who loses his reason.

70
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,720
The order between us

71
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,830
has always been the opposite.

72
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,150
This has always confused me.

73
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,910
But your true intentions,

74
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,920
I received it all.

75
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,120
Are you willing to…

76
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,790
I…

77
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,589
I do.

78
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,150
Are you willing to,

79
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
you and me,

80
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,990
start our relationship from our marriage?

81
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,110
I…

82
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,240
We…

83
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,270
You and me…

84
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,909
Well…

85
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,760
Are you willing to

86
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,230
starting our relationship with me from our marriage?

87
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,790
Ling Rui,

88
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,830
I do.

89
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,400
Why do I feel like crying?

90
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,920
So embarrassing.

91
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,750
It doesn't matter.

92
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,840
I've seen you when you were

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,520
even more embarrassed.

[Deer Sing]

95
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,510
It's really quite delicious.

96
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,510
Why are you there

97
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,750
watching me eat?

98
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,190
Eat together.

99
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,520
Okay, okay.

100
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,710
Take it yourself.

101
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,310
That's why you asked me out

102
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,390
so many times?

103
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,070
Just to eat together?

104
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,630
Of course.

105
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,270
What the heck.

106
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,720
What about the birthday celebration?

107
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,110
And your investment?

108
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,790
Then, you said things that I didn't understand.

109
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,000
You made me misunderstand you for so long.

110
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,630
In fact,

111
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,840
the answers to these questions are the same.

112
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,190
Other people,

113
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,870
they fall in love and get married.

114
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,480
And we,

115
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,720
get married first and then fall in love.

116
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,750
The order is reversed.

117
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,360
And the case is more complicated.

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,710
So,

119
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,990
I want to make everything

120
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,200
a little easier.

121
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,560
Investment

122
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,080
is to help us

123
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,960
avoid any financial entanglements.

124
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,350
The birthday party was

125
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,159
to thank you for

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,240
everything you've done for me.

127
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,400
That is to say,

128
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,830
we're having a new beginning.

129
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,080
Starting with dating.

130
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,310
Going by the normal order,

131
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,720
what should we do next?

132
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,600
We can watch movies.

133
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,920
We've seen it.

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,680
Episode seven.

135
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,710
In the mall, midnight.

136
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,760
Then…

137
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,030
We can go to the amusement park.

138
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,950
-Episode nine.
-Episode nine.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,880
Actually, we've done a lot of things.

140
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,880
Hold hands.

141
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,000
Kiss.

142
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,510
You can rewind and watch it.

143
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,390
But for me,

144
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,150
tonight is indeed our first day.

145
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,160
I just found that

146
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,950
we've done

147
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,230
so many things together.

148
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,720
So then,

149
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,600
what else can we do?

150
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,790
Ling Rui.

151
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,280
Ling Rui, Ling Rui, Ling Rui.

152
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,120
What's wrong?

153
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,990
Come on, come on.

154
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,830
Sit.

155
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,710
What's the matter?

156
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,040
I know what we can do.

157
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,760
Come on, give me your hand.

158
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,110
We're going to change our profile photos

159
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,520
and contact nicknames.

160
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,270
Change it

161
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,600
to our match each other as couples.

162
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,440
Come on.

163
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,150
Like this.

164
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,230
Why are you taking this?

165
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,950
I want to capture your hands.

166
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,590
Your hands are so pretty.

167
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,870
Besides,

168
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,510
people who don't know you

169
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,520
won't know whose hand is this.

170
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,760
It won't expose you.

171
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,840
Someone who knows you,

172
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
they'll know that

173
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,200
you are my husband.

174
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,270
I should change your profile photo to

175
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,550
the debt bill.

176
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,720
When I see it,

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,550
I'll think of you right away.

178
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,960

353
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,800
Come on, change your shoes. Your coat.

354
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,550
Okay.

355
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:11,680
Thank you.

356
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,280
How's your day?

357
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,430
Were you busy?

358
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,630
I'm fine.

359
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,590
How about you?

360
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,670
I finished the work ten times faster

361
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,350
than usual.

362
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,560
How's that? Am I good?

363
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,190
Ten times faster?

364
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,400
That's really fast.

365
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,350
Well, do you want to reward me?

366
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,120
Hug me.

367
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,230
I'm very tired.

368
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,350
Why are you tired?

369
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,390
Because I'm hungry.

370
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,920
What are you gonna

371
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,710
cook for me today?

372
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,000
I forgot it.

373
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,110
How about this?

374
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,880
To make it up to you,

375
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,470
I'll take you out to dinner.

376
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,160
My treat.

377
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,350
Good.

378
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,230
I think you're tired.

379
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,710
Let's order takeout?

380
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,150
Order the one I like to eat.

381
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,720
Up to you.

382
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,870
No, no.

383
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,190
I said I'll cook dinner.

384
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,190
I should cook dinner.

385
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Come.

386
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,390
Come on.

387
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,230
-Hurry.
-You sure?

388
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,040
Come.

389
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,470
I'll make you

390
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,510
the best dinner in the world.

391
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,150
Instant noodles?

392
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,230
When did you

393
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,000
buy so many again?

394
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:34,710
Well,

395
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,550
last time,

396
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,550
you came to my company to see me.

397
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,160
It doesn't matter.

398
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,190
Which flavor would you like to have?

399
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,320
You pick one and I'll make it for you.

400
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,680
You're the boss.

401
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,560
Then…

402
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,310
This one.

403
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,190
Wait for me.

404
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,190
I'll cook the most delicious

405
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,310
instant noodles in the world for you.

406
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,000
First of all,

407
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,750
take a bowl out.

408
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,150
Then,

409
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,110
put the noodles in.

410
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,240
Then, the seasoning.

411
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:14,870
Wait.

412
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,600
I'll boil the water first.

413
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,390
After the water is boiled,

414
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,350
just put it in the pot and it's done.

415
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,350
You make instant noodles like this?

416
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,320
How else can instant noodles

417
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,200
be cooked?

418
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,350
Let me do it.

419
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,630
♫ My dear, I have three hearts for you ♫

420
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,310
When the water comes to a boil,

421
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,680
I'll put the noodles in.

422
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,120
Okay.

423
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,790
What are you doing with ice?

424
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,710
The instant noodles must be cooked in hot water.

425
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,800
Use hot water.

426
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,710
You just watch.

427
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,920
Hot water.

428
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,790
What are you doing with ice?

429
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,280
You'll see it soon.

430
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,240
♫ exist only for you ♫

431
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,240
Every time

432
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,280
I used to see you cooking,

433
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,160
I really wanted to hug you like this.

434
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,080
♫ Your arrival in my world ♫

435
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,240
♫ Makes me believe in destiny ♫

436
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,750
♫ I'm moved beyond my expectation ♫

437
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:40,750
♫ I can't move my gaze from you ♫

438
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,030
♫ I know the future is too uncertain ♫

439
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,120
♫ I can only be sure that you are the only one ♫

440
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,790
♫ I'm not afraid to walk in a sea of ​​people ♫

441
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,070
♫ Because I really love you ♫

442
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,840
♫ My dear, I have three hearts for you ♫

443
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,670
♫ Listen to this carefully, this shall not be done half-heartedly ♫

444
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,080
♫ You must love and give with all your heart ♫

445
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,870
Thank you.

446
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,590
Try it.

447
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,280
Smells good.

448
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,070
Is it good?

449
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,630
Good.

450
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,990
It was made by us two,

451
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,910
so good.

452
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,680
You look good anyway.

453
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,030
There's no need to be like this.

454
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,760
Ling Rui,

455
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,830
something just occurred to me.

456
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,550
Look at it.

457
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,240
Disgusting.

458
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,710
Why would I get that idea?

459
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,870
-Eat noodles.
-Eat.

460
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,000
Wonderful.

461
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,560
So,

462
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,240
this is the first day

463
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,190
of our formal relationship.

464
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,510
We two

465
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,600
just cooked together.

466
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,720
And we ate

467
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,630
such delicious noodles.

468
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,470
Next,

469
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,950
let's go out for a date.

470
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,520
How's that?

471
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,470
Are you tired after a day's work?

472
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,390
If you're tired,

473
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,430
how about

474
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,200
we just date at home?

475
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,960
Date at home.

476
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,550
What can we do at home?

477
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,110
Don't think too much.

478
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,790
I didn't think too much.

479
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,510
Let's watch TV.

480
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:49,710
I'm serious.

481
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,680
Let's watch the variety show.

482
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,110
I haven't seen a variety show for a long time.

483
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,910
How's that?

484
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,080
Okay.

485
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,720
Ling Rui,

486
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,670
I don't want to see it.

487
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,270
Didn't you say you wanted to watch TV?

488
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,400
Why you don't want to see it?

489
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,350
It's good.

490
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,470
But I think

491
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,870
you're more attractive than the TV.

492
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,160
I want to talk to you.

493
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,000
Tell me about

494
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,590
what happened

495
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,790
in the hospital today.

496
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,670
What could happen at the hospital?

497
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,750
Same as usual.

498
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,920
What's the usual situation, then?

499
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,190
In simple terms,

500
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,310
I was very busy.

501
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,040
You worked a day.

502
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,990
You must be tired.

503
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,750
It's a good thing I helped you cooking,

504
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,400
right?

505
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,000
Well, thank you very much.

506
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,240
You're welcome, I should do that.

507
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,550
Well,

508
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,640
work was pretty tiring

509
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,030
and I also have

510
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,510
some annoyance,

511
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,790
but as long as you are here,

512
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,840
the world is splendid for me.

513
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,550
I do have

514
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,520
that kind of ability.

515
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,760
Actually, I feel the same.

516
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,150
In the past,

517
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,760
I always felt being alone is good.

518
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,400
There's nothing bad about it.

519
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,560
Not that much trouble.

520
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,910
But since I had you with me,

521
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,190
I've changed my thought.

522
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,470
You made me

523
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,680
form this bad habit.

524
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,320
So you should be responsible for me.

525
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,590
You're not allowed to dislike me.

526
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,830
Or hate me.

527
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,030
Do you hear me?

528
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,750
I promise you.

529
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,080
What?

530
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,910
That's all?

531
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,950
You're not up to scratch.

532
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,470
It's our first date.

533
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,910
How could you kiss me without passion?

534
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,280
Come on.

535
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,110
Save it for next time.

536
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,470
So mean.

537
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,990
Did he fall asleep?

538
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,360
Are you asleep?

539
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,750
Yes.

540
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,720
Good night.

541
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,520
He goes to bed so early.

542
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,600
Tomorrow is the weekend.

543
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,350
Where shall we go on a date?

544
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,960
We've been to the amusement park.

545
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,830
Go to the cinema.

546
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,310
Watch a horror movie.

547
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,240
Give him a chance

548
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,720
to jump into my arms.

549
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,240
I'm afraid I can't tomorrow.

550
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,920
I'm having a gathering with my colleagues.

551
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,510
Thank you.

552
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,990
I'll help you wear it.

553
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,030
My husband is so handsome.

554
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,430
Remember to come back early tonight.

555
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,590
I'll miss you.

556
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,310
I'll miss you too, dear.

557
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,480
What did you put on?

558
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,670
I…

559
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,920
I didn't…

560
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
I love you.

561
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,960
Go.

562
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,950
Then,

563
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,270
I'm leaving.

564
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,710
Bye, take care.

565
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,520
Bye.

566
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,990
This is just like the dramas, right?

567
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,160
On the second day of our relationship,

568
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,870
he leaves me alone at home.

569
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,080
I am so lonely.

570
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,800
Cai Siyu,

571
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,390
Ling Rui is not at home today.

572
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,600
Come and hang out with me.

573
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,950
I'm so sorry.

574
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,699
I am

575
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,780
on a date.

576
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:12,630
You…

577
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,150
Didn't even let me say more.

578
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,350
Who? Fangning?

579
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,350
Yes.

580
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,989
Dr. Ling is not home.

581
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,600
She felt a little lonely.

582
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,520
You two get along well with each other.

583
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,389
But it seems that

584
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:30,219
you haven't known each other that long.

585
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,989
We feel like

586
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,870
old friends at the first meeting.

587
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,520
Let's go.

588
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,120
Dance… You danced well.

589
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,270
No.

590
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,030
I sat for too long in the house.

591
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,520
I just did some exercise.

592
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,430
You… Why did you come back?

593
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,080
I wanted to ask you

594
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,230
if you want to come

595
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,910
to join our gathering?

596
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,550
It doesn't matter if you don't want to go.

597
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,360
They're all colleagues anyway.

598
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,070
Maybe we'll discuss something about

599
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,840
surgeries or work.

600
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,470
You may not be very interested.

601
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,550
I want to go.

602
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,350
I'll go get changed.

603
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,190
Okay.

604
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,470
Okay.

605
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,560
We're almost there.

606
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,950
Do you dare to go there?

607
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,510
Welcome our perfect couple.

608
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,160
Welcome, welcome.

609
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,470
Your colleagues, aren't they

610
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,280
a little over the top?

611
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,280
So beautiful.

612
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,440
Wherever I go,

613
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,920
I'll bring glory to the place.

614
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,630
Hi.

615
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,310
Hello, Dr. Ling, Fangning.

616
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,880
I brought Fangning with me.

617
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,120
Are you satisfied?

618
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,550
-Fangning.
-That's good.

619
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,390
Hello.

620
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,190
Hello, Fangning.

621
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,000
Hello.

622
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,310
Welcome, welcome.

623
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,520
Welcome, Fangning.

624
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,110
Welcome them.

625
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,800
Welcome.

626
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,710
Applause.

627
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,750
As long as you guys

628
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,990
can help me take care of

629
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,070
Ling Rui more.

630
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,710
No big deal.

631
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,510
Professor Luo.

632
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,600
Professor Luo.

633
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,080
Professor Luo.

634
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,920
Finally you come.

635
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,710
Fangning will treat us to delicious food.

636
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,550
Professor Luo,

637
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,440
this is my wife.

638
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,430
Since I graduated from my school,

639
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,430
Professor Luo has taken care of me.

640
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,790
He is my mentor.

641
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,880
Professor Luo, hello.

642
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,920
We've met.

643
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,910
It's rare for Ling Rui to bring his family.

644
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,830
We're not going to talk about academic problems today.

645
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,710
Let's just enjoy our meal.

646
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,390
How's that?

647
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,390
Professor.

648
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,630
How about you

649
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,310
consider the…

650
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,350
Let's go.

651
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,120
Please think it over.

652
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,230
Come on, go, go.

653
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:47,910
Go.

654
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,750
Why are you pinching me?

655
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,550
Go.

656
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,790
Professor, sit down please.

657
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,830
Okay, sit down, everyone.

658
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,510
Thank you.

659
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,350
Xiaoxuan.

660
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,270
What?

661
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,160
Thank you, thank you.

662
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,110
What would you like to eat, professor?

663
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,030
Up to you. You choose.

664
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,520
Fangning, you choose.

665
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,390
What would you like to eat?

666
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,310
Brother is so handsome.

667
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,390
So handsome.

668
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,790
I dreamed about him last night.

669
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,230
Me too.

670
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,240
You like him?

671
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,390
Yes.

672
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,360
I'll get his signature

673
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,920
for you later.

674
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,040
Really?

675
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,390
Ms. Lu, you're so nice.

676
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,600
Ms. Lu, I want one too.

677
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,230
Thank you.

678
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,040
I'll go back and frame it.

679
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,280
You and this actor

680
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,670
whose skin is whiter

681
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,350
than a woman's.

682
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,920
Are you still in touch with him?

683
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,440
Yes.

684
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,880
Didn't I tell you that last time?

685
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,520
The company will hire him as a spokesman.

686
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,710
Really?

687
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,630
Thank you, Ms. Lu.

688
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,070
Dr. Ling,

689
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,550
you're just jealous.

690
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,470
Jealous of our brother's

691
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,430
milk-like skin.

692
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,240
Last time,

693
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,640
I haven't forgiven you yet.

694
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,190
You said our brother is not famous.

695
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,160
When he comes out,

696
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,510
even the sky changes color, okay?

697
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,760
You're just being jealous.

698
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,960
Being jealous is such a childish thing.

699
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,510
I won't do it.

700
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,040
You won't?

701
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,920
Will you?

702
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,480
Of course I won't.

703
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,760
Em…

704
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,510
What would you like to eat?

705
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,550
You don't drink wine.

706
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,680
Have some juice?

707
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,800
Dr. Ling never drinks juice.

708
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,510
He always

709
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,350
ordered black tea, right?

710
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,270
This one?

711
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,350
Here you are.

712
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,480
-See?
-Thank you.

713
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,550
Dr. Ling,

714
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,190
I'd like a cup of black tea, too.

715
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,560
Thank you.

716
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,190
Okay.

717
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,390
Dr. Ling,

718
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,870
I'd like a cup of black tea, too.

719
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,710
Do it yourself.

720
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,040
Ling Rui's lover, right?

721
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,760
Professor Luo,

722
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,200
you can call me Fangning.

723
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,430
Fangning,

724
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,270
your birth plan with Ling Rui.

725
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,240
How's it going?

726
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,270
Preparations are underway.

727
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,790
That's good, good.

728
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,790
Fangning.

729
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,080
Ling Rui, the indifferent prince charming of our hospital,

730
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,470
is difficult to take down, right?

731
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,640
A little bit.

732
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,230
Dr. Ling does

733
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,470
make people feel depressed.

734
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,080
Every time he goes into the operating room,

735
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,430
he'll always tell a joke.

736
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,070
Corny jokes, you know.

737
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,080
But he

738
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,360
tells the same one every time.

739
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,230
And we can't embarrass him.

740
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,270
Am I right?

741
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,590
That's right.

742
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,430
You know what.

743
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,320
We were just

744
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,470
chiming in with him.

745
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,550
Just to give him face.

746
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,990
I'm tired of warning him.

747
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,110
Is that so?

748
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,150
Yeah.

749
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,520
You may ask them.

750
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,360
-Yes.
-Exactly.

751
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,400
Actually, it was funny

752
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
when he told us the first time.

753
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,160
But he kept telling us the same one,

754
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,960
then we're afraid of

755
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,040
embarrassing him.

756
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,190
What joke?

757
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,910
It's not funny.

758
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,080
Let's not talk about it.

759
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,240
Peng Bo, what's the joke?

760
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,590
You'd better let Dr. Ling

761
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,630
tell you himself.

762
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,830
So, next time he will

763
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:48,910
tell another joke.

764
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,320
Yes, he should tell another one.

765
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,910
It's really not that funny.

766
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,750
When he told that joke

767
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,790
the first time,

768
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,870
I didn't think it's funny.

769
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,950
But he liked it.

770
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,800
I'll go to the restroom.

771
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,870
Professor, I'll go with her.

772
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:05,670
Okay.

773
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,190
I have a joke.

774
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:09,840
Fangning.

775
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,510
Dr. Ling doesn't drink juice,

776
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,720
only black tea, right?

777
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,760
Yes, yes. What the hell!

778
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,070
Dr. Ling, I'd like to have a glass as well.

779
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:35,990
Pour me a glass.

780
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,680
Pour her a glass!

781
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,560
You poured for her,

782
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,600
why didn't get one for me?

783
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,440
The first time Dr. Ling

784
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,150
told that joke,

785
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,990
it was pretty funny.

786
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,200
It was not funny later.

787
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,480
If so, why you're laughing?

788
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,040
Hahaha…

789
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,950
They all were laughing.

790
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:45,670
Am I the only one

791
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,230
who hasn't heard of this joke?

792
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,240
Why didn't you tell me?

793
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,800
Lu Fangning,

794
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,510
you can't be like this.

795
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,630
You don't look pretty when you're angry.

796
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,440
Have you forgotten what you said

797
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,230
before you came here today?

798
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,150
Be elegant.

799
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,720
Calm down.

800
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,230
Keep smiling.

801
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,550
Calm down.

802
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,830
Beautiful.

803
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,230
Hi,

804
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,160
I am back.

805
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,640
What are you talking about?

806
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:19,320
Okay.
