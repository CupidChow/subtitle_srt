Yes, I think.

11
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,710

15
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,320
I have a friend

So, she found a guy

whom she likes very much,

19
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,360
and got married.

20
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,320
But after they got married,

21
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,880
they have never slept on the same bed.

22
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,840

with my friend or the man?

27
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,770
Oh, so that's

28

This is actually very simple.

37

Just let your friend show

38
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,310
all of her charm.

39
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,030
She's your friend,

40
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,610
so she must be someone like you.

41
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,000
No one could resist

But I...

45

I mean, my friend has tried that.

46

He's not an ordinary man

54

who could be attracted by simple beauty.

55
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,110

57

About this situation,

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,410

59

60
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,170
we need to stop being human.

61
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,010
There are three methods.

62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,730
You could be a cat,

63
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,030
or a tiger,

64
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,520
or a dog who got wet in the rain.

65
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,370
I didn't say that.

66
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,710
It's not you.

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,170
She's my idol
from the entertainment industry.

68

You have good taste in picking your idols.

69
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,690
But,

70
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,310
how exactly to apply this?

71
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,370
It's a bit difficult

72
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,730
to actually do that.

73
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,850
But the advice from my other idol

74
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,830
in another industry

75
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,030

are similar to that of your friend.

82

Your friend could find some inspiration

83
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,160
from these books.

346
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,420
I've got used to it already.

347
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,339
It's not that easy.

348
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,060
If you can get used to it,

349
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,540
you're not the Ling Rui

350
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,350
that I know anymore.

351
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,820
Are you comforting me?

352
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,180
What else?

353
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,900
You know, I had Gao Erfan

354
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,100
spend a lot of time

355
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,180
booking this whole place today.

356
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,460
Isn't this amazing?

357
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,940
When I was young,

358
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,070
I liked coming here

359
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,980
every time I felt down.

360
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,740
This is very comforting.

361
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,700
A lot of time?

362
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,980
You prepared this in advance?

363
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,390
Never mind all that.

364
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,340
Time is precious.

365
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,860
Where do you want to go next?

366
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,820
I've tried so hard to

367
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,590
get you half a day off.

368
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,580
Half a day off?

369
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,460
Director Luo told me

370
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,340
to take a rest.

371
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,870
That's because of you?

372
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,670
I apologize. I'm sorry.

373
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,580
But,

374
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,750
I saw that

375
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,740
you weren't feeling good today.

376
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,980
So I want you to have some rest.

377
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,860
I've already asked them.

378
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,580
You don't have any

379
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,860
important appointments today.

380
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,820
-So I thought...
-First of all,

381
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,150
it's my call

382
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,460
whether I have

383
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,980
important appointments.

384
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,540
Secondly,

385
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,700
it's a waste of

386
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,820
medical resources

387
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,900
to change a doctor's schedule.

388
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,780
Lastly,

389
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,940
I would like you not to

390
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,980
intervene in my job and my life

391
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,180
too much in the future.

392
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,260
Am I not part of your life?

393
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,270
You are.

394
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,500
But...

395
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,260
But what?

396
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,500
But we...

397
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,020
We're just bonded by a contract.

398
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,020
A contract?

399
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,580
It's just a contract?

400
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,620
You think I like

401
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,660
to watch you riding on

402
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,430
some merry-go-round

403
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,230
and play bumper cars with you

404
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,850
like an idiot?

405
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,060
I even acted like

406
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,700
the CEOs in the novels,

407
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,210
called you silly,

408
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,220
and put my hand on a tree,

409
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,500
hurting my own palms.

410
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,220
Even the kids were laughing at me.

411
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,020
I did all these just

412
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,260
to make you happy.

413
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,630
You're doing this just

414
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,740
to achieve your own goal.

415
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,790
What goal?

416
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,370
I don't want to talk about it.

417
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,780
I want to have a baby, right?

418
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,580
What's up?

419
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,270
Why are you embarrassed to

420
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,980
say that out loud?

421
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,690
I just want a baby.

422
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:32,860
Say something.

423
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,260
Alright.

424
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,710
Let me ask you a question.

425
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,410
Do you love me?

426
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,230
Does it

427
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,010
matter whether I love you

428
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,100
or not?

429
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,540
I think this is something

430
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,900
that has to do with love.

431
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,220
I hope you can understand

432
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,010
and respect me.

433
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,610
Aren't we married?

434
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,860
Lu Fangning, you really want

435
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,670
a baby that much, huh?

436
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,150
Yes, I do.

437
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,220
Okay.

438
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,020
I'll give you what you want.

439
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,950
Let's give it a shot.

440
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,260
But you must not

441
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,270
run away this time.

442
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,620
Deal.

443
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,660
I won't run away.

444
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,990
Didn't you do everything

445
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,540
to get this?

446
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,500
I think

447
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,250
we can do it

448
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,830
step by step.

449
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:48,870
What's up?

450
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:50,740
Are you scared?

451
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,260
Scared?

452
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,100
My hair was stuck.

453
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,230
Just give me a second.

454
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,570
One second, okay?

455
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,580
Lu Fangning, haven't you been waiting

456
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,590
for this day to come?

457
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,730
What are you waiting for? Get inside.

458
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,780
It's the first time.

459
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,500
It's normal to be a bit nervous.

460
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,340
About what?

461
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,290
Just close your eyes
and you'll have a baby.

462
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,340
But I was so frivolous

463
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,450
in front of him.

464
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,390
If he finds out

465
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,770
I have no experience,

466
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,750
isn't that embarrassing?

467
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,100
You don't need to care about that.

468
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,060
When this story got out,

469
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,050
how would Cai Siyu think of you?

470
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,850
Once Tang Ping knows,

471
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,870
she is gonna jump to the sky.

472
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,710
You were just bragging

473
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,710
with that girl at the front desk.

474
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,350
Have you forgotten?

475
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,050
If you went out alone,

476
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,230
what would she think of you?

477
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:07,910
If you go out alone now,

478
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,770
it'll be more embarrassing.

479
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,190
Lu Fangning, don't you want a baby?

480
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,370
Don't be scared, go inside.

481
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,300
You're right.

482
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,420
Wait, wait.

483
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,410
Hold on, hold on.

484
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,330
Why do we still need to wait some more?

485
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,980
We've waited long enough.

486
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,150
You just want a baby, don't you?

487
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,540
I knew you are afraid.

488
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,050
Honey,

489
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,420
I'll be up in a minute.

490
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,330
Ms. Lu,

491
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,850
How's your charm working?

492
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,850
Ling Rui,

493
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,210
you're a beast.

494
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,890
This will not do.

495
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,930
Is there anything more exciting?

496
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,450
Is this not exciting enough?

497
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,930
It doesn't make any sense.

498
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,370
Is Dr. Ling unwilling?

499
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,510
It's not that.

500
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,130
The problem is with me.

501
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,940
How is the problem

502
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,620
with you, Ms. Lu?

503
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:49,730
Can you?

504
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,090
Of course,

505
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,730
I can't.

506
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,570
Ms. Lu,

507
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,610
you have a serious problem

508
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,020
which could not be solved

509
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,860
by the books.

510
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,170
So what am I supposed to do?

511
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,610
How about

512
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,730
asking for help from someone else?

513
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,460
If I could find someone else,

514
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,650
why did I ask you?

515
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,210
If you don't ask someone else,

516
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,610
how do you know for sure

517
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,570
it's your problem?

518
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,340
Well, who am I gonna talk to?

519
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,290
Ms. Lu.

520
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,820
I didn't know you had important business.

521
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,730
Well, I'll come back later.

522
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,810
What are you doing here?

523
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,460
Ms. Qin of Jiang Cheng Group

524
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,010
will be here soon.

Yujiang.

527
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,730
Ms. Qin of Jiang Cheng Group.

528
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,490
Who is that?

529
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,250
This is Ms. Qin of Jiang Cheng Group?

530
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,570
Director Lu's ex...

531
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,010
fiancee?

532
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,940
She's so tall,
yet she's wearing high heels.

533
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,050
That must be expensive.

534
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,740
Perfect figure, pretty face.

535
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,050
And her presence

536
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,810
is almost like that of Ms. Lu.

537
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,050
Qin Yujiang, and Cai Siyu.

538
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,090
Only our names are similar.

539
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,490
It's god's will.

540
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,970
I heard you just got back today,

541
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,290
and you came here
right after you got off the plane.

542
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,370
You're so hardworking.

543
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,290
Not as good as you.

544
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,170
You're running Deer Sing alone.

545
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,650
You even used your marriage
as a marketing stunt.

546
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,290
I hadn't come back in time,

547
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,100
or I would have witnessed it.

548
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,120
This time you've come to us

549
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,260
for the production lines.

550
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,300
It must be

551
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,250
for Infinity, I presume.

552
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,050
Yujiang,

553
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,340
you really know a lot

554
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,490
about our Deer Sing.

555
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,450
You're an important client of Jiang Cheng.

556
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,650
Knowing about the Deer Sing

557
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,090
means we're taking you seriously.

558
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,500
I will be responsible

559
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,680
and follow up on

560
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,380
this production line in person.

561
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,450
Isn't that a little

562
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,810
unnecessary?

563
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,130
You're so busy.

564
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,730
Why do you have to do everything yourself?

565
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,280
If I don't do this,

566
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,170
how could we show that

567
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,500
we value Deer Sing?

568
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,650
I know that Lu Yiyao is back.

569
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,100
Now he is chiefly in charge of

570

571
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,130
I'll talk to him.

the best.

574
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,730
Talk to me. It's more direct.

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,170
I won't talk to you.

If you don't want to see her,

581
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,730
just forget it.

No problem.

with her back then?

589
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,130
Why did you suddenly

590
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,090
decide to go abroad?

591
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,340
All these years,
neither Qin Yujiang

592
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,420
nor you have mentioned anything.

593
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,730
I'm not being nosy.

594
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,130
I only care about you.

595
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,660
If you really don't want to talk about it,

596
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:16,970
I can understand.

597
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,800
We...

598
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,220
We just found that

599
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,360
we weren't suitable for each other.

600
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,330
You were together for two years,

601
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,280
and right when you were
about to get married,

602
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,160
you found that you were not compatible
with each other?

603
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,170
Sometimes,

604
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,480
it only takes one moment to

605
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,690
realize that.

606
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,290
Okay, I give up.

607

Let alone someone else's.

609

But if it's truly

610
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,810
like you said,

611
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,610
Qin Yujiang is not sentimental,

612
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,890
that will be good.

I just

624
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,380
don't want things

625
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,490
to come to that.

626
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:24,730
I've already contacted

Ms. Qin's office

628
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,560
for many times.

629
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,530
She's either in a meeting,

630
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,640
or out of the office.

631
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:29,680
I suspect

632
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,920
they don't even want to work with us.

633
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,300

from Deer Sing Group, Lu Yiyao,

636
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,960
May I speak to Ms. Qin, please?

637
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,480
Hi. I'm so sorry.

638
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,920
Ms. Qin is out of the office currently.

639
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,290
Can I help you with anything?

640
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,680
May I take down your message?

641
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,520
I'll let her know when she gets back.

642
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,570
No, thanks.

643
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,530
Can't reach her, right?

644
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,920
I'll keep trying.

645
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
You'll have to reach her someday.

646
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,080
I don't believe Ms. Qin

647
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,210
could just disappear.

648
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,340
If you approve, director,

649
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,620
I'm gonna go to her company

650
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,080
and wait for her.

651
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,500
Director,

652
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,520
you and Ms. Qin have known each other
for years.

653
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,960
Don't you have her personal phone number?

654
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,040
She didn't pick up the calls
in the office.

655
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,460
Perhaps she'll answer her private calls.

656
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,850
This is business.

657
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,330
If she doesn't answer a business call,

658
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,520
she definitely won't answer private calls.

659
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,000
Stupid.

660
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:46,800
Hello.

661
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,080
It's me.

662
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,740
Lu Yiyao.

663
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,860
Director Lu.

664

I've been waiting for your call.

665
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,400
I'd like to meet you sometime.

666
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,600
And we could talk about

667
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,370
the cooperation between
Deer Sing and Jiang Cheng.

668
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,520
Okay.

669
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,280
Let's meet over lunch.

670
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,160
By the way,

671
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,160
I have one request.

672
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:09,770
Name it.

673
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,330
How romantic.

674
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,700
Isn't this Director Lu?

675
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,280
I never thought
he'd do something like this.

676
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,560
Look, so handsome.

677
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,080
Who's so lucky? He's so handsome.

678
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,330
Who's so lucky?

679
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm so jealous.

680
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,180
Learn from him, okay?

681
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,450
Flowers?

682
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,400
We're about to get into

683
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
the main storyline?

684
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,040
But,

685
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,920
why is he standing in the lobby

686
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,940
with two bouquets of flowers?

687
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,210
That's lovely.

688
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,730
I'm embarrassed.

689
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:09,900
How do you feel?

690
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,920
Standing in the lobby alone

691
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,080
with two bouquets of flowers,

692
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,130
isn't it good?

693
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,600
As long as you are happy.

694
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,460
However,

695
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,160
I don't like

696
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,930
this kind of flower anymore.

697
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,320
The colors are too boring.

698
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,400
It doesn't really go with me now.

699
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,400
Well, then,

700
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,480
what kind of flowers does Ms. Qin like?

701
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,680
I'll buy it next time.

702
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:34,690
Of course, you will.

703
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,210
Siyu, why you are still here?

704
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,600
Don't look at me. Just go.

705
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,850
Now, may I take Ms. Qin

706
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,040
for a meal now?

707
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:49,960
Of course.

708
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,040
Please.

709
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,360
Throw it away.

710
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,280
It's all right. Go eat.

711
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,480
Okay, bye.

712
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,440
What a waste.

713
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,679
Threw away such perfect flowers.

714
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,440
And the trash can downstairs

715
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,010
could only take dry waste.

716
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,400
I've done my bit

717
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,480
to keep our company clean.

718
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,929
That's basically the same as

719
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,889
you bought me flowers.

720
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,530
Cai Siyu,

721
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,800
who bought you flowers?

722
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,360
Come on.

723
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,000
Didn't you go downstairs for lunch?

724
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,290
Did you go to buy flowers instead?

725
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,570
I just picked it up.

726
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,450
I see.

727
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,360
Who is so rich

728
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,920
to put such a bunch of flowers there

729
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
waiting for you to pick it up.

730
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,850
How was I supposed to know that?

731
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,040
Director Lu bought it.

732
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,320
Well, he's certainly rich.

733
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,720
You wouldn't admire Director Lu,

734
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,800
would you?

735
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,080
I...

736
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,730
Really?

737
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,560
-You...
-Alright, I admire him.

738
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,450
I admit that.

739
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,360
What? Can't I?

740
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,610
Of course, you can.

741
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,040
You're not the first one

742
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,080
and you won't be the last.

743
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,040
Don't take

744
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,160
hopeless things so seriously, okay?

745
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,480
Bye.

746
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,910
I'm just gonna be the last one.

747
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,800
For dessert,

748
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,600
we have mango pudding

749
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,440
and chocolate mousse.

750
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
Which one do you prefer?

751
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,370
Mango pudding for two.

752
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,410
Alright, please give me a moment.

753
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,560
I know you like

754
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,250
mango pudding.

755
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:40,920
Yujiang,

756
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,040
Deer Sing needs
Jiang Cheng's production line.

757
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,480
These two companies

758
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,440
have been doing well together.

759
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,370
But, it has been a long time

760
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,650
and you still haven't signed the contract.

761
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,160
I want to know

762
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,010
what else do you want?

763
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,990
I'll move forward with the partnership.

764
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,560
-Okay.
-But,

765
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,640
you don't like

766
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,560
things you can get easily.

767
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,760
Besides this meal,

768
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,040
shouldn't you have something else

769
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,880
to offer?

770
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,560
The prices we set couldn't be changed.

771
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,880
Deer Sing can make certain compromises

772
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,600
to Jiang Cheng.

773
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,430
As soon as you come up with a plan,

774
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,080
we'll consider taking it.

775
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,720
We do need some new plans.

776
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,610
I understand that Jiang Cheng

777
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,750
hasn't got big projects

778
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,560
in recent years.

779
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,410
Deer Sing can ensure that

780
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,040
in the next few years,

781
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,090
you'll have a steady start-up rate.

782
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,840
A partnership like this

783
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,550
is a rare opportunity for you.

784
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,960
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.

785
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,080
For you,

786
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm just a business partner?

787
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,330
I think

788
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,350
we're still friends.

789
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,400
You think?

790
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,890
Lu Yiyao, you've always thought

791
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,320
that you know me well.

792
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,610
There's so much

793
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,880
you don't know about me.

794
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,310
You don't know that

795
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,680
I never like mango pudding.

796
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,400
You don't know that I like flowers,

797
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,390
but I don't like your attitude
when you send me flowers.

798
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,280
You don't know where I am,

799
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,130
whether I'm busy or hungry.

800
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,440
You never care.

801
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,120
You were just following

802
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,230
your standards

803
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,150
and playing the perfect fiance.

804
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,840
Weren't you?

805
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,120
Excuse me, Director Lu.

806
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,160
I have an appointment today

807
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,320
with Golden Horse Furniture.

808
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,560
Mr. Zhang's called me many times.

809
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,520
If I don't go, he'll feel offended.

810
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,960
We all don't want
to offend anyone in business.

811
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,080
Yujiang.

812
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:08,920
I'll give it to you

813
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,960
whatever you want.

814
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,930
I don't want our relationship

815
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:12,720
to affect the cooperation

816
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,710
between Deer Sing and Jiang Cheng.

817
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,240
Infinity

818
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,070
is important to Fangning.

819
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,410
After all these years,

820
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,730
you still care about her so much.

821
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:01,990
I'm sorry.

822
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,760
Let's call off the engagement.

823
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,190
As long as you wish,

824
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,230
you could use any excuse
to tell the public.

825
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:11,910
I'm sorry.

826
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,350
The number you dialed is

827
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,830
busy now.

828
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:16,850
Sorry.

829
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,280
The number you dialed is

830
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,720
busy now.

831
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,990
Sorry.

832
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,320
The number you dialed is

833
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,760
busy now.

834
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,150
Please try again later.

835
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,170
Clean up the room.

836
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,310
Lu Yiyao and I

837
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,040
will cancel our engagement.

838
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,470
Lu Yiyao.

839
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,640
Why do you think

840
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,070
I can handle all of this?

841
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,870
Why should I have to

842
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,130
be decent and sensible?

843
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,850
It's unfair.

844
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,370
You're the only one who's calm.

845
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,160
Fangning.

846
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,510
Let's have dinner tonight.

847
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,560
Bring your husband along.

848
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,000
I didn't make it

849
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,120
to your wedding.

850
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,910
Think of it as a celebration.

851
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,730
Okay, see you tonight.
