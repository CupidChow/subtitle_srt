00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,840
I don't know what's going on

6
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,170
between you two.

7
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
But listen to me carefully,

8
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,080
I won't let anyone

9
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,200
have any chance to hurt her.

10
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,789
Lu Yiyao,

11
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,009
I don't know what's going on

But listen to me,

14
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,800
the one who hurts her

15
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,160
definitely won't be me.

She founded Infinity

because of her past experience.

19
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,590
Throughout all these years,

20
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,010
she has always insisted on
founding Infinity.

21
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,950
That means she's never let it go.

22
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,680
It seems that she doesn't trust you
as I imagined

No.

27
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,079

28

Yeah, I must have.

37
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,560
it's only a contract for a year.

38
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,080

You did sleep well.

50
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,160
You slept like a pig.

51
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,250
You're the one who should take initiative.

Is it so difficult to get pregnant?

Okay, you can go on.

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,520
Here she is.

351
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,960
I'll leave you two here.

Peng Bo.

353
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,090
You stay here. Wait for a moment.

354
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,680
Dr. Ling, please help my dad.

355
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,130
Your father now has

356
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,680
congestive splenomegaly.

357
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,650
So I suggest

358
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,370
to receive a radical treatment

359
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,270
through surgery.

360
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,570
Is it very serious?

361
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,250
We can't make judgments now.

362
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,000
But if it's spleen lesions,

363
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,790
he should get diagnosed

364
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,080
and receive treatment as soon as possible.

365
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,090
I'll take your advice.
We'll do the surgery.

366
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,200
Okay.

367
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,760
I'll make you an admission notice.

368
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,120
Dr. Ling,

369
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,970
are you still willing

370
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,800
to do the surgery for my father?

371
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,800
Of course.

372
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
He is the patient. I'm a doctor.

373
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,920
It's my job to save a patient's life.

374
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,000
Alright, you've got
the patient ID card, right?

375
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,200
Go pay the fees.

376
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:41,840
How much should I give you

377
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,970
personally?

378
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,360
Are you a fool?

379
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,810
How could you say this in front of me?

380
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,120
I said I should go.

381
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,360
Don't listen to him.

382
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,400
We won't accept that.

383

Take this.

Go pay the fees.

385
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,480
Good for you.

386
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,760
Separate work from private interests.

387
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,730
Nice.

[Send to: Ling Rui]

390
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,080
come back tonight?

391
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,200
The condition of the patient at bed 22

392
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,400
is quite special.

393

His liver is normal

in size and shape.

395

But you see, it has a smooth
and neat contour,

as well as a clear membrane.

397

So be sure to observe closely

398
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,810
and pay attention to his temperature.

399

Keep an eye on him.

400

Dr. Peng, who is this woman?

401
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,560
She seems to have an unusual relationship

402

with Director Ling?

403
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,080
Another crazy fan of him.

404

Haven't you got used to this?

405

-Dad.
-You're can't be cured.

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,200
I think he just said that because

524
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,760
he didn't want to

525
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,690
make things awkward for you.

526
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,960
It was his fault anyway.

527
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:48,730
Sister.

528
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,250
Why don't you be proactive this time?

529
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,690
I heard from brother-in-law

530
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,730
that there is a nice restaurant

531
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,360
nearby the hospital.

532
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,000
Why don't you

533
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,570
deliver the food there in person

534
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,720
to impress him?

535
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,990
Sister,

536
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,880
I'm also a man.

537
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,200
I know what men like.

538
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,920
Lu Fangyu,

539
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,030
I can let you

540
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,720
get out right now,

541
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,510
you know?

542
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,400
-I know, I know.
-Get out.

543
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,240
Now.

544
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:15,760
Get out!

545
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,080
Okay, as you wish.

546
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,210
Sister, I'm your brother.

547
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,360
I'll definitely help you!

548
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,370
Get lost!

549
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,440
A man who said

550
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,280
he would obey the contract

551
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,710
hasn't come home
for two days in a row.

552
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,160
Should I stay at home,

553
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,530
waiting for him to break the contract?

554
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,520
Of course, no.

555
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,870
I have the duty to

556
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,520
remind him

557
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,970
and help him.

558
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Tang Ping?

559
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,840
Why are you here?

560
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,370
Dr. Ling

561
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,050
specially arranged the surgery

562
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
for my father right away

563
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,010
after he heard that my father was sick.

564
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,360
And, he stressed that

565
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,970
he'd do it personally.

566
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,970
He knew that

567
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,410
I don't like being around

568
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,640
too many people.

569
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:32,840
So,

570
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,880
he arranged

571
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
a single ward for my father.

572
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,610
So sweet.

573
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,210
What are you doing?

574
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,170
This is a hospital.

575
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,520
Behave yourself.

576
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,760
Listen, Tang Pingping.

577
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,010
Our Ling Rui is a doctor

578
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,130
who is considerate and responsible.

579
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,040
It's his duty

580
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,610
to take care of his patients

581
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,000
and their families.

582
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,840
That's nothing.

583
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,680
Single ward?

584
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,840
Let alone Ling Rui,

585
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,520
even Uncle Tang won't request that.

586
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,290
But you are quite good at

587
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,360
wasting national resources

588
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,560
without contributing.

589
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,920
-You...
-Alright.

590
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,930
Since I'm here,

591
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,080
just bring me to visit Uncle Tang.

592
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,370
No, let go of me!

593
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,400
Didn't you hear from them?

594
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,840
Both the man and the woman
are not married.

595
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,280
People in this hospital

596
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,080
don't know

597
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,850
he's married.

598
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,040
You say,

599
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,520
why didn't he tell others?

600
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,450
He doesn't want any trouble
when you get a divorce later, right?

601
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,330
Dr. Yang.

602
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,280
Tell her who I am.

603
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,000
The family member
of the patient of bed 2.

604
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,770
Be more specific.

605
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,810
A special family member of Director Ling.

606
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,320
Fangning, why are you here?

607
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,250
Sure enough, he isn't wearing the ring.

608
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
One-year term.

609
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,600
You remember that very clearly.

610
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,650
What do you mean?

611
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,160
You always say

612
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,080
that you will

613
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
obey the contract.

614
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,120
You accepted

615
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,850
another woman's cake

616
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,890
and be kind to another woman.

617
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,210
Is this how you

618
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,050
obey the contract?

619
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,800
Fangning,

620
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,320
can we have a talk calmly?

621
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,520
Am I talking to the air

622
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,400
right now?

623
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,400
Do you know that

624
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,040
when I'm alone at home,

625
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,720
all the people asked me

626
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,320
where you went

627
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,000
and when would you come back?

628
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,090
What can I tell them?

629
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:32,880
How come a newlywed husband

630
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,610
gets tied up

631
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,680
and can't come home?

632
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,090
I'm just worried that

633
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,130
we would be caught in a lie.

634
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,120
What about today?

635
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,690
I told everyone

636
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,330
you wouldn't come back,

637
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,280
and you showed up suddenly,

638
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,440
that embarrassed me.

639
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,050
Do you know that?

640
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,730
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

641
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
It's my fault.

642
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,250
That's all?

643
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,840
Ling Rui, let me ask you.

644
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,560
At the present time, do you ever

645
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,640
keep it in mind that

646
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,800
you're already married?

647
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,360
Do I have to?

648
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,160
Of course!

649
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,760
Newlyweds don't just say that

650
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,840
they love each other

651
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,080
and hold hands!

652
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,810
Look at us,

653
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,520
we don't look like

654
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,360
a newlywed couple at all!

655
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,360
I'm telling you,

656
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,040
if our lies are exposed,

657
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,810
it's your fault.
You're breaking the contract!

658
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,640
My fault?

659
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,400
I can finally work in

660
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,440
a splendid office building.

661
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,440
They are really elites,

662
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,520
looking so fancy.

663
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,600
But why should I

664
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,160
dress like this for work?

665
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,400
My feet ache.

666
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,200
Cai Siyu, you can do this.

667
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,760
Come on.

668
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,040
I'm coming.

669
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,960
There, falling, careful.

670
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:41,840
Good luck.

671
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,440
Missy,

672
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,200
are you from the "rookie village"?

673
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,840
You are not proficient
in your "equipment".

674
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,010
Mind your mouth, okay?

675
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,960
Don't hit on me.

676
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,290
I didn't.

677
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,240
Let me help you?

678
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,400
No need.

679
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,880
We're colleagues, let me help you.

680
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,040
Don't touch me.

681
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,970
Don't touch me!

682
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,410
-You...
-Shut up.

683
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,080
Director Lu.

684
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,080
I'm sorry.

685
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,200
You saw that.

686
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,570
She pushed me.

687
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,920
-She pushed me.
-Director Lu?

688
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,400
What are you talking about?

689
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,840
Why would I push you
if you didn't touch me?

690
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,080
I meant well.

691
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,160
Director Lu, I'm sorry.

692
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,240
I'm sorry.

693
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,360
Well... I'll go bring the cleaner over.

694
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,440
You!

695
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,560
Cai Siyu?

696
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,160
Director Lu.

697
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,630
Why are they together?

698
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,080
Cai Siyu.

699
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:49,990
What are you doing?

700
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,000
Why are you two together?

701
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,840
Oh my.

702
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,690
Did Ms. Lu misunderstand?

703
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,870
Simon.

704
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,550
-What's wrong with you?
-Ms. Lu, I...

705
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,240
I didn't do that.

706
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,450
Alright. Quit it.

707
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,130
You embarrassed the director
on your first day.

708
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,200
No bonus this month.

709
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,560
Let's go, Simon.

710
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,890
Go get it changed.

711
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,679
Tissue.

712
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,730
Ms. Lu...

713
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:28,679
I had my bonus canceled on my first day,

714
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,330
what should I do next?

715
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,320
Cai Siyu,

716
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:41,870
do you know why

717
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,050
I asked you to stay?

718
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,320
I don't really know.

719
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,370
The employee was sent by Ms. Lu.

720
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,949
How come it's you,

721
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,199
a rookie?

722
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,449
You dared spill coffee

723
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:56,449
all over Director Lu

724
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:57,330
on your first day at work?

725
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,720
No, I didn't do that.

726
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,160
You didn't, then I did?

727
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,640
How dare you slander me!

728
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,530
I did that, I did.

729
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,280
Stand up.

730
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,480
Have a seat.

731
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,880
You have a good attitude.

732
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,040
I'll just let you go.

733
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,720
Anyway, you'll be in

734
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,130
my Planning Department.

735
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,280
I'll back you in the future.

736
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,800
Thank you so much.

737
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,130
Hold on.

738
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,000
My last name is Lin. I'm Lin Qi.

739
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,400
You can call me

740
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,270
Leader Lin.

741
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,840
Hello, Leader Lin.

742
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,210
You can come to me

743
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,560
if you have any problem

744
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,680
about the company

745
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,080
in the future.

746
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,200
But,

747
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,880
you may not have the chance to do that.

748
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,000
You just pissed Director Lu off.

749
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,410
I assume you will not stay here
for a long time.

750
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,400
Is Director Lu

751
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,910
terrifying?

752
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,400
Terrifying?

753
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,170
More than that.

754
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,240
He is a legend, okay?

755
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,570
Legend?

756
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,240
Yeah.

757
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,330
What legend?

758
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,400
First,

759
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,920
there are two subordinates

760
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,800
who've worked with him for over a decade.

761
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,480
They've been sticking by him

762
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,530
no matter at home or abroad.

763
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,080
A leader's glamor.

764
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,240
He must be broad-minded then?

765
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,370
Not necessarily.

766
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,730
Second, although his last name is Lu,

767
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,880
he is not

768
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,690
relevant to the Lu Family.

769
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,920
He was adopted by Chairman Lu.

770
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,830
But he has helped our chairman,

771
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,000
and done many things that

772
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,130
our chairman wanted to do

773
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,210
but dared not do.

774
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,960
The mystery of his lot,
complicated and mysterious.

775
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,880
Exactly the standards of a male lead.

776
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,840
What else?

777
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,760
Just listen to me.

778
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,600
Third,

779
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,970
ten years ago,

780
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,400
he suddenly broke up

781
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,040
with his fiance

782
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,370
who was about to marry him.

783
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,560
No one knew what happened

784
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,120
and why.

785
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,400
Later,

786
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,410
Lu Yiyao went to Sweden for ten years

787
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,170
and never came back.

788
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,570
He was

789
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,130
traveling the world for love.

790
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,890
A rare love fool.

791
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,480
Anything else?

792
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,310
No more?

793
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,680
Except for the two subordinates
and the fiance,

794
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,250
no more juicy gossips

795
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,770
about Director Lu?

796
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,520
What's wrong with your eyes?

797
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,120
Well, Director Lu, I...

798
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,400
You're fooling me again.

799
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,760
Well done.

800
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,770
Come on.

801
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,290
What else do you want to know?

802
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,680
I can tell you in person.
