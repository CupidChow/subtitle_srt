4
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,009
Ms. Lu,

5
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,289
are we just eating bread for dinner?

6
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,700
Yes.

7
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,130
Eat up.

8
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,970
Don't choke on the bread.

9
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,370
Thank you.

10
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,010
Ms. Lu,

11
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,620
would you like to eat something else?

12
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,450
Ms. Lu, you...

13
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,130
What's wrong?

14
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,140
Are these bread so delicious

15
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,820
that it moved you to tears?

16
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,890
It tastes normal.

17
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,610
Even this kind of bread tastes bad

18
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,610
when you eat too much of it.

19
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,250
How awful Ling Rui must felt

20
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,570
when he had to keep eating those bread?

21
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,450
Come on.

22
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,530
Don't stop, keep eating.

23
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,650
We have to choose

24
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,770
the best bread.

25
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,329
I'll buy it for Ling Rui

26
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,300
when he comes back

27
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,490
from his business trip.

28
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,620
You're trying to force Dr. Ling

29
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,810
to recall his past misery
to accentuate his current happiness?

30
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,410
How can that be?

31
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,860
I'm replacing

32
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,660
his previous bad memories

33
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,740
with delightful flavors.

34
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,130
No, Ms. Lu.

35
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,170
In life,

36
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,940
there is countless great food.

37
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,180
Eating bread

38
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,610
is definitely not Dr. Ling's

39
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,290
dream.

40
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,579
You've gotten smarter.

41
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,690
How can eating bread

42
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,170
be a person's

43
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:34,970
lifelong dream?

44
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,010
I'm going to write

45
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,490
a wealth plan that generates
a million yuan income a year.

46
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,500
Ms. Lu,

47
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,090
can you write one for me first?

48
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,220
That'd be too slow.

49
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,340
Shall I give him some shares?

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,290
My fortune?

51
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,010
I'll let Gao Erfan do some checking.

52
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,300
No, no.

53
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,180
If you do that to Dr. Ling,

54
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,180
he'll be scared.

55
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,140
Girl, you're naive.

56
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,130
I'm trying to give him

57
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,900
a strong sense of security.

58
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,410
Previously,

59
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,580
I always thought that.

60
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,260
Ling Rui was a warm person.

61
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,610
But it turns out that

62
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,620
he had been through such painful days.

63
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,140
Ms. Lu,

64
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,130
are you sick?

65
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,610
What are you doing?

66
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,180
No, no.

67
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,770
I mean,

68
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,490
you love Dr. Ling so much.

69
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,290
Love?

70
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,940
Don't tell me that

71
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,450
you don't feel anything.

72
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,170
Ms. Lu,

73
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,010
do you know what you're doing?

74
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,570
I'm...

75
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,050
I'm just...

76
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,730
taking care of

77
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,380
the father of my future baby.

78
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,730
Only when my baby's father is in a good mood,

79
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,570
can the baby

80
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,580
be in a good mood.

81
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,490
I'm considering it from

82
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,260
a genetic point of view.

83
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,050
Let me put it this way.

84
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,060
Even if you're lying to Dr. Ling that

85
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,250
you don't want a baby.

86
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,490
But what about then?

87
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,860
Having a baby

88
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,300
is not what Dr. Ling wants.

89
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,980
Will you force him?

90
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,130
Ms. Lu,

91
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,010
have you ever been in a relationship?

92
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,820
Don't tell me you have been single since birth?

93
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,300
What?

94
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,050
Single since birth? What do you mean?

95
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,020
It means that

96
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,210
you've never been in love

97
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,740
ever since you were born.

98
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,460
How is that possible?

99
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,180
Tell me about it.

100
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,260
How many times have you been in a relationship?

101
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,810
Or I wouldn't believe you.

102
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,060
This many?

103
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,850
One.

104
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,090
Strictly speaking, it's one point five.

105
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,770
Why is there a decimal point?

106
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,980
It's the kind of situation

107
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,659
where he thought he's in a relationship with me.

108
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,540
But I was actually taking him as a subject.

109
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,220
His family sells soy sauce.

110
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,010
Okay, okay, this doesn't count.

111
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,610
What about the remaining one?

112
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,020
That was a

113
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,060
serious relationship.

114
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:56,900
Later on,

115
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,890
because of some reason,

116
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,050
we broke up,

117
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,530
I was even a little sad.

118
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,860
At that time,

119
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,450
he confessed his love to me

120
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,660
and gave me a box of chocolates.

121
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,900
I gave him a gift back.

122
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,730
What did you give him?

123
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,060
I don't know if you've bought one before.

124
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,210
Those stickers,

125
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,980
the puffy ones.

126
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,220
Not the normal kinds.

127
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,370
I remembered it was quite expensive.

128
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,410
Five yuan for one sticker sheet.

129
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,570
Did you buy one before?

130
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,700
I did.

131
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,010
How old were you?

132
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,380
Seven or eight.

133
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,170
I can't really remember.
It happened when I was in Grade 3.

134
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,690
That can't be counted as a relationship.

135
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,170
It doesn't count?

136
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,050
What is love then?

137
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,220
Love is when I...

138
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,409
He...

139
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,610
You're back.

140
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,300
I'm cooking.

141
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,490
♫ Even the pedestrians look like him ♫

142
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,490
♫ Even the sky won't stop crying ♫

143
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,330
What's the matter?

144
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,409
You're really back?

145
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,770
How come you are back?

146
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,370
They were conducting air traffic control today.

147
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,460
The flight was canceled.

148
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,340
We had conference calls

149
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,250
the whole day.

150
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,570
You are cooking.

151
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,810
I bought some vegetables

152
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,260
on my way back.

153
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,010
How's your day today?

154
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,850
How was work?

155
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,730
Pretty good.

156
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,370
We exchanged many new technologies

157
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,170
with specialists in pancreatic diseases.

158
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,340
I heard that in Germany,

159
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,930
they have new adjuvant therapies

160
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,450
and there have been successful cases.

161
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,290
I'm so glad.

162
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:10,970
Will you feel bored

163
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,130
if I talk about these?

164
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,290
No, I won't.

165
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,210
I like it.

166
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,290
What else did you do?

167
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,610
I had lunch with my colleagues.

168
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,170
In the afternoon,

169
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,820
we had a brief exchange.

170
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,530
Nothing else.

171
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,130
How about you?

172
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,330
I...

173
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,260
I was busy making money.

174
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,340
Nothing much.

175
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,530
You must be tired

176
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,610
after having a long day.

177
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,169
You don't have to cook.

178
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,169
Let's dine out.

179
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:35,940
It will be my treat.

180
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,580
Do you want Japanese or French cuisine?

181
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,490
Well...

182
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,140
If you don't like it,

183
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,820
you can treat me, too.

184
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,260
I'm fine with whatever you like.

185
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,330
I like the feeling of

186
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,490
eating with my family.

187
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,740
I'd like to cook for them.

188
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,730
I won't get tired of that.

189
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,810
Well then, I like it too.

190
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,860
What's the matter with you today?

191
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,530
Why do you keep looking at me?

192
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,060
You cried?

193
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,530
No.

194
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,170
Probably because that

195
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,970
I haven't rested well these two days.

196
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,980
I suppose so.

197
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,860
No one would dare to bully you.

198
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,850
Except for you.

199
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,490
Nothing.

200
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:53,970
Ling Rui.

201
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,450
Today,

202
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,820
I really, really

203
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,140
want to hug you today.

204
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,660
Can I hug you?

205
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:04,780
Sure.

206
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,820
I have to get some ingredients.

207
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,170
Okay.

208
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,460
Fangning,

209
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,650
why are you acting

210
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,490
like a child today?

211
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,370
Come on.

212
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,330
I can't cook like this.

213
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,770
It's fine.

214
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,410
Go on.

215
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,690
Fangning, come on.

216
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,660
Come.

217
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:00,970
Here.

218
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,090
Stand still.

219
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,420
Stand against the wall.

220
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:05,850
Don't move.

221
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:06,650
What's wrong?

222
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,010
What are you doing?

223
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,980
What's wrong?

224
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,090
Put your back against it.

225
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,010
Don't let it fall off.

226
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:22,900
Hold these.

227
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,170
Grab tight.

228
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,490
Don't move.

229
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,850
Dinner will be ready soon.

230
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,330
Just wait a bit more.

231
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:33,730
Be good.

232
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,450
If... If you do this,

233
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,260
I can't move.

234
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,970
That's the point.

235
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,450
Or there's no way I can cook.

236
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:56,980
Well then...

237
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,970
What can be called as

238
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,410
love?

239
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,050
Love is when you care

240
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,100
if the person is happy or not.

241
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,570
All your emotions

242
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,810
are influenced by him.

243
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,570
Is he really not a fool?

244
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,090
I don't want to force him

245
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,050
to do what he doesn't want to.

246
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,300
You want to help him realize all his wishes.

247
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,370
You want to give him your most important things.

248
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,050
All of it.

249
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,250
Ling Rui,

250
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,250
I would like to officially inform you that

251
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,380
I want us

252
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,530
to start...

253
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,900
I'll open the door.

254
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,050
That's fine.

255
00:12:59,250 --> 00:12:59,980
I'll go.

256
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,170
Who's that?

257
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,290
Who?

258
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,730
Lu Fangning,

259
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,530
you are just forcing him!

260
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,740
Tang Pingping,

261
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,380
why are you making a scene here at my house?

262
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,340
I didn't expect that

263
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,690
you would use their family debt

264
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,970
to force him to marry you.

265
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,580
I'm warning you.

266
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,850
Slander is also a crime.

267
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,100
I did not slander.

268
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,940
I found out about everything.

269
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,210
Your marriage with him

270
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,730
was fake from the beginning.

271
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,930
You're not saying anything?

272
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:42,970
You're admitting it?

273
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,730
Shut up.

274
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,100
You forced him with money.

275
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,090
You don't love him at all.

276
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,930
Who gives you the right

277
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,850
to speculate

278
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,850
my feelings?

279
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,620
Tang Pingping,

280
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,140
listen carefully.

281
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,770
How did Ling Rui and I meet

282
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,970
is none of your business.

283
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,340
Besides, I'm telling you.

284
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,930
My feelings for him are real.

285
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,810
As long as he's happy,

286
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,020
I'll be happy.

287
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
If he is not,

288
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,650
I'll try my best to make him happy.

289
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,810
I won't let him do anything

290
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,890
that he doesn't like.

291
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,610
On the contrary,

292
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,940
I will give him

293
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,050
my most precious things.

294
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,660
For the first time since I was a child,

295
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,770
I now understand

296
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,820
what it is like to truly love a person.

297
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,100
That's right.

298
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,850
Yes.

299
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,060
I love him.

300
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,090
♫ My dear, I have three hearts for you ♫

301
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,930
♫ Listen to this carefully,
this shall not be done half-heartedly ♫

302
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,260
I finally said it.

303
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,010
It feels so good.

304
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,170
Dr. Ling...

305
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,050
Ms. Tang,

306
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,540
Fangning and I have a happy marriage.

307
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:44,980
Thank you for your concern.

308
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,100
Sorry for hurting your eyes.

309
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,090
Are you satisfied now?

310
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,530
Now,

311
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,810
please...

312
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,890
get out of our house.

313
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,810
Your hand.

314
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,650
I hate you!

315
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,530
Close the door.

316
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,530
Darn it.

317
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,210
Lu Fangning,

318
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,490
just wait and see.

319
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,210
I will definitely

320
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,140
get Ling Rui back!

321
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,250
I won't lose to you.

322
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,290
♫ I'm moved beyond my expectation ♫

323
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,130
It's cold.

324
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,620
How dare you chase me out?

325
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,570
One day,

326
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,940
it will be your turn, Lu Fangning!

327
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:39,420
Hmph!

328
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,610
Hmph!

329
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,810
You...

330
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,530
don't hate vegetables anymore?

331
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,370
I'll buy more vegetables tomorrow.

332
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,300
No.

333
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,730
Anything is fine.

334
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,770
I'm fine with anything.

335
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,250
Ling Rui,

336
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,060
don't you...

337
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,050
have anything to say?

338
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,980
Like what?

339
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,250
About my confession

340
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,450
to you tonight,

341
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,340
don't you have anything to say?

342
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:48,940
Isn't that

343
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,180
an excuse

344
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,130
to make Tang Ping give up?

345
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,370
I have thousands of other reasons

346
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,540
to make her give up.

347
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,060
Why would I bother to say all those things?

348
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,690
Perhaps

349
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,370
that is the most convenient one.

350
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,380
Ling Rui, look at me.

351
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,619
Look at me.

352
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,900
In all seriousness,

353
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,250
I'll tell you once again.

354
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,369
I love you.

355
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,210
You've said that many times.

356
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:23,819
This time...

357
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,460
I really love you.

358
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,530
I mean it. It's true.

359
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,130
No,

360
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,090
you were just being impulsive

361
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,500
to upset Tang Ping.

362
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,980
I don't know

363
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,970
what happened to you today.

364
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,850
But love

365
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,130
is not something so casual.

366
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,050
I'm full. I'll go back to my room.

367
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,650
Tell me when you're done.

368
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,050
I'll clean up.

369
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,210
You are so stupid.

370
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,260
Who wants to have a baby with you?

371
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,890
You get what you deserve.

372
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,490
This time,

373
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,170
I really love you.

374
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:24,900
I mean it.

375
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,050
It's true.

376
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,390
[The CEO's Sweetheart]

377
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,260
I've tried everything.

378
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,730
What do you want me to do?

379
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,770
Ling Rui,

380
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,810
I love you.

381
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,490
Ling Rui,

382
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,370
I love you.

383
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,450
Ling Rui works in the hospital every day.

384
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,050
I think he's probably

385
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,170
fed up with a white coat.

386
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,100
No.

387
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,370
This is good.

388
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,210
I'm not wearing anything under this.

389
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,090
It looks sexy.

390
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:54,730
Ling Rui.

391
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,570
No.

392
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,090
It will bring back

393
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,220
all the bad memories to him.

394
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,460
Why?

395
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,130
Why do I have to dress up like this?

396
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,210
[Even if she said she was not being impulsive]

397
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,570
[or because she wanted to win,]

398
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,410
[but it's because]

399
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,060
[everything feels new when she's with me.]

400
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,090
[It will fade away soon.]

401
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,930
The wealth plan that generates
a million yuan income a year?

402
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,130
Half of your fortune?

403
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,530
All of your fortune?

404
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,140
Aren't you the one

405
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,730
who suggested them, Ms. Lu?

406
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,060
It worked before.

407
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,450
How come it doesn't now?

408
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,890
That's right.

409
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,050
It worked before.

410
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,650
How come it doesn't now?

411
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,170
Did you get rejected

412
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,050
by Dr. Ling?

413
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,090
I mean...

414
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,660
Ms. Lu, your love for Dr. Ling

415
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,050
has gotten deeper.

416
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,690
The more you care about him,

417
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,500
the more insecure you feel.

418
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,250
Insecure...

419
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,940
I never thought that one day,

420
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,930
this word

421
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,300
will be related to me.

422
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,570
You know what?

423
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,460
Even if I gave Ling Rui

424
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,210
the wealth plan

425
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,530
and all my fortune,

426
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,570
Ling Rui won't accept it.

427
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,260
Why?

428
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,650
He has such a great personality.

429
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,450
His job is to heal the wounded
and rescue the dying.

430
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,370
After he gets off work,

431
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,850
he continues to do that.

432
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,180
He saves more people

433
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,090
and treats more wounds.

434
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,170
More importantly, it's for free.

435
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,250
So,

436
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,690
compared with Ling Rui,

437
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,250
I'm nothing.

438
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,140
From now on,

439
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,580
I want to be like him.

440
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,530
Be a warm person,

441
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,940
a noble person,

442
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,490
a perfect match for him.

443
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,210
A woman who really matches him.

444
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,890
I want to be

445
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,330
an angel.

446
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,580
Ms. Lu,

447
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,690
you are an angel.

448
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,490
Do you lack money?

449
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,930
Do you want the watch?

450
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,860
I see you haven't

451
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,570
had a watch.

452
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,810
-This watch is expensive.
-No, Ms. Lu.

453
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:08,700
Dad.

454
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,900
Come on.

455
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,530
Daddy.

456
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,820
How much do you want?

457
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:23,820
80,000 yuan?

458
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,850
No.

459
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,170
8,000 yuan? No problem.

460
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,260
No.

461
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,330
IOU.

462
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,530
I, Tang Ping will borrow four million yuan

463
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,250
from my father, Tang Dawei.

464
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,250
I will definitely pay off the debt.

465
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,450
Debit holder, Tang Ping.

466
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,900
Right.

467
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,090
Pingping.

468
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,140
Tell me honestly.

469
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,330
Did you do something

470
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,530
very bad?

471
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,650
I didn't break the law.

472
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,530
That's right.

473
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,770
You are not capable of doing that.

474
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,490
But,

475
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,970
you're not that capable,

476
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,330
someone else can be.

477
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,490
Tell me the truth.

478
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,900
Did someone deceive you?

479
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,340
Did they brainwash you?

480
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,460
No.

481
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,490
What are you talking about?

482
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,050
Are you lending me or not?

483
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,450
If you are not, I'll go to uncle Lu.

484
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,820
You didn't break the law?

485
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,690
No.

486
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,570
You must have been deceived then.

487
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,850
I told you earlier

488
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,770
that you're not clever.

489
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,900
You don't believe me.

490
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,250
Did some jerk

491
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,420
ask you for four million yuan?

492
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,370
Is it?

493
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,050
Jerk?

494
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,580
Yes.

495
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,530
Tell me, what kind of man

496
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,650
would simply ask a girl

497
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,050
for four million yuan?

498
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,570
Doesn't that make him a jerk?

499
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,940
Lu Fangning gave Dr. Ling

500
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,850
four million yuan.

501
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,170
That makes Dr. Ling a jerk?

502
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,450
If I told Uncle Lu

503
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,730
and everyone the truth,

504
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,490
they will think that

505
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,770
Dr. Ling is a jerk.

506
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,890
I can't say anything.

507
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,210
Are you lending me or not?

508
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,650
No.

509
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,810
Are you lending me or not?

510
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,420
No!

511
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,850
Yes or no?

512
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,490
Where is that jerk?

513
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,290
Ask him to come here.

514
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,410
I'll give it to him.

515
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,410
I'll give him four hundred slaps!

516
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,930
There's no one like that, no!

517
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,180
It's not like that!

518
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,090
What is it then?

519
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,900
I want to get plastic surgery!

520
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,130
To look like Lu Fangning.

521
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,220
All right?

522
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,330
Plastic surgery?

523
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,730
To look like Lu Fangning?

524
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,660
Any amount of money will do.

525
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,770

But you'll be able to do it after a year.

553

A year later,

554

you don't have to wait for me.

Neither will we, in the future,

573

00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,680
How's that?

873
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,490
I'm sure all of you can feel

874
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,010
their generosity.

875
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,350
Xinbao, do you feel it?

876
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,740
Yes.

877
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,040
Right. Of course,

878
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,340
the way we show love

879
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,770
may not just through

880
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,990
this auction.

881
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,670
I'm sure there will be

882
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,420
other ways

883
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,470
and opportunities

884
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,440
waiting for both of you.

885
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,400
You're right.

886
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,580
Therefore,

887
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,630
I hereby announce that

888
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,730
I've decided to fund

889
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,780
one-year medical expenses

890
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,380
for ten poor children

891
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,760
in this hospital.

892
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,340
I'll fund 20 children!

893
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,310
30 children.

894
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,920
Dr. Ling.

895
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,510
Xinbao.

896
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,070
I would like to have this painting, too.

897
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,170
But...

898
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,180
I only have 2,000 yuan.

899
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,360
Can I have it?

900
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,110
Xinbao,

901
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,830
what is your decision?

902
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,730
Okay.

903
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,620
I drew a portrait of Dr. Ling.

904
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,600
So I'll sell it to Dr. Ling.

905
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,920
2,000 yuan, deal. Congratulations!

906
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,810
Now, let's have

907
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,070
all the successful bidders

908
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,500
come up on stage for a group photo.

909
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,200
Why do we have this session?

910
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,600
What's wrong with this session?

911
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,780
Don't worry, my sister-in-law.

912
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,120
Don't worry.

913
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,630
I'll make sure to tell everything

914
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,470
to Ling Rui.

915
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,430
Okay, let's give them a big hand.

916
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,180
Listen.

917
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,150
I can paint, too. I sell it for 500 yuan.

918
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,370
I'll give you 1,000 yuan to shut up.

919
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,340
Bye, Dr. Ling.

920
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,360
Fangning.

921
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,670
Bye.

922
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,520
It's okay.

923
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,670
I'll get back to work.

924
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,430
You should go as well.

925
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,740
Ling Rui, actually I...

926
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,830
I'm very busy.

927
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,050
Let's talk about it when we're at home.

928
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,780
No, we'll talk about it next time.

929
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,260
That's it.

930
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:55,970
I'm returning to my ward.

931
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,570
That's it?

932
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,160
Forget it, okay?

933
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,090
Why?

934
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,870
Because I don't like it.

935
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,460
I don't like that

936
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,850
you could say those three words so easily.

937
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,280
I don't like that you are competing

938
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,580
over such things.

939
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,550
So let's just drop it, okay?

940
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,020
Why would you think so?

941
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,740
Who told you that?

942
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,870
Who told you I was being insincere?

943
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,840
Tang Ping?

944
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,850
Why did you choose to believe her

945
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,520
but not me?

946
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,950
I don't believe her.

947
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,880
I believe what I know about you.

948
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,680
Who are you

949
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,890
to judge me?

950
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,620
I've never done that

951
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,830
to anyone else.

952
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,180
I was not acting recklessly

953
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,350
or competing with anyone.

954
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,610
What can I do

955
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,040
to make you believe me?

956
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,220
Should I sponsor more patients for your sake?

957
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,560
Is that okay?

958
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,170
I'm... I'm sorry.

959
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,070
Did I say something wrong again?

960
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:43,810
Ling Rui,

961
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,990
I did all of these

962
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,170
because I want to

963
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,300
get closer to you.

964
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,530
I hope you can truly

965
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,410
fall in love with me.

966
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,800
I admit what I did to you before

967
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,600
was on the spur of the moment.

968
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,330
But when these spontaneous moments

969
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,880
come together,

970
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,360
it then becomes an indisputable fact that

971
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,720
I love...

972
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,650
Believe me.

973
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,710
When you're no longer impulsive

974
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,510
and competitive,

975
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,020
you won't feel the same anymore.

976
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,900
Don't say anything

977
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,160
that you're not sure of.

978
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,180
That's all I'm going to say.

979
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,320
I'm leaving.

980
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,970
Our brand

981
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,570
is the leading brand
in the home furnishing industry.

982
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,700
We have the ability to

983
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,380
lead the main trends of the market.

984
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,570
Compared to our brand,

985
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,200
our competitors use crude materials

986
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,210
and apply irrational structures.

987
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,090
In contrast,

988
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:46,810
Infinity

989
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,280
is the lightest and strongest.

990
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,760
Adjourn.

991
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,770
That's it for my love life?

992
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,340
It wilted before it even started.

993
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,950
Where's my next episode?

994
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,850
Where is the next episode?

995
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,280
The next episode is coming.

996
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:37,960
Director Lu.

997
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:41,370
Lin Qi.

998
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,050
Director Lu.

999
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,260
Siyu.

1000
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,420
Siyu.

1001
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,980
You've got something to say?

1002
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,690
Carry on with your work then.

1003
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:03,790
Go on.

1004
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,380
The proposal that you just gave me

1005
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,510
is not like what you said.

1006
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,190
Have a look at it.

1007
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,330
Sure, I'll check it.

1008
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,390
I'll hand it to you in a while.

1009
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,560
Yes, please do.

1010
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:20,720
I'm sorry.
