[Episode 13]

4
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,479
The proposal that you just gave me

5
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,600
is not like what you said.

6
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,280
Have a look at it.

7
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,400
Sure, I'll check it.

8
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,479
I'll hand it to you in a while.

9
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,640
Yes, please do.

10
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,800
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,280
These flowers...

12
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,370
Director Lu threw

13
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,000
these flowers away last time.

14
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,960
I bumped into you accidentally last time.

15
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,960
It's okay.

17
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,880
Director, we have good news.

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,850
We found a new factory to replace Jiang Cheng.

19
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,040
The equipment specifications
of the production line,

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,960
quality data,

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,160
price, and location are all suitable.

22
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,800
Who negotiated with this factory?

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,410
Manager Wang from the Production Department.

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,600
Is there a problem?

25
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,770
Let's talk about it in my office.

26
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,040
He's so cute.

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,760
My heart.

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,640
She's fangirling.

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,800
I like the feeling of

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,120
eating with my family.

31
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,080
I'm willing to cook for them.

32
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,400
This is the President

33
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,600
of Shanghai Cuisine Professional Association,

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,560
Expert of Jiangnan Food Culture

Communication Center,

36
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,840
Honorary President of the
Yangtze River Delta Famous Chefs Association,

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,600
Chairman of the
World Chinese Cuisine Association,

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,320
also known as the Culinary King of
Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cuisine, Chef Guo.

39
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,600
Ms. Lu, may I ask

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,040
what kind of dishes
would you like to learn today?

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,079
As long as you can say it,

42
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,240
there is nothing I can't cook.

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Stir-fried vegetables.

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,960
Isn't this a little too perfect?

45
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,280
♫ Makes me believe in destiny ♫

46
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,040
♫ I'm moved beyond my expectation ♫

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,160
One more teaspoon.

48
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,280
♫ I know the future is too uncertain ♫

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,960
Smart.

50
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,839
Sadfishing

51
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,720
is not my style.

52
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,780
♫ My dear, I have three hearts for you ♫

53
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,640
♫ Listen to this carefully,
this shall not be done half-heartedly ♫

54
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,120
♫ You must love and give with all your heart ♫

55
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
♫ I'll love you well ♫

56
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,800
♫ When I speak of love,
I mean it wholeheartedly ♫

57
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,520
♫ To prove that
you'll always be my one and only ♫

58
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:57,080
♫ From now on, my heartbeat, pulse, and breath ♫

59
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,520
You're back.

60
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm back.

61
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
Change your shoes here.

62
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,120
I'll do it by myself.

63
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,600
It's okay. It's okay.

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,200
I'll help you.

65
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:05,880
Thank you.

66
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,570
How was everything in the hospital today?

67
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,720
How was your work?

68
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,840
Were you busy? Tired?

69
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,880
It was okay.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,040
That's good then.

71
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,480
I'll wash my hands first.

72
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,920
The vegetables that you like,

73
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,610
fish,

74
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Mapo tofu

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,520
and the soup that I made.

76
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,760
I cooked all of these myself.

77
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,159
Did you really...

78
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,200
cook all of these?

79
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,159
Of course,

80
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,400
I learned from the chef

81
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
for several hours.

82
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,250
The chef also said that

83
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,640
a smart person

84
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,840
can indeed do everything well.

85
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,120
He said that I had

86
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,520
some talent for cooking.

87
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,920
Have a try.

88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,520
If you think they're good,

89
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,880
I'll cook for you more often in the future.

90
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,120
Let me get you some soup.

91
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,200
Thank you.

92
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,160
Try it.

93
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,320
Taste it.

94
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,240
Is it good?

95
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,330
Is it too salty?

96
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,320
You know, it's my first time.

97
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,040
And...

98
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,480
the chef wasn't with me

99
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,360
so I don't know

100
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,640
how much salt to add.

101
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,409
But I will try

102
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:38,600
to improve my cooking skills.

103
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,560
If you have the time,

104
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,040
you may teach me, too.

105
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,480
Fangning,

106
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,120
I said

107
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,370
I don't want you to act like this.

108
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,680
What do you mean?

109
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
Didn't you say

110
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,080
you like the feeling of

111
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,480
eating with your family?

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's why I tried so hard

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
to cook so many dishes.

114
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,160
I want you to feel at home.

115
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,520
You

116
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,200
don't like it?

117
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,960
Do you like it?

118
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,720
Lu Fangning,

119
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,280
although we

120
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,520
started this lie together,

121
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,600
I really don't like to lie.

122
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,160
I hate it more

123
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,800
when you keep telling another lie.

124
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,760
I'm not lying.

125
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
I'm showing you

126
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,650
my sincerity.

127
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,240
I mean it.

128
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,080
Because I love…

129
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,040
Okay.

130
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,800
If you don't like it,

131
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,640
I won't say it.

132
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,240
All right?

133
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,360
But I want you to know that,

134
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,240
Ling Rui,

135
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,000
no matter how much you try to avoid,

136
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,240
you can't resist

137
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
my feelings for you.

138
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,440
Why do you want to run away?

139
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,360
Are your feelings for me real?

140
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,960
I saw the takeaway packages for

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,040
these dishes

142
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,760
in the trash can outside.

143
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,120
Don't tell me

144
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
someone else has ordered

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,640
the exact same dishes

146
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,880
as these on the table.

147
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,680
But how can takeaway food

148
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,880
taste so salty?

149
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,760
You're a smart person.

150
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,040
To pretend that you cooked all of these dishes,

151
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,160
you deliberately added more salt.

152
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,200
Lu Fangning.

153
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,200
Liking someone,

154
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,600
love,

155
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,240
sincerity,

156
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,360
are never something

157
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,640
to be said so casually.

158
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,280
The reason you can keep saying it

159
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,039
as if it means nothing

160
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,559
is because...

161
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,320
For you,

162
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,490
lying is something that can be easily done.

163
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,370
Whether it's the cooking this time

164
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,360
or the charity auction.

165
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,680
You always think that

166
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,320
money can solve all problems.

167
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,120
But you never consider

168
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,930
other people's feelings.

169
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,680
You just want to achieve

170
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,760
your own purposes.

171
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,000
This may be your

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
way of doing things.

173
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,760
But please don't do it in

174
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,240
such a way

175
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,400
to mess with my feelings

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,960
and my life.

177
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,560
Let us calm down a little.

178
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,800
I'm not eating.

179
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,240
I don't consider your feelings?

180
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,720
You know what?

181
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,720
It is you who

182
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,330
are inconsiderate of others' feelings

183
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,440
and trampled on someone's heart.

184
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,040
Not me.

185
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,800
Ling Rui,

186
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,160
do you think

187
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,440
I lied about everything I said?

188
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,840
So what am I supposed to do?

189
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,920
Imitate the stories in romance novels

190
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,680
and dramas,

191
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,960
get drunk and tell the truth?

192
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,290
As if no matter what the person says,

193
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,320
as long as he is drunk,

194
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,610
people will believe what he said.

195
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,360
Sure.

196
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,480
You don't believe me, do you?

197
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,560
I'll show you

198
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
how to get drunk and tell the truth.

199
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,120
Drinking will not solve the problem.

200
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,960
Lu Fangning,

201
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,520
give it to me.

202
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,600
Give me the wine.

203
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,610
Stop drinking!

204
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,560
Give it to me!

205
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,720
What are you doing?

206
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,720
Don't worry.

207
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,760
I can't get drunk.

208
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,050
Why?

209
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,240
To socialize with my business partners,

210
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,800
I drink wine at home every day.

211
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,120
So, I can't get drunk.

212
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,680
If I can't get drunk

213
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,570
in my life,

214
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,520
are you never going to trust me

215
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,800
in your life?

216
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,440
I, Lu Fangning,

217
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,640
have never acted like this before.

218
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,680
Back then,

219
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,640
if I did something good,

220
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,400
I would go on broadcast

221
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,240
and tell the whole world

222
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,520
that I did it.

223
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,640
If I cut

224
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,680
one of my fingers,

225
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,280
I would bandage

226
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,200
the rest of my fingers

227
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,680
and show them to you.

228
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,200
But what about now?

229
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,960
I feel insecure every day.

230
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,120
I'm cautious.

231
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,880
All I can think about is

232
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,320
if you will be happy

233
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,760
if you will be pleased.

234
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,320
What I have done wrong?

235
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,960
What I have done wrong?

236
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,000
You think that

237
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,080
I have disturbed your life.

238
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,600
Haven't you

239
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,250
disturbed mine, too?

240
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,800
Ling Rui,

241
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,240
if you don't like me,

242
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,680
you can reject me.

243
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,280
Just reject me.

244
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,840
Why do you

245
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,960
repeatedly

246
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,440
deny my feelings

247
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,800
and my love for you?

248
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,800
Is it because it makes you look

249
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,600
better and superior?

250
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,520
Lu Fangning.

251
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
Stop talking. Stop!

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,680
I hate you!

253
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,920
Ling Rui,

254
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,640
from now on,

255
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,040
I hate you.

256
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,000
Fangning!

257
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,120
Ms. Lu's parcel.

258
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,400
Okay, thank you.

259
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,280
I suggest you check it in my presence.

260
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,320
Okay.

261
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,720
Please open the package then.

262
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,290
Okay.

263
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,000
Thank you.

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,760
You're welcome.

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,480
I feel insecure every day.

266
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,640
I'm cautious.

267
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,450
All I can think about is

268
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,760
if you will be happy

269
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,240
if you will be pleased.

270
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,840
What I have done is wrong?

271
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,760
What I have done is wrong?

272
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,720
If I cut

273
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,840

274
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,360

I'll do it by myself.

283

Yes.

Stir-fry it.

00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,480
The factory under Jiang Cheng Group

347
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,690
is also here?

348
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,530
Yes.

349
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,040
The whole area belongs to Jiang Cheng Group.

350
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,160
Amend these again.

351
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,290
Okay.

352
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,810
You guys may go first.

353
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,650
Okay. Okay.

354
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,800
Dr. Ling,

355
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,880
what a coincidence.

356
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,120
Hi, Ms. Qin.

357
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,120
I happened to be giving
free medical consultations nearby.

358
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,520
It's not exactly a coincidence.

359
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,920
I want to talk to you.

360
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,840
Talk to me?

361
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,960
Are you here

362
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,800
to speak for Fangning

363
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,920
this time?

364
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,280
I don't know what happened

365
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,520
between you two in business.

366
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,640
I'm not trying to persuade you.

367
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,240
But I want to do

368
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,330
something for her.

369
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,680
Since I happened

370
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,000
to meet you here.

371
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,120
Sometimes, I do

372
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,570
envy Lu Fangning.

373
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,250
She speaks her mind

374
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,320
and is comfortable in her own skin.

375
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,930
Now,

376
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,480
she has a good husband like you.

377
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,840
No one can really understand

378
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,560
other people's lives.

379
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,200
Maybe

380
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,160
she envies you, Ms. Qin.

381
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,480
Did she tell you that?

382
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,160
I don't believe it.

383
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,200
Maybe

384
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,970
she likes you.

385
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,320
She likes me?

386
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,960
What does she like about me?

387
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,120
Both of you

388
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,960
share many similarities.

389
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,730
Lately,

390
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
I don't think

391
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,640
I know myself very well.

392
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,120
What do I look like?

393
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,570
What do I really want?

394
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,160
Perhaps, it's not that you don't know yourself.

395
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,560
You are just afraid to face yourself.

396
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,480
Ms. Qin, do you know?

397
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,560
Fever

398
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,360
is actually a way for the body

399
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,440
to protect and repair itself.

400
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,600
It's the white blood cells

401
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,920
fighting against viruses and bacteria.

402
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,440
When they win,

403
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,440
the symptoms will go away naturally.

404
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,400
The immune system will also be strengthened.

405
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,960
So, instead of forcing the fever down,

406
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,290
leaving it alone

407
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,120
maybe better.

408
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,600
You don't have to worry

409
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,920
or be afraid.

410
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,850
Humans are strong.

411
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,600
When you heal,

412
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,650
you will naturally become a better person.

413
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,280
What are you trying to say?

414
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,570
I want to say that

415
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,560
I hope Ms. Qin can

416
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,800
recover soon.

417
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,680
Consider it as my heartfelt thanks.

418
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
For not making Fangning bear the harm

419
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,040
that was brought upon you in the past.

420
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,480
These are the factory's production line data

421
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,400
that you have submitted

422
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,880
and the results of our review.

423
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,520
Is that so?

424
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,080
Is there any difference?

425
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
This number is different by 0.01.

426
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,480
The factory was being careless.

427
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,960
They are too irresponsible.

428
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,440
I'll question them.

429
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,240
Director Lu,

430
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,960
in my opinion,

431
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,890
Manager Wang is still reluctant

432
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,680
to tell the truth.

433
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
However,

434
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,000
I've recorded

435
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,440
what he just said.

436
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,520
As evidence, it should be enough.

437
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,200
Bring the recording and these materials

438
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,040
to the lawyer.

439
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Ask him to look into it.

440
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,640
Director Lu.

441
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
I was wrong.

442
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,680
Please let me off this time.

443
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,720
Just this once.

444
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,880
I'll find a new factory right away.

445
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Listen to yourself.

446
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,360
You should have realized your mistakes

447
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,000
before you did it.

448
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,320
Director Lu, I didn't want it to happen either.

449
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,370
This tiny difference

450
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,840
is negligible.

451
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,840
Otherwise,

452
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,920
I'll return all the money that

453
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,280
I've received.

454
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
I can even return the money to the company.

455
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,490
I mean it, Director Lu.

456
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,760
I have realized my mistake now.

457
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,840
I promise.

458
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,850
I promise to be loyal to the company

459
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,760
and work extra hard

460
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
from now on.

461
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,250
It seems that your problem

462
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,130
is more serious than I thought.

463
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,320
What?

464
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,440
Although we

465
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,920
found out that data was wrong,

466
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,080
we don't have any direct evidence

467
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,000
to prove that you took bribes.

468
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,200
Now that you've admitted it yourself,

469
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,320
we can only leave the rest

470
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,960
to the lawyer and the police.

471
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,480
Lu Yiyao,

472
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,690
you played tricks with me?

473
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,320
We didn't expect that

474
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,920
you would show your hand so easily.

475
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,920
Get him out of here.

476
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,080
Lu Yiyao!

477
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,440
Please go.

478
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,440
Lu Yiyao, you've crossed the line!

479
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,200
Lu Yiyao!

480
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,640
Lu Yiyao, you'll be sorry!

481
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,800
The terms of cooperation are better than before.

482
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,560
After all,

483
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,280
it's my problem this time.

484
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,880
I refuse.

485
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,960
With such preferential prices,

486
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,040
it'll be difficult for you

487
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,280
to find other suppliers.

488
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,600
I will find one.

489
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,240
How about quality assurance?

490
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,640
You have to think about it carefully.

491
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,400
In such a short period,

492
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
it's hard for you

493
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,240
to find this kind of manufacturing technology

494
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,040
with such an inexpensive rate.

495
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,840
There is always a solution.

496
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,520
I certainly believe in Jiang Cheng.

497
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,440
But, Yujiang,

498
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,240
you're the one who broke the rules of the game.

499
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,080
You broke the contract and re-signed it at will.

500
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,040
Deer Sing Group

501
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,520
doesn't need such an emotional partner

502
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,000
who can't make a clear distinction
between public and private interests.

503
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,760
Ten years ago,

504
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,120
Simon made a mistake.

505
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,640
But ten years later,

506
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,200
it was you who used the wrong method.

507
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,000
I've adjusted the product design

508
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,680
for Infinity's main series.

509
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,810
I don't need Jiang Cheng anymore.

510
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,960
And I won't be threatened by anyone.

511
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,920
I'm sorry.

512
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,010
It's really my problem this time.

513
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,160
I hope

514
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,760
we still have the opportunity
to work with Deer Sing again.

515
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,840
This is a new manufacturer.

516
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,720
I know the owner.

517
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
He's a decent person.

518
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,840

522
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,120
Okay.

523
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,120
I accept it.

524
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,680
However,

526
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,520

Does he have a girlfriend abroad?

538
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,960
In this world,

539
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,840
there is only one person

540
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,040
who can make him cry

541
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,080
and make him laugh.

542
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,680
But this is his secret.

543
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,240
I can't tell anyone.

544
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,530
Well,

545
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,360

546
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,040

Ling Rui?

552
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,280
He was giving free medical consultations
in our factory area.

553
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,440
He came to see me.

554
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,600
He said he wanted to do something for you.

555
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,520

When I passed by here,

565
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,560
I thought of our dates before.

566
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,160
Besides having dinners, watching movies,

567
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,120
and listening to music concerts,

568
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,240
we didn't seem to do

569
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,400
anything else.

570

Do you remember

571
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,720
what other things we did?

572
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,520
I don't think we did.

573
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,480
Right?

574
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,800
That's why I feel unfair.

575

I would like you so much?

580
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,160
I want to know the truth.

581
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,960
Back then,

582
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,280
I thought

584
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,720
But now...

I'm sorry.

588

Actually, you know what?

589
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,960
You just have to say

590
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,360
or do something

591
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,000
and I'll be fine.

592
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,400

express my feelings frankly.

599
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,400
I can only pretend to blame you

600
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,530
because it's easier than blaming myself.

601

Since her sister died,

Fangning locked herself inside

She doesn't cry or make a scene.

Something's going to happen to her.

619

My sister gave me this candy.

620

I don't know what happened.

627
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,920
He said he was leaving all of a sudden.

628
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,200
He packed his baggage quickly

629

and left.

630
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,320

00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,570
Are we really going to do this?

693
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:28,640
We're already here.

694
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,640
No more crap.

695
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,160
He burned the bridges for your factory.

696
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,600
He got us into trouble with the lawsuit.

697
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,640
Lu Yiyao

698
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,040
burned our bridges.

699
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
We have nothing to lose.

700
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Here he comes.

701
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,560
Get ready to go!

702
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,320
What do all of you want?

703
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,120
Get him!

704
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,440
Hit him hard!

705
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,160
Security!

706
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,080
Security!

707
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,680
They're here! Hurry!

708
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,520
Let's go.

709
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,960
Director Lu, are you okay?

710
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,640
I'm sorry that I came late.

711
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,200
You shouted quite loudly.

712
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,760
It was an emergency.

713
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:29,920
You...

714
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,440
Next time, you should run

715
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
and get someone here, understand?

716
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,800
There will be no next time.

717
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,040
Are you okay?

718
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,280
Shall we call the police
or go to the hospital first?

719
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,440
No need to call the police.

720
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,040
I'll handle it by myself.

721
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,840
Then, how about your wound?

722
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,440
Thank you.

723
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:01,960
I'll do it.

724
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,280
It's fine. Let me help you.

725
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,560
Another classic scene,

726
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,880
I've made it.

727
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,360
I'm sorry. Does it hurt?

728
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,440
I'll do it gently.

729
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,720
I think you are smiling.

730
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,680
No, I'm not.

731
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,160
You're my boss.

732
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,240
You're injured.

733
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,280
I worry about you a lot.

734
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,040
Of course,

735
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,880
I have some other thoughts.

736
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,320
Director Lu,

737
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,720
I want to know

738
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,440
what do you think of me.

739
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,520
Why...

740
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,560
Why did you suddenly invite me to dinner?

741
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,040
Nothing.

742
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,930
You have been working overtime

743
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,360
so I wanted to show my appreciation.

744
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,800
It's okay. I'll do it by myself.

745
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,360
What's wrong?

746
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,850
All right, it's late.

747
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,800
You should go home now.

748
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,010
Director Lu,

749
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,960
do you really

750
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,920
have nothing to tell me?

751
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,120
I don't feel like saying it today.

752
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,240
Maybe another day.

753
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,200
You have the chance now.

754
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,680
I'm leaving.

755
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,680
Director Lu,

756
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,840
it's okay if you don't feel like saying it.

757
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,840
I'll say it.

758
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
I know that

759
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,960
you need to put in the effort

760
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,690
for a relationship to work.

761
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,600
That is how it's like in the novels.

762
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,400
Director Lu,

763
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,440
I like you.

764
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,120
Can you be my boyfriend?

765
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,160
You don't have to answer me now.

766
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,000
I'll head home now.

767
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,840
Shouldn't he stop me by now?

768
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,240
Why doesn't he stop me?

769
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,840
Come on!

770
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,560
All right.
