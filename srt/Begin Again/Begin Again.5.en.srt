4
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,120
Here, right?

5
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,940
So shameless.

6
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,760
What?

7
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,460
I mean Gao Erfan.

8
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,579
I...

9
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,900
I feel much better. Thank you.

10
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,220
Um...

11
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,370
My hand also aches.

12
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,490
Hand?

13
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,500
Maybe because

14
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,700
the glove is too tight.

15
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,300
It's probably the room service.

16
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,090
What's wrong?

17
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,260
Off you go.

The second guideline of a happy marriage,

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,890
wine and ambiance.

20
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,860
Ling Rui, Ling Rui.

21
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,380
How much alcohol can you take?

22
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,329
I've never

23
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,370
been drunk before.

24
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,690
This one is of high concentration of alcohol.

25
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,220
Let's have some wine

26
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,130
as a celebration.

27
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,450
I won't.

28
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,220
Wine does no good

29
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,260
to health.

30
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,810
But it does good to sleep.

31
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,250
You can sleep well when you feel calm.

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,140
I haven't had

33
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,730
the "cross-cupped wine" with you yet.

34
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,200
You asked the wedding MC

35
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,180
to change the "cross-cupped wine" part

36
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,930
into a lucky draw to give away furniture.

37
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,820
I know it.

38
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,100
Sometimes I appear

39
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,650
too push-and-go.

40
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,460
But I don't want to miss

41
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,700
the necessary procedure

42
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,780
in a marriage.

43
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,940
All right.

44
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,610
I won't push you.

45
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,340
I'll drink it myself.

46
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,180
Don't.

47
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,780
What are you doing?

48
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,660
This glass of wine is for me.

49
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,810
And this, for you.

50
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,260
I'll have one glass of wine.

51
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,570
Just one glass.

52
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,340
Wait a second.

53
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,620
Do you know...

54
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,570
Do you know...

55
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,020
Do you know...

56
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,810
Do you know that the heart?

57
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,330
Heart lies

58
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,770
between the chest and lungs,

59
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,180
about

60
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,780
one third

61
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,940
at the right side of the median line,

62
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,020
and about two thirds

63
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,500
at the left side of the median line.

64
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,940
As big as my fist.

65
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,460
-Ling Rui, can we...
-You.

66
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,770
Leave the heart aside for a moment?

67
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,290
Let me finish.

68
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,980
Its shape is like a peach,

69
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,050
like a pear grown askew.

70
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,540
Venous blood from the right ventricle

71
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,860
flows into the pulmonary artery

72
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,220
And then

73
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,860
flows into the capillary network

74
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,420
around pulmonary alveolus.

75
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,490
Through pulmonary artery

76
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,220
as well as its branches.

77
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,730
How come you're still a physician

78
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,260
when you're drunk?

79
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,130
Ling Rui.

80
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,100
Are you okay?

81
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,180
Ling Rui?

82
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,130
No, no, no.

83
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,090
No, no, no!

84
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,410
It's such a folly.

85
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,220
Lu Fangning.

86
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,140
You can't do this.

87
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,130
This is not what a gentlewoman should do.

88
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,890
By the way,

89
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,460
I can't just do it

90
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,850
by myself.

91
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,530
I can.

92
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,610
Who hit me?

93
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,970
Why are you staring at me
early in the morning?

94
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,050
I'm frightened.

95
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,420
Didn't you say you've never been drunk?

96
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,300
Yeah, never have I...

97
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,130
Nothing happened between us

98
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,580
last night, right?

99
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,900
What do you think?

100
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,140
I'm kidding.

101
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,820
Let's go home.

102
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,650
I'll take care of you at home.

103
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,450
This feels right.

104
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,730
Ningning.

105
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,010
Fangning.

106
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,780
Simon?

107
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,620
Simon!

108
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,020
You are finally back!

109
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,860
You've been away for so long.

110
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,140
Are you going to leave again this time?

111
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,250
Anyway,

112
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,010
I won't let you go

113
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,820
even if you mean to leave.

114
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,660
I'll hold onto you

115
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,220
so you can never

116
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,330
have the chance to

117
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,300
just walk away.

118
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,580
But it'd be better if you come back

119
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,180
one day earlier.

120
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,570
You could have attended my wedding then.

121
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,540
But it was just a marketing conference.

122
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,850
Forget about it.

123
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,540
You're a grown-up.

124
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,580
How could you kid

125
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,130
about your wedding?

126
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,940
You have the gut to blame me?

127
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,540
You've been away for ten years.

128
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,650
Ling Rui.

129
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,620
This is Simon,

130
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,690
my little uncle.

131
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,490
I am Lu Yiyao.

132
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,330
I'm Ling Rui.

133
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,250
Simon is finally back.

134
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,690
That's great.

135
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:06,940
You look happy.

136
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,090
Of course.

137
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,050
He was away for ten years

138
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,140
and no one could

139
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,090
persuade him to come back.

140
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:12,900
I don't know why

141
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,970
he figured it out this time.

142
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,580
He looks young

143
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,380
and does not look like your uncle.

144
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,060
Actually, he was adopted by my family.

145
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,850
He is more like a brother

146
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,090
who watched me growing up.

147
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,060
He treats me so well.

148
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,980
I'm done. Your turn.

149
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
Be serious about it.

150
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,290
Simon is my favorite person

151
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,700
in this house,

152
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,820
the current house.

153
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,410
Alright.

154
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,820
Where are you going?

155
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,660
I'm going to find Simon.

156
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,980
I have so much to tell him.

157
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,380
You just leave me alone here?

158
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,020
It's good for you to be here.

159
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,660
No one

160
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,810
will disturb you.

161
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,450
It's daytime anyway,

162
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,410
so it's safe here. Rest assured.

163
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,450
Didn't you say

164
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,140
you would look after me

165
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,620
on the way here?

166
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,060
What's wrong?

167
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,100
We're newlyweds.

168
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,460
And this is our first day home.

169
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,210
I know that.

170
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,460
To make it convincing

171
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,660
to your families,

172
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,340
shouldn't we be

173
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,730
better prepared?

174
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,410
You can be assured.

175
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,380
No one is my match

176
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,970
in this family.

177
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,650
Really?

178
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,700
Although Lu Fangyu

179
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,220
is clear about our relationship,

180
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,930
he is just

181
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:05,900
a mascot

182
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,540
that can talk.

183
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,820
Don't mind him.

184
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,810
As for Yang Yi,

185
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,050
she earnestly wishes that

186
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,620
we'll divorce as soon as possible.

187
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,450
She wants to see me sad,

188
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,690
and crying all day.

189
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,660
But she is not worthy of

190
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,090
being mentioned for her low level.

191
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:20,820
Want some?

192
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,500
But,

193
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,810
I don't understand

194
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,620
what my father is thinking this time.

195
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,900
To my surprise,

196
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,650
he just allowed us

197
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,690
to get married

198
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,020
although we've only known each other
for five days.

199
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,140
I wonder

200
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,210
what is he thinking?

201
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,700
What about Simon?

202
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,050
Why don't you mention him?

203
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,300
My little uncle

204
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,740
seems to be

205
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,530
normal and tranquil.

206
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,250
But he knows everything clearly.

207
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,380
He just doesn't say it.

208
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,380
He is the cleverest person

209
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,370
in the family,

210
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,090
save me, of course.

211
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,410
You don't worry about him?

212
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,490
No need at all.

213
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,130
He treats me really well.

214
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,700
And he is the one I trust the most

215
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,820
in the family.

216
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,130
And he also trusts me.

217
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,930
To fully achieve the contract,

218
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,860
I assumed a proper setting

219
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,930
for our relationship.

220
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,090
Come in.

221
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,900
Fangning. Dr. Ling.

222
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,090
The food is ready.

223
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,370
You can have some fruit first.

224
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,650
Thank you, Aunt Gao.

225
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,260
Aunt Gao has been working

226
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,100
at our home for years.

227
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,410
She cooks very well.

228
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,020
Thank you, Aunt Gao.

229
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,580
I don't want it.

230
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,370
This strawberry

231
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,380
seems tasty.

232
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,340
I'd like to taste it.

233
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,170
Don't move.

234
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,480
I assume we should be

235
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,160
deeply attached to each other.

236
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,650
Aunt Gao is watching us at the door.

237
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,060
She left.

238
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,650
Aunt Gao

239
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,940
seemed to be looking for something.

240
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,810
My son.

241
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,090
Mom,

242
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,930
why didn't you knock at the door?

243
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,900
Why should I knock

244
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,810
since it's my son's room?

245
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,160
What are you watching?

246
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,500
What?

247
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,849
-Let me see.
-Nothing.

248
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,170
Don't watch it too much.

249
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,140
It's bad for your body.

250
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,300
Mom, what are you talking about?

251
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,410
What do you wanna say again?

252
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,819
Your dad has always wanted

253
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:20,700
Lu Fangning to get married.

254
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,210
And now,

255
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,849
they live with us here.

256
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,859
Your dad

257
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,339
can't be happier.

258
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,330
She got a new brand for her marriage.

259
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,810
What a good deal.

260
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,260
Lu Fangyu.

261
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,450
What, Mom?

262
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,250
You go get married too.

263
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,300
Your dad may get you a new brand

264
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,980
if he's happy.

265
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,820
You don't have to

266
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,300
watch those anymore.

267
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,760
I...

268
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,500
I'll go become a monk now.

269
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,410
Forget about it.

270
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,340
It's good now.

271
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,450
Otherwise, I may have to

272
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,700
take care of my daughter-in-law.

273
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,810
I think she should be the one to serve you.

274
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,060
Yes!

275
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,260
Get married.

276
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,180
She'll have kids after getting married.

277
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,420
If she gets pregnant,

278
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,140
then she won't have time to run the company.

279
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,860
It'll be yours then.

280
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:02,860
Mom,

281
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,410
there is Uncle Simon

282
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,300
managing the company.

283
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,280
I wanna stay out of

284
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,220
the awful mess.

285
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,740
Pregnant.

286
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,620
Well,

287
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,900
how can I get her pregnant?

288
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,820
How can I get her pregnant?

289
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,170
Knock before you come in next time.

290
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,460
Lu Fangyu, bring our uncle here.

291
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,370
-Okay.
-Go.

292
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,330
They're here.

293
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,250
-Coming.
-Uncle.

294
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,580
Here. Take a seat.

295
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,840
Son, you can sit here.

296
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,090
I can sit here...

297
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,820
Never mind, sit here.

298
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,650
-Next to me.
-Okay.

299
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:41,980
Brother,

300
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,720
you sit over there.

301
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,140
Take your seat.

302
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,690
Isn't there a seat?

303
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,420
Go over there.

304
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,260
Just go.

305
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,890
How was it going over there?

306
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,770
Quite good.

307
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:01,770
What's wrong?

308
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,220
Mascot.

309
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,890
Troublemaker.

310
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,010
Old and wicked.

311
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,860
And,

312
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,290
the cleverest.

313
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,170
I hold my alcohol better now.

314
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:17,770
Ling,

315
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,900
this is the first time you dine at home

316
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,180
since you're married.

317
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,730
I wonder if the dishes

318
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,540
suit your taste.

319
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,300
It's okay.

320
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,860
I'm not picky, aunt.

321
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,980
That's right.

322
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,180
Especially the young people,

323
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,330
don't be picky with food.

324
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,700
Health is the most important.

325
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,380
Here.

326
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,500
Eat this.

327
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,570
Enjoy it.

328
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,220
Thank you, Dad.

329
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,180
Good.

330
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,260
We were both drunk at that time.

331
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,020
Stop chatting.

332
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,500
Focus on the dishes, come.

333
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,450
I shouldn't have asked you.

334
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,580
You were away for so long.

335
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,460
Here, try this.

336
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,580
How is it?

337
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,900
Good.

338
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,760
Nice.

339
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,580
It's so good that you are back.

340
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,700
I'm telling you...

341
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,810
Ningning,

342
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,420
you've had a hard couple of days.

343
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,770
You should eat more.

344
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,930
Hard?

345
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,820
Ling Rui,

346
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,140
did you sleep late

347
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,420
at your wedding night

348
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,730
yesterday?

349
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,060
Fangyu.

350
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,650
All these dishes still

351
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,860
can't shut your mouth?

352
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,580
Fangning.

353
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,330
Well,

354
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,380
now that you're married,

355
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,730
you should start planning

356
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,770
your future, right?

357
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,580
You're not young anymore.

358
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,530
Your dad can't wait any longer, either.

359
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,850
Why don't you put it on the agenda

360
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,420
to have a baby?

361
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,740
Yea, we should.

362
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,170
Really?

363
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,340
Glad that you think the same!

364
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,690
I'm so pleased.

365
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,340
You're too slim.

366
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,740
Eat something good

367
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,130
to get into shape.

368
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,340
Eat some sea cucumber and bird-nests,

369
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,890
also pork liver.

370
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,900
With good circulation,
you'll conceive more easily.

371
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,780
Do you have someone to cook for you?

372
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,170
If not, I can cook some

373
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,700
and send them to you.

374
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,840
Alright.

375
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,970
You don't have to care so much.

376
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,700
These loving couples

377
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,610
care for each other.

378
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,090
Why bother?

379
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,860
They got married when the time came.

380
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,340
So, when the time comes,

381
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,140
they will naturally

382
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,060
have a baby.

383
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,170
Why are you in such a rush?

384
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,530
I don't think so.

385
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,610
Aunt Yang,

386
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,290
does the diet plan work?

387
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,530
Of course!

388
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,730
See? My son. It does work!

389
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,020
Ningning, Ningning.

390
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,700
Ningning.

391
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,850
You should think twice.

392
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,740
You'll have a useless kid

393
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,410
if you

394
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,610
follow this diet plan.

395
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,860
Dad.

396
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,540
Why am I useless?

397
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,020
How could they get married

398
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,970
if it weren't me?

399
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,140
Fangyu,

400
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,620
she knew Ling Rui

401
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,970
because of you?

402
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,700
Yeah... No...

403
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,410
Yes.

404
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,060
Fangyu went to the hospital

405
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,500
and I met Ling Rui.

406
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,740
Hospital?

407
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,060
What happened?

408
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,700
-Mom.
-Why did you go to the hospital?

409
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,130
I'm fine, mom.

410
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,330
He was sick because…

411
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,170
It was

412
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,290
hard to tell.

413
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
What?

414
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:03,890
You...

415
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,610
I've told you not to spend too much time
on your phone.

416
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,380
See? Now you're sick.

417
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,770
Son, it matters a lot!

418
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,250
-Mom.
-How will you have kids?

419
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,490
Mom, you think too much.

420
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,370
Stop looking at your phone.

421
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,300
I don't wanna talk.

422
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,140
Let me have my meal.

423
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,900
You should've done it earlier.

424
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:18,850
Cheers.

425
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,780
Okay.

426
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,100
We don't have to drink wine sneakily

427
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,300
as we did when we were little.

428
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,020
We can feel free to drink now.

429
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,300
We were

430
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,690
so anxious

431
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,380
as we did it covertly.

432
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,930
Ningning, try this.

433
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,130
Fangning doesn't like fat meat.

434
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,100
Does she?

435
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,610
Tastes good. Thanks, darling.

436
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,090
Enjoy it.

437
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,140
Simon,

438
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,450
you may not know that her taste has changed

439
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,970
since you were away

440
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,900
for so long.

441
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,580
No, I know.

442
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,250
Fangning likes peppery chicken the most.

443
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,100
Right?

444
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,530
Ningning.

445
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,730
Eat more vegetables.

446
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,850
Now, you even

447
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,780
like the vegetables

448
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,620
you hated the most?

449
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,180
My throat has been bothering me lately.

450
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,450
I should eat some vegetables.

451
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,380
It is not enough.

452
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,700
You've been so tired these days,

453
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,980
have more meat.

454
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,290
Otherwise,

455
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,100
how can you

456
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,020
make it through the night?

457
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,770
Darling, as I say,

458
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,210
you are more tired.

459
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,660
It's so good.

460
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,570
Thank you, honey.

461
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,690
Love you.

462
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,620
Eat your meal.

463
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,170
Enjoy yourselves.

464
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,780
You behaved well,

465
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,620
Mr. Ling Rui.

466
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,100
That's impressive.

467
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,340
You were good too,

468
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,620
Ms. Fangning.

469
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,690
Fangning.

470
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,890
Uncle.

471
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,900
Hey, Simon.

472
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:33,970
We are

473
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,220
putting in a lot of effort to enjoy the sea.

474
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,980
I brought her a wedding gift.

475
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,180
I don't know what she likes now

476
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,740
since I was away for so many years.

477
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,010
Don't you know her well?

478
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,820
What do you think she likes?

479
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,050
Of course, I know.

480
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,500
She likes me

481
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,810
the most.

482
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,330
Oh, come on.

483
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,740
Ling Rui.

484
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,420
I'm sorry

485
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,260
to disturb you two.

486
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,940
Can you

487
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,860
give us a minute?

488
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,170
No problem.

489
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,330
Honey,

490
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:15,770
I'll go back then.

491
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,740
Come back early.

492
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,060
Off you go.

493
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,050
Wait for me.

494
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,100
I will.

495
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,090
He is so clingy about me.

496
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:33,850
Guess what it is.

497
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,090
A bag?

498
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,220
Wine?

499
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,370
Open it.

500
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,900
This is?

501
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,050
Dala horse.

502
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,420
It was a handicraft

503
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,410
made by Swedish carpenters

504
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,540
long time ago

505
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,570
to carry their wishes to the families.

506
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,740
Thank you, uncle.

507
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,460
You don't blame me

508
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,500
for my sudden marriage, right?

509
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,690
Fangning.

510
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,140
You always know what you want.

511
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,740
As long as you're sure

512
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,540
you're doing the right thing,

513
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,620
I'm not worried then.

514
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,500
I'm sure.

515
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,180
Okay.

516
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,970
Then, I'll wait and see.

517
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:18,980
See if this man

518
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,860
can bring you happiness.

519
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,180
By the way, Fangning.

520
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,970
Although the proposal of Infinity

521
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:26,900
has been adopted,

522
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:27,980
we still have

523
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,930
a lot of work to do.

524
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,500
You must be stressed out.

525
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,450
Relax,

526
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,450
I'll get your back

527
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,100
and protect LM Deer Sing Group.

528
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,890
Thank you.

529
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,900
Thank you for coming back.

530
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,980
Have you got over the jet lag?

531
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,890
I'm alright.

532
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,130
I can fall asleep. Don't worry.

533
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,140
I can drink wine with you

534
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,850
if you can't sleep.

535
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:01,580
Good then.

536
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,860
No kidding,

537
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,700
did you also prepare

538
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,610
anything else for me?

539
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,650
Well...

540
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,340
Are you okay?

541
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,090
What are you doing?

542
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,330
Your hair got wet.

543
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:28,860
You're just

544
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,010
messing up my hair.

545
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,050
It was already a mess

546
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,300
and wet. Don't move.

547
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,410
It looks better now.

548
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,930
Honey.

549
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,180
The wind is strong here.

550
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:43,930
You may catch a cold,

551
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,900
then you'll get a flu

552
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,690
which will lead to many complications.

553
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,970
And they can

554
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,540
do harm to your brain.

555
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,300
Fangning, I'm going upstairs.

556
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,410
Uncle, you are wet too.

557
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,540
Use this.

558
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,420
No need.

559
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,770
I feel cool this way.

560
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,890
Let's have a drink tonight, uncle.

561
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,620
No problem.

562
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,850
What are you doing?

563
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,260
I thought it was done.

564
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,380
I'm curious, Ling Rui.

565
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,810
You've been acting weirdly today.

566
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:23,980
You are weird, I think.

567
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,420
What's wrong with me?

568
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,820
What did you talk about

569
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,220
with Simon?

570
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,330
Fangyu is not only a mascot.

571
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,890
Aunt Yang is not like a troublemaker.

572
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,020
There is no bad intention

573
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,380
on your dad's mind.

574
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,020
But, Lu Yiyao

575
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,290
is indeed the cleverest

576
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,530
in the family.

577
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,050
He is also the one

578
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,220
who can see through us the most easily.

579
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,170
No, no, no.

580
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,140
I am the cleverest person

581
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,620
in the family.

582
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,260
And he just said

583
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,300
he wanted me to be happy.

584
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,620
According to the contract,

585
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,940
we'll get divorced one year later.

586
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,580
I'm afraid no one would take this

587
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,740
as happiness.

588
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,090
If he really accepts

589
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,500
every decision you make,

590
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,100
he wouldn't have

591
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,090
sounded me out like that just now.

592
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,940
He is indeed the one who knows me the best.

593
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,560
We can't go on like this.

594
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,580
Being alert all the time,

595
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,170
we'll both be tired then.

596
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,900
Then what should we do?

597
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,580
We can only stay in the room

598
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,770
till night

599
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,220
and enjoy the time for ourselves,

600
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,340
refusing all disturbances.

601
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,660
Ling Rui.

602
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,660
About some things,

603
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,570
you can't say too much.

604
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,850
Because I'll take that

605
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,930
seriously then.

606
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,170
Don't think too much.

607
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,580
I'll sleep on the floor.

608
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,820
Come on.

609
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,420
Darling.

610
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,540
Come sleep with me.

611
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,740
When I'm going to sleep,

612
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,050
I'd like to spray some…

613
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,980
What are you doing?

614
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,450
Are you really gonna sleep on the floor?

615
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,180
Didn't we say to enjoy the time for us?

616
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,100
You sleep on the bed.

617
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,450
I'll sleep on the floor.

618
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:04,810
No way.

619
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,620
They'll find out if they come in.

620
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,340
I've locked the door.

621
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,210
If you know locking the door,

622
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,820
you should know what to do next.

623
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,930
I'm kidding.

624
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,680
Alright.

625
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,140
Come here.

626
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,100
You have to work tomorrow.

627
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,820
I always work overtime at the hospital.

628
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,530
I'm used to this.

629
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,580
Working overtime?

630
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,140
Come here. We can share the bed.

631
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,480
I have a good sleeping habit.

632
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,860
I won't touch you.

633
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,490
I'm not that kind of person.

634
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,250
Good night.

635
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,700
The third guideline of a happy marriage.

636
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,180
Acting actively or passively.

637
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,930
First, I have to act.

638
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,290
Good night.

639
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,180
So sleepy.

640
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,580
Ling Rui.

641
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,570
Ling Rui.

642
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,219
Ling Rui!

643
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,130
Don't go.

644
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,739
Okay.

645
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,699
Easy, easy.

646
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,489
I'm here with you.

647
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,100
Just sleep.

648
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,650
What do you mean by this?

649
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,660
What are you doing?

650
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:11,610
I can't

651
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,690
move at all.

652
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,060
You can calm down for a while.

653
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,450
Ling Rui.

654
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:36,900
Ling Rui.

655
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,690
Ling Rui.

656
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,300
Ling Rui!

657
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,060
What is the brand of his body wash?

658
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,330
Smells nice.

659
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,220
Would you like some?

660
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,170
No, thank you.

661
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,420
She can't fall asleep again?

662
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,580
Fangning has insomnia.

663
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,970
She is always like this.

664
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,780
The slightest sound can wake her up.

665
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,930
She'd feel better after drinking some milk.

666
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,060
You do know her well.

667
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,820
My parents passed away

668
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,770
when I was little.

669
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,620
I was adopted by her family from then.

670
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,300
I was probably sort of uncomfortable

671
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,890
at first.

672
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,810
I only had her.

673
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,940
She was just born at that time.

674
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,890
I liked staring at her so much.

675
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,660
She could say nothing.

676
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,900
She knew nothing.

677
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,490
She didn't show care

678
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,940
and protection

679
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,250
in a cautious way.

680
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,730
She didn't put a feeler.

681
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,260
Fangning is always ambitious

682
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,460
and bad-tempered.

683
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,890
Actually,

684
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,540
she'll bury her scars inside

685
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,860
once she gets hurt.

686
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,180
Throughout all these years,

687
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,770
she has always insisted on founding Infinity,

688
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,340
that means she still can't let it go.

689
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,810
The foundation of Infinity

690
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,890
has something to do with her past?

691
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,210
You don't know about this?

692
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,170
That is to say

693
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,540
she does not trust you as I imagined.

694
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,260
I know that

695
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,690
You don't believe

696
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,820
our marriage.

697
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,090
Or,

698
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,690
you don't believe in me.

699
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,370
Yes.

700
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,660
Maybe,

701
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,060
Fangning is still hiding something from me.

702
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,540
But if she doesn't want to tell me,

703
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,980
I won't try to

704
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,330
pry into her mind.

705
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,380
In this world,

706
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:41,890
even if you're a family

707
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,540
or a couple,

708
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,170
no matter how close your relationship is,

709
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,260
they all enjoy the freedom

710
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,500
to have their own secrets.

711
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:50,820
Am I right?

712
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,220
Thank you.

713
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,940
Ling Rui.

714
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,300
I don't know what's going on

715
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,610
between you two.

716
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,140
But listen to me carefully.

717
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,540
I won't let anyone

718
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,650
have any chance to hurt her.

719
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,130
Lu Yiyao,

720
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,330
I don't know what's going on

721
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,770
between you two, either.

722
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,050
But listen to me,

723
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,140
the one who hurts her

724
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,500
definitely won't be me.
