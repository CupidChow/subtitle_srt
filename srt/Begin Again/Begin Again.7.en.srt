00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,710
Why are you running so fast?

176
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,040
I'm scared to death.

177
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,830
You scared me first.

178
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,230
I'm not frightened at all.

179
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,440
Me too.

180
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,920
Then, why are you grabbing me

181
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,070
if you're not scared?

182
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,350
I worry that you'll be scared.

183
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,560
Didn't you say we're almost there?

184
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,950
Why is it taking so long?

185
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,110
We're almost there, just a minute.

186
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,880
Don't be scared. I'm with you.

187
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,120
I'm not afraid.

188
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,680
Almost there.

189
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,190
Slow down.

190
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,830
Slow down.

191
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,510
We set this place

192
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,870
as a

193
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,910
Living Room Exploration Hall,

194
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,230
simulating a sense of being at home,

195
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,430
to make customers feel like they are home.

196
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,550
Sit down.

197
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,510
Our employees

198
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,510
usually rest here, too.

199
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,270
The sofa over there

200
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,200
is an exhibition.

201
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,240
But, it has been booked

202
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,880
by our customer.

203
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,230
So we can't sit there.

204
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,160
Just make do with it.

205
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,840
Sit here.

206
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,390
Never mind.

207
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,510
It's quite comfortable here.

208
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,510
Here you are.

209
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,990
Thank you.

210
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,440
We only have chips here.

211
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,990
Next time I'll ask my staff

212
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,950
to order

213
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,110
something more delicious.

214
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,990
It's okay.

215
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,150
It's good enough.

216
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,070
However,

217
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,190
we probably won't get to do this again.

218
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,670
Nothing. Enjoy it.

219
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,750
I'm so tired.

220
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,310
Shall we

221
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,240
find something interesting

222
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,190
to do?

223
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,390
Do...

224
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,150
Do what?

225
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,320
Come here.

226
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,350
Let's play this.

227
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,430
The winner can ask

228
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,350
the other person a question.

229
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,390
The other one has to answer truthfully

230
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,070
and can't hide anything,

231
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,590
so we can

232
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,960
learn more about each other.

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,550
I'm not in.

234
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,750
I don't wanna know more about you.

235
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,790
Come on.

236
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,990
So childish. I don't want to play.

237
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,270
I'll go first.

238
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,990
Your turn.

239
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,910
Pick one.

240
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,590
Have you decided?

241
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,870
Don't rush me.

242
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,390
Strategy matters.

243
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,310
Okay, take your time.

244
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,790
Be quieter when you eat chips.

245
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,080
I got distracted.

246
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,470
You lost. I win.

247
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,870
Ask me.

248
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,110
I am not

249
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,670
curious about you.

250
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,150
I don't know what to ask.

251
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,750
Okay, I got one.

252
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,510
What do you think of Tang Ping?

253
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,590
Tang Ping?

254
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,110
Not interested.

255
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,590
Then in hospital, you and her...

256
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,360
Her father had

257
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,430
an unexplained shadow in his lungs.

258
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,790
She took the X-ray there,

259
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,310
which is

260
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,990
exactly my specialty.

261
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,990
So I took him in.

262
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,750
No more?

263
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,590
-Yep.
-That's all?

264
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,830
Go on.

265
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,950
I win again.

266
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,590
Awesome people indeed

267
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,120
do well in everything.

268
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,990
Go ahead.

269
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,990
Why did you suddenly

270
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,350
decide to marry me?

271
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,870
Because I wanted to help you.

272
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,910
And?

273
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,550
Nothing.

274
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,750
Nothing again?

275
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,230
You...

276
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,470
You're not playing fair.

277
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,630
I'm not lying.

278
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,910
I'm not dodging it.

279
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,710
Go on.

280
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,390
You lose.

281
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,430
It's my turn to ask you.

282
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,270
Why did you want to

283
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,190
marry me so badly?

284
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,710
Was there any other reason

285
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,670
other than work?

286
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,550
Of course, I wanted to

287
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,630
have a baby with you.

288
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,270
But I can't let him know.

289
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,190
And I can neither lie nor evade it.

290
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,390
What should I say?

291
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,070
Because I want to

292
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,390
have a deeper...

293
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,870
A deeper connection with you.

294
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,270
Another round?

295
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,830
I...

296
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,910
I feel sleepy.

297
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,470
Okay then.

298
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,430
Let's stop.

299
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,110
Would you like to watch a film?

300
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:50,030
♫ The potent fragrance of the rose petals ♫

301
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,850
♫ I don't mind walking
on the streets alone ♫

302
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:09,350
♫ The movies are always full
of disappointment and farewells ♫

303
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:17,410
♫ But, who will watch them with me ♫

304
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,600
♫ Slowly, we get closer ♫

305
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,380
♫ I like you ♫

306
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,090
♫ Only you ♫

307
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,790
♫ You're my one and only ♫

308
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,090
♫ Tonight, I'll let my mind wander ♫

309
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,500
♫ Tonight is the night ♫

310
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,290
♫ I want to travel to Paris and Tokyo,
and eat chocolate by the sea ♫

311
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,780
♫ As long as I'm with you ♫

312
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,920
♫ We can lie on the beach
and count the stars ♫

313
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,740
♫ I like you because you put up with me ♫

314
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,960
♫ My unyielding stubbornness ♫

315
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,500
♫ It's all because of you ♫

316
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,950
♫ I like you ♫

317
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,740
♫ Only you ♫

318
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,440
♫ You're my one and only ♫

319
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,620
♫ Under the moon, on the bright street,
we'll hold our wedding tonight ♫

320
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,130
♫ Only you ♫

321
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,880
♫ You're my one and only ♫

322
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:31,130
♫ We need to learn no more,
we'll fall in love tonight ♫

323
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,910
Ms. Lu.

324
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,830
Ms. Lu.

325
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,420
Ms. Lu.

326
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,700
Darling.

327
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,560
Yes?

328
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,190
Let's go to work.

329
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,500
Okay.

330
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,860
Let's go.

331
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,670
Did you sleep well last night?

332
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,710
Pretty good.

333
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,470
I had a nice dream.

334
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,820
And you?

335
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,390
Me too.

336
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,900
I thought you were

337
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,230
already awake, right?

338
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,110
You pretended to be asleep.

339
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,860
It was so awkward.

340
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:23,020
[More brands and surprises upstairs!]

341
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,420
This is your place.

342
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,460
You're more suitable

343
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,300
to deal with the situation.

344
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,070
Wait for me here.

345
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,820
-Ma.
-Ms. Lu.

346
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,990
Before closing the door,

347
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,910
you must check

348
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,820
if there is anyone inside

349
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,510
to make sure

350
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,500
the safety of people and goods.

351
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,030
-Got it?
-Yes.

352
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,630
Done?

353
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,500
Do you have something to do later?

354
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,070
Why don't you drive me to the hospital?

355
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,630
I drive you to the hospital?

356
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,430
I mean...

357
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,820
How about we have our breakfast there?

358

359

Anything is okay, you decide.

You can taste

361
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,420
the grain porridge here

362
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,790
and some desserts.

363
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,070
Okay.

364

You go take a seat. I'll go get the food.

She is...

379

She's my wife.

380
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,740
You're married, Dr. Ling?

381
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,470
Yes.

382
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:10,380
Okay.

383

I heard that Dr. Ling
has been long married.

394

Really?

395

-Let's eat.
-Okay.

396

Yes.

399

Congratulations.

Good morning, Mrs. Ling.

introduce you to them.

No, no. I was kidding.

412

You are better than me in the hospital.

413

414
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,750

00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,260

I'm Dr. Ling's wife.

Mrs. Ling.

418
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,870
I like this.

419
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,180
I do matter more

420
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,950
than you at the hospital.

by many people.

424
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,190
So,

425
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,540
I didn't tell my colleagues

426
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,020
about my marriage.

427
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,940
I didn't know you would...

428
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,190
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,270
It's okay.

430
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,340
I didn't mind.

433
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,270
must not wear any accessories,

434
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,020
because we may be required
to do an operation

435
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,900
at any time.

436
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,910
But, I don't have any today.

437
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,340
I'll wear it

438
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,110
as often as possible from now on.

439
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,940
I'm not pushing you

440
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,710
to wear it all the time.

Of course, you can

take it off in the hospital.

I don't have anything else to do.

Of course, I don't.

Ling Rui and I

522
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,340
are already married.

523
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,940
If you want something,

524
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,590
you can ask Tang Ping to contact Ling Rui.

525
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,900
But if you think Tang Ping

526
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,220
is unreliable and

527
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,540
immature,

528
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,820
I can help you.

529
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,020
Alright, thank you.

530
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,830
I'm leaving.

531
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,100

533
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,780

534

538
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

539
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,020

my visit

541

542

Tang Pingping,

543
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,540
can you please

544
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,620
grow up

545
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,740
and be more considerate?

546
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,260
Your father is sick now.

547
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,380
Yet, you let him worry about you.

548
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,300
How could you be a...

549
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,620
Don't say that word!

550
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,380
The grudge is between

551
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,300
the two of us.

552
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,300
Don't get others involved.

553
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:06,900
Okay?

554
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,620

555
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,740
I don't think there is bad blood
between us.

556
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,420
If there is, it's about winning or losing.

you can just say

560
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,300
you're a friend of Mrs. Ling.

561
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,390
That'll be good.

562
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,300
I feel so pleased.

00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,660

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,540
Sister, how did it go?

568

Did anything happen?

It's like wasting your talent

Here is my plan.

Are you kidding me?

596

Also, I cannot learn anything there.

00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,370
Then,

695
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,690
can I take a picture with you?

696
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,140
Don't take a selfie.

697
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,780
Let me be your cameraman.

698
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,290
Isn't it good?

699
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,100
Okay.

700
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,930
-The font...
-What's wrong?

701
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,420
It suits you.

702
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,810
Hold it.

703
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,860
Come on!

704
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,740
Ready.

705
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,100
-How do I look?
-Perfect.

706
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,420
Well,

707
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,140
what are you doing here?

708
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,170
Isn't there's a patient waiting for you?

709
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,170
Go, now.

710
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:01,650
Yes.

711
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,090
Ms. Tang, I'm sorry.

712
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,060
There are patients waiting for me.

713
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,700
I've got to go.

714
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,740
Bye.

715
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,690
Dr. Ling.

716
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,060
Your phone, here you are.

717
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,410
I'll take a look at the photo.

718
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,860
Why am I the only one
in the photo?

719
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,210
You told me to take pictures of you.

720
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,180
You didn't tell me

721
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,530
to fit Ling Rui into the frame too.

722
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,570
What did you do?

723
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,370
You should take pictures of us.

724
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,250
-Who told you to shoot only me?
-Well...

725
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,860
You didn't make it clear.

726
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,540
-How can you blame me?
-You!

727
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,970
Trash!

728
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,140
The red banner

729
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,530
suits her anyway.

730
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,940
To Dr. Ling Rui,

731
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,050
you're

732
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,540
the star that never falls by day or night,

733
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,050
the light scattered in the world.

734
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,170
You're benevolent,
caring for everything.

735
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,570
You treat patients
like your own families.

736
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,890
You bring patients back to life

737
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,500
and bring comfort to everyone.

738
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,770
The most beautiful
patient's family, Tang Ping.

739
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,810
My God.

740
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,090
Unusual content,

741
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,570
but unexpectedly good.

742
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,810
The fifth guideline of a happy marriage,

743
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,330
cooking skill makes up for charm.

744
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,730
Didn't you want to

745
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,010
keep a distance from me?

746
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,930
Drinking my soup doesn't count

747
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,980
as breaking the contract, right?

748
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,330
I am so virtuous and generous.

749
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,570
How can you not fall for me

750
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,890
after you see me?

751
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,460
I'm back.

752
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,650
What are you laughing at?

753
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:12,850
Nothing.

754
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,530
I just thought of

755
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,770
something funny.

756
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:17,690
Right.

757
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,900
Last time,

758
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,610
I sent you the night snack,

759
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,770
but you didn't eat it.

760
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:22,730
Try the soup.

761
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,010
Did you make this?

762
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,130
Try it.

763
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,330
I'll go take a shower.

764
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,010
Thank you.

765
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,580
Smells good.

766
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,780
It's pretty good.

767
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,690
Darling.

768
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:13,740
What?

769
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:15,530
I'm so careless.

770
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:16,570
Um...

771
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,210
I forgot to bring the towel in.

772
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,970
Can you get it for me?

773
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,610
Darling.

774
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,500
Be quick.

775
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,410
Darling.

776
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,410
-I can't reach it.
-Then, I'm leaving.

777
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,370
Ling Rui, Ling Rui!

778
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,820
I'm coming out.

779
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,450
I'm coming out.

780
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,770
Why is my heart beating so fast?

781
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:09,970
What's wrong?

782
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,210
Why did you drink so much water?

783
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:03,490
I don't know why.

784
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,370
I just feel thirsty.

785
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:07,770
Are you wearing too many layers?

786
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:08,770
Take off your clothes.

787
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:11,770
It's okay.

788
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,330
I might have caught a cold.

789
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,530
A cold?

790
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,770
I changed

791
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:20,850
my shampoo today.

792
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:21,410
Smell it.

793
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,570
See if you can smell it.

794
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,250
I'm sorry.

795
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,010
I've been in the shower for too long.

796
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,410
I feel dizzy.

797
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,490
No, no.

798
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,580
Ling Rui.

799
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,290
What?

800
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,410
What are you doing?

801
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:00,890
I don't know why

802
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,370
I feel so hot too.

803
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,730
You're sweating a lot.

804
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:15,930
Darling.

805
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,250
Flu

806
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,490
is contagious.
