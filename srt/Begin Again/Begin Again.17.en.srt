[Episode 17]

4
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,289
I didn't expect Doctor Ling

5
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,530
to get married so early.

6
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,490
Yes

7
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,650
I always thought

8
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,580
he will be together with

9
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,890
the Medical University Talented Girl.

10
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,150
Medical University Talented Girl?

11
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,370
Who's that?

12
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,890
Fangning, you didn't know,

13
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,190
when I first entered the medical college

14
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,030
I heard many things

15
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,930
about Dr. Ling's Deeds.

16
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,570
It can be said

17
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,490
Doctor Ling is the

18
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,970
idol of all of us.

19
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,610
As for this Talented Girl

20
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,810
Yu Shiyi.

21
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,130
She's the White Moonlight

22
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,850
in our hearts.

23
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,150
What do you mean?

24
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,530
Everyone was there every night

25
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,470
to watch the moonlight.

26
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,740
But this White Moonlight

27
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,420
only follows Dr. Ling.

28
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,710
I heard that the two of them

29
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,729
could stay in the library all day.

30
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,770
Or in the laboratory.

31
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,650
And

32
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,730
they even conducted an autopsy on the same corpse.

33
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,130
You talk too much.

34
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,450
It's okay, go on.

35
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,329
Well, Fangning.

36
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,970
It's like this.

37
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,190
This is just a rumor in the university.

38
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,270
Like every other school

39
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,410
has its top ten singers.

40
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,650
You don't have to worry about it.

41
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,850
It's okay.

42
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,010
I know all these.

43
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,570
Aren't these all in the past?

44
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,390
Yeah.

45
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,690
When we were young.

46
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,710
In the past.

47
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,770
Don't mention it.

48
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,050
What are you guys talking about?

49
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,329
You guys look happy.

50
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,270
About your ex-girlfriend.

51
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,850
Ex-girlfriend?

52
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,090
That one.

53
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,060
Yu…

54
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,329
Yu Shiyi.

55
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,530
Shut up.

56
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,210
Are you and that Ms. Yu

57
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,890
still in contact now?

58
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,820
She's studying in Germany.

59
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,970
We email each other occasionally

60
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,250
about our research progress.

61
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,170
You okay?

62
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,530
Fangning.

63
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,730
What happened?

64
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,570
It's all your fault.

65
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,490
Hello, Mr. Lu.

66
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,500
Hello.

67
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,450
The works of more than 30 artists are on display today.

68
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,130
These are Nordic paintings.

69
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,540
There are quite a few

70
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,450
are from some famous collectors

71
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,620
who put the art on display for the first time.

72
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,930
Mr. Lu,

73
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,010
I trust you will love them.

74
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,450
Hope you can pick

75
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,260
something you like.

76
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,570
Thank you.

77
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,850
Well, Mr. Lu.

78
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,090
And your secretary.

79
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,070
Please Enjoy.

80
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,540
I shall excuse myself.

81
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,730
What the heck.

82
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,670
How did I become your secretary?

83
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,930
Don't mind him.

84
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,650
He was just talking casually.

85
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,620
I'm obviously your girlfriend.

86
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,500
This painting is not bad.

87
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,290
This one is not bad, too.

88
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,880
What do you think?

89
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,120
Are you okay?

90
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,050
Director Lu, today is the weekend.

91
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,250
Your miss secretary

92
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,200
is getting off work.

93
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,610
Are you angry?

94
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,290
Not really.

95
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,610
Today we are not in the company.

96
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,090
I want to experience

97
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,530
how it feels to be a girlfriend.

98
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,750
Okay.

99
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,730
Then I will explain to them.

100
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:00,840
Well.

101
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,000
You don't have to do it on purpose.

102
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,050
Come on, smile a little.

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,040
Look at your face.

104
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,350
If others see it they will think

105
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,450
you are my bodyguard.

106
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,040
I'm kidding,

107
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,810
don't take it seriously.

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,240
How about this?

109
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,400
All the paintings here.

110
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,130
Which one do you like?

111
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:20,840
I'll buy it for you.

112
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,890
For who?

113
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,730
Your secretary or your bodyguard?

114
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,010
Excuse me, Mr. Lu.

115
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,630
There is a reporter over there.

116
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,880
They want to interview you

117
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,210
about today's exhibition.

118
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:31,930
Okay.

119
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,130
I'll go first then.

120
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,320
Wait for me.

121
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,840
Miss, this way please.

122
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,270
Currently,

123
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,440
this is the one

124
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,650
with the highest bid.

125
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,510
Director Lu wants this one, then.

126
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,720
Also,

127
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,240
please double the bid.

128
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,250
Okay, no problem,

129
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,230
I will handle it.

130
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,960
Thank you.

131
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,610
I will buy it.

132
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,090
And give it to my bodyguard.

133
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,480
Bodyguard.

134
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,010
Welcome back babies

135
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,230
to my channel.

136
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,409
Today I am honored

137
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,490
to have received an invitation

138
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,830
from a Nordic painter

139
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,010
to see his exhibition.

140
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,690
I'm so excited.

141
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,450
Really.

142
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,730
I can't describe it in words.

143
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,710
Now,

144
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,350
I will take everyone

145
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,650
to have a good look

146
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,490
at this exhibition.

147
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,080
Come, shoot over here.

148
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,360
Get my good angles.

149
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,250
You must capture my

150
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,730
noble and elegant temperament.

151
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,409
I'll buy you a chicken drumstick tonight.

152
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,650
Sorry.

153
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,610
-It's you?
-It's you?

154
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,330
The paparazzi at Lu Fangning's wedding?

155
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,770
Ruining someone else's wedding…

156
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,010
You can't say that.

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
Looking at paintings?

158
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,050
Do you even understand them?

159
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,760
You…

160
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,590
How about you, you minx?

161
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,800
You paparazzi wench!

162
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,270
Jerk!

163
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,880
Small fry reporter!

164
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,810
A woman who only knows how to stomp her foot!

165
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,960
Whether you understand the paintings or not

166
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,470
you can't have them.

167
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,150
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,240
This painting is already mine.

169
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,770
How is this possible?

170
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,070
This painting,

171
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,350
is it bidden?

172
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,200
This painting,

173
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,610
Mr. Lu just bought it.

174
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,250
Mr. Lu?

175
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,330
Which Mr. Lu?

176
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,010
Mr. Lu Yiyao.

177
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,330
Lu Yiyao?

178
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,800
Yes.

179
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,570
What does Lu Yiyao have to do with you?

180
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,630
He asked me to choose one.

181
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,010
This painting

182
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,280
is what he bought for me.

183
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,130
Excuse me.

184
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,550
Are you kidding me?

185
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,650
How could Lu Yiyao

186
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,930
spend this money for you?

187
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,050
I know.

188
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,880
Must be because of your

189
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,590
relationship with Lu Fangning.

190
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,730
So he…

191
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,510
He did this just to make me happy.

192
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,010
Gosh.

193
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,130
Are you dreaming?

194
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,170
How could Lu Yiyao

195
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,570
fancy you?

196
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,690
Look at yourself.

197
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,240
Do you know who is Lu Yiyao's

198
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,970
ex-girlfriend

199
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,450
and fiancee?

200
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,920
Are the people of the Lu family blind?

201
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,360
You are so ordinary.

202
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,810
How could he fall in love with you?

203
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,490
Lu Yiyao's taste

204
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,929
can't drop this much.

205
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,600
So you must be dreaming.

206
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,330
Miss Tang.

207
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,770
Please don't harass

208
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,610
my girlfriend.

209
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,650
Girl…

210
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,730
First of all,

211
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,710
My taste

212
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,490
I think.

213
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,790
Has nothing to do with you.

214
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,410
Secondly,

215
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,890
Miss Cai Siyu next to me,

216
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,370
She is no worse

217
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,280
than any of my exes.

218
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,490
Her good features

219
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,730
I don't think I need to

220
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,520
or am obligated to let you know.

221
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,170
In addition,

222
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,050
the way you wear a wedding dress

223
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,130
is really ugly.

224
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,250
You…

225
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,690
Let's go.

226
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,760
Stop shooting. Why are you shooting?

227
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,130
Why shoot him? Shoot me!

228
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,570
Shoot me, idiot!

229
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,370
What are you looking at?

230
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,770
There's nothing to see here.

231
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,650
Break up.

232
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,010
Shameful.

233
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:58,300
[Castfast Hotel]

234
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,710
I drank a little too much.

235
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,650
Thank you for the treat, Fangning.

236
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,790
I didn't.

237
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,210
Who did then?

238
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,850
It's the same if I did or she did.

239
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,530
Yeah, it's the same.

240
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,010
Hey, Fangning.

241
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,890
You seem like you have indigestion.

242
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,530
Should we go

243
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,480
help with your digestion?

244
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,550
Disco?

245
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,450
Let's go!

246
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,370
Well, then we will…

247
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,450
Oh, to the disco?

248
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,390
Why do you only think of disco

249
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,090
whenever we go out?

250
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,680
How does karaoke sound?

251
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,970
Professor Luo, you…

252
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,450
Then you young people go and play.

253
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,790
It's too loud there.

254
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,470
My heart can't stand it.

255
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,050
You guys have fun.

256
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,770
Goodbye, Professor.

257
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,470
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

258
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,250
Goodbye, Professor Luo.

259
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,290
Goodbye.

260
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,450
It's my treat.

261
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,610
Let's go.

262
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,930
Then let's go first.

263
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,370
We are going.

264
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,090
Goodbye.

265
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,070
If you don't want to go.

266
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:38,970
Then we…

267
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,160
You don't want to go, right?

268
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,270
If you don't want to go

269
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,370
I'll go.

270
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,650
Okay, now that we are all here.

271
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,730
First of all, please welcome our

272
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,770
Flower Couple

273
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,930
to sing a song, "I love You So Much".

274
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,870
Welcome.

275
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,250
Come come.

276
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,370
Come, Dr. Ling.

277
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,490
Don't be shy and go.

278
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,230
Yes.

279
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,970
Come on.

280
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,930
If you don't want to sing

281
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,250
we can say no.

282
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,290
I want to sing.

283
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,770
But I don't know how to sing this song.

284
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,330
Don't tell me at this age

285
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,610
you have never been to karaoke.

286
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,070
I came once,

287
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,170
back in college.

288
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,330
Just once.

289
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,490
Was it with that

290
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,090
Dr. Yu.

291
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:31,690
Yes.

292
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,050
I don't want to sing.

293
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,730
If they don't want to sing.

294
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,570
Let's sing this.

295
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:39,930
Okay.

296
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,970
-Let's sing this.
-What's the matter?

297
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,590
Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

298
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,730
In my heart.

299
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,370
The heart is on the left.

300
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,890
Is it because I can't sing the song you want to sing?

301
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,890
No.

302
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,290
I'll sing a song I know.

303
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,410
Let you listen to that song.

304
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,410
No need.

305
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,330
Ling Rui, let me ask you a question.

306
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,850
Is Yu Shiyi better at singing?

307
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,490
Or am I?

308
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,680
But I never heard you sing.

309
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,250
This kind of thing.

310
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,050
Do you have to listen

311
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,370
to get a conclusion?

312
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,330
Probably.

313
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,090
I'm thirsty, I want to drink beer.

314
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,770
Peng Bo.

315
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,710
Drink with me.

316
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,650
Cheers.

317
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,680
Fangning.

318
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:41,970
Do you know why

319
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,730
Ling Rui is called

320
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,880
the flower on the hill?

321
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,190
Hill flower.

322
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,570
The hill is tall.

323
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,970
The terrain is a bit high.

324
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,610
And high places are cold.

325
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,490
Sometimes it's easy

326
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,250
to freeze your brain.

327
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,050
So don't you

328
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,690
get down to his level.

329
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,010
Did he make you angry again?

330
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,410
Yes.

331
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,090
I asked him if I sang better

332
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,370
or the Medical University Talented Girl.

333
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,530
He said he could only tell

334
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,330
after listening.

335
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,010
That was not what I meant.

336
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,770
Stop talking.

337
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,770
No matter who

338
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,720
cannot beat your wife at singing.

339
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,490
Do you need to ask?

340
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,770
Fangning,

341
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,030
look, it's not just you.

342
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,130
Even if a singer was here

343
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,410
he couldn't tell the difference.

344
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,730
The key is,

345
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,810
the issue is,

346
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,650
the fact is,

347
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,330
I really sing better.

348
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,010
Me.

349
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,730
Yeah, I think so too.

350
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,650
Who are you?

351
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,730
You are his wife, right?

352
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,310
You two are

353
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,970
in a loving husband and wife relationship.

354
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,210
He and Yu Shiyi

355
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,570
were only ordinary classmates.

356
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,450
That's it.

357
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,690
Don't even talk about Yu Shiyi.

358
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,600
No one can compare to you.

359
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,330
What can Yu Shiyi compare with you?

360
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:42,920
Right?

361
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,410
Yes.

362
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,970
Listen, Fangning.

363
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,250
He is like this.

364
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,450
He is usually handsome,

365
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,640
looks smart.

366
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,810
When his brain is frozen

367
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,690
and he's dim-witted,

368
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,170
no one can argue with him.

369
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,150
Who's dim-witted?

370
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,490
Am I wrong?

371
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,530
For example, before we conduct surgery

372
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,120
he would always tell a joke.

373
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,090
He has been telling this joke

374
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,330
since university.

375
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,250
I told him

376
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,090
again and again

377
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,170
but he won't listen.

378
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,450
He thinks it's fun.

379
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,850
Tell me, is this guy stubborn?

380
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,250
-Stop it.
-He's just like that.

381
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,210
It's the same as when he confessed to me.

382
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,810
He asked me, "Did you have breakfast?"

383
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,690
"Did you have lunch?"

384
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,410
"Did you have dinner?"

385
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,720
Nothing else.

386
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,560
Right.

387
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,330
Cheers.

388
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,210
One more thing.

389
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,810
You know, before a surgery

390
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,890
we have to wash our hands.

391
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,530
He's so good.

392
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,160
The first one to go in and wash his hands.

393
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,210
Always the last one

394
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,210
to come out.

395
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,770
My gosh, those hands.

396
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,200
While washing his hands,

397
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,290
he talks to his hands!

398
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:40,770
You know?

399
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,090
He's like a pervert.

400
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,400
He does this at home too.

401
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,250
Always cleaning.

402
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,170
Forever cleaning.

403
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,170
And not only that,

404
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,490
he also asked me to wash my hands.

405
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,490
He's not satisfied after I washed it,

406
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,610
I have to wash it a second time.

407
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,170
You know what's the scariest thing?

408
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:53,770
What?

409
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,370
These hands

410
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,410
are just like his brother to him.

411
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,570
Even closer to him than I am.

412
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,730
Tell me, is he a pervert?

413
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,690
-Am I right?
-Yeah, pervert.

414
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,170
What pervert? Who is a pervert?

415
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,490
Ling Rui is not a pervert!

416
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,330
As a doctor

417
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,040
maintaining cleanliness

418
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,130
is very normal.

419
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:06,920
Moreover,

420
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,090
only when he is clean

421
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,570
his patients will be safe.

422
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,090
This shows that he is serious and responsible.

423
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,930
Did you hear that?

424
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,370
Did you hear that?

425
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,800
It's too difficult for me.

426
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,920
I know.

427
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,370
Don't be mad.

428
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,740
Okay?

429
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,330
Mom, I'm going out.

430
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:01,850
Come here.

431
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,640
What's wrong?

432
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,770
Sit.

433
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,850
You haven't been home recently.

434
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,570
What did you do?

435
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,810
Something.

436
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,880
You work at the front desk,

437
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,850
why would you be so busy?

438
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,570
I blame Fangning.

439
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,610
She did this to you.

440
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,540
This has nothing to do

441
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,650
with my sister.

442
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,060
Shut up.

443
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,970
Tell me honestly,

444
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,610
what are you doing?

445
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,890
Just meeting friends.

446
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,050
You have a girlfriend?

447
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,820
Mom, you misunderstood.

448
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,970
That's good.

449
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,340
What's her family like?

450
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,760
Does she have a sister?

451
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,410
That doesn't matter.

452
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,690
As long as her family has a solid foundation.

453
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,960
You should get married quickly.

454
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,610
Then your dad would be happy.

455
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,450
The inheritance is yours.

456
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,570
Mom, you think too much.

457
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,520
You know

458
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,530
I am not interested

459
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,530
in these things.

460
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,810
Are you short-minded or pig-headed?

461
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,840
Why are you not like me at all?

462
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,930
If you have nothing else, I'm leaving now.

463
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,140
Wait.

464
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,859
Where are you going?

465
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,569
Didn't I just say？

466
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,380
I'm meeting friends.

467
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,970
Girlfriend?

468
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,450
Take Mom with you.

469
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,650
Mom, you are thinking too much.

470
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,490
It's not convenient.

471
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,210
I'm going to study.

472
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,250
Study?

473
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,329
I didn't like studying when I was young.

474
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,569
What are you studying at this age?

475
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:22,690
I'm learning how to do business.

476
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,849
Live and learn.

477
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,210
Just leave this matter

478
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,369
alone to me.

479
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,569
I'm leaving now.

480
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,780
Don't leave. You…

481
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,850
[City Ballet]

482
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,730
Niuniu.

483
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,610
How is the class today?

484
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,050
Are all the students here?

485
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,050
They are all here.

486
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,090
They are all here, right?

487
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,100
Right.

488
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,160
There are so many people in class today.

489
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,090
Quite a lot of people today.

490
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,290
Stinky kid, I thought you were studying?

491
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,640
Mom, why are you here?

492
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,940
Why am I here?

493
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,980
You are not at home every day.

494
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,370
Coming to a messy place like this.

495
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,080
If your dad knew he would kill you.

496
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,330
Go home with me.

497
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,330
-Go home and study.
-Mom.

498
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,500
-Hurry up.
-You misunderstood.

499
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,810
Misunderstood what? Learning to do business?

500
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,890
Mom, you misunderstood.

501
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,600
Misunderstood what?

502
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,300
Let's go.

503
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,010
Fangyu.

504
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,930
Erfan.

505
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,770
Mrs. Lu is here too?

506
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,930
I told you.

507
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,040
Don't tell others.

508
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,180
In the case where

509
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,970
Ms. Lu finds out…

510
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,010
Finds out about what?

511
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,580
You're afraid if Fangning finds out about what?

512
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,940
You two were hiding from her.

513
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,560
What are you doing secretly?

514
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,740
Mrs. Lu, it's like this.

515
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,690
I've been teaching Fangyu recently.

516
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:41,730
How to do business.

517
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,640
How to manage the company.

518
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,650
Correct.

519
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,320
But this matter

520
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,620
was done secretly.

521
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,340
That's why I chose this place.

522
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,820
Because I and the person in charge here

523
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,060
are good friends.

524
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,170
They say here

525
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,020
is quiet and we won't be disturbed.

526
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,770
I really dare not

527
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,010
let Ms. Lu know about this.

528
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,250
Otherwise, my

529
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,040
pay and leave will…

530
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,890
I hope you can understand.

531
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,500
After all, I just want to live.

532
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,890
I understand.

533
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,050
Of course I understand.

534
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,010
Good son.

535
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,490
You finally understand.

536
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,500
Knowing how to learned behind Fangning's back.

537
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,720
Both of you are doing this is behind Fangning's back.

538
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,970
Mom is so happy.

539
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,200
But Mrs. Lu,

540
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,380
I'm afraid if you are here

541
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,220
we will get noticed easily.

542
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,210
Correct.

543
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:25,920
Oh, yes.

544
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,570
I'll go then. I'll go now.

545
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,890
Study well.

546
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,930
Mom is so relieved.

547
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,250
I'll make some soup for you.

548
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,050
To give you some nutrients.

549
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,780
Thank you, Mom.

550
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,930
I'll save you a bowl.

551
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,300
Good luck.

552
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,130
Mom, you're really leaving now?

553
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,490
Study well.

554
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,860
Teach him more, okay?

555
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,740
Goodbye, Mrs. Lu.

556
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,020
Goodbye.

557
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,850
You're awesome.

558
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,800
Then I'm leaving too.

559
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,610
Erfan,

560
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,020
thank you.

561
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,770
It's nothing.

562
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,050
No matter what you do

563
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,020
I'll support you.

564
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,840
And I heard that your mother

565
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,010
is bad at cooking.

566
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,450
If she really made my portion,

567
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,500
you drink it for me.

568
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,490
Erfan,

569
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,020
don't you have anything

570
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,860
you want to ask me?

571
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,770
So all these years

572
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:19,780
you've been secretly

573
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,580
learning ballet.

574
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,500
Yes.

575
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,080
More than ten years already.

576
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,170
You are hiding it very well.

577
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,650
If I didn't

578
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,720
happen to be working nearby

579
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,090
won't you be exposed?

580
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,410
It's usually fine.

581
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:33,860
I never thought my mother

582
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,770
would follow me today.

583
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,980
But this is nothing

584
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,090
shameful.

585
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,540
Why are you hiding from your family?

586
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,820
You don't know about this.

587
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,900
I mentioned it to my mom before.

588
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:44,610
She scolded me

589
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,780
for half a month.

590
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,210
Let alone my dad.

591
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,090
You also know my dad's temper.

592
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,080
Back then, my eldest sister

593
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,420
because…

594
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,500
Forget it.

595
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,260
By the way, Erfan,

596
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,250
I have something to ask you.

597
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,420
Erfan?

598
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,010
This one.

599
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,400
This is?

600
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,420
This is the male version of Swan Lake.

601
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,100
I know there's a

602
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,730
stereotype in most people's minds.

603
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,010
They think Swan Lake should be

604
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,690
for girls.

605
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,220
But this show,

606
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,410
I loved it since I was young.

607
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,450
The dance.

608
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,090
Now comes my chance.

609
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,540
This troupe

610
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
came to our school

611
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,860
and is casting the students.

612
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,840
I want to try.

613
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,330
Erfan.

614
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,340
Did you know?

615
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,660
Swan Lake is my elder sister's favorite

616
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,370
ballet.

617
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,180
When I went to see for the first time,

618
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,620
it was my sister who took me there.

619
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,610
After watching it

620
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,650
I was deeply attracted by it.

621
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,420
From that moment,

622
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,610
I feel that

623
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,680
it's the most important thing

624
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,960
in my life.

625
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,180
Now that I have a chance,

626
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,200
I want to interpret this dance

627
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,500
with my own methods.

628
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,820
After all,

629
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,900
this is the best gift I can give

630
00:21:59,210 --> 00:21:59,980
to her.

631
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,440
That's very good.

632
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,450
I support you.

633
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,900
You know that

634
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,780
my parents are so strict,

635
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,900
they certainly won't allow me to do this.

636
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,900
Fangyu.

637
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,160
In the past,

638
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,540
I have a friend

639
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,740
who told me something.

640
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,460
Today, I will give these words to you.

641
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,890
Regret and frustration

642
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,530
are countless times worse

643
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,810
than fear.

644
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,180
So while there is still something

645
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,060
you want to do.

646
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,300
Just do it.

647
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,690
I support you.

648
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,260
Okay.

649
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,220
Next.

650
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,400
Stretch a little.

651
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,640
Come here.

652
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,260
Me too.

653
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,260
You can just line up here.

654
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,810
This role suits you well.

655
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,140
Your styling is also very special.

656
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,730
We will contact you later.

657
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,770
-Thank you.
-Okay.

658
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,050
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

659
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,090
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

661
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,530
I've been expecting you.

662
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,300
Please wait a moment.

663
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,780
I'll get the information on the performances.

664
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,720
In the future,

665
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,970
You have to write to us.

666
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,010
Okay, I'll wait for you.

667
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,540
Okay.

668
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,420

Lu Fangyu.

671
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,420
Quite the unique last name.

672
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,460
I have a question.

673
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,540
Does the head of the Deer Sing Group

674
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,060
have a son?

675
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,120
Okay.

676
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,400
Interesting.

677
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,620
Sir.

678
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,040
There's a parcel for you.

679
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,380
Okay, you may go.

680
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:39,860
Okay.

681
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,180
How's my writing?

682
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,620
Great.

683
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,460
Amazing.

684
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,900
Awesome!

685
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,380
Oh my gosh.

686
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,220
Don't don't don't move.

687
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,620
Don't look!

688

Mr. Lu.

689
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,780
Why are you laughing so happily?

690
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
Why?

691
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,340
Look at what you did!

692
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,860
Look!

693
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,940
Look!

694
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,640
Look what you did!

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,540
at the gas station employee, and said,

703
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,580
"Air."

704
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,660
"Replace."

705
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,540
I think the author's brain

706
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,420
should be replaced instead.

707
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,020
Are you all right?

708
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,000
Fangning.

709
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,860
Why did you buy so many snacks?

710
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,330
I eat them.

711
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
Are they from Bai Jing?

712
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,140
No.

713
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,140
I bought them myself.

714
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,540
Here you go.

715
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,860
There are so many in the living room.

716
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,940
There are also in the kitchen lockers.

717
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,260
You'll be too full to have a proper meal.

718
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,540
I will eat it.

719
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,740
Stand properly.

720
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,740
Don't move.

721
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,980
What do you want to eat tonight?

722
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,540
I want to

723
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,300
eat you.

724
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,820
Hello?

725
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,220
Fangyu, open the door.

726
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,900
Listen to Mom.

727
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,860
Good son, have you heard?

728
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,060
Fangyu, Fangyu!

729
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,060
Son.

730
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,050
Your father is angry.

731
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:34,860
Don't you…

732
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,060
Open the door now!

733
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,820
I can hear you.

734
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,720
Quickly open the door!

735
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
Open the door.

736
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,420
Madam.

737
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,580
Sir said that

738
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,420
Fangyu must never go out.

739
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,260
You should leave him alone

740
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,420
so that he can calm down.

741
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,460
Good son.

742
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,100
I know

743
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,860
there must be

744
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,100
a misunderstanding, right?

745
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,800
When your Dad feels better,

746
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,140
explain to him

747
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,530
and solve this misunderstanding.

748
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,010
You are his only son.

749
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,420
He won't ignore you.

750
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Open the door.

751
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,340
Open the door!

752
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
You make me so anxious, open the door!

753
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,140
Fangyu!

754
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,540
Fangyu.

755
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,700
Erfan.

756
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,620
How are you? You all right?

757
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,740
I'm fine.

758
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,740
Well,

759
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,060
I did it too thoroughly

760
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,940
this time.

761
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,010
I'm afraid I can only rely on you.

762
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,340
Are you sure about this?

763
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,100
Yes.

764
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,100
If you leave now,

765
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,540
you can never come back again.

766
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,180
Ok.

767
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,780
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

768
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,380
What are you doing?

769
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,380
Who are you guys?

770
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,380
-Come.
-Let me go.

771
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,260
Let me go.

772
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,380
-Let go.
-Let me go.

773
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,180
-Fangyu.
-Erfan.

774
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,140
Fangyu.

775
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,650
Let me go.

776
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,100
Fangyu.

777
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,490
Let me go.

778
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,970
Save me, Erfan!

779
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,820
-Save me!
-Fangyu!

780
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,620
Let me go!

781
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,010
Fangyu!

782
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,890
Let me go!

783
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,660
Are you hurt?

784
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,860
I'm fine, Mom.

785
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,570
Why did you escape?

786
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,060
Why did you run away?

787
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,980
How dangerous it was!

788
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,340
You…

789
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,860
How can you escape?

790
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,900
-Big Brother.
-Look, your Dad is angry.

791
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,780
Calm down.

792
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,620
He is still a kid.

793
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,620
Don't be mad.

794
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,100
Go.

795
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,100
Big brother.

796
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,580
Wen… Wenbin.

797
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,220
Well, he…

798
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,220
He knew it was wrong.

799
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,180
He knows.

800
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,020
If he knows, that's fine.

801
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,180
Dad, what are you doing?

802
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,020
Stop!

803
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,900
Move aside!

804
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,340
You have no right to do this!

805
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,540
This is mine!

806
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,620
Yours?

807
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,180
Everything on you

808
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,420
I gave it to you!

809
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,750
Even you are mine!

810
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,460
Son.

811
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,740
Dad, you can't cut it!

812
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,380
Let him cut it.

813
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:31,940
That is my thing!

814
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,980
-Let him cut it?
-How can you cut it?

815
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,310
-Mom will buy new ones for you.
-How can you cut it?

816
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,140
Mom, it's not about money.

817
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,540
This is my dream!

818
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,100
What's happening?

819
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,220
I could hear you yelling

820
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,350
from the entrance.

821
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,300
Wonderful.

822
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,340
Fantastic.

823
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,860
Lu Wenbin, President of the Deer Sing Group.

824
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,130
What are you tearing apart?

825
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,860
A tutu?

826
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,900
Father and son fighting against each other.

827
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,220
Sexism.

828
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,780
What else?

829
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,180
Drama in a rich family?

830
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,060
I heard you have been doing ballet.

831
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,420
That's pretty good.

832
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,940
Finally,

833
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,180
you have found something you are good at.

834
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,850
In this house,

835
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,900
other than the both of us

836
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,140
who love money,

837
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,500
there's finally an artist.

838
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,150
Isn't this a good thing?

839
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,460
Pretty gorgeous.

840
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,380
I bet you spent a lot of money?

841
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,340
It's also the money of our Lu family.

842
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,180
Keep it away.

843
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,010
What a shame to cut.

844
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,620
Oh, right.

845
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,740
Ling Rui and I,

846
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,660
Aunt Gao.

847
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,180
Yes?

848
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,980
Put these dirty things away,

849
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,220
throw them into the sea.

850
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,470
-Okay.
-Stop.

851
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,740
-Stand aside!
-Don't move!

852
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,420
You!

853
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,820
Before coming, Ling Rui asked me

854
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,220
to talk to you

855
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,220
and be reasonable.

856
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,340
But I realized that people like you

857
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,740
can't be reasoned with.

858
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,780
The reason is right in front of you.

859
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,300
But you just don't want to watch or listen.

860
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,700
What did Lu Fangyu do wrong?

861
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,380
He did nothing wrong.

862
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,460
He is just doing

863
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,220
what he likes to do.

864
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,290
Big Sister.

865
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,940
Let him throw it and let him cut.

866
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,380
Anyway, I won't give up

867
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,290
my dreams.

868
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,380
I have loved dancing since I was a kid.

869
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,740
If it wasn't to not upset you

870
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,820
and not make mom sad…

871
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,500
-Don't say it.
-I have to say!

872
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,710
I won't think about anything else now!

873
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,660
Not even death!

874
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,940
Great, go then!

875
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,230
You can go die for me now!

876
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,030
Go what?

877
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,580
Say it.

878
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:42,940
What is it?

879
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,580
You can't say it?

880
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,270
After all, it's not your first time.

881
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,220
Say it, say it!

882
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:49,900
Fangning.

883
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,060
Anger cannot solve any problem.

884
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,420
Don't make yourself regret it.

885
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:05,900
Dad.

886
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,870
We're leaving now.

887
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:08,850
Let's go.

888
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:09,780
Go.

889
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:10,790
Go.

890
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,780
Lu Fangyu, come with me.

891
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,270
Big Brother.

892
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,550
Calm down.

893
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,780
I'll go.

894
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,060
I'll deal with it.

895
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,340
Don't be mad.

896
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,460
Don't be mad.

897
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,100
Okay?

898
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,310
Fangning.

899
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,530
Get in the car first.

900
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,670
Let me talk to him.

901
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,540
Fangning.

902
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,350
It's okay.

903
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,900
Take care of Lu Fangyu.

904
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,020
Speak.

905
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,820
How do you want to persuade me?

906
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,260
Give him some time.

907
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,540
You saw it just now.

908
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,790
Your dad is actually feeling quite bad about it.

909
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,830
It's been ten years.

910
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,820
Is that not enough?

911
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,830
What's the difference between this case

912
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,980
and my sister's?

913
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,889
Because he is too authoritarian, my sister…

914
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,780
You can't blame him for today's matter.

915
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,870
Fangyu's photo was sent by a reporter.

916
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:31,980
They are obviously

917
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,949
blackmailing your dad.

918
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,230
Your dad is also afraid

919
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,179
if something went wrong.

920
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,550
It might affect Fangyu's future

921
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,659
and Deer Sing's reputation.

922
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,860
Future?

923
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,219
He doesn't even know

924
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,980
what is the future Fangyu wants.

925
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,350
Take it easy.

926
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,340
He will understand.

927
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,219
I don't expect him to understand.

928
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,100
If he did,

929
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,780
it won't be like this now

930
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,510
to Fangyu.

931
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,430
Fangning.

932
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Listen to me.

933
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,350
Fangyu's matter,

934
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,230
I will solve it.

935
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,010
These few days,

936
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,100
stop irritating your dad.

937
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,100
Whatever.

938
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,380
I don't want to

939
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,350
stay here anyway.

940
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,870
You will stay in the hotel temporarily, all right?

941
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,150
I've arranged everything for you.

942
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,530
Don't worry about the cost.

943
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,500
I will get Gao Erfan

944
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,060
to send you your luggage.

945
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:52,550
Okay.

946
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,300
Sister.

947
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,140
This time,

948
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,740
thank you so much.

949
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,830
You have called me a sister

950
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,220
so many times.

951
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,900
But this one just now was the most pleasant.

952
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,310
Lu Fangyu,

953
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,500
listen to me, all right?

954
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,420
Okay.

955
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,690
Regardless of your decision

956
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,430
in the future,

957
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,510
whatever you plan to do,

958
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,310
I will always support you.

959
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,470
So don't be afraid.

960
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,910
Okay.

961
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,770
All right.

962
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,700
Go.

963
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,050
Sister.

964
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,030
I'm really going up.

965
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,110
Stop talking to me

966
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,550
like a coward.

967
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,230
Go.

968
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:09,910
Goodbye.

969
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,790
Fangning.

970
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,140
Fangning.

971
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,140
What happened?

972
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,030
Are you okay?

973
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,550
Ten years have passed.

974
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,510
I thought he has changed.

975
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,630
Until I saw Fangyu today,

976
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,070
I realized,

977
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,940
he is still like that.

978
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,350
Fangning.

979
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,780
You don't have to treat everyone

980
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,250
as your enemy.

981
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,980
You don't have to

982
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,950
close your heart to everyone.

983
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,470
We are married now,

984
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,460
I am willing to share with you

985
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,620
my happiness and pain,

986
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,390
every part of my life.

987
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,630
I hope you can do the same.

988
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,590
If

989
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,020
there's something

990
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,190
that can make you happy,

991
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,550
I am willing to do it for you.

992
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,450
Thank you.

993
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,180
Ling Rui.

994
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,870
Can you accompany me to a place?

995
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,510
Before this,

996
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,070
I often come here alone,

997
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,580
standing right here

998
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,900
and observing the store.

999
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,470
Now,

1000
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,300
I'll be with you.

1001
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,410
You can watch it as long as you want.

1002
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,710
Ling Rui.

1003
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,610
Did you know?

1004
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,150
I have been telling you before,

1005
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,750
founding Infinite

1006
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,950
is my wish.

1007
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,550
Actually that's not true.

1008
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,620
This is not my wish.

1009
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,310
Founding Infinite

1010
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,590
all this while

1011
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,190
has been my elder sister's wish,

1012
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,810
if

1013
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,430
she hasn't left yet.
