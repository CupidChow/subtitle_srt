Hello, everyone.

I'm the president of Deer Sing Group.

This is my wife Yang Yi.

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,210
As you can see, she is excited.

29
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,960
Well, I'm excited, too, actually.

30
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,640
Because we've made a last-minute decision

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,610
here today

32

great news,

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,079
that is

Ling Rui

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
would be the face

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,079
of our new brand Infinity.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,760
Listen to me.

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,170
Shouldn't it be Bai Jing?

42
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,640
How did it become our boss?

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,440
Where's Bai Jing?

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
I just heard Bai Jing

mumbling about

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,760
is so happy.

48
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,120
He probably heard the news

49
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,010
and got out of here.

If anything happens today,

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,240
and the bad news gets around,

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,840
our stocks will plummet tomorrow.

55
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,650
Think about all the Deer Sing stocks

57

Calm down.

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,760
Alright.

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,440
I sincerely hope that

61
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,210

74

we would like to confess to you.

Don't worry, I'm here.

My marriage with Ling Rui

80
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,200
is a little unusual.

81
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
In the beginning,

82
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,640
I used a

83
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,920
certain way

84
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,680
to force him to marry me.

85
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,320
What the hell?

86
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,160
Didn't they say they were in a relationship?

87
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,380
Write that down.

[Infinity Product Press Release] [Lu Fangning reveals abnormal beginnings of her marriage]

90
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,600

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,000
started out a little different.

94
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,600
Because of that,

95
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,850
we've taken a few wrong turns, too.

96
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,240
There's been a lot of misunderstandings.

97
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,240
But we are grateful for

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,050
this unusual experience.

99
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,760
It allowed us to get into each other's lives,

100
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,600
and learn the true meaning of marriage.

101
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,040
Love

102
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,770
exceeds everything.

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,520
Actually,

104
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,450
the conception of Infinity

105
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,560
came from something

106
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,880
that my sister Lu Yue said.

107
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,490
Giving you infinite meanings

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
in a finite time.

109
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,450
Therefore,

110
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,920
I hope the series of

111
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,800
Infinity's furniture

112
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,840
could bring a little bit of

113
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,080
difference to

114
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,760
everyone's daily life.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,010
Enjoy the people around you and the love.

116
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,560
Cherish every minute

117
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,280
and every second of every day.

118
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,080
I also wish the Infinity series

119
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,760
could be more than furniture.

120
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,159
It could also become

121
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:45,840
an emotional connection

122
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,120
between everyone.

123
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,720
Just like the meaning

124
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,880
of Infinity's name.

125
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,120
In a finite time,

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,320
giving you infinite love.

127
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,250

Mr. Ling.

133
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,480
While this release conference is ongoing,

134
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,680
there came a few scandals

135
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,690
about your

136
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,600
marriage situation.

137
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,320
What do you think?

138
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,680
I think

139
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
it's because I'm

140
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
just too perfect.

141
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,240
If nobody hates me,

142
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,120
wouldn't it be unfair?

143
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,200
Ms. Lu,

144
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
about the rumor that

145
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,480
your marriage is a

146
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,610
money transaction,

147
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,520
what do you think?

148
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,690
Miss reporter, may I ask if

149
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,570
you have someone on your mind

150
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,159
that you really wanted

151
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,800
but you couldn't get?

152
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:40,960
Yeah.

153
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,880
If there's a chance now,

154
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,010
and all you have to give

155
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,450
is your three months' salary.

156
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,040
For the next year,

157
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,409
you'll be able to

158
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,520
enjoy the fact that

159
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,360
the man you love

160
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,080
completely belongs to you.

161
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,920
Would you take it?

162
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,890
Sure.

163
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,400
That's what I thought at first.

164
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,160
And then I found out

165
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,080
it's impossible.

166
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,840
Because love is

167
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,760
cannot be bought with money.

168
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,040
But until then,

169
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,400
it's okay to dream.

170
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,080
He means more than just a lover

171
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,280
or a husband to me.

172
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,720
He is also what I'm fighting for,

173
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,280
and who I make money for.

174
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,610
I want to give

175
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,640
all the best things that I have

176
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,570
to him.

177
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,230
Mr. Ling.

178
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,900
Mr. Ling.

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,530
Mr. Ling.

180
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,410
Mr. Ling, may I ask

181
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,880
why you didn't say anything?

182
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,720
What do you think of

183
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,320
the marital relationship

184
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,400
between you and your wife?

185
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,490
Yeah, what's your thought?

186
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,330
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

187
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,890
To me,

188
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,640
she is the best of everything.

189
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,090
Thank you.

190
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,320
OK. That's good.

191
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,120
Thank you, Ms. Lu.

192
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,680
Thank you, Ms. Lu.

193
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,010
♫ My dear, I have three hearts for you ♫

194
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,800
♫ Listen to this carefully, this shall not be done half-heartedly ♫

195
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,250
♫ You must love and give with all your heart ♫

196
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,730
♫ exist only for you ♫

197
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,000
One-year marriage? Money transaction?

198
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:23,880
Did Ling Rui

199
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,360
sell himself for four million?

200
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Four million?

201
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,520
My…

202
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,160
My son is

203
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,640
worth only four million?

204
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,160
Don't ask.

205
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,080
I love her anyway.

206
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,400
"I love her."

207
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,000
Look at this.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,880
Ling Rui says he loves her.

209
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,690
It's none of my business.

210
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,170
Where are you going?

211
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,410
It's all your fault.

212
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,360
Your fault.

213
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,530
How could you stay out of it?

214
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,810
-I have to punch you.
-Punch you.

215
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,650
-It's all your fault.
-It's all your fault.

216
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,640
I was wrong.

217
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,200
Why did you tell them about

218
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,130
the transaction

219
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,650
at Infinity's release conference?

220
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,520
I'm just glad I made this choice.

221
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,920
Otherwise,

222
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,240
all the efforts poured in for Infinity

223
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,320
would be tainted by

224
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,280
my marriage.

225
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
If Ling Rui hadn't tricked you to marry him,

226
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,840
this kind of thing would not

227
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,880
have happened today.

228
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,760
Simon,

229
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,280
I know I owe you an explanation.

230
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,240
But as I said,

231
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,490
I took the initiative.

232
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,330
I wanted to do this.

233
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,080
This has nothing to do with Ling Rui.

234
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,200
Even if the marriage

235
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,520
was your idea,

236
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,810
then what about Tang Ping?

237
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,200
Is hers also a one-sided love?

238
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,560
Fangning, don't you see?

239
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
He's lying to you.

240
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,090
In order to make you believe him,

241
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,040
he can pretend to be the kind of guy

242
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,280
that you like.

243
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,320
Simon,

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,360
this is my marriage.

245
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,720
My relationship with Ling Rui

246
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,560
is also my personal business.

247
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,320
I'm trying to protect you, Fangning.

248
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,960
What happened to you?

249
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,290
You've always been

250
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,840
a rational, calm man,

251
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,000
and never suspected

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,650
someone else like this

253
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,400
without probable cause.

254
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,330
What's the matter with you, Simon?

255
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,240
What's wrong with me?

256
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,720
I just…

257
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,890
You both need to calm down.

258
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,570
Simon.

259
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,690
I'm not gonna stop you from caring about Fangning.

260
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,040
I believe that in the end,

261
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,520
you're gonna have

262
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,480
a right judgment

263
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,410
about whether I'm good to her.

264
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,530
Fangning, let's go.

265
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,120
She's good at what she does.

266
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,680
And even better at finding a husband.

267
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,730
Yes, they confessed, so what?

268
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,680
Their marriage is indeed fake.

269
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
How is it fake?

270
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,320
The two of them

271
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,280
are truly in love.

272
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,650
What's fake?

273
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,490
Let me tell you.

274
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,680
You just don't want to see Fangning

275
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,480
live a good life.

276
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,560
You're just jealous.

277
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,120
I…

278
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,530
You put too much faith in them.

279
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,210
Everything she says now sounds good to you.

280
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,240
So is everything she does.

281
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,680
I didn't want you to be fooled.

282
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,560
I'm telling you.

283
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,440
Everything that Fangning

284
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
does is good.

285
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,570
She is perfect to me.

286
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,320
OK?

287
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Look at yourself.

288
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,960
You went up

289
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,200
to the stage of the press conference.

290
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,800
Do you know what you looked like?

291
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,480
You're like a shrew!

292
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,770
You're really making me

293
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,280
lose my face.

294
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,490
Do you think that

295
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,240
if you did this,

296
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,440
Fangyu could come back?

297
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,490
Have a think!

298
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,440
Think with your brain.

299
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,010
What are you thinking about?

300
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,970
Why did Fangyu leave?

301
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,120
It's because Lu Fangning

302
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,640
was bullying him in the company.

303
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,010
That's why he went dancing.

304
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,320
If he didn't dance,

305
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,930
how could he be abroad

306
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,240
and suffering now?

307
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,250
And you.

308
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:02,760
What?

309
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,520
You let Lu Fangning

310
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,920
bully your son.

311
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,800
It's your fault.

312
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,610
You and your perfect daughter

313
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,440
drove my son away.

314
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,880
Lu Fangning bullied him?

315
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,850
And I bullied him?

316
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,210
Come on, he should have the ability to protect himself.

317
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,360
If you care about him so much,

318
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,530
why didn't you go dancing with him?

319
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,720
You two should dance together.

320
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,560
Go dancing.

321
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,720
You're kicking me out?

322
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,640
I'm not kicking you out.

323
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,680
You just told me to go.

324
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,720
I didn't.

325
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,970
You sent our son away.

326
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,280
Now you're kicking me out.

327
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
I'm not kicking you out.

328
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,730
You don't want our son,

329
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,680
and you don't want me.

330
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,050
Why is my life so hard?

331
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,170
Psycho.

332
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,280
I married you.

333
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,480
Yet I haven't had a single good day.

334
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,120
I choked down all the bitterness in life.

335
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
In the end, you don't want me and my son.

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,850
Look at yourself.

337
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,200
You're out there messing around and you're still doing that at home.

338
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,810
Do you really

339
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,120
have to be such a shrew!

340
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,680
All you care about is Lu Fangning,

341
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,010
not me and my son.

342
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,000
Now you want a divorce?

343
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,010
I won't agree with that.

344
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,320
Psycho.

345
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,290
I took the initiative.

346
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,080
I wanted this.

347
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,410
This has nothing to do with Ling Rui.

348
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,360
Even if the marriage

349
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,080
was your idea,

350
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,410
then what about Tang Ping?

351
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,600
Is hers also a one-sided love?

352
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,280
Fangning, don't you see?

353
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,640
He's lying to you.

354
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,400
Simon.

355
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,360
This is my marriage.

356
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,800
My relationship with Ling Rui

357
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,370
is also my personal business.

358
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,290
What brings

359
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,480
our tasteful Director Lu

360
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,280
here today?

361
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,970
Why is your super nice

362
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,440
girlfriend

363
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,080
is not here?

364
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,640
Do you like Ling Rui?

365
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,890
It's none of your business.

366
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,640
I can help you.

367
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,280
How is that possible?

368
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,520
Are you nuts?

369
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,530
Of course not.

370
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,690
I can help you get him.

371
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,520
Is today April Fools'?

372
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,800
Or the end of the world?

373
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,040
Don't trick me.

374
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,560
Tang Ping.

375
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,280
Everything I'm saying right now

376
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,120
is serious.

377
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,440
I want you to tell

378
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,530
Fangning the truth

379
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,960
of how Ling Rui tricked her

380
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,160
and fooled you at the same time

381
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,200
to get everything he wanted

382
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,650
from you two.

383
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,640
Do you have any idea

384
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,650
what you're talking about?

385
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,170
Have you read too many novels?

386
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,450
I don't want to be the mean girl here.

387
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,280
Hey,

388
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,200
why are you still defending him?

389
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,050
Or are you trying to cover for him?

390
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,120
I actually want to defend him.

391
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,080
But he doesn't need it.

392
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,320
Dr. Ling.

393
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,920
He is a real streak of

394
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,040
pure white moonlight.

395
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,000
There's not even one single flaw in him.

396
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,210
That's why I both love and hate him.

397
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,600
You won't understand.

398
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,920
Tell me. Do I look good

399
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,080
in a wedding dress?

400
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:52,970
Tang Ping.

401
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,720
I was hoping you could

402
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,960
think about

403
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,120
what I just told you.

404
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,080
Bye.

405
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,760
Love you.

406
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:06,760
Bye.

407
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,839
What's wrong with him?

408
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,920
Evil mother-in-law?

409
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,359
Or the scheming supporting actor?

410
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,880
Wait.

411
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,120
I didn't do anything wrong.

412
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,240
What am I panicking about?

413
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,840
Shouldn't he run up

414
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,320
to me, explain himself,

415
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,400
and do some sweet talking

416
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,480
at times like this?

417
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,680
I'm walking so slowly.

418
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Why hasn't he caught up?

419
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,730
Didn't he see me?

420
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,280
Siyu.

421
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,520
Excuse me. One second.

422
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,800
Siyu.

423
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,730
Yes, Director Lu?

424
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,840
I'm busy.

425
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,440
Let's talk.

426
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,040
What does Director Lu

427
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,280
want to talk about?

428
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm sorry.

429
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,960
I shouldn't have lied to you

430
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,880
about this whole recorder thing.

431
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,440
Yeah.

432
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,640
Yeah.

433
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,890
And?

434
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,000
And?

435
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,080
Yeah.

436
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,210
Now that you've apologized to me,

437
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,640
you're supposed to say you regret it,

438
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,240
it won't happen again,

439
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,210
and you're gonna put

440
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,250
my feelings first.

441
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,080
I lied to you,

442
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,960
and that is my fault.

443
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,240
I apologize for that.

444
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,800
What I did was wrong.

445
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,560
However,

446
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,160
I don't regret it.

447
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,200
If I didn't do this,

448
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,650
I wouldn't know the truth about

449
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,130
Fangning and Ling Rui.

450
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,080
And Ling Rui

451
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,520
is surely up to something.

452
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,970
I don't want Fangning

453
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,040
to fall into his trap like this.

454
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,330
Sorry, Director Lu.

455
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,600
I don't see it the same way you do.

456
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,880
And,

457
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,050
you seem to have forgotten one thing.

458
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,080
You keep talking about Fangning.

459
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,880
Lu Fangning.

460
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,120
Did you ever think about me?

461
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,240
Ms. Lu is my friend.

462
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,560
You made me betray my friend

463
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,000
in a way like this.

464
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,440
Did it ever occur to you

465
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,610
how I'm supposed to face her?

466
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:44,680
Alright.

467
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,040
Even if in your heart,

468
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,170
I'm not in the first place.

469
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,250
But do I have any place there?

470
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,530
I guess I shouldn't have expected

471
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,530
your apology.

472
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,240
[Deer Sing]

473
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,640
Ms. Lu,

474
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,120
the next couple of plans

475
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,920
that we present to you

476
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,650
were all made by

477
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,010
[Shooting Proposal]

478
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,690
the Planning Department

479
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,160
overnight

480
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,120
for our two

481
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,200
new spokespersons.

482
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,610
The first plan.

483
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,480
Walking down a boardwalk in the mountains.

484
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,250
Man meets nature.

485
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,490
How beautiful is this?

486
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,240
Back to primitive life.

487
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,410
Getting some fresh air

488
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,840
in these hills.

489
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,240
The second plan.

490
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,400
Walking on the endless highway.

491
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,600
The highway is like

492
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,560
a golden belt

493
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,120
leading to the perfect place.

494
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,440
Very comfortable.

495
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,920
It fits our theme.

496
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,160
The third plan

497
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,480
is an endless lake.

498
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,800
You can see it's perfectly still.

499
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,880
Just like our brand,

500
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,360
simple, elegant,

501
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,840
and refreshing.

502
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,080
It calms the mind.

503
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,130
The fourth plan is a small town in Europe.

504
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,880
European towns

505
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,040
combined with

506
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,200
the eastern face of our brand,

507
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,970
the clash of cultures

508
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,890
makes a perfect fit.

509
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,800
The God-chosen place.

510
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:10,970
Ms. Lu.

511
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,360
These are

512
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,200
the first four

513
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,160
of our proposals.

514
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,240
What do you think?

515
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,120
It's not enough to make a splash.

516
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,000
It's not original enough.

517
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,450
The budget's too high.

518
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,480
Too low for me.

519
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
No problem.

520
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,320
We still have one last option.

521
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,760
The urban cultural initiative.

522
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,120
The ones we talked about before

523
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,530
are about combining our brand

524
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,480
with traditional cultures.

525
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,320
But this is different.

526
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,360
This is a

527
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,640
combination of urban culture.

528
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,760
It's definitely on the cutting edge of fashion.

529
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,160
Besides,

530
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,840
we could use urban culture

531
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,400
to accentuate and elevate

532
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,440
our brand awareness.

533
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,920
Ms. Lu.

534
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,480
This is the last one.

535
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,890
What do you think?

536
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,610
I don't like it.

537
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,090
Ms. Lu.

538
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,280
What do you have in mind?

539
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,960
You can tell us

540
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,890
about it, too.

541
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,480
So we can find the right direction.

542
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,240
I think…

543
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,160
I think this thing needs to

544
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,080
leave some empty space

545
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,290
for people to imagine.

546
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,410
We can't be too specific,

547
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,130
or too graphic.

548
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,000
Please go on, Ms. Lu.

549
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,080
I think we can have fewer people in it.

550
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,170
Fewer?

551
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,120
Well, let's make sure

552
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,080
to use scenic or panoramic shots.

553
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,960
The people in the ads

554
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,560
can only take up

555
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,840
half of the picture.

556
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,360
Fewer.

557
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,960
One third?

558
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,440
Fewer.

559
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
A quarter of it?

560
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,970
What do you say we use our backs?

561
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,880
I'm gonna go to the toilet.

562
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,320
Backs?

563
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,520
The camera pulls out,

564
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,080
and the two little silhouettes

565
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,930
could just be a profile on the picture.

566
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,240
How's that?

567
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,120
I'm gonna go take a pill.

568
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,360
Please don't put his voice in it.

569
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,120
Because Ling Rui's voice

570
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,280
sounds too good.

571
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,570
You've heard it before, right?

572
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,320
Yeah.

573
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,080
We can't let them know

574
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,240
Ling Rui's job.

575
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,640
What are we gonna do now?

576
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,280
If it goes like this,

577
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,090
I might actually be on my meds soon.

578
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,430
Dr. Ling.

579
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,270
Dr. Ling.

580
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,240
Help us.

581
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,520
We've just had

582
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,720
a six-hour meeting.

583
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,520
And not a single proposal was accepted.

584
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,810
We're going bald from this.

585
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,360
-What should we do?
-Ask him to come here.

586
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,320
Come here.

587
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,850
Help.

588
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,240
Our boss is so hard to please.

589
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,320
Will he come?

590
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,000
Dr. Ling.

591
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,730
What do you think?

592
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,320
Which would you prefer?

593
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,570
I had a look at these proposals.

594
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
They all look pretty good to me.

595
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,520
But in this field,

596
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,250
I'm not a professional.

597
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,560
I'll leave it to you.

598
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,880
Ms. Lu.

599
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,760
Since Dr. Ling said so,

600
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,080
what do you think?

601
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,000
But…

602
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,960
-But...
-But what?

603
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,290
But I've seen

604
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,520
you scheduled this

605
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,160
at the beginning of the next month.

606
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,970
I don't think I'll be available then.

607
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,760
Because this time of year,

608
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,570
I have to go back to my hometown.

609
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,560
You heard that?

610
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Dr. Ling won't be available.

611
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,970
Change the schedule.

612
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,880
But Ms. Lu,

613
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,890
Infinity's products

614
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,080
for the next season

615
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,360
are about to be released to the market.

616
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,890
We can't do without the face of the brand

617
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,010
at the time of

618
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,760
the brand's first big launch, can we?

619
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,130
Go get Bai Jing.

620
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,480
Bai Jing has canceled

621
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,040
his partnership agreement with Deer Sing.

622
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,440
We've even collected the penalty.

623
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,360
Ask him again.

624
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,080
Ask him to give us a discount.

625
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,520
After all, he got

626
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,250
the first payment.

627
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,400
If…

628
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,320
If you don't mind,

629
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,490
perhaps

630
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,810
we could shoot in my hometown.

631
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
-Yeah, no problem.
-Yeah, no problem.

632
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,770
Ling Rui.

633
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,440
I think that

634
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,640
if you really don't want to,

635
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,010
you don't have to do this.

636
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,890
Actually, these are

637
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,240
not big problems.

638
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,410
I can find someone else to do it.

639
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,520
I know.

640
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,080
You don't want to intrude on my life.

641
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,960
But since we have

642
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,570
announced it at the press conference.

643
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,610
We have to make it happen.

644
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:41,930
And plus,

645
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,680
we can shoot at my hometown.

646
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,320
You can do your job,

647
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,080
and I can do mine.

648
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,720
Isn't that great?

649
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
But…

650
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,800
Alright, that's just my opinion.

651
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,960
You can listen to the suggestions

652
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,010
of the Planning Department.

653
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,480
Alright.

654
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,690
Don't you still have a meeting?

655
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,570
Go.

656
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,570
Go.

657
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,760
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

658
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,680
Hello, Simon.

659
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,250
I need to talk to you.

660
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,480
I hope I'm not interrupting your work.

661
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,570
What are you doing here?

662
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,930
I'm here for the spokesperson planning meeting.

663
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,200
In a few days,

664
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,160
I'm gonna take Fangning

665
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,330
to my hometown

666
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,880
and shoot the commercials.

667
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,250
Oh.

668
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,440
That's what you came here to tell me?

669
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,720
What am I supposed to say?

670
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,560
Should I say that your place in Fangning's heart

671
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,360
is unshakable?

672
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,360
No.

673
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,040
I'm here to remind you that

674
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,480
if you've been hiding

675
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,800
a secret for ten years

676
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,650
just to avoid hurting Fangning,

677
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,490
then why should you

678
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,160
give up now?

679
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,720
What are you talking about?

680
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,880
Lu Yiyao.

681
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,560
You can easily tell

682
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,040
whether I've hurt Fangning or not.

683
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,160
Your hostility towards me

684
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,530
is not because I did something wrong,

685
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,880
but because the man standing

686
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,450
next to Fangning

687
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,240
is me, not you.

688
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,480
I'm not in a position to judge

689
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,360
you departure ten years ago.

690
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,240
But I thank you

691
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,890
for not letting your feelings

692
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,320
hurt Fangning.

693
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,730
But if you still can't

694
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,800
let go by now,

695
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
it'll only make Fangning feel bad.

696
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,720
How do you know all this stuff?

697
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
A man like you

698
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,250
who has been hiding your feelings for ten years

699
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,280
and knew how important that

700
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,560
the conference was to Fangning,

701
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,360
still chose to expose everything

702
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,240
at that time.

703
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,290
This means you've lost your mind,

704
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,680
and you can't control your emotions.

705
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,440
Do you think that

706
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,800
Fangning can't

707
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,960
see through all of this?

708
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,360
I'll take Fangning

709
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,440
away for a while.

710
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,490
In the meantime, I'd appreciate

711
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,040
it if you could get your emotions together.

712
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
What makes you think

713
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,440
you have the right to tell me this?

714
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,600
Because I can

715
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,730
love her fair and square.

716
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,080
That's all I've got.

717
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,920
Besides,

718
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,200
Fangning is not someone

719
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,970
who needs others' protection.

720
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,240
What she needs is someone to

721
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
stand next to her.

722
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,250
And now,

723
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,610
I'll stand by her side.

[Wheatfields represent hope]

725

Ms. Lu.

726
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,400
This is my special proposal

727
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,560
which is customized

just for you and Dr. Ling.

730
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,440
How's it?

731
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,770
Are you sure that

732
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,400
this is Ling Rui's hometown?

733
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,490
Yes, of course.

734
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,040
I got these off the Internet.

735
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
The picturesque scenery.

736
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,640
Full of nature's spirit.

737
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,600
And completely undeveloped.

738
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,880
Just right for Infinity.

739
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,680
What a pleasant surprise.

740
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,440
So,

741
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,160
I highly recommend you and Dr. Ling

742
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,200
to have your

743
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,280
honeymoon here.

744
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,920
And just take some pictures

745
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,290
during your spare time.

746
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,720
What do you think, Ms. Lu?

747
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,280
Ms. Lu.

748
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,760
This is shooting three birds with one arrow.

completely?

755
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,560
It's exactly what you are thinking.

756
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:45,730
Think about it.

757
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,280
In a secluded farming town,

758
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,130
away from the buzz of the city,

759
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,720
in the golden fields of wheat,

760
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,610
the wind carries the waves of wheat.

761
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,250
Waves.

762
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's so romantic.

763
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,200
I'm talking about the shooting.

764
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,080
It's all for work.

765
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,200
And of course,

766
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,600
it's also for Ms. Lu's

767

768

Then it's settled.

769
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,530
You and Dr. Ling go ahead first.

770
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,920
We'll work out the plan at the company.

771
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,680
And we'll be there in a few days

772

so that you and Dr. Ling

773
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,760
could complete the final step.

774
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,360
All right, go ahead.

775
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,040
All right.

Wave.

780
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,520
You knew how important that conference

781
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,690
was to Fangning,

782
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,800
and still chose to

783
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,810
expose everything at that time.

784
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,330
It means you've lost your mind,

785
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,720
and you can't control your emotions.

786
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,360
Fangning is not someone

787
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,720
who needs others' protection.

788
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,400
What she needs is

789
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,080
someone to

790
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,080
stand next to her.

791
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,690
And now,

792
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,080
I will stand by her side.

793
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,800
Is this the ending?

794
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,530
What a bad ending.

795
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:08,880
No way.

796
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,040
Even if I'll die, I have to know the truth.

797

798
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,920
Simon.

799
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,020
Simon.

800
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,030
You've got a call.

801
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:54,480
Hello.

802
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,160
Hello.

got drunk at the Alleyway Bar.

805
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,730
If you're his friend,

806
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,080
can you come and get him?

807
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,130
Okay.

808
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,210
Lu Yiyao.

809

Lu Yiyao.

810
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,050
Lu Yiyao.

811
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,400
Naughty.

812
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,560
Are you really drunk?

813
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,130
Well, is this the time when

814
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,480
you tell the truth while you're drunk?

815
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,490
Lu Yiyao.

816
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,410
What's your bank account password?

817
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,040
Password?

818
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,760
35768024.

819
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,160
What kind of password is this? It's so long.

820
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:56,880
Lu Yiyao.

821
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,080
So who's your favorite person?

822
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,680
Do they have a long name too?

823
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,600
Don't bother.

824
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,480
I mean, he's this drunk.

825
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,760
He should be asleep by now.

826
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:19,960
Young lady,

827
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,160
now that you're here,

828
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,130
I'm gonna have to ask you

829
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,080
to pay the bill for him.

830
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,450
We don't accept credit

831
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,480
even from my best customers.

832
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
-This…
-Excuse me.

833
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,840
Do I look like that kind of

834
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,010
naive and stupid girl?

835
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,640
I can't get anything out of him.

836
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,600
And I have to pay for you!

837
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:48,840
Pay?

838
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,560
Who's paying?

839
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,800
I got money.

840
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,840
Money.

841
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,040
I thought you said you don't use a wallet.

842
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,640
Why are you so tall?

843
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,200
I can't even get a picture of you.

844
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,040
You stay down, stay down.

845
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,160
What are you doing?

846
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,960
Just squat down.

847
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,120
Alright.

848
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,490
How about we use this picture

849
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,370
as our lock screen wallpaper?

850
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,080
What do you say?

851
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,960
No, we're in a secret relationship.

852
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,210
This is too public.

853
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,120
Well, why don't we

854
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,080
put it in our wallets?

855
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,440
Every time you open it,

856
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,280
you'll see me.

857
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,160
Isn't that wonderful?

858
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,440
But I don't really use a wallet.

859
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,240
Every time you open it,

860
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,320
you'll see the one you love.

861
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,800
Cai Siyu.

862
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,520
Director Lu.

863
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,290
Let's have dinner after work.

864
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,160
Cai Siyu.

865
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,810
When did you and Simon

866
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,290
get close enough to have dinner together?

867
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:08,480
That's right.

868
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,410
When?

869
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,240
If I didn't do this,

870
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,680
I wouldn't know the truth about it.

871
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,160
Fangning and Ling Rui.

872
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,490
And Ling Rui surely

873
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,730
is up to something.

874
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,680
I don't want Fangning

875
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,800
to walk into a trap like this.

876
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:09,840
Hello.

877
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,040
Simon.

878
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,440
The girl who paid for you

879
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,200
left your wallet

880
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,330
here at the bar.

881
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,120
Come and get it when you're free.

882
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:17,890
OK.

883
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,720
Director Lu.

884
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,120
Hi, Director Lu.

885
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,570
Lin Qi was here just now.

886
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,360
There're some new kittens at the pet store.

887
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,170
Let's check it out after work.

888
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,840
Here you are.

889
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,160
Look, this kitten is new here.

890
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,920
Isn't it cute?

891
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,640
Last time I brought you here

892
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,290
I noticed that you liked kittens.

893
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:46,680
What do you say?

894
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,090
Do you want one?

895
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,010
Siyu.

896
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,880
You don't like this one?

897
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,200
Then how about that one?

898
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,680
That one's cute, too.

899
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,010
Siyu.

900
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,160
What are you doing?

901
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,320
I'm picking out a kitten for you.

902
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,840
You look cold

903
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,760
and stressed every day.

904
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,800
Having a cat helps prevent depression.

905
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
Most important of all,

906
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,880
it could accompany you.

907
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,440
I don't need it.

908
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,840
No problem.

909
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,280
I can think of something else.

910
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,050
You know all about it?

911
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,610
What do I know?

912
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

913
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,200
Since you don't want a pet.

914
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,170
Well, let's…

915
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,560
Let's go to watch a movie.

916
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,160
OK?

917
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,320
Let's just break up.

918
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,480
I'm sorry.

919
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:17,930
Lu Yiyao.

920
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,610
Lu Yiyao, wait.

921
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,370
Yes, I know.

922
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,400
So what?

923
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,720
I don't care.

924
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,600
Just pretend that I don't know anything.

925
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,200
OK?

926
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,720
Why are you doing this?

927
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,690
Because I found out that

928
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,400
I like you more than I thought.

929
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,560
I don't care about anything else.

930
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:47,880
Can't I just continue to

931
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,010
be your girlfriend?

932
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,330
You know I don't like you,

933
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,210
and you still want to be my girlfriend?

934
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,000
Are you stupid?

935
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,330
Perhaps if you give it some time,

936
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,320
we could have another try

937
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,920
and you might like me.

938
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,840
Other than 'love at first sight',

939
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,770
and 'quarrelsome lovers',

940
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,920
there're also people who fall in love

941
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,240
after spending some time together.

942
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,970
That's impossible.

943
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:10,920
I'm not gonna like you.

944
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,360
I think we're done here.

945
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,440
I said I don't care.

946
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,850
I just don't care!
