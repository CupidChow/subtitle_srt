[Episode 10]

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,250
What a "perfect" timing.

5
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,330
She chose today to have dinner with us.

6
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,490
How am I supposed to face Ling Rui?

7
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,170
Today is just...

8
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,810
Just a dinner.

9
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,250
It's part of my job.

10
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,240
Qin Yujiang,

11
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,450
the ex-fiancee of Simon,

12
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,170
is a very important partner

13
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,210
for Deer Sing.

14
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,329
So today's dinner

15
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:31,690
is kind of important to me.

16
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,810
Okay.

17
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,130
Sorry to bother you

18
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,490
to come to have dinner with me.

19
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:39,840
It's alright.

20
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,770
-Um...
-Um...

21
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,040
You go first.

22
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,329
Shall we go inside?

23
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,450
That's what I was gonna say.

24
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,130
Let's go.

25
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:51,970
Okay.

26
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,490
Yujiang.

27
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,850
I've been waiting for you.

28
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,850
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

29
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,850
Thanks.

30
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,250
He is my husband, Ling Rui.

31
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,810
Hello, Yujiang.

32
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,690
You indeed make a good match.

33
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,810
Fangning, it's been a while
since the last time

34
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,610
we took a picture together.

35
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,410
Let's take a picture.

36
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,250
Sure.

37
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,610
Okay.

38
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,920
Come on in. This way.

39
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,840
-Alright.
-Let's go.

40
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,690
Ling Rui looks good.

41
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,290
Fangning surely has good taste.

42
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,210
Have a seat.

43
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,010
Nice decoration.

44
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:43,570
Here.

45
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,690
Yujiang.

46
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,890
What's taking Simon so long?

47
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,170
Do I have to invite him?

48
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,450
Just kidding.

49
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,450
He'll be here in a minute.

50
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,040
How's it going?

51
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,330
Quite good.

52
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,570
Look, he just called.

53

[Lu Yiyao]

54
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:06,970
Yujiang.

55
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,010
What do you want?

56
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,250
Why did you invite Fangning?

57
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,410
Simon,

58
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,010
we're all here.

59
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,360
We're waiting for you now. Hurry up.

60
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,370
Don't keep us waiting here.

61
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,570
Although I didn't give you a heads up,

62
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,810
you don't have to be so anxious.

63
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,810
Fangning and Ling Rui have arrived.

64
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,010
You're the last one. Hurry up.

65
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,010
He has become

66
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,570
more and more impatient now.

67
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,409
Yujiang, I'm sorry,

68
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,090
but I have to ask.

69
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,370
Are you and Simon okay?

70
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,290
Because I think that

71
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,010
it'll be more appropriate
for us two to discuss

72
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,490
the cooperation between
Deer Sing and Jiang Cheng.

73
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,890
I had a good talk with Yiyao.

74
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,490
Why would you think so?

75
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,490
Don't worry.

76
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,650
Our partnership will work.

77
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,120
You can sit here. I'll open the wine

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,850
and get it prepared.

79
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,770
Thanks.

80
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,090
What did she mean by that?

81
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,250
It's appropriate? It will work?

82
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,890
That sounds so strange.

83
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,210
It's not like they're back together.

84
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,890
Is she trying to

85
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,600
settle scores at an opportune moment?

86
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,160
How is this? Do you guys like it?

87
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,360
Your helper has great cooking skills.

88
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,240
Come here anytime if you like.

89
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,120
You are late.

90
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,250
Uncle.

91
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,930
You need to drink
as a punishment.

92
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,890
Come sit down.

93
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:50,850
I'll tell you what.

94
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,730
Fangning is fortunate

95
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,130
to have met someone like Ling Rui.

96
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,850
What took you so long?

97
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,530
Come on. Welcome you all,

98
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,330
especially Dr. Ling.

99
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,010
Uncle?

100
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,970
Fangning, you need to drive.

101
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:17,970
You can't drink.

102
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,360
-I'll drink for you.
-You can drive too.

103
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,010
I have night blindness.

104
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,080
You're night blind?

105
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:23,850
Yeah, exactly.

106
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:25,890
He's night blind.

107
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:27,810
Cheers.

108
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,130
Uncle.

109
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:33,930
Thank you for your hospitality.

110
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,890
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

111
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,090
The last time

112
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,130
the three of us got together

113
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,200
was when

114
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,290
I went on a blind date.

115
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,360
If Fangning hadn't

116
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,330
cut me some slack,

117
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,050
I'm afraid I couldn't have got a chance

118
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,090
to be Yiyao's girlfriend.

119
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,370
Dr. Ling,

120
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,770
how did you two meet?

121
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:54,570
Fate.

122
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,250
When it's the right time,

123
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,090
you'll naturally meet the right person.

124
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,410
We have friends in common.

125
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,010
So what do you love about Fangning?

126
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,930
He likes me because I'm pretty, gorgeous,

127
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,370
noble, independent,

128
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,130
smart,

129
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,450
and very rich.

130
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,130
Of course,

131
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,290
it'll take more than a mealtime

132
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,410
to talk about all my strength.

133
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:16,890
Right?

134
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,010
I like her because

135
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,730
sometimes she's heedless,

136
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,450
fearless,

137
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,130
unreasonable,

138
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,450
and occasionally

139
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,810
reckless.

140
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,570
She is like a shooting star

141
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,480
who came into my unexceptional life.

142
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,570
After hearing your description of me,

143
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,680
why do I feel like

144
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,409
I'm a giant octopus?

145
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,970
How lucky Fangning is.

146
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,010
Well, he's lucky, too.

147
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,650
Didn't you say you liked me

148
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,770
being reckless and unreasonable?

149
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,850
Why are you avoiding me?

150
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,690
I thought you said you're like an octopus.

151
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,530
I don't like an octopus.

152
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,650
Fangning.

153
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,170
It's healthy to eat more greens.

154
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,770
Thank you.

155
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,810
You're welcome.

156
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,409
I remember that Fangning

157
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,130
never liked to eat

158
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,530
all these vegetables.

159
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,090
Apparently, she changed her taste

160
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,770
after getting married.

161
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,169
Yiyao.

162
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,610
As her uncle,

163
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,010
I think you should reflect on yourself.

164
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,210
I don't really like the wine today.

165
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,090
Well...

166
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:55,970
Any other wine?

167
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,410
Let's open another bottle.

168
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,650
Why are you avoiding me?

169
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,210
I'm not.

170
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,730
Yes, you are.

171
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,650
Look, look.

172
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,770
You are avoiding me right now.

173
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,330
I've had enough.

174
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,050
I'm done with playing

175
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,130
reserved tonight.

176
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,610
Why are you avoiding me?

177
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,770
I got it.

178
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,850
It's because

179
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,810
we didn't make a deal that night.

180
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,690
That's why you're avoiding me.

181
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,570
You know it clearly that

182
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,520
I would love to make this work.

183
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,930
Let's change the topic, Fangning.

184
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,210
Ling Rui.

185
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,490
You're not cut out for coquetry,
Lu Fangning.

186
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,250
I'll go to the washroom.

187
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,050
The washroom?

188
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:45,690
Can you solve

189
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,650
our problem then?

190
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,000
Yujiang.

191
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,090
What are you doing?

192
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,730
Can't you see it?

193
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,570
Well, think again.

194
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,610
I don't want to think.

195
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,850
You tell me now.

196
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,530
You are always like this.

197
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,130
Whatever she asks you to do,

198
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,290
you'll try everything you could.

199
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,490
But you never paid
even the slightest attention

200
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,960
to what I asked you to do.

201
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,330
I thought it was strange.

202
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,370
Now I know.

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,730
You're in love with someone

204
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,730
you can't love.

205
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,520
So it doesn't matter

206
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,690
who you get married with.

207
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,090
I just happened to show up,

208
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,130
and happened to be the perfect fit

209
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:16,890
to become your perfect wife.

210
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,090
You didn't need to

211
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,880
pay any effort.

212
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,250
Yujiang.

213
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,330
Lu Yiyao.

214
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,330
Although you don't know me,

215
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,600
I know you very well.

216
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,490
Ever since we got engaged,

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,930
how many times
we should dine together every week,

218
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,290
how many times you should send me flowers,

219
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,000
when you should send me gifts
for our anniversary,

220
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,410
and drive me home.

221
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,770
On all these things,
you've never made a mistake.

222
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,930
But she's the only reason that

223
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,290
you would ignore

224
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,600
all the standards regardless,

225
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,850
and call off the engagement

226
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,330
with a single text message.

227
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,370
If it wasn't for Lu Fangning,

228
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,170
would it be anyone else?

229
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,050
So you invited them here today

230
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,690
to tell her all the truth

231
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,730
or to threaten me?

232
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,250
Lu Yiyao,

233
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,650
you underestimated me.

234
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,570
I just wanted to see

235
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,810
how rattled you are.

236
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,850
You didn't let me down.

237
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,970
Ling Rui is indeed a great man.

238
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,290
I think they are a perfect match.

239
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,970
Well, aren't you disappointed?

240
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,450
I'm not disappointed.

241
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,890
I just want her to be happy.

242
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,530
No.

243
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,680
What you want is

244
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,290
to bring her happiness yourself.

245
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,240
I'm the one who made the mistake.

246
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,490
I don't want her involved.

247
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:39,810
Okay.

248
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,130
Well, in that case,

249
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,640
I'm gonna give you a chance.

250
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,970
I've changed my mind, Lu Yiyao.

251
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,810
You can either make yourself

252
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,330
fall for me truly,

253
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,970
or I'm gonna tell her

254
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,370
why exactly did you call off

255
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,530
your engagement ten years ago,

256
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,370
and who's the person

257
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,490
you truly loved

258
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,810
deep down.

259
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,450
You're done?

260
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,290
When are we gonna try again?

261
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,770
Lu Fangning, I have to tell you...

262
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,770
Try it again.

263
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,130
Come, try the cake I baked.

264
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,810
You know how to bake.

265
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,490
Thank you.

266
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,650
But, I think

267
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,730
you like fruit cakes, right?

268
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,010
It's alright.

269
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,890
I've always wanted to try

270
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,010
some other cakes.

271
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,250
When I was a kid, I wanted something new,

272
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,890
so I said that I liked fruit cake.

273
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,770
From then on, there had been

274
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,970
only fruit cakes at home.

275
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,730
No other options.

276
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,810
Yummy.

277
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,090
Fangning.

278
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,050
Didn't you just tell me that

279
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,370
your stomach hurt

280
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,090
and you wanted to go home?

281
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,130
Me?

282
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,810
My stomach hurts.

283
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,330
You just told me.

284
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,050
Yeah, it hurts.

285
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,010
It just came out of nowhere.

286
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,650
I'm so sorry.

287
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,770
We should probably go first.

288
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,410
Simon.

289
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,770
Sorry, Yujiang.

290
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,410
Thank you for your hospitality today.

291
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,760
She's always like this.

292
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,130
We're gonna go home.

293
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,250
It's okay. I'll walk you out.

294
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,090
What a pity, all these foods.

295
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,930
-Are you alright?
-I'm okay.

296
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:25,770
Come on.

297
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,810
You okay?

298
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,650
Watch the steps.

299
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,160
Drive carefully.

300
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,370
Thank you for the dinner.

301
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,330
Ms. Qin.

302
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,690
We shall excuse ourselves first.

303
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,050
Bye.

304
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,090
Bye.

305
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,570
Ling Rui.

306
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,450
Ling Rui.

307
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,930
Thank you for today.

308
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,530
It's alright.

309
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,130
Fangning.

310
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,530
Uncle.

311
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,570
Well, I've got to go.

312
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,890
You two get some rest early.

313
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,720
Uncle.

314
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,330
Are you alright?

315
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,970
-I'm fine.
-Fangning.

316
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,650
Flies.

317
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,850
Are there flies in this season?

318
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,330
There's so much greenery here.

319
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,730
Of course, there are flies.

320
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,290
Simon.

321
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,410
In short,

322
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,290
I hope you don't take that too personally.

323
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,610
I'm leaving.

324
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,970
You didn't drive here, right?
Let me drive you home.

325
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,210
Alright.

326
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,330
-Let's go.
-Fangning.

327
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,850
I have something to tell you.

328
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,530
What is it?

329
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,370
I'll take a cab.

330
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:20,810
Uh...

331
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,370
Bye.

332
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,490
Be careful, uncle.

333
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,240
What's up?

334
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,330
Let me answer it first.

335
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,850
Hi.

336
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,850
Friday?

337
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,370
Reunion?

338
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,330
Will Mr. Yu be there?

339
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,450
If he'll be there,

340
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,810
then I'll go, too.

341
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:56,930
Bye.

342
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,170
So,

343
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,490
what did you want to tell me just now?

344
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,610
You look good today.

345
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,170
Thank you.

346
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,930
Nothing else?

347
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:16,890
Nope.

348
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,330
Well, I'm leaving then.

429
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,490
I've checked on the manufacturers

430
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,810
that we could find

in this city and nearby.

434
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,650
is special,

all the materials should
be consistent with

environmental standards,

437
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,810

Every product,
from material to finished product,

440

over a hundred procedures.

442

So a large portion of the manufacturers

Mr. Yu for a long time.

526
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,010

Okay, I won't say it.

533
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,610
I thought we are done with the discussion.

534

he's gonna fly here.

He is slow, okay?

624
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,000
I'll give him a call.

625

644
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,170
He misses him so much.

00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:14,970
How about this?

646
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,050
Let him pick up Mr. Yu.

647
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:16,930
And I'll chat with you.

648
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,770
I can talk too, right?

649
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,890
-No, no.
-I don't want that.

650
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:19,530
We haven't seen Ling Rui

651

for a long time too.

652
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,450
-We all miss him so much. Right?
-Exactly.

653
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,410
I'll take him away.

654
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,130
Curly, you...

655
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,690
So annoying.

656

Let's get out of here.

657

eat you up.

665
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,690
We just want Ling Rui.

666
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,090
You're not as handsome as he is.
Don't speak.

667
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,930
-Oh my.
-That can't be changed.

668
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,650
We're both so good-looking.

669
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,210
Why...

670
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,530
Mr. Yu, this way.

671
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,610
Mind your steps.

672
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,290
Ling Rui,

673
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,650
are you usually that busy?

674
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,490
I haven't seen you

675
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,690
for so many years.

676
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,410
You didn't say this

677
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,690
when you saw Ling Rui just now.

678
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,330
I mean, he just put on an act.

679
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,050
Which one of you here

680
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,090
doesn't know that?

681
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,810
We all know

682
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,570
how he used to be like?

683
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,170
What's wrong with that?

684
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,330
He is handsome all the time,

685
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,130
okay?

686
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,210
You women are so shallow.

687
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,560
What else could you care about
other than his pretty face?

688
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,770
His face is enough.

689
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,610
Listen to me,

690
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,130
Mr. Yu called on the entire class

691
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,610
to help poor students.

692
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,010
I donated him

693
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,770
a down jacket.

694
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,210
I wonder

695
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,050
if he still wears it.

696
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,290
Come on.

697
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,210
He is a surgeon

698
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,330
at a major hospital.

699
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,450
Why wear your cheap down jacket?

700
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,090
The other day,

701
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,650
I heard from another doctor
at Ling Rui's hospital.

702
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,250
They met his wife

703
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,720
who looks very rich.

704
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,250
Her bag,

705
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,690
and her clothes...

706
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,050
How much salary can

707
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,090
Ling Rui earn every month?

708
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,530
They don't even care about
that little amount of money.

709
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,050
You know?

710
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,050
See? What I was saying?

711
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,210
What did I tell you?

712
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,050
When I came in, he was like

713
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:44,970
"Hello."

714
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,040
I mean, who was he trying to fool?

715
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,810
I'll tell you what.

716
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,450
With a rich wife,

717
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,490
life is easy.

718
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,250
He was just lucky.

719
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,690
What's the big deal?

720
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,490
Who is this?

721
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,330
Who are you looking for?

722
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,410
Do you know her?

723
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,410
Excuse me.

724
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,090
For me, Lu Fangning,

725
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,090
Ling Rui is quite amazing.

726
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,130
Who are you?

727
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,170
I'm Ling Rui's wife,

728
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,010
Lu Fangning.

729
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,730
If you don't know,

730
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,730
you can search for my name online.

731
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,410
Thanks.

732
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,490
He brought his wife

733
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,370
Fangning.

734
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,210
to the reunion?

735
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,370
This wine

736
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,010
is so terrible.

737
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,090
After all, this is a reunion.

738
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,330
How could you drink such terrible wine

739
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,450
with your teacher?

740
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,570
I'll have my assistant

741
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,570
get two bottles of fine wine

742
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,290
from my personal cellar

743
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,610
to celebrate with you all.

744
00:28:59,090 --> 00:28:59,850
I was just wondering

745
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,530
why you had to invite Ling Rui.

746
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,050
It turns out you want him to pay the bill.

747
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,610
What do you mean?

748
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,930
How could she say something like that?

749
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,690
Forget it, Fangning.

750
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,610
You're Lu Fangning.

751
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,490
She's Lu Fangning,

752
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,250
who is very rich.

753
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,090
This lady,

754
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,850
please mind your behavior

755
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,800
and don't ruin

756
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,250
our reunion party.

757
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,320
What?

758
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:20,890
Who is exactly rude?

759
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:21,930
Can't you see that?

760
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,410
You're all here for the reunion.

761
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,090
Some people are just

762
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,970
speaking ill of others.

763
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,170
Are that good manners?

764
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,090
Are they?

765
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:28,610
By the way,

766
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,050
you're the classmate

767
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:31,770
who gave clothes to Ling Rui,

768
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,330
right?

769
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,210
It occurred to me that

770
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,210
I meant to throw away the jacket

771
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,570
for so many times,

772
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,120
but Ling Rui didn't allow me to do so.

773
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,250
I can see that it really means a lot

774
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,690
to Ling Rui.

775
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,930
But I've changed my mind.

776
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,970
When we get back today,

777
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:47,810
I'm gonna use that jacket

778
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,090
to make a nest for our Doudou.

779
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:49,850
By the way,

780
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,130
Doudou is our dog.

781
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,250
What do you mean?

782
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,690
What do you mean, Ling Rui?

783
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,960
You got a rich wife, that's fine.

784
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,370
But now you have your wife

785
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,650
humiliating your old friends?

786
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,090
I'm not humiliating you all.

787
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,090
I'm only humiliating

788
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,250
the two of you.

789
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,570
But you know what,

790
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,170
it should be an honor to you

791
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,250
to have a chance

792
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,690
to be humiliated by me.

793
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,130
Just so you know,

794
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,090
it's not easy
to get Ling Rui to depend on me.

795
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,610
I was gonna give him

796
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:16,850
tens of millions

797
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,720
He refused it and called me shallow.

798
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,560
It took me so much effort

799
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,770
to get him to depend on me.

800
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,330
Even if he's gonna make this place

801
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,210
a mess,

802
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,770
I'm gonna let him do it.
What can you say about that?

803
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,930
A mess, huh?

804
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,130
Just do it!

805
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,370
What are you doing?

806
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,650
What?

807
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,480
It's alright, teacher.

808
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,570
Ling Rui's got this.

809
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,250
But I don't wanna make it

810
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,240
a mess.

811
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:04,920
Let's go.

812
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,690
Are you alright?

813
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:08,920
I'm angry.

814
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,730
Mr. Yu, I'm sorry.

815
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,770
Ling Rui.

816
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,210
Don't beat her!

817
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,170
Mr. Yu, don't worry. He won't do that.

818
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,560
What are you all doing?

819
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,370
Huh?

820
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,210
Ling Rui.

821
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,930
Why did you drag me out?

822
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,850
I'm not done talking.

823
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,570
They just taunted you like that.

824
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,410
How could we let them

825
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,970
finish this meal in peace?

826
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,650
Those kinds of snobs

827
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,410
need to be defeated by our strength.

828
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,810
Why are you so angry?

829
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,450
Because...

830
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,170
Because those people

831
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,650
are a bunch of losers,

832
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,570
they're nasty,

833
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,250
and nobody would tolerate them.

834
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,440
Okay, even though I know

835
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,930
I'm still menacing

836
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,650
even when

837
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,530
I'm not wearing my heels.

838
00:31:59,530 --> 00:31:59,930
But, my biggest regret today

839
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:00,570
is that

840
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,410
I didn't wear

841
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,810
my 11-centimeter heels here.

842
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,530
Or else when I saw that stinky man

843
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,450
just now,

844
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,290
I could do this.

845
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,570
And I could look at him this way.

846
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,290
What are you laughing at?

847
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,560
What's so funny?

848
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,370
At times like this,

849
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,240
should I just kiss him?

850
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,970
Someone else is around.

851
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,570
Well, that's fine.

852
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,290
Should I kiss him?

853
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,080
Do it.

854
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,610
I'm not mad.

855
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:35,810
So,

856
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,370
don't be mad.

857
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:40,770
I...

858
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,810
You're not mad?

859
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,330
Then why did you just

860
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,690
do that

861
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:49,960
and that?

862
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,160
Because they were right.

863
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,090
When I was in school,

864
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,650
my family was really poor,

865
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,610
and we took a lot of help from others.

866
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,730
Well, they couldn't say that
about you anyway.

867
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,770
These things

868
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,600
are part of my life.

869
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,650
I'm not trying to hide it.

870
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,370
As for

871
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,530
what they said about you,

872
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,210
that's true too.

873
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,890
You're really awesome.

874
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,490
I don't have your mild temper.

875
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,130
He has such a mild temper,

876
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,850
so he should be done

877
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,530
being mad at me about last time, right?

878
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,770
It was different last time.

879
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,490
Why does he know what I'm thinking?

880
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,170
That's annoying.

881
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,770
Fangning.

882
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,530
What's up?

883
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,810
Can I just

884
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,050
ask you a favor?

885
00:33:51,510 --> 00:34:01,510
[Bath]

886
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,340
[Sanitary napkin]

887
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,170
Is he a freak?

888
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,250
Cut it out.

889
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:22,800
He looks funny.

890
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:05,610
Let's go.

891
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,330
Go?

892
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,210
You are back to your place,

893
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,210
and I go back to mine again?

894
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:11,610
What's up?

895
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,250
I'm feeling a little uncomfortable.

896
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,730
Every time I have my period,

897
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,290
I don't feel so good.

898
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,610
I need someone to take care of me.

899
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,090
Well, I'll send you back
to your family's place.

900
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,770
What's the point of going back there?

901
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,450
You're not there either.

902
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,810
Besides, who would take care of me

903
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,850
there?

904
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,890
I want to go back to the apartment.

905
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,490
Alright, I'll send you back.

906
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,290
Take a seat.

907
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,690
You know, because of the wedding,

908
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,450
I've been a little busy,

909
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,050
so I haven't cleaned up this place.

910
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,370
It's not always like this.

911
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,770
You know me.

912
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,120
I'll go get you some warm water.

913
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,210
Just a minute.

914
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,200
It hurts.

915
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,730
It hurts.

916
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:29,970
Fangning.

917
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,770
Where's your hot-water bottle?

918
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,970
Why would I have

919
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:34,850
a hot-water bottle?

920
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,610
What do you do when your hurts?

921
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,720
I never...

922
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:42,770
I just endure it.

923
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,050
I just want to go to my room

924
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,770
and clean up a little bit.

925
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,530
Oh, it hurts.

926
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,170
Are you okay?

927
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,370
I'm fine.

928
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,330
One really can't lie.

929
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,610
Why it hurts all of a sudden?

930
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,010
This really hurts like hell.

931
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:04,770
Come in.

932
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,250
Fangning.

933
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,930
I got you some warm water.

934
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,730
You'll sleep better after you drink this.

935
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:15,730
Thank you.

936
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,480
Careful, it's hot.

937
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,050
Aren't I supposed to

938
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,970
drink brown sugar water?

939
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,010
Drinking brown sugar water or warm water

940
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,090
doesn't make any difference in

941
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,560
helping with your symptoms.

942
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,810
Place this over your belly.

943
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,050
Thank you.

944
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,970
It hurts so much.

945
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,250
Do you want more warm water?

946
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,370
I don't want to drink anymore.

947
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,690
I want you.

948
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,570
Then, go to sleep.

949
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,810
Sleep?

950
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,050
Well, I mean

951
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,210
you'll sleep on your own.

952
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,170
Alright.

953
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,650
Yeah, of course.

954
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,090
I mean, I'm like this, right?

955
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,210
I have to sleep alone.

956
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,570
Where are you going?

957
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,320
I'm suffering.

958
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,530
Can't you just

959
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,130
stay with me?

960
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,130
Stay, please.

961
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:43,650
It hurts.

962
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,440
Much better.

963
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,010
Put your feet up.

964
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,890
Don't get cold.

965
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,130
You know what,

966
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,890
I do feel better this way.
