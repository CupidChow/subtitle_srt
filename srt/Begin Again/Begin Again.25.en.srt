176
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,539
you gave me

177
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,830
such great courage.

178
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,309
What did you say?

179
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,390
You gave me

180
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,830
such great courage.

181
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,110
Little grandpa, hold me up.

182
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,550
Come.

183
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,950
I'm here.

184
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,830
You're spoiling him.

185
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,910
Little grandpa,

186
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,630
I'm troubling you again

187
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,310
to bring that over, too.

188
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,350
Come here.

189
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,670
What is it?

190
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,750
You told me when I was young

191
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,550
that I was found in the trash can.

192
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,910
I was worth nothing.

193
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,350
This was such an outdated

194
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,390
excuse.

195
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,190
Now that I've grown up,

196
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,310
this can no longer satisfy me.

197
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,110
Please give my dad's face

198
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,110
back to me right away.

199
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,550
You want a face, right?

200
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,440
Okay, then whose face you want?

201
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,710
Spider-man or batman?

202
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,060
I'll change it for you tomorrow.

203
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,070
How can you say that?

204
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,830
He'll be sad later.

205
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,950
Don't be fooled by him.

206
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,580
This kid is smarter than me.

207
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,630
Lu Youyou, we'll go back tomorrow.

208
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,620
Go back immediately.

209
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,950
You're still acting?

210
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,030
Don't pretend anymore.

211
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,790
No pouting. Stop acting so.

212
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,030
Mom.

213
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,990
Mom.

214
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,430
Mom.

215
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,790
Look,

216
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,830
you're making the kid sad.

217
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,160
He's sad?

218
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,870
Little grandpa,

219
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,590
I'm not sad. I'm making trouble instead.

220
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,070
Mom is most afraid of Youyou

221
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,870
crying and yelling.

222
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,300
-Mom.
-Listen.

223
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,710
-Is this what a kid should say?
-Mom.

224
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,190
Mom.

225
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,980
Mom.

226
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,910
Lu Youyou, don't make trouble again.

227
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,350
Don't you want to stay here anymore?

228
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,350
Come.

229
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,990
Welcome back home.

230
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,790
I can only stay for a while.

231
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,870
Youyou is asleep.

232
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,590
He's sleeping like a pig.

233
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,800
Fine.

234
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,910
He feels at ease seeing you.

235
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,790
I'm afraid that it'd be inconvenient

236
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,750
for you to stay in a hotel bringing Youyou along.

237
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,350
So I simply did the cleaning

238
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,470
for you.

239
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,790
I can see it.

240
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,590
Thank you, little uncle.

241
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,790
But I really can only stay for a while.

242
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,950
What exactly happened?

243
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,590
Why did Youyou come back suddenly?

244
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,910
Don't mention it.

245
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,510
Shen Zhuo.

246
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,590
He's always wanted

247
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,390
to come back to China for his career.

248
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,150
So he's holding a White Queen exhibition

249
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,310
with Shenzhen-Hong Kong University,

250
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,240
but then he broke his hand.

251
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,390
So he couldn't work alone

252
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,390
and wanted to deceive me to come back.

253
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,270
But I definitely wouldn't want to come back.

254
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,720
In the end, he went to deceive Youyou.

255
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,630
He told Youyou that

256
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,510
he could find his dad when he's back in China.

257
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,390
Youyou would definitely want to come back after hearing that.

258
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,510
As a result,

259
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,870
I'm back here, too.

260
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,550
So

261
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,950
what is your plan?

262
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,000
Staying here?

263
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,230
I'm definitely leaving.

264
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,510
But now that I've returned home,

265
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,590
I'll only decide

266
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,900
after getting the work done here.

267
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,230
Do you want to tell Ling...

268
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,310
He...

269
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,150
He should also have the right to know.

270
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,320
I...

271
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,510
Look, you left without saying anything

272
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,660
six years ago.

273
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,670
My brother also didn't tell me

274
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,790
where you went.

275
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,310
When I contacted you again,

276
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,230
a little grandson

277
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,430
appeared out of nowhere.

278
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,430
I really

279
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,670
couldn't accept it at that time.

280
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,630
Not to mention

281
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,940
the one who is staring at me.

282
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,670
Simon.

283
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,360
It's really

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,950
very difficult for me.

285
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,750
You always say this

286
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,670
whenever I ask you about this.

287
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,860
-The first year.
-The first year.

288
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,150
The first year.

289
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,030
Hello.

290
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,110
I've received it. I'm looking at it now.

291
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,940
Be obedient.

292
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,270
Mom is making money for your milk powder.

293
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,230
At that time, we just divorced.

294
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,590
How could I disturb him?

295
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,720
Ling Rui just started his studies

296
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,630
in Germany.

297
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,870
He must be very busy.

298
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,430
How could I distract him?

299
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,110
The milk is here.

300
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,390
After that...

301
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,350
I was a mess,

302
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,950
and that was a huge difference from before.

303
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,390
I couldn't go to see Ling Rui.

304
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,830
He'd definitely find me embarrassing.

305
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,710
What if he also disliked Youyou?

306
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,510
Youyou,

307
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,080
come and have your meal.

308
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,440
It's so delicious.

309
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,990
Let's eat something delicious.

310
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,710
Youyou was at the age

311
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,350
when people hate the most.

312
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,150
Ling Rui would blame me,

313
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,230
saying that I didn't take good care of the kid.

314
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,350
My new career had just started,

315
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,480
and I had to take care of Youyou.

316
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,350
I was too busy.

317
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,000
How could I have the energy to care about others?

318
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,350
What are you doing?

319
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,270
These few years have passed.

320
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,910
I must be courting death

321
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,190
to tell him about this at the moment.

322
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,870
I'll tell him

323
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,070
when Lu Youyou has grown up.

324
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,470
What about now?

325
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,310
What excuse are you making?

326
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,740
Uncle.

327
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,520
You don't know

328
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,630
that I'm a coward.

329
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,110
I once thought

330
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,630
that it was a little lie,

331
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,470
but it has now become

332
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,990
a big lie.

333
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,950
How do I tell him?

334
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,790
How do I speak?

335
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,390
How should I tell him?

336
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,830
Moreover, have you ever thought

337
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,870
about what I should do

338
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,910
if he's living a good

339
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,710
and happy life now?

340
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,030
He's forgotten me.

341
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,070
How is he going to face this

342
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,790
if I bring a son to go and see him?

343
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,790
Moreover,

344
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,190
have you ever thought

345
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,990
about what would happen to me

346
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,030
if he got to know this?

347
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,590
Then how long

348
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,510
are you going to keep it to yourself?

349
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,670
Simon.

350
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,070
It's like this.

351
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,310
It's been six years.

352
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,870
I don't care

353
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,910
to wait a little longer.

354
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,710
I'll definitely think of a solution

355
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,390
as soon as possible.

356
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,430
But currently,

357
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,670
the first task

358
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,350
is to settle my work

359
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,270
in China

360
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,550
as soon as possible.

361
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,560
I'm meeting

362
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,510
a curatorial company later on.

363
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,710
I'll go and talk to them.

364
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,990
But before I make a move,

365
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,030
I still have to tell you

366
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,990
that please make sure

367
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,870
that you don't tell anyone.

368
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,110
Don't tell him.

369
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,230
You must keep it as a secret for me,

370
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,830
particularly before

371
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,470
I tell him.

372
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,470
Also, don't tell others

373
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,950
that I've returned to China.

374
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,950
But no one will know, too.

375
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,150
Fangning?

376
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,790
Uncle Tang.

377
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,590
You kid.

378
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,390
Why didn't you tell me

379
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,790
that you're back?

380
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,670
Do you know how worried I was?

381
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,550
A few years ago,

382
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,630
you sold the shares and left.

383
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,870
A few days later,

384
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,790
your father left LM Deer Sing Group, too.

385
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,150
It made me feel

386
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,830
uncomfortable for a long time.

387
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,950
I thought

388
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,870
that your family's business would be gone.

389
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,350
Perhaps I wouldn't want to live anymore.

390
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,230
I didn't expect to see you again.

391

[White Queen]

392
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,310
This White...

393
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,150
White Queen.

394
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,150
It's unimportant.

395
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,350
White Queen.

396
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,360
You conducted research

398
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,470
and developed this brand on your own?

399
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,550
I'm managing this,

400
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,470
and others are in charge of the design.

[Active Giant Star]

402
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,150
Good.

403
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,150
Good.

404
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,710
Although I haven't heard of it,

405
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,670
I believe

406
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,270
that you'll succeed.

407
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,110
In fact, it's considered a success

408
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,350
overseas.

409
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,470
It's quite famous abroad.

Uncle Tang,

412
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,230
I'm back this time

413
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,510
just to settle some work.

414
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,430
Okay.

415
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,030
I'll leave when I'm done.

416
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,790
So fast?

417
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,870
So

418
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,190
don't tell Tang Ping.

419
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:44,960
Why?

420
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,230
Why don't we tell Pingping?

421
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,070
What is it that you don't want to tell me?

422
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,510
Pingping. This...

423
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,630
Lu Fangning?

424
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,470
You're back?

425
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,030
Hello, Lu Fangning is back.

426
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,590
Who are you calling?

427
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,710
Cai Siyu.

428
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,750
She's introducing me to a role.

429
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,190
The most beautiful woman in the drama.

430
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,550
You've finally come back.

431
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,430
I missed you so much.

432
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,109
Long time no see.

433
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,310
I don't usually

434
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,430
come to

435
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,470
this kind of public area.

436
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,950
It's not that good to cause a commotion after all.

437
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,910
I'd thought of offering help

438
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,550
before someone left,

439
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,030
and I'm more capable of helping now.

440
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,270
But

441
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,510
don't ask how I can help.

442
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,230
I'm afraid that someone won't be able to stand it.

443
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,030
Wasn't someone

444
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,510
into romance fiction before?

445
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,590
Those she used to see

446
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,070
are all rubbish.

447
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,910
The one who is top-notch in this industry

448
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,630
is sitting here right now.

449
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,270
But someone doesn't have to be afraid.

450
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,190
Even if she has no money,

451
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,670
we won't give her the cold shoulder.

452
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,710
-Right, Ms. Cai?
-Of course.

453
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,710
Even though she's

454
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,950
not my boss anymore,

455
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,820
we're still friends.

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,550

457
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,950
Yes, friends.

458
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,670
Correct.

459
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,990
Won't dislike me?

460
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,640
We're still friends?

461
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,350
Pingping,

462
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,270
I won't dislike you either.

463
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,030
After all, I only saw

464
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,310
your gossip news

465
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,190
when they popped up

466
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,230
occasionally.

467
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,310
I heard that you went to shoot a drama.

468
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,510
I also took a look.

469
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,980
You played the assistant

470
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,070
of a female supporting character.

471
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,430
I didn't see your name

472
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,430
at the subtitles appeared at the end

473
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,860
even when the song is over.

474
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,710
If you really want to act,

475
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,710
I still have

476
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,950
some resources

477
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,750
although I was not in China.

478
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,550
I can help you introduce

479
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,590
to shoot a few dramas.

480
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,630
Why are you laughing?

481
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,790
Top-notch in the industry?

482
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,070
What era is it now?

483
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,030
You're still writing this kind of tacky plot.

484
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,830
Do you have any common sense?

485
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,710
What else can happen

486
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,550
when they're drunk?

487
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,270
Nothing.

488
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,270
Ms. Lu, I was wrong.

489
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,630
Fangning, help me.

490
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,830
Help me.

491
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,260
Ms. Lu,

492
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,750
don't tell me that you actually

493
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,830
read the novel which made my name?

494
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,150
When I was bored overseas, I'd have a look.

495
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,430
Then you really watched my drama?

496
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,230
Abroad?

497
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,150
It's okay.

498
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,000
You usually

499
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,350
watch international news to make money.

500
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,910
Now you've watched romance dramas for me.

501
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,030
That means

502
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,070
I'm as important as

503
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,870
your career of making money?

504
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,910
-Love you, Ms. Lu.
-Love you.

505
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,240
Love you.

506
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,470
It's pretty good

507
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,950
to see

508
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,830
that you two are having quite a good time.

509
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,790
Ms. Lu.

510
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,030
How about you?

511
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,510
Why did you

512
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,830
leave without saying anything?

513
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,630
Why didn't you get in touch with us

514
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,220
in six years?

515
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,150
Yes, indeed.

516
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,990
Didn't you merely lose a company?

517
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,710
Anyone will have experienced it.

518
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,030
You didn't have to hide from us,

519
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,110
and for so long.

520
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,230
It's long enough

What?

523
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,230
What did you say?

524
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,190
Ms. Lu.

525
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,270
You left without saying anything at that time.

526
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,430
Later on, we learned

527
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,430
that you even divorced.

528
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,220
Why did you divorce Dr. Ling?

529
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,670
Was it really like what he said

530
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,630
that you two had a personality clash?

531
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,800
We...

532
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,830
It must be Dr. Ling's fault.

Forget it.

Why do you still mention him?

541
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,470
Dr. Ling has even...

542
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,400
What happened?

543
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,540

Okay.

In fact, this time around, I didn't tell anyone

that I've come back.

can keep it a secret for me.

Don't tell anyone.

Don't tell...

554
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,910
Don't tell Dr. Ling particularly.

555

I know.

556
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,550
We won't tell him for sure.

557
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,270
Don't worry.

558
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,220
Okay, I'm leaving.

559
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,430
Won't you stay a little longer?

560
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,190
I... I still have something to do.

Sure.

I didn't expect that seeing Lu Fangning

568
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,390
would make me so happy.

569

Are you calling to say

579
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,750
that I smiled so beautifully?

580
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,310
My dear,

581
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,350
why did you smile at this time?

582
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,430
No, is it that my schedule has been fixed

583
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,350
when I should smile

584

and cry?

585
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,590
When I said that you're not allowed to smile,

586
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,510
you must obey.

587
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,310
You're not allowed to smile.

593

692
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,310
So

693
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,290
you just wanted to...

694
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,420
Poach you.

695
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,510
In fact, my senior forced me.

696
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,990
Don't tell my teacher.

697
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,410
I'm sorry. I still...

698
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,920
I have no plan for this for now.

699
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,760
Thank you.

700
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,330
How may I address you?

701
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,130
Xiaoye.

702
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,010
Xiaoye.

703
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,330
Xiaoye, I...

704
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,570
I want to go around the school by myself.

705
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,200
Okay.

706
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,330
Miss Lu, I'll keep you company.

707
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,050
It's okay. I'm fine.

708
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,250
I'll trouble you again when something happens.

709
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,090
Okay.

710
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,320
Thank you, Xiaoye, for your hard work.

711
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,410
The kids nowadays

712
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,050
are not ambitious at all.

713
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,570
Maybe I'm

714
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,320
too posh

715
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,160
for them.

716
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,850
We woke up late.

717
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,330
Hurry up.

718
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,170
He's really handsome.

719
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,490
Professor Ling is really handsome.

720
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,490
Now only you know.

721
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,440
Do you know that he's one-of-a-kind

722
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,520
in my heart?

723
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,610
He's incomparable.

724
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,890
I know. Stop talking now.

725
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,070
Hurry up.

726
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,380
So their ambition is here.

727
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,680
We’re running out of time.

728
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,210
Professor Ling.

729
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,440
Professor Ling.

730
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,960
He should be quite handsome.

731
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,010
Among the deaths caused by cancers,

732
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,530
the mortality rate of pancreatic cancer

733
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,670
was ranked third.

734
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,720
The condition is the worst after recovering.

735
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,790
[Lecture on General Foreign Medicine]

736
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,190
Only about five percent

737
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,290
of pancreatic cancer patients

738
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,890
can live more than five years.

739
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,810
This number is quite small.

740
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,810
Up to about 90 percent

741
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,720
of breast cancer patients

742
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,790
have a five-year survival rate.

743
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,010
In the past four decades,

744
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,770
cancer treatment in various fields

745
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,680
has developed by leaps and bounds.

746
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,600
But the data on pancreatic cancer

747
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,450
has not changed much.

748
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,850
To date,

749
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,090
surgery

750
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,450
is still the only way of treatment.

751
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,200
Laparoscopic

752
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,170
pancreaticoduodenectomy, LPD.

753
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,240
This surgery

754
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,090
is one which is gradually getting mature

755
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,210
and life-saving

756
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,470
for the malignant pancreatic cancer

757
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,800
patients.

758
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,410
But it's also the surgery

759
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,050
with the highest difficulty level.

760
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,170
It requires doctors to have long-term studies,

761
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,530
with the accumulation of experience.

762
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,610
This student,

763
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,850
do you have any questions?

764
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,210
Professor Ling,

765
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,050
I checked the information before.

766
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,360
For LPD surgery,

767
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,770
the mortality rate of the patient

768
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,610
in the next 90 days

769
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,050
is up to ten percent.

770
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,610
But for an ordinary open surgery,

771
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,250
the mortality rate is only two percent.

772
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,130
Since there's such a high mortality rate,

773
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,490
is it necessary for us

774
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,010
to develop this kind of technique?

775
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,690
This student is very serious.

776
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,490
But if you

777
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,230
had checked the information carefully,

778
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,690
you'd discover

779
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,530
that in different centers in the past,

780
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,050
for the postoperative research review

781
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:47,650
of the 1,029 cases

782
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,210
of laparoscopic

783
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,250
pancreaticoduodenectomy,

784
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,730
this data

785
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,810
was modified to

786
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,450
5.93 percent.

787
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,130
After more careful research,

788
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,890
it was discovered that the difference in mortality rate is very big

789
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,720
for different institutions

790
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,090
and different doctors.

791
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,640
In other words,

792
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,550
an experienced doctor

793
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,130
is able to ensure the safety of conducting the surgery.

794
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,330
Professor Ling,

795
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,130
how many times have you performed

796
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,210
such a surgery?

797
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,160
89 cases.

798
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,040
Then the mortality in your hands...?

799
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,090
Two cases.

800
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,560
It was because of postoperative complications.

801
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,770
I know that most of you here

802
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,170
are classmates.

803
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:35,770
You'll possibly become a doctor

804
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,810
in the future.

805
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,520
Throughout your

806
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,160
career,

807
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,410
you may be

808
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,680
asked the same question repeatedly.

809
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,360
A question that

810
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,810
the family members of the patients would ask.

811
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:45,930
That is

812
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,570
why we can save

813
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,080
another patient with the same condition,

814
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,850
but not their loved ones.

815
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,170
If I ask you,

816
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,130
how will you answer?

817
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,290
You'll slowly realize

818
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,920
that medicine has its limits.

819
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,130
No matter how modern medicine develops,

820
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,850
doctors can't do anything about

821
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,210
birth, old age, sickness, and death.

822
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,850
It's like a gardener who can't do anything to

823
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,730
spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

824
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,850
What a gardener can do

825
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,730
is to just make this flower

826
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,050
bloom more gorgeously

827
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,610
and longer.

828
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,130
But the flower will eventually wither.

829
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,280
This is the law of nature.

830
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,010
If we give up the whole garden

831
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,810
just because of the withering of a flower,

832
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,970
then the boundary of medicine

833
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,690
will appear here.

834
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,570
Appear at the moment.

835
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,320
Appear in front of you and me.

836
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,600
We can only regard all of this

837
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,810
as a process.

838
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,570
Regard the process of seeking an answer

839
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,050
as the answer to this question.

840
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,200
When we continue exploring

841
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:56,850
and inquiring,

842
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,330
the boundary will continue

843
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,650
move forward

844
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,810
throughout our research

845
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,010
and process of verifying.

846
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,010
Then the things with limitations

847
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,690
will also be filled with hope.

848
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,850
Medicine with a boundary

849
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,370
will also have a considerable future.

850
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,060
He's really handsome.

851
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,530
Yes, indeed.

852
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
He's really handsome. Is he here?

853
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,730
I saw him once last time.

854
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,940
-He's really handsome.
-Yes!

855
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,490
Does he have a girlfriend?

856
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,040
I don't know.

857
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,210
Maybe no.

858
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,000
I remember that there seemed to be one last time.

859
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,130
Really? His ex-girlfriend?

860
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,450
Do you know who his ex-girlfriend is?

861
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:35,730
I don't know.

862
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,330
She seems to be from this school.

863
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,400
What a pity.

864
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,570
Miss Lu.

865
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,690
Ling Rui.

866
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:09,889
Professor.

867
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,330
Professor Ling, do you have a girlfriend?

868
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,600
What?

869
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,580
[Lecture on General Foreign Medicine] [Speaker: Ling Rui]

870
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,090
Why didn't they even attach a photo?

871
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,570
This student.

872
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,200
You can't tear the poster.

873
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,850
Leave it to me, bro.

874
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:06,720
Look. We're...

875
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,370
Are you okay?

876
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,690
I'm sorry.

877
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,320
Thank you for your hard work today.

878
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,610
Student, which faculty are you in?

879
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,980
What do you mean?

880
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,700
It was very wonderful.

881
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,280
Thank you.

882
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,120
It was also very interesting.

883
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:37,230
♫ This is my first time wanting to see you, but I endured until dawn ♫

884
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:43,740
♫ This is my second time wanting to see you, but I controlled my emotion ♫

885
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,680
♫ How many times have I wanted to see you ♫

886
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,410
I'll do it.

887
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,890
Look.

888
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,370
It's nothing.

889
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:55,970
Are you okay?

890
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:58,690
Student.

891
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,130
I'm sorry.

892
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:03,970
You... Your food...

893
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:04,930
-You can't eat it anymore.
-It's okay.

894
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,250
I...

895
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,530
I'm so sorry.

896
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,450
You...

897
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,570
You go and buy another one.

898
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,280
And a bubble milk tea.

899
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,210
Buy a bubble milk tea.

900
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,570
And also buy a cake.

901
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,450
I'm not a student. I'm a sister.

902
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,330
A large hot Americano.

903
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,650
Okay, just a second.

904
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:47,960
You can redeem

905
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,800
an extra-large coffee

906
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,530
if you choose another item

907
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,570
above ten yuan.

908
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,720
Do you need one?

909
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,010
You can also buy one

910
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:55,690
medium fries

911
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:56,810
so that you can redeem

912
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,170
an extra-large coffee.

913
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,410
Of course, you can also buy one

914
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,130
large fries

915
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:00,810
because with this,

916
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:01,400
you can

917
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,320
collect two stamps at once.

918
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,690
With another two stamps,

919
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,490
you can be entitled to

920
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,530
an upgrade for free again next time.

921
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,250
It won't matter if you have coffee or fries.

922
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,280
Medium or large fries?

923
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,480
Do you need it, Miss?

924
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,730
Why is it so troublesome?

925
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,010
Forget it. I don't want it at all.

926
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,690
What about your large coffee?

927
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,570
I don't want it either.

928
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,290
Hello.

929
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,250
Two large hot Americano.

930
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,930
I don't need the rest. Thank you.

931
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,280
Okay, just a second.

932
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,610
A medium fries

933
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,850
with 100g cost 11 yuan.

934
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,410
The large one with 110g

935
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,320
cost 13 yuan.

936
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,170
Counting like this,

937
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,040
the medium portion

938
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,570
costs 0.11 yuan per gram,

939
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,440
while the large portion

940
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,650
costs 0.1181 yuan per gram.

941
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,440
Then it must be more cost-effective to buy medium fries.

942
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,880
But you can earn points if you buy a large fries.

943
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,130
Don't calculate anymore.

944
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,290
It's unclear.

945
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:00,840
Why is this world

946
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,200
so troublesome?

947
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,610
What is the point

948
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,810
of having so many useless promotions?

949
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,570
You still insisted to calculate when you think it's troublesome.

950
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,890
I don't know if you're lazy

951
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,570
or too serious.

952
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,090
You have a new trick.

953
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,680
It's indeed a good way to prevent other girls from pursuing you.

954
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,770
What do you know?

955
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,840
This method is more efficient.

956
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:28,770
Give it to me.

957
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,770
Why bother?

958
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,720
Since I'm back now,

959
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,250
why not let me help you?

960
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,400
It's completed in one step.

961
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,890
I thought you came back

962
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,210
to look for a job.

963
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
It won't cause delays, and there's no contradiction.

964
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,290
After all,

965
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,120
we'd been a campus couple

966
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,130
for five years.

967
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,290
We were a rumored campus couple.

968
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,410
Then we're now

969
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,930
new hospital colleagues.

970
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,490
What do you think?

971
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,250
Do you want me to help you

972
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,850
to appease

973
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:03,570
the agonizing pain caused by your ex-wife?

974
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,330
Why was there a coincidence?

975
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,930
Why was there a coincidence?

976
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,810
How come we bumped into each other so soon?

977
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:28,690
Why?

978
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,450
Why is he still so good-looking

979
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,640
when six years have passed?

980
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,490
Why I just...

981
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,690
I look quite okay, too.

982
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,320
Today, I...

983
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,170
I was still okay today?

984
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,570
Did he see me?

985
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,680
He saw me

986
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,490
but he pretended that he didn't?

987
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,650
He ignored me?

988
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:51,760
That's right, too.

989
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,170
What do you want him to do?

990
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,850
To come and greet you and shake hands,

991
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,080
saying that we haven't been seeing each other for long?

992
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,240
Come to think about it.

993
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:57,930
You left without saying anything

994
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,160
six years ago.

995
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:00,650
If I were him,

996
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,490
I'd hate me to death.

997
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,120
"I hate you."

998
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,490
"I won't forgive you until the day I die."

999
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,970
Fine.

1000
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,650
In this case,

1001
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,890
I'll let him hate me forever.

1002
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,810
We'll sever our ties for good.

1003
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,730
Fangning.

1004
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,410
It's impossible.

1005
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:47,970
How could Ling Rui be

1006
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,410
such a dramatic person?

1007
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,370
Our Ling Rui

1008
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,290
is a person who is like an angel.

1009
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,880
Long time no see.

1010
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,850
Long time no see.

1011
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,570
Yes, that's just it.

1012
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,850
If he smiles at you,

1013
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,850
you'll just smile back.

1014
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,210
If he ignores you,

1015
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,240
then you'll do the same as well.

1016
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,050
That's right.

1017
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,650
If he talks to you properly,

1018
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,650
you two will just reconcile.

1019
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,290
Isn't it just a meeting?

1020
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,170
Lu Fangning.

1021
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,570
Don't be a coward.

1022
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:52,960
Don't be a coward.

1023
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,410
It was just an accident today.

1024
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,090
I'm probably not going to

1025
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,450
meet you again tomorrow.

1026
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,290
It's time to give you a bath.

1027
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,050
Come on.

1028
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,050
Youyou.

1029
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,080
Put on your shoes.

1030
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,810
-Go.
-Okay.

1031
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:48,410
Can you wear it?

1032
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,130
Are you sure?

1033
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,050
The shoelaces.

1034
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,090
Look.

1035
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,490
I've taught you so many times,

1036
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,770
but you still don't know how to tie.

1037
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:03,170
I'm only five years old.

1038
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,130
I already know how to cook, clean,

1039
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,730
sleep alone, and fold the blanket.

1040
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,450
These are only shoelaces.

1041
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,570
Mom,

1042
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,290
don't request

1043
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,330
too much from me.

1044
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,010
I think that except sleeping alone,

1045
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,610
you don't know anything else that you said.

1046
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,170
You're bragging.

1047
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,250
You're bragging.

1048
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:19,970
It's you.

1049
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,570
That's enough. Mom has to work today.

1050
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:22,490
I'll fetch you to

1051
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:23,690
little grandpa's house later.

1052
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:24,640
You must be obedient

1053
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,770
while you're in grandpa's house.

1054
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:26,610
Got it?

1055
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,130
It's strange.

1056
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,810
Isn't today the weekend?

1057
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:32,050
Why do you still have to work?

1058
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,210
I can only work on the weekends,

1059
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,050
do you know?

1060
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,600
But then little grandpa's house

1061
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,410
looks

1062
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,680
very boring.

1063
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,810
How come?

1064
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,730
Little grandpa

1065
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,170
is an urban elite.

1066
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,010
The news said that

1067
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,640
over 70 percent of urban elites

1068
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,050
have no energy or interest

1069
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,730
to enjoy their spare time.

1070
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:49,490
You should

1071
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:50,610
watch less news.

1072
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:51,290
Let's go.

1073
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,250
Let's go.

1074
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,050
Who is it?

1075
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,290
Little grandpa,

1076
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,130
mom said that she'll work today,

1077
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,050
so she asked me to come to your house to have fun.

1078
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,370
There's one

1079
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,970
little chameleon.

1080
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,050
Today is the weekend.

1081
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,130
I guess a visiting professor

1082
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,050
won't come either.

1083
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:03,450
I think it's very simple

1084
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,010
after you've explained.

1085
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:05,610
You can apply this...

1086
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:06,320
Thank you, teacher.

1087
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:06,850
Apply this here.

1088
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:08,490
Correct.

1089
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:09,410
This step.

1090
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:12,330
Ling...

1091
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:12,850
This step is like this.

1092
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,010
This question can even be solved like this?
