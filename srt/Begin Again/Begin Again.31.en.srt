Was Ling Rui serious

or was he just as drunk?

20
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,410
Dad.

21
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,570
You're not asleep, Youyou?

22
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,730
Aren't we going home today?

No.

No.

Are you going to be together forever?

27
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,530
Yes.

28
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,330
Will you sleep together?

29
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,050

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,050
Youyou,

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,170
who told you these?

33
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,079
My girlfriend abroad,

34
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,800
Lily told me these.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,250
Her mom and dad

36
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,450
leave her alone

37
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,130
when they sleep.

38
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,450
Mom and Dad

39
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,640
will always be by your side

40
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,050
and never leave you alone.

41
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,960
Good night, Dad.

42
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,370
Good boy.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,720
Here, head on your pillow.

44
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,760
Good night, Youyou.

45
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,370
Get back together? Are we really getting back together?

46
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,690
It's definitely not because of me.

47
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,130
Is it for Youyou,

48
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:33,450
or me?

49
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,200
Because of Youyou?

50
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,810
Or maybe the both of us?

51
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,450
Why did you say that?

52
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,280
I'm going to pick Youyou up today.

53
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,330
I'll see you later.

54
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,800
What should I do?

55
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,570
Ling Rui.

56
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,680
-Let's go.
-Wait a minute.

57
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,720
Well...

58
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,360
I thought about it.

59
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,090
I think

60
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,440
it's best I don't go up there.

61
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,810
You're not picking up Youyou?

62
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,480
Can't you get him here?

63
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,120
I can't.

64
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,890
Here is the case.

65
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,920
You know, my aunt

66
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,050
gave me too many books,

67
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,690
I haven't finished

68
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,640
reading yet.

69
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,880
I'm afraid I can't give a good answer

70
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,680
when she asks me about it.

71
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,490
That would be awkward.

72
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,530
And our mom,

73
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,240
when our mom…

74
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,210
No, your mom.

75
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,450
Your mom must be shocked

76
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,450
to see me.

77
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,880
You've changed.

78
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,400
You wouldn't

79
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,880
force me like this before.

80
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,850
As you said yesterday,

81
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,250
we've both changed.

82
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,920
Why must I go up?

83
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,200
You came to pick up Youyou,

84
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,920
yet you won't get to the door.

85
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,890
Do you want Youyou

86
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,200
to think that his mom won't

87
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,010
come to Grandma's home

88
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,210
because we're having a fight?

89
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,530
-Let's go.
-Wait.

90
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,800
I was drunk yesterday.

91
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,400
So, I'm not sure.

92
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,130
But I

93
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,890
seemed to hear you said

94
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,360
that we...

95
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,400
We're back together.

96
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,930
I see.

97
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,490
Why?

98
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,640
Is a reason needed?

99
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,840
It's good for us.

100
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,090
In what aspect?

101
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,090
In every aspect.

102
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,880
Forty-five. Forty-six. Forty-seven.

103
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,330
-Forty-eight. Forty-nine. Fifty.
-Forty-eight. Forty-nine.

104
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,120
-Fifty-one. Fifty-two. Fifty-three.
-Fifty-three.

105
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,080
Fifty-four. Fifty-five.

106
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,370
Fifty-six.

107
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,690
Fifty-seven.

108
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,010
Fifty-eight. Fifty-nine. Ninety.

109
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,440
-Fangning and I...
-Ninety-two.

110
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,540
Ninety-three.

111
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,990
-We're back together.
-Ninety-four. Ninety-five.

112
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,690
What?

113
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,850
Mom, you're here.

114
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,170
Good boy.

115
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,490
Youyou,

116
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,280
I have an important assignment

117
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,650
for you, okay?

118
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,040
What assignment?

119
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,880
Here, come with me.

120
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,760
Hi.

121
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,050
When are you getting the certificate?

122
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,400
Will you hold another wedding?

123
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,920
I'm against this.

124
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,130
They got back together,

125
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,610
why are you against it?

126
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,640
They once had

127
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,840
a failed marriage.

128
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,919
That means they

129
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,850
are not meant for each other.

130
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,370
Why should they get back together?

131
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,409
Aunt,

132
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,530
I don't think it was a failure.

133
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,970
Fangning,

134
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:44,490
do you think our marriage

135
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,440
was a failure?

136
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,570
No, no, no. It was not.

137
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,490
I was a failure.

138
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,050
I was not mature and sensible

139
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,400
six years ago.

140
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,040
She is right.

141
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,490
She was not mature and sensible.

142
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,200
She left without a word six years ago.

143
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,730
Did you forget

144
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,480
how much pain

145
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,680
she has brought you?

146
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,960
Because of our experience,

147
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,770
she'll cherish me even more now.

148
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,170
It has been six years.

149
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,450
You've both changed.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,640
Who knows

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,320
if you suit each other now?

152
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,930
Six years ago,

153
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,960
we managed to be together.

154
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,890
Now that we're back together,

155
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,880
we don't have to know each other

156
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,400
all over again.

157
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,410
We don't even have to

158
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,600
explain to others.

159
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,800
This is a good thing for both of us.

160
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,720
I think

161
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
Lu Fangning

162
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,880
is the right person for me.

163
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,560
I can't argue with you.

164
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
All right.

165
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,640
It's not like

166
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,760
we've managed

167
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,960
to sway Ling Rui's decision before.

168
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,160
Mom.

169
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,250
Stop drinking water.

170
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,400
Fangning and I

171
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,560
could take you to a coffee shop.

172
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,520
Okay.

173
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,120
There will be no problem

174
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,800
if Fangning comes with me.

175
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,210
You...

176
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,240
Um, Fangning.

177
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,640
You can stay here

178
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,560
for dinner tonight.

179
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,090
Yes.

180
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,560
Sister.

181
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,360
Sister.

182
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,720
Get ready.

183
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,200
Don't just sit here.

184
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,320
What do you want for dinner? Start preparing.

185
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,970
Get working.

186
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,610
Let's go.

187
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,440
Let's go, Sister.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,720
Let's go.

189
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,720
You should check on Youyou.

190
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,080
Okay.

191
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,050
We can go on a stroll

192
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,640
with him after dinner.

193
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,120
Okay.

194
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,520
I'll go help in the kitchen.

195
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,440
Okay.

196
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,450
Dinner.

197
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,130
How many times

198
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,770
have I told you?

199
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,850
The stopcock dropped off.

200
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,000
I can't install it myself.

201
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,850
The water keeps running.

202
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,600
What if my house becomes flooded?

203
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,480
I called you yesterday,

204
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,560
didn't I?

205
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,000
Why didn't you come?

206
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,210
Aren't you coming now?

207
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,400
How can you...

208
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,770
Hello?

209
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,920
I'm the one paying you, okay?

210
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,200
Who is it?

211
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,450
A surprise from the management?

212
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,640
Why are you here?

213
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,160
Who else are you expecting?

214
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,010
A plumber.

215
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,600
The trouble arrived and help

216
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,520
is nowhere to be seen.

217
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,320
What do you want?

218
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,280
You didn't answer

219
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,410
the question I asked you.

220
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,600
You got my answer.

221
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,040
What did you say?

222
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,410
What happened between us

223
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,280
six years ago?

224
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,000
Old man, are you done yet?

225
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,170
I answered it

226
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,120
six years ago.

227
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,690
I answered it a week ago.

228
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,560
Can you ask

229
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,810
something new?

230
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,160
Then why is your Weibo...

231
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,960
Wait a second.

232
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,200
At this rate,

233
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,880
there is no end to this conversation.

234
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,600
I don't have the time to waste on you.

235
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,570
I'm busy.

236
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,560
What are you doing?

237
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,720
The stopcock is off.

238
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
You're strong.

239
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,010
How did you pull it out?

240
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,960
You're a man, right?

241
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,000
Of course I am.

242
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Go fix it.

243
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
I didn't say I could fix this.

244
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,440
Fixing and patching,

245
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,410
and being a plumber are

246
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,320
basics for every man.

247
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,160
Right?

248
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,840
Here.

249
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,200
I got the tools.

250
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,160
Go fix it.

251
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,640
Stop standing there.

252
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,520
Take your time.

255
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160

256
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,360
Ah.

257
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,240
[He's drenched.]

258
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,000
Why are you still standing here?

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,840
Stop staring,

260
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,080
go grab a towel.

261
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,960
A towel...

262
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,520
Inspiration hits me.

263
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,400
Oh, no. It hurts.

264
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,310
[Cosmic Century]

265
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,320
I finally finished it.

266
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,560
Lu Yiyao

267
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,360
is my muse.

268
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,640
Lu Yiyao.

269
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,440
Lu...

270
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,360
Was it a dream,

271
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,400
or did it really happen?

272
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,160
Dad,

273
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,920
will you and Mom

274
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,520
stay with me together

all the time?

276
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,520
Yes.

277
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,400
Youyou.

278
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,760
Have some water.

279
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,720
You need to stay hydrated. Here.

280
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Good boy.

281
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,320
What else

282
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,560
do you want to buy?

283
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,200
I'm going to buy some underwear.

284
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,040
Well...

285
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm not going with you.

286
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,790
I'll browse for the vegetables.

287
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,830
Good boy.

288
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,550
I remember someone

289
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,960
asked me to buy her

290
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,280
female sanitary products.

291
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,040

292
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,960
Where is the underwear?

293
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:53,710

What do you want? I can grab it for you.

297
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,670
I want potato chips.

301
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,040
Snack Day of this month yet.

302
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,280
Did you forget?

303
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,319
A little boy

304
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,839
suffered from a throat inflammation

305
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,880
because he ate too much potato chips,

306
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,560
do you remember that?

307
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,720
It's okay to have some sometimes.

308
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,480
Besides,

309
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,240
Mom eats it at night

310
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,200
while people aren't watching.

311
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,520
You put potato chips in the safe.

312
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,000
You can't fool me!

313
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,880
Well, I am an adult.

314
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,040
It's okay

315
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
for me to eat it once.

316
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,960
I won't have throat inflammation.

317
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,960
-Youyou.

00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,320
Is Mom too broke

321
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,560
to buy me a bag of potato chips?

322
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,520
No.

323
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,920
Mom wants you to be healthy.

324
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,320
She doesn't want you

325
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,950
to have the habit of eating snacks.

326
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,430
Then I won't make it a habit,

327
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,160
okay?

328
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,240
No.

329
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,080
Dad, get me down.

330
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,400

Dad.

332
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,680
Buy me one bag, all right?

333
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,640
That looks delicious.

334
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,920
Don't you want some too?

335
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,960
I'll just have several pieces,

336
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,520
you can have the rest.

337
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,120
All right?

338
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,830
Youyou,

339
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,280
I saw

340
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,880
some fresh vegetables over there.

341
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,270
I could buy some

342
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,160
and make you

343
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,240
vegetable dishes tonight?

344
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,470
I don't like vegetables.

345
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,480
Don't yell.

346
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,280
This is a public space.

347
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
Once you have a bag of potato chips,

348
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,160
you should take ten times of

349
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,070
vegetable dishes for enough nutrition.

350
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,800
Do you know that?

351
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,680
I don't like vegetables.

352
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,400
Then I'll have one piece of potato chip,

353
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,680
does that mean I only need

354
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,880
one green dish?

355
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,840
Youyou.

356
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,880
Stand here.

357
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,680
I'll offer you two options.

358
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,360
You can either hold my hand

359
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,840
and we buy some vegetables,

360
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,560
or you can hold Mom's hand

361
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,040
and we go check out now.

362
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Which will it be?

363
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,280
Have you decided?

364
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,710
Who do you pick?

365
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,230
Mom.

366
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,440
Here, hold my hand.

367
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,800
You know

368
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,120
how to deal with children.

369
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,760
Let's go.

370
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,360
You're a good mom too.

371
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,360
Youyou.

372
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,360
Youyou.

373
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,710
Change your shoes first.

374
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,680
Why didn't you buy

375
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,870
potato chips for me today?

376
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,040
Why?

377
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,320
I'll get you some next time.

378
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,720
Okay?

379
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,520
Yes.

380
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,520
Here.

381
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Youyou,

382
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,120
what do you do after you come home?

383
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,360
I must wash my hands.

384
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,310
Go do it.

385
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,310
I'll wait for Dad.

386
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,470
-Let's go.
-Let's go, Dad.

387
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,640
Let's wash our hands.

388
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,920
Let's wash our hands.

389
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,160
A good wife.

390
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,750
A good mom.

391
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,960
What else?

392
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,480
What else can I do well?

393
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,110
Fangning.

394
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,640
I...

395
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,830
I'm unpacking the things.

396
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,630
Yes.

397
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,760
I didn't see it clearly.

398
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,720
I'm sorry.

399
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,160
It's okay.

400
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,280
I'll put the things

401
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,190
in the bedroom and bathroom.

402
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,320
But you have to

403
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,710
spare some room for me.

404
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,520
Okay.

405
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,360
Spare...

406
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,560
To spare some room in my bedroom?

407
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,400
That's for sure.

408
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,120
Aren't you

409
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,720
sleeping with Youyou?

410
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,440
Lu Fangning.

411
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,670
Did you forget that

412
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,160
we're now back together?

413
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,240
Listen,

414
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,190
Youyou is asking for me.

415
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,030
Youyou?

416
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,600
What's up, Youyou?

417
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,080
Youyou.

418
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,150
Really?

419
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,870
Dad and Mom

420
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,240
are really back together.

421
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,480
Yes.

422
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,400
Thank you for taking in Mom.

423
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,950
You're such a good person.

424
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,030
You're an angel!

425
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,560
How could you say that?

426
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,550
You sound like

427
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,880
I was a bad person.

428
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,670
Dad,

429
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,350
is Mom going to

430
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,840
stay here forever?

431
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,320
Am I going

432
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,390
to the school here?

433
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,400
Why didn't Mom tell me earlier?

434
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,230
What if I can't catch up with the course?

435
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,070
Right.

436
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,640
Should I

437
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,280
change my name

438
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,670
to Ling Youyou?

439
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,920
It doesn't sound nice.

440
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,920
Dad,

441
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,270
can I name

442
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,550
myself?

443
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,670
What name do you want?

444
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,120
Like Ling Tian Ares.

445
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,510
You can name yourself Ling Zero.

446
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,360
Dad,

447
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,990
Mom is bullying me.

448
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,390
You too.

449
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,400
You're using your Dad

450
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,880
to pick on me.

451
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,640
Will you sleep

452
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,760
with me tonight?

453
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,000
Tonight?

454
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,070
I'm afraid I can't.

455
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,110
Because Mom and Dad

456
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,950
will sleep together tonight.

457
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,120
Mom is a grown-up,

458
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,400
does she need your company?

459
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,750
Mom, you're so weak.

460
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,710
That's not the case.

461
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,710
It's because

462
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,200
Mom and Dad are now together.

463
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,480
Just like you and I,

464
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,710
we have to cultivate our relationship now.

465
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,880
It's okay if we do it later.

466
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,870
All right.

467
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,000
That makes sense.

468
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,270
We have a lot of time anyway.

469
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,270
Mom can have you

470
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,910
for the night.

471
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,000
Good boy.

472
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,550
Dad,

473
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,800
what will we have for dinner?

474
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,160
I'll make you the most delicious

475
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,680
stir-fried vegetables.

476
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,870
I don't like vegetables.

477
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,670
No way.

478
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,760
Kids need vegetables.

479
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,280
That's good for their health.

480
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,190
Right?

481
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,120
Of course.

482
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,440
Have more vegetables.

483
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,510
All right.

484
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,790
I'll go have fun then.

485
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,830
-Off you go.
-Off you go.

486
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,680
You see?

487
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,830
Youyou is happy.

488
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,560
Thank you, Ling Rui.

489
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,950
Don't mention it.

490
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,160
Instead of thanking me,

491
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,960
you should make it up to me.

492
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,310
I'll go pack

493
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,350
your things up.

494
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,150
Remember to put them in...

495
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,670
The bedroom. I remember that.

496
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,310
Lu Fangning.

497
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,230
Be sober.

498
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,560
What are you thinking?

499
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,950
We can sleep separately.

500
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,070
Separately.

501
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,520
Be cool.

502
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,030
Inner peace.

503
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,240
All wishes come true.

504
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,390
What am I saying?

505
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,350
Aren't you asleep?

506
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,910
You woke me up.

507
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,920
What?

508
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,470
I'm not prepared.

509
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,190
You don't have to prepare for it.

510
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,990
I told you that

511
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,080
in the past.

512
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,600
That's all?

513
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,560
I'm a little tired today,

514
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,630
I'll sleep first.

515
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,230
Good night.

516
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,590
I may not be tired

517
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,830
if you keep staring at me.

518
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,160
Okay, never mind.

519
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,790
I didn't sleep well the whole night.

520
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,270
Youyou, get up.

521
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,230
Don't let me

522
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,030
wait for you in front of the bathroom.

523
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,270
Morning.

524
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:21,990
Morning.

525
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,230
Breakfast is ready.

526
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,870
We can have it after Youyou gets up.

527
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,390
[There should be mine this time.]

528
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,590
Come here.

529
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,710
Do you want your breakfast?

530
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,950
Judging by your personality,

531
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,150
wouldn't you pay me for breakfast?

532
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,950
I'm brushing my teeth.

533
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,150
Is there toothpaste on my lips?

534
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,830
Clean it up for me.

535
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,070
A little bit left.

536
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,990
Thank you.

537
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,910
Go.

538
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,550
You can have breakfast

539
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,790
after you're done.

540
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,070
Here, Youyou.

541
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,950
Have an egg.

542
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,710
Mom,

543
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,070
didn't you cultivate your relationship

544
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,590
with Dad last night?

545
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,670
What?

546
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,030
Cultivating your relationship.

547
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,830
Did you

548
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,110
decide on my name?

549
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,470
Youyou.

550
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,750
Finish your breakfast.

551
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,670
You

552
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,350
are still Lu Youyou for now.

553
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,590
Fangning,

554
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,270
any plan for today?

555
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,150
I'm going to

556
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,230
the art park today

557
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,670
to see the shop

558
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,950
Mr. Cao recommended,

559
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,190
then I'll go to check out

560
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,270
the details of the contract.

561
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,710
Is it settled?

562
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,220
Settled.

563
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,310
I'll go to check out some schools

564
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,220
for Youyou if I'm available.

565
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,430
Mom,

566
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,580
can I pick it myself?

567
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,550
Of course.

568
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,750
But you first need to make it past the entrance test.

569
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,110
There is a standard.

570
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,030
Is that clear?

571
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,310
I'm full.

572
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,670
Mom,

573
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,710
I'm full.

574
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,710
Take your time.

575
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,470
You're full?

576
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,910
Where are you going, baby?

577
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,190
I must do some reading.

578
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,270
You barely ate anything.

579
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,390
The kid

580
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,510
really takes after you.

581
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,870
Let me drive you there.

582
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,510
What?

583
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,990
To the art park.

584
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,750
Never mind.

585
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,470
You can cultivate your relationship

586
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,630
with Youyou at home.

587
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,670
What about you?

588
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,470
I don't need to.

589
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,630
No.

590
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,270
I mean,

591
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,470
I can manage it myself.

592
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,630
I'm an adult.

593
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,710
I won't get lost.

594
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,830
Shen Zhuo will accompany me.

595
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,620
Don't worry.

596
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,630
I'll drive you there.

597
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,180
I haven't had it yet.

598
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,590
You're full.

599
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,030
Let's go.

600
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,550
Ms. Lu.

601
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,870
There are two floors.

602
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,350
The e-commerce platforms are taking off.

603
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,070
A large number

604
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,220
of the shops in the art park

605
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,030
are used as an experience center

606
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,830
to exhibit major design works.

607
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,950
The space

608
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,430
should be enough.

609
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,550
The space is good.

610
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,670
The place isn't fully renovated yet.

611
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,710
That's fine.

612
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,910
This makes it easy for me

613
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,150
to decorate it as I please.

614
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,190
How is it, Ms. Lu?

615
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,380
Are you satisfied with this?

616
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,550
Ms. Lu.

617
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,910
You have nothing to worry about.

618
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,910
The location and construction of the shop

619
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,420
are top of the line.

620
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,710
I'll never go back on my promise

621
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,550
with Dr. Ling.

622
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,070
Thank you, Cao.

623
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,110
Of course I'm not worried.

624
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,510
I just

625
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,110
came by because

626
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,470
I have some free time.

627
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,180
Feel free to look around.

628
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,910
Shen Zhuo.

629
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,990
Never mind.

630
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,150
I'll take this shop.

631
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,150
This place will be

632
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,310
the official starting point

633
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,510
of the White Queen in this country.

634
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,230
How is the contract?

635
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,590
It's good.

636
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,940
I don't see any problems.

637
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,020
The terms

638
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,150
are sensible.

639
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,300
I think we can sign it.

640
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,420
Will you take a look?

641
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,630
Never mind.

642
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,910
You're the boss.

643
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,350
You've sold me out

644
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,710
so many times already.

645
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,310
Ms. Lu,

646
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,470
if there is

647
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,270
no problem with the contract,

648
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,470
I'll start preparing.

649
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,510
We can sign the contract very soon.

650
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,310
Okay.

651
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,190
Ling Rui.

652
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,910
Will you take a look too?

653
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,909
Dr. Ling can read a contract?

654
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,270
He is better at this than me.

655
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,100
Stop playing.

656
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,110
It's okay.

657
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,630
What's the matter?

658
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,310
Is there something wrong?

659
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,260
The years of cooperation

660
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,510
could be extended.

661
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,909
Ms. Lu said

662
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,340
she'd make it for five years

663
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,219
when I talked it over with her and Mr. Shen.

664
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,780
If Ms. Lu would like to

665
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,659
extend our cooperation,

666
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,030
I'll be glad to accept it.

667
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,260
Okay, okay.

668
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,230
I'm fine with that.

669
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,580
Okay. No problem at all.

670
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,350
Eight or ten years are all fine.

671
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,710
You're selling yourself to him.

672
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,390
You'll get a 30% cut.

673
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,030
Good.

674
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,790
Go away.

675
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,700
Isn't the penalty

676
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,790
too low?

677
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,180
Low?

678
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,980
Higher penalty

679
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,790
ensures the spirit of contract

680
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,550
for each side.

681
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,390
I'm afraid that someone

682
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,260
might run away

683
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,070
without one word.

684
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,350
What do you think, Fangning?

685
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,790
How unbelievable.

686
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,070
Well...

687
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,750
How about we make it triple?

688
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,550
All right, it's fine with me.

689
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,150
It's fine.

690
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,350
I think it makes sense.

691
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,780
No way.

692
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,740
This is an unequal treaty.

693
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,740
Now that Fangning agrees,

694
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,550
we can sign the contract.

695
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,750
Dr. Ling, Ms. Lu.

696
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,020
Once we've signed the contract,

697
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,340
it'll become legally effective right away.

698
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,350
I can't compensate for the money

699
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,740
even if you sell me.

700
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,470
It's okay.

701
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,060
If she skipped town,

702
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,380
this would be

703
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,190
a joint debt for both of us.

704
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,270
I could compensate for it in her place.

705
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,670
Compensation?

706
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,740
Couple?

707
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,550
Lu Fangning.

708
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,150
You two...

709
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,550
I see.

710
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,910
Congratulations.

711
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,430
No wonder.

712
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,910
I've never seen

713
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,190
Dr. Ling

714
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,790
so concerned about

715
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,110
anything other than work.

716
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,590
This is great.

717
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,340
The girls in the company

718
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,420
can stop asking me

719
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,950
to fix them up with you.

720
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,350
Then I'll

721
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:38,990
go revise

722
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,270
the contract

723
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,340
and send it to you.

724
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,310
Thank you, Mr. Cao.

725
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:42,860
Okay.

726
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,870
May this be a great partnership.

727
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,740
Likewise.

728
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,190
I should get going.

729
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,270
Goodbye.

730
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,010
-Bye.
-Bye.

731
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,570
Goodbye.

732
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,910
I'll go to the exhibition.

733
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,590
Goodbye.

734
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,950
Is he okay?

735
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,300
Don't worry.

736
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,420
Let me see the contract

737
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,070
after it's revised.

738
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,670
I'll be in the debt with you.

739
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,660
I should know about it.

740
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,190
I'll go back to the hospital later.

741
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,100
There is an important meeting next week.

742
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,270
I have to go back

743
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,310
to sort my data.

744
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,540
Let me drive you.

745
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,580
Never mind.

746
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,590
You're going

747
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,140
to be busy for a while.

748
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,390
Then I'll come to pick you up for dinner.

749
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,350
I'll wait for you.

750
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,190
I mean,

751
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,060
I'll wait for you so that

752
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,070
we can go

753
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,070
pick up Youyou together.

754
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,230
He will be so happy.

755
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,710
Okay.

756
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,500
Then I'll come to pick up you for dinner,

757
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,270
then we'll pick up Youyou.

758
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,180
Fangning.

759
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,540
I didn't see anyone of them.

760
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,140
Those girls

761
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,380
Mr. Cao and the others

762
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,230
introduced to me,

763
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,260
I didn't see anyone of them.

764
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,780
You saw me

765
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,460
on a blind date with Dr. Yu the other day

766
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,980
because I didn't want my aunt

767
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,980
to be worried.

768
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,550
It's okay.

769
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,670
You don't have to explain it to me.

770
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,150
I don't mind.

771
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,590
I want you to know.

772
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,620
Ling Rui.

773
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,420
I'd like to ask you one more time.

774
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:48,990
Are we...

775
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,740
Fangning,

776
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,910
I have work at the hospital.

777
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,710
Isn't Shen Zhuo waiting for you

778
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,980
to revise the contract?

779
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,900
I should get going.

780
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,430
I'll pick you up at night.

781
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,580
See you.

782
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,830
Mr. Gao.

783
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,780
Thanks for your support

784
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,350
of our work over the years.

785
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,430
We will do

786
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,820
as you requested.

787
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
You have my word.

788
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,740
I'll expect good news from you.

789
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,380
Okay.

790
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,460
If there is nothing else,

791
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,540
I must get back to my work.

792
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,750
Dr. Ling.

793
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,060
Mr. Gao.

794
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,510
Why are you here?

795
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,460
I just came by

796
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,590
to have a look.

797
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,140
I didn't expect to see you here.

798
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,580
I heard that

799
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,900
Lu Fangning has come back.

800
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,940
Well?

801
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,420
How is she lately?

802
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,700
Fangning just

803
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,980
settled down here.

804
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,100
Then you showed up here.

805
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,020
Is this only a coincidence?

806
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,460
You got LM Deer Sing

807
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,780
six years ago.

808
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,180
I hope you won't

809
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,500
ruin her life again.

810
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,660
Without LM Deer Sing,

811
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,900
Lu Fangning

812
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,430
can create

813
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,510
a new brand.

814
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,620
So,

815
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,900
why would I

816
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,540
listen to you?

817
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,470
Dr. Ling?

818
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,500
You've tried it once,

819
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,110
and you didn't get what you want.

820
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,030
There is nothing you can do

821
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,910
to make amend.

822
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,820
It sounds like you

823
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,020
know me very well.

824
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,790
I understand the feeling

825
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,940
of being trapped in memory.

826
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,740
Then you're more fortunate than I am.

827
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,300
Shen Zhuo.

828
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,940
Shen Zhuo.

829
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:10,900
What are you doing?

830
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,420
I'm talking to you.

831
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,430
Hey.

832
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,220
What are you doing?

833
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,150
Don't give me the attitude.

834
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,830
I'm talking to you.

835
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,220
I just searched on the Internet

836
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,140
to see

837
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,100
if there is a case

838
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,020
of someone

839
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,870
who suddenly

840
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,660
got a split personality.

841
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,820
Shut up.

842
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,220
Are you asking for trouble?

843
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,140
Don't be absurd.

844
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,060
This is

845
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,940
the Lu Fangning I know.

846
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,310
Scold me more.

847
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,350
See if you'll

848
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:43,990
be soberer.

849
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,470
Think it through.

850
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,710
How could you just

851
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,790
sign the unequal treaty.

852
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,910
You didn't even spare your time

853
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,700
to check the punctuations

854
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,140
in the contract.

855
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,340
What is this nonsense you're giving me?

856
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,430
Didn't you say

857
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,340
it'd be fine if I sold you off?

858
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,820
I haven't got to that, yet.

859
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,020
You're picking on me.

860
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,140
Weren't you cowering

861
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:03,580
at the back?

862
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:06,270
"Eight, nine or ten years are all fine."

863
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,900
I...

864
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,630
Well...

865
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,140
I...

866
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,870
What?

867
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,740
You said, "It's fine by me."

868
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,500
Shut up.

869
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,500
I was

870
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,900
sensible

871
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,020
and considerate.

872
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,940
You know?

873
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,300
Sensible,

874
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,910
and considerate?

875
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,020
That's ridiculous.

876
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,830
Shen Zhuo.

877
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,580
I once,

878
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,540
ran away from him.

879
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,460
And now,

880
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,860
in Ling Rui eyes,

881
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
I'm not

882
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,860
worthy of his trust.

883
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,660
So,

884
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,980
if I can make him feel secure

885
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,790
by doing this,

886
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,380
then it's fine by me.

887
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,510
Not again.

888
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,100
It's the same all over again.

889
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,340
What spell

890
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,420
did he cast on you?

891
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,300
Did he make you drink

892
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,020
some kind

893
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,940
of love potion

894
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,780
to bewitch you?

895
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,300
Love? No.

896
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,780
Then what?

897
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,540
He didn't say if he loved me.

898
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,500
I see.

899
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,460
You must have driven him insane

900
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,620
six years ago.

901
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,740
So he drew a dungeon

902
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,470
to confine you

903
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,220
so you can't escape,

904
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:18,860
He tortured you.

905
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,740
Shut up.

906
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,300
I should tell Ling Rui

907
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:21,940
everything

908
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,020
you just said.

909
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,700
He could teach a lesson.

910
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,980
You even rely on him

911
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,870
to punish

912
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,660
me?

913
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,620
You're so annoying.

914
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,620
Stop it.

915
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,860
What are you saying?

916
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,680
-Hit your darling Ling Rui.
-Beat you up.

917
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,310
I'll beat you up!

918
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,460
What for?

919
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,020
Yeah, so what?

920
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,660
[LM Deer Sing Group]

921
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,380
[Yueyue,]

922
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,460
[I've arranged the luggage for you.]

923
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,940
[Let's go to the airport directly.]

924
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,460
We promised

925
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,550
we'd leave right away.

926
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,180
I have to celebrate

927
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,700
my sister's 18th birthday.

928
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,300
But I'm afraid you can't come out

929
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,310
once you've gone back.

930
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:04,980
Your dad...

931
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,830
I must go back.

932
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,900
This is my sister's birthday wish.

933
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,180
Moreover,

934
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,140
this could be the last time.

935
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,740
So just let me be there

936
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,980
for her birthday.

937
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,740
It's just a birthday party.

938
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,140
Erfan.

939
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,420
You know that.

940
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:20,710
Family,

941
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:21,900
kids,

942
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,380
and Infinity

943
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,700
are my life goals.

944
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,140
And,

945
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,470
Fangning matters the most to me.

946
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,460
What about me?

947
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,220
I promise you,

948
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,700
I'll be back soon.

949
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:35,740
All right?

950
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,260
Yueyue, actually I...

951
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,060
I'll be back soon.

952
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,180
Wait for me.

953
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,820
-[Take care then.]
-[Okay.]

954
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,980
[I'm waiting for you.]

955
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,820
[Okay.]

956
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,620
Yueyue.

957
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,620
Lu Yue.

958
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,980
Your sister is back.
