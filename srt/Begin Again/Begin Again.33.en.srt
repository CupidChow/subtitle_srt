Hello.

Um...

Please sit.

After you.

12

Mr. Shen,

28
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,290
I wonder how you and Miss Pingping

29
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,620
got to know each other?

30

39

41
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,530
But I know her very well.

42
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,610
That's enough.

Excellent and priceless husband.

Then you can surely understand her.

79
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,770
She's just

80
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,370
a little bit...

81
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,940

Yes, it's good for you to understand that.

84
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,860
Besides, you need to tolerate her.

I'm wondering why she asked for my advice.

94
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,090
Right?

95
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,540
Does my opinion even matter?

96
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,850
I'm not saying I'm not satisfied with you.

97
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,940
Don't get me wrong.

98
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,220
I mean,

99

I'm glad you two like me.

106
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,930
We?

107
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,490
You?

108
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,610
So you asked both of us here,

109
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,250
just to fix us up with each other?

110
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,260
No, Miss Pingping.

111
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,450
You got it all wrong.

112
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,610
Explain it

113
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,370
to your girlfriend.

114
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,690

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,650
Not him?

117
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,610
Don't you both like me?

118

[It's a war of three.]

[This saying is so philosophical.]

121
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,130
When did I say I like you?

122
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,450
You said Lu Fangning was crazy

123
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,409
and a liar.

124
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,890
You said I was sweet and cute,

125
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,730
lively and considerate.

126
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,570
It's not like there were

127
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,540
no other women left.

128
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,380
If that was the case,

129
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,130
I'd rather be single

130
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,130

131
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,810
How about you?

132
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,730
Do you like me?

133
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,250
I...

134
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,580
Sure.

135
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,290
That's good.

136
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,410
I allow you to...

137
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,290
Miss Pingping,

138
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,890
I like you,

139
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,650
but considering your status,

140
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,170
I don't deserve you.

141
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,690
What do you mean?

142
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,530
He means,

143
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,250
his feelings for you are

144
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,090
what a fan would have towards his idol.

145
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,370
It's not romantic.

146
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,090
Right?

147
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,860
Yes.

148
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,130
You!

149
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,050
But...

150
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,890
This is too much!

151
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,010
You two should date each other!

152
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,290
You're meant for each other!

153
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,530
That was too mean!

154
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,450
Miss Pingping, calm down!

155
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,220
You have a love scene

156
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,530
in a few days!

157
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,530
Damn it, can she even perform well

158
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,010
for the scene?

159
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,220
I bet the director

160
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,130
will yell at her again.

161
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,570
I'm sorry, Ms. Lu.

162
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,730
I'm afraid we can't sign the contract.

163
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,290
But...

164
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:11,970
I...

165
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,490
I don't understand. This is too sudden.

166
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,450
I'm really sorry.

167
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,050
Mr. Cao,

168
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,930
because our previous partnership

169
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,580
was very pleasant.

170
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,610
So our products

171
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,010
are now arriving

172
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,410
and on display.

173
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,370
If you suddenly

174
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,330
end the partnership now,

175
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,290
it's really hard for me to accept.

176
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,370
About this park,

177
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,090
we were supposed to design

178
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,210
and operate it.

179
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,530
But it actually

180
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,180
belongs to another company.

181
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,490
They ordered us

182
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,370
not to let your brand in.

183
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,250
Otherwise, the rent of the entire park

184
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,650
will be raised.

185
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,130
Ms. Lu,

186
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,330
if they raise the rent,

187
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,690
it will be hard for us

188
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,740
to explain to the other businesses.

189
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,530
May I know

190
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,010
which company it was?

191
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,890
Ming Cheng Development.

192
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,330
Okay, I got it.

193
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,570
She thought I liked her?

194
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,220
Lu Fangning's friend is weird.

195
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,130
Are we going in now?

196
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,450
How bad should we make it?

197
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,490
The boss ordered us

198
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,810
to give them a warning.

199
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,740
Just make sure they close down the business.

200
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,690
Hello.

201
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,130
We're not open for business yet.

202
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,010
What can I do for you?

203
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,170
Just looking around.

204
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,250
What kind of

205
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,330
delicate trinkets are you selling?

206
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,330
Don't kick it.

207
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,890
You're trashing our store!

208
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,500
This is pretty solid.

209
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,170
We're here

210
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,130
to stop you from opening the store.

211
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,810
I'm warning you.

212
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,530
You can't even open a shop around here.

213
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,890
Pack your stuff and leave.

214
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,930
Who are you?

215
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,850
I'll call the police unless you leave.

216
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,890
The police?

217
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,809
What are you doing?

218
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,900
-Stop it!
-Don't move.

219
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,850
Stop it!

220
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,330
What are you doing? Don't do that!

221
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:45,690
Stop.

222
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,650
Stop it!

223
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,690
Don't move.

224
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,090
Don't scratch it!

225
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,370
Let me go!

226
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,450
-Don't move, -Let me go!

227
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,250
Run!

228
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,130
Are you okay?

229
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,490
What happened?

230
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,210
What happened here?

231
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,050
I don't know where

232
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,930
those two bastards came from.

233
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,450
They broke our lights.

234
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,650
The table was scratched.

235
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,530
I tried to stop them.

236
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,770
Look, my hand is hurt.

237
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,930
Are you okay?

238
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,700
-I'm fine.
-Can you still move?

239
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,210
Try moving it.

240
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,260
Maybe it was hurt earlier.

241
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,130
Now it's got worse.

242
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:43,740
Be careful.

243
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,050
I'm sorry.

244
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,610
I'll take you to a hospital

245
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,890
for a checkup.

246
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,770
Any idea who did this?

247
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,290
I don't know.

248
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,930
They must think they were action stars.

249
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,500
They came in and said,

250
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,090
"Don't ever open a shop here again."

251
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,260
I'll call the police now.

252
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,010
Shen Zhuo.

253
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,820
Shen Zhuo.

254
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,660
What's wrong?

255
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,570
Mr. Cao just called off

256
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,610
the partnership.

257
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,020
They terminated the contract.

258
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,410
This can't be a coincidence.

259
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,010
Was it Mr. Cao's doing?

260
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,610
Am I imagining things?

261
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,770
Who would be mean enough to do that?

262
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,170
Give me a hint.

263
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,450
Shen Zhuo,

264
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,210
stay here for a while.

265
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,650
I'll take you to a hospital later.

266
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,050
I'll come back later.

267
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,940
Send me to the hospital now!

268
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,140
You can't go in there, miss.

269
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,370
Mr. Gao.

270
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,540
That's fine.

271
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,380
Leave us.

272
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,530
Okay.

273
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,970
You are trespassing the general manager's office.

274
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,650
Lu Fangning,

275
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,540
you don't own the place.

276
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,490
Mr. Gao, you don't seem surprised

277
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,250
by my arrival.

278
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,650
You're revisiting this place.

279
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,410
You want to see how well the company you worked for

280
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,290
has become.

281
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,570
It's normal.

282
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,100
Since you and I

283
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,890
have worked together once.

284
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:21,860
I

285
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,770
don't mind wasting a little time

286
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,890
to show you

287
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,890
the current Lu Sing

288
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,890
and how well it develops.

289
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,650
Gao Erfan,

290
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,530
six years ago, my dad and I

291
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,890
left the company to you.

292
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,610
We weren't afraid of you

293
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,850
or defeated by you.

294
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,210
It was because I knew

295
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,810
a fight to the death

296
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,090
against you

297
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,130
will end up with me

298
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:42,730
ruining the lives

299
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,900
of ordinary people.

300
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,450
So I chose not to back out.

301
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,650
That sounds ridiculous.

302
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:55,900
Ming Cheng Development

303
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,010
has been Lu Sing's

304
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,010
partner for years.

305
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,290
You used them to threaten the park

306
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,300
into breaking the contract

307
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,730
and sent some thugs

308
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,290
to the trash in my store.

309
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,890
While I've been away,

310
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,930
you've stooped very low.

311
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,140
I didn't realize

312
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,530
you would sink so low

313
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,170
and resort to petty tricks.

314
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,450
Lu Fangning,

315
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,770
please don't take it out on me

316
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,130
because you failed

317
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,690
to open a business.

318
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,530
Do you think that

319
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,250
you are the most pitiful

320
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,130
and the greatest man alive?

321
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,410
Should everyone

322
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,050
play along

323
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,290
with your emotional drama?

324
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,180
Yes.

325
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,250
I'm not like you.

326
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,850
Whether it's your company, your family,

327
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,530
or your lover,

328
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,970
you never hesitate to give up.

329
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,010
Losing Infinity didn't bother you at all.

330
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,170
You could always

331
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,930
start a new business if you felt like it.

332
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,250
All the things you've lost

333
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,730
came back to you in the end.

334
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,210
Ling Rui never stopped waiting

335
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,330
for your change of heart!

336
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,290
I am not pitiful.

337
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,090
But Lu Yue was.

338
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,980
Because I'm the only one who remembers her.

339
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,890
What?

340
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,810
Did it hit a little too close to home?

341
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,620
Did that make you speechless?

342
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,460
I will never forget her.

343
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:19,940
Never.

344
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,290
You're lying.

345
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,020
What can I do

346
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,410
to make you believe me?

347
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,530
Should I blame myself

348
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,690
and dwell on the past?

349
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,490
Everything you said was about my sister.

350
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,410
Do you know how to love her?

351
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,610
Do you know

352
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,260
what her greatest wish is?

353
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,690
I believe

354
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,490
I know Lu Yue better than you do.

355
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,220
Let me tell you

356
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,090
what she really wanted.

357
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,250
She would never hope

358
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,420
for any of us

359
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,370
to get trapped by guilt

360
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,490
and give up our own life.

361
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,810
Every year on my birthday,

362
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,060
she would tell me,

363
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,130
"I hope you can

364
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,330
do whatever you want with your life,

365
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,690
and be whoever you want to be."

366
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,930
If...

367
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,050
If she could celebrate...

368
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,690
one more birthday with me,

369
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,970
I'm sure she would...

370
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,850
-say...
-Enough.

371
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,050
Lu Fangning,

372
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,690
stop making excuses for yourself.

373
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,170
Gao Erfan,

374
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,460
you're the man my sister loved the most.

375
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,620
I don't want you to have only

376
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,890
painful memories

377
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,380
when you're thinking of my sister.

378
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,490
I'll leave when I'm done,

379
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,490
and I won't stop you

380
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,420
if you keep seeking revenge on me.

381
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,170
But I warn you.

382
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,650
You can make it personal,

383
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,210
but don't get others involved.

384
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,330
Most of them in the art park

385
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,930
are all ordinary business owners.

386
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,810
They stand no chance against your massive firm.

387
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,340
If you insist on doing this,

388
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,610
I will play along with you.

389
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,730
Youyou.

390
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,970
Are you reading?

391
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:55,810
Yes.

392
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,250
-Dad.
-Yes.

393
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,420
Mom,

394
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,130
how's she?

395
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,050
Your mom...

396
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,810
Your mom is a little tired.

397
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,010
She went to bed.

398
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,370
Maybe...

399
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,650
I could read you a story,

400
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,490
okay?

401
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,570
Okay.

402
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,890
Where were you at?

403
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,730
Here.

404
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:15,820
Okay.

405
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,540
Sister Bear asks her dad,

406
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,370
"Dad,

407
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,410
do we have tree rings too?"

408
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,020
Papa Bear

409
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,850
tells Sister Bear,

410
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,380
"We don't have it.

411
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,130
But,

412
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,010
we have a better thing to celebrate.

413
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,580
Our birthdays.

414
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,730
We can have a birthday party."

415
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,730
Birthday?

416
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,970
What's wrong, Dad?

417
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,090
Have you got anything on your mind?

418
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,770
I just remembered

419
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,330
something about birthdays.

420
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,610
Are you wondering

421
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,690
how to celebrate my birthday?

422
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,050
But I'm very considerate.

423
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,460
I won't ask for too many gifts or anything expensive.

424
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,890
Good boy.

425
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,970
Dad,

426
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,140
I want to tell you a secret.

427
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,609
What's the secret?

428
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,970
Before my birthday,

429
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,930
mom's birthday is just around the corner.

430
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,859
Remember

431
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,180
not to celebrate her birthday.

432
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,890
Otherwise, I can't celebrate mine.

433
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,329
I know.

434
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,369
But you should have told me sooner.

435
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,970
Is it too late?

436
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,140
Yes.

437
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,850
It's six years too late.

438
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,010
Dad,

439
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,650
did you know that six years ago?

440
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,260
Morning.

441
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,130
Morning.

442
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,090
Well?

443
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,340
Did you sleep well?

444
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,610
In the beginning,

445
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,650
I was a little restless.

446
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,090
But then I slept soundly.

447
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,220
This is a lot. Let's dig in.

448
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,410
I didn't have enough yesterday.

449
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,410
I'm starving,

450
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,890
Is it not for me?

451
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,220
So none of it

452
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,170
is for me?

453
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,370
You must first promise me three things.

454
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,330
That's a lot.

455
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,770
Forget it then.

456
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,100
Just three things.

457
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,610
Go ahead, what?

458
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,930
First,

459
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,420
I'll be honest with you

460
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,810
about everything in the future.

461
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,810
I hope you will be the same.

462
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,170
Don't hide anything from me.

463
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,650
Trust me.

464
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,650
I promise.

465
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,010
Secondly,

466
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,330
when should we

467
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,620
get our marriage certificate?

468
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,780
When I first came back to China,

469
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,820
I couldn't find you.

470
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,300
To force you to show up,

471
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,810
I went to court

472
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,170
and filed for divorce.

473
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,050
But you hid too well.

474
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,930
You didn't show up.

475
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,290
The court made the divorce effective.

476
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,650
You wouldn't think that

477
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,530
we just need to live together

478
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,690
to take care of Youyou

479
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,060
after I said we got back together.

480
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,570
In view of your previous credit,

481
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,090
I need the protection of the law.

482
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,770
-Otherwise...
-Yeah, I know.

483
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,450
I can totally understand that.

484
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,050
No problem.

485
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,570
Then...

486
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,140
What's the third thing?

487
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,330
Thirdly,

488
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,370
I love you,

489
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,050
Lu Fangning.

490
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,170
The three words we owed to each other.

491
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,370
I love you.

492
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,290
It doesn't matter.

493
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,530
If you can't say it now,

494
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,290
you won't have any breakfast.

495
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,220
Youyou.

496
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,450
Ling Rui.

497
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,050
I love you.

498
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,610
I love you.

499
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,570
You're the person

500
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,580
I love the most.

501
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,730
I saw nothing.

502
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,370
Well...

503
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,410
Let's finish the breakfast.

504
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,410
♫ I'll love you forever ♫

505
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:48,420
♫ All I want is to be with you ♫

506
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,970
♫ I've never wanted to escape from the palm of your hand ♫

507
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,810
♫ Holding on to the past and present ♫

508
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:06,300
♫ And our future ♫

509
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,810
Why are you here again?

510
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,610
What are you doing here?

511
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:24,850
I...

512
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,210
If you're here

513
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,250
to ask the question

514
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,050
from six years ago...

515
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,250
Since I've said it many times

516
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,690
yet you're still skeptical,

517
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,090
then there is only one solution left.

518
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,050
That is...

519
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,170
Let's try again.

520
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,700
Let's recreate the scene.

521
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,490
If you're here to repeat

522
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,690
the boring question,

523
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,490
now you can get up

524
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,380
and walk ten steps forward.

525
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,170
Open the door, close the door, and leave.

526
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,090
Keep a safe distance.

527
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,210
No.

528
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,530
I'm not here to ask you the question.

529
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,530
I came to ask you

530
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,090
about your progress on the novel.

531
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,810
It goes very well.

532
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,970
You haven't updated for three days.

533
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,940
So you came here asking for an update?

534
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,130
Well...

535
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,930
Use me.

536
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,930
Didn't you want to use me

537
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,460
to inspire your passion?

538
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,610
So I came here in person.

539
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,810
You can use me as you please.

540
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,210
Use me to inspire your passion

541
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,620
for the pinnacle of your creativity.

542
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,450
How's that?

543
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,530
You want me to use you.

544
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,530
Okay.

545
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,330
Here's the deal.

546
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,370
We only

547
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,850
talk about the plot, nothing else.

548
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:47,730
Okay.

549
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,210
Let me tell you

550
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,050
the plot of the novel.

551
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,290
Try to feel it.

552
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,170
Here's the story.

553
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,090
I know.

554
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,730
You know?

555
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,490
The bossy president's

556
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,450
mysterious son

557
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,450
met the female protagonist

558
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,370
and never let her go.

559
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,810
It was a fascinating plot,

560
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,690
but you summed it up in one sentence?

561
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,500
And then?

562
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,810
Actually,

563
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,570
the child

564
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,570
is the kid of two main protagonists.

565
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,970
But the female protagonist

566
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,290
doesn't know the man.

567
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,260
Where did the baby come from?

568
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,180
Do you really want to know?

569
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,690
I bet you can't guess it.

570
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,170
I'll give you a sneak peek.

571
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,730
Here's the previous plot.

572
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,730
The president

573
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,130
was with a woman he loved deeply

574
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,290
who suffered leukemia.

575
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,330
This woman

576
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,490
had a long-lost

577
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,010
biological sister.

578
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,890
The sister is the female protagonist.

579
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:38,620
In a word,

580
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,250
the president went through a great ordeal

581
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,690
to find this woman.

582
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,820
He tricked her into loving him

583
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,500
so she could give him a child.

584
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,980
He would use this baby's

585
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,410
umbilical cord blood

586
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,010
to save the woman he loved.

587
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,290
But surprisingly,

588
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,010
the female protagonist

589
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,220
learned the truth

590
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,570
on the day the baby was born.

591
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,490
Her heart was shattered.

592
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,650
So...

593
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,140
So?

594
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,890
Then,

595
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,330
she lost her memories.

596
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,050
Because extreme heartbreak

597
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,060
erased all her memories

598
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,940
about the president.

599
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,370
Isn't this man awful?

600
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,530
It's written in your image.

601
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,370
I just wrote about their reunion.

602
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,810
Facing the female protagonist who lost her memories,

603
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,900
what shall the president

604
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,290
do next?

605
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,330
Will he hide the truth?

606
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,330
Or maybe

607
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,530
he will approach her with ill intent?

608
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,380
[Head-on tactics won't work on her.]

609
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,140
[Simply defending won't do me any good.]

610
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:40,890
[I'll improvise.]

611
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,330
Stay here.

612
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,650
The plot of your novel

613
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,090
stopped at this action, right?

614
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:58,930
Right.

615
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,660
Shall we give it a try

616
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,570
and find out what happens next?

617
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,450
Parcel delivery.

618
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,370
Leave it at the doorstep.

619
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,340
You...

620
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,490
I...

621
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,890
Did you get any inspiration?

622
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,370
Yes, you can leave now.

623
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,650
Don't kick me out

624
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,970
the moment you got the inspiration.

625
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,170
I have other ideas.

626
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,010
Come on, sit.

627
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,690
No. I have to work.

628
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,730
Let's talk about it next time.

629
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:40,850
Next time.

630
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,380
Next time?

631
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,250
Really?

632
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,930
Really, I mean it.

633
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,410
Don't forget.

634
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,410
Tang Ping is here.

635
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,690
Later on,

636
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,300
you'll sit in his back seat.

637
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,730
You'll ride on his bike.

638
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,860
Here's the route.

639
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,970
From here to there.

640
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:43,810
Then go there.

641
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,970
I thought it was a bus.

642
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,210
A bus? Forget it.

643
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,140
It's too tedious.

644
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,250
A bike will do.

645
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,090
My love

646
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,660
is only worthy of a bike.

647
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,820
You're not looking good today.

648
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,570
You're supposed

649
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:58,890
to play as

650
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,900
a woman in love.

651
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,850
You're not up for the job.

652
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,370
A woman...

653
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,210
in love?

654
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:04,940
Look.

655
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,930
Show me your smile.

656
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,050
Why is she crying?

657
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,050
Tang Ping,

658
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,810
I asked you to show

659
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,700
the feeling of being in love.

660
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,810
What are you showing me?

661
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,530
She had waited a long time

662
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,810
for such a scene.

663
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,290
The cold wind.

664
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,890
The chill rain.

665
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,090
Tang Ping

666
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,370
What's the matter?

667
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:28,850
Brother,

668
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,380
please explain to them.

669
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,730
Tang Ping is experiencing

670
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,810
various states of love.

671
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,690
This is the only way

672
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,380
to make her feel

673
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,370
the sweetness of love.

674
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,900
What kind of acting is this?

675
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,170
Forget about her method.

676
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,490
Talk to the director.

677
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,100
Get me half an hour.

678
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,690
Who are you?

679
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,730
I'm a paramedic.

680
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,570
What was that about?

681
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,370
Director.

682
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,850
Please wait for a while.

683
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,410
She'll definitely be here soon.

684
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,290
Do me a favor.

685
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:56,970
Assistant director.

686
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:57,930
Director.

687
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:58,940
Where did you get this actress?

688
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,050
Did you tell her about the plot?

689
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,090
Can she still do it or not?

690
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,050
Yes, she can.

691
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,610
She'll be right here.

692
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,770
Leave.

693
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,500
Let's take a break.

694
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,250
Have some rest.

695
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,160
Are we calling it a day?

696
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,020
How long are we going to wait?

697
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,280
-I'm so sorry.
-Can we have an exact time frame?

698
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,800
It's almost done.

699
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,530
When you cry like that,

700
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,170
I'll in a bad mood.

701
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,330
That's the end.

702
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,210
Wait!

703
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,650
Isn't that the paramedic?

704
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:58,970
Brother,

705
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,890
go ask the director.

706
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,420
We'll be done soon.

707
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:03,890
Okay.

708
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,340
Then I'll just

709
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,650
leave Pingping to you two.

710
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,660
Okay.

711
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:08,890
Good luck.

712
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,290
Director.

713
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,530
You two...

714
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,570
This is for you.

715
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,530
This is for you.

716
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,050
What do you mean?

717
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,130
We are wooing you.

718
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,100
I want to win your love.

719
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,730
You said you didn't like me.

720
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,490
We went back

721
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,300
and thought it through.

722
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,850
I think you're

723
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,250
a really good girl.

724
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,810
And you're pretty, right?

725
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,580
You're gorgeous.

726
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,370
And...

727
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,130
You're innocent.

728
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,420
Nowadays,

729
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,810
girls like you are hard to come by.

730
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,330
Do you think so, Shen Zhuo?

731
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,970
Yes, beautiful and innocent.

732
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,210
Lovely.

733
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:26,490
Lovely.

734
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,090
Enough.

735
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:35,970
I'm not saying that

736
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,650
I accept you two.

737
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,660
I mean...

738
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,290
I have to work.

739
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,090
Yes, that's good. Carry on.

740
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,570
Are you sure you're up for the job?

741
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,010
Yes.

742
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,170
I should get back to work.

743
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,570
Let's talk about this when I'm back.

744
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,090
The feeling of love.

745
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,570
The breeze.

746
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,890
The petals.

747
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,050
That's the effect.

748
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,970
I'm sure she won't fail again this time.

749
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,780
Unbelievable.

750
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,660
Where are you going?

751
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,010
I'm sorry.

752
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,690
Nature calls.

753
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,570
What the hell?

754
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,810
What are they up to?

755
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,530
She said,

756
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,210
"I'm glad you like me,

757
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,810
but don't fight over me."

758
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,890
Yeah, that's the smile.

759
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,250
Why not use a mirror instead?

760
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,900
Shen Zhuo.

761
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,580
You scared me.

762
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,330
What are you doing here?

763
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,500
Aren't you working?

764
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,020
It's done. I passed on the first try.

765
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,260
Congratulations.

766
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,130
Are you leaving?

767
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,380
Don't you want to know the answer?

768
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,930
What?

769
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,740
Where are my flowers?

770
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,210
My flowers.

771
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,250
I'm too busy. I'll give it to you next time.

772
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,380
I mean, later.

773
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,810
Well...

774
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,740
Peng Bo is over there. Go find him.

775
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,620
You.

776
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,530
Hey!

777
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:23,700
What's going

778
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,740
with you two?

779
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,370
What? What do you mean?

780
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,260
Just as you saw

781
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,930
just now.

782
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,940
We both

783
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,690
like you.

784
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,930
I'm not stupid.

785
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,410
All right.

786
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,210
I admit

787
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,010
I can be silly at times.

788
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,460
However,

789
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,930
on this kind of matter,

790
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,650
I don't want to

791
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,690
make the same mistake.

792
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,450
So you were putting up an act?

793
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,500
Not really.

794
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,180
Half of it was real.

795
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,970
Actually, I'm worried

796
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,370
I can't do well in love scenes.

797
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,730
You two just happened to be here.

798
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,290
So I use the chance for practice.

799
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,220
Don't change the topic.

800
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,570
Be honest with me.

801
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,090
If you don't tell me,

802
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,570
I'll tell Lu Fangning

803
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,010
you skipped your work

804
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,650
and came to me.

805
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,850
-I'll ask her to cut your pay.
-Stop.

806
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,889
Stop!

807
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,210
You're so annoying.

808
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,690
You all threatened me with her.

809
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,570
To tell you the truth,

810
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,260
I'm not afraid of Lu Fangning at all.

811
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,770
So,

812
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,340
are you afraid of me?

813
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,210
If you don't say it,

814
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,489
I'll take this as you like me.

815
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,449
I'll choose you.

816
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,570
I'll pass.

817
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,449
Okay, I'll tell you.

818
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,699
Peng Bo noticed you've been in a bad mood.

819
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,889
He wanted to cheer you up.

820
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,130
So he dragged me

821
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,010
into doing this.

822
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,139
Peng Bo?

823
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,380
Why did he do that?

824
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,860
How do I know that?

825
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,139
Maybe he was too bored.

826
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,210
Or maybe he likes you a lot.

827
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,650
He likes me?

828
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,340
Yes.

829
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,730
He likes you.

830
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:50,770
When he came to me for help,

831
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,540
I asked him,

832
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,050
"Do you like Tang Ping?"

833
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,530
He didn't even think about it

834
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,889
and denied.

835
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,250
Then he doesn't like me.

836
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,610
You don't understand.

837
00:34:58,810 --> 00:34:59,890
Trust me.

838
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,620
Psychologically speaking,

839
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,050
the faster he answers,

840
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,610
the more he tries to hide.

841
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,770
It was the reality

842
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,610
he wouldn't dare to face.

843
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,250
If he likes me,

844
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,490
why he doesn't tell me?

845
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,130
That's...

846
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,650
Self-abashment.

847
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,970
Self-abashment?

848
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,410
Think about it.

849
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,820
You are so beautiful and lovely.

850
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,210
You're a superstar.

851
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,010
He is just

852
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,290
a little doctor at a small hospital.

853
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,250
He wouldn't dare

854
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,450
to admit he likes you.

855
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,020
He was afraid you wouldn't

856
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,730
see him as a friend if you knew this.

857
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,410
Or...

858
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,650
Maybe he couldn't even

859
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,690
be your fan.

860
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,610
That's why he used

861
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,690
this convoluted method

862
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,450
to cheer you up.

863
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:42,730
Is that true?

864
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,290
Why would I lie?

865
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,250
You know very well

866
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:45,970
how he treats you.

867
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,020
Can't you feel it?

868
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,290
Don't thank me.

869
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,450
Take care of yourself.

870
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,650
You did a great job just now.

871
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,650
The director praised you.

872
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,090
Now,

873
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,690
I finally got the courage

874
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,610
to get you some

875
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,770
romance scenes.

876
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,490
Who is he?

877
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,460
He's the one who asked me to give you

878
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,250
half an hour

879
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,490
to relax.

880
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,820
I didn't expect it would work.

881
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,650
He talked to me.

882
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,090
He knows you pretty well.

883
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,890
Of course.

884
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,130
Who is he to you?

885
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,370
He looks handsome.

886
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,370
Have some water.

887
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,970
Set aside the romance dramas.

888
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:51,730
I think

889
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,730
you'd better make a plan now.

890
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,330
Plan it through.

891
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:56,850
If I fell in love

892
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,850
and people found out,

893
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,530
how would you handle the PR crisis?

894
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,970
PR crisis?

895
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,060
Falling in love?

896
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:08,410
Peng Bo.

897
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,660
What are you doing?

898
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,650
Well...

899
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,450
I'm checking on

900
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,930
the shooting site of the crew

901
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,860
to find you something

902
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,850
you can make use of.

903
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,850
Don't worry, Miss Pingping.

904
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,690
I won't disclose anything

905
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,010
about the crew.

906
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,170
I totally trust you.

907
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,450
I made a decision.

908
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,650
I allow you to be my boyfriend.

909
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:33,850
I mean

910
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,170
I allow you to be my boyfriend.

911
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,570
What about Shen Zhuo?

912
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,410
Shen Zhuo?

913
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,210
He is already an adult.

914
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,810
He will treat this matter

915
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,890
rationally.

916
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,250
Don't worry about him.

917
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,650
I'll protect you.

918
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,050
I won't worry.

919
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,420
What's with that attitude?

920
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,770
Didn't you say you liked me?

921
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,570
I do like you.

922
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,700
That's enough.

923
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,730
Give it to me.

924
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,730
I love it.

925
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,290
In a few days,

926
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,130
it's Lu Fangning's birthday.

927
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,850
I want to celebrate her birthday at home

928
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,860
and invite all her friends.

929
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,570
So,

930
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,410
I may need your help.

931
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,170
Are you sure you want to celebrate her birthday?

932
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,890
I believe she has overcome it.

933
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,570
And,

934
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,530
I hope this day

935
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,250
can give her a different meaning.

936
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:47,810
Okay.

937
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,050
Any advice on the matter?

938
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,020
Peng Bo?

939
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,130
Okay. Anything will do.

940
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:00,890
What are you talking about?

941
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,690
Anything is fine?

942
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,810
Can you be serious?

943
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,130
I've sent everything I need

944
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,370
for the birthday party

945
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,770
to your phones.

946
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,850
Take a look.

947
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,850
Never mind.

948
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,400
[Shopping list for Lu Fangning's birthday]

949
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,650
I'll handle the decoration.

950
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,290
Leave the rest to Curly.

951
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:16,930
Do I know you

952
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,610
that well?

953
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,090
Who allowed you to call me "Curly?"

954
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:20,970
Ling Rui,

955
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,780
are you throwing a birthday party

956
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,620
or a wedding?

957
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,890
They are pretty much the same.

958
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,570
It seems like you prepared

959
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,940
a grand present.

960
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,690
Are you going to pack yourself

961
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,700
as the present

962
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,050
for her?

963
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,450
I want to propose to her

964
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,020
at the birthday party.

965
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,540
After all, she did it last time.

966
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,450
This could be

967
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,050
a surprise for her birthday.

968
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,330
You finally got it straight.

969
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,900
It's been years.

970
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,940
I bet she will

971
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,450
cry in your arms.

972
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,500
Why would Fangning cry?

973
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,090
Don't be silly.

974
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,450
Listen to me.

975
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,650
At most,

976
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,090
Fangning would say,

977
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,490
"I'll give you all the money

978
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,970
I earned and will earn

979
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,490
in the past and in the future."

980
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,570
Will she really like it?

981
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,010
Of course.

982
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,410
What are you worrying about?

983
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,530
All women like surprises.

984
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,220
I just once had

985
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,730
a bad experience.

986
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,050
So,

987
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,730
I was a little concerned.

988
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,130
Don't worry.

989
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,490
Trust me.

990
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,770
You don't have to prepare anything.

991
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,050
You need nothing.

992
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,050
Cooperate with me.

993
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,770
Look carefully.

994
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,450
Go straight to her.

995
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,690
Put your arms around her waist.

996
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,570
My waist is not yours to hold.

997
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,300
Listen,

998
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,490
I've hurt my waist before.

999
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,290
If I got hurt,

1000
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,210
I'd go to you at the hospital.

1001
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,300
Don't blame me for your waist.

1002
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:48,940
Okay?

1003
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,180
Sit down and talk.

1004
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,730
-He pushed me.
-Okay, enough.

1005
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,050
Sit down.

1006
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,450
Let's continue.

1007
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,690
Run over to her,

1008
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,690
holding her waist, and say,

1009
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,090
"Fangning,

1010
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,610
marry me.

1011
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,020
Promise me.

1012
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,570
I don't have a second choice."

1013
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,570
Perfect.

1014
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:06,970
Perfect.

1015
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,410
You can surely succeed.

1016
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,450
Come on,

1017
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,380
did you learn this

1018
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:10,970
from online novels?

1019
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,010
You should save this

1020
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,810
for

1021
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,050
when you propose.

1022
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,090
I'll pass.

1023
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,130
If I propose...

1024
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,260
The success rate will be low.

1025
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,130
See?

1026
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,140
You knew it wouldn't work,

1027
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,850
and you asked him to follow your advice.

1028
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,100
Listen, Ling Rui.

1029
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,450
You have to make it lively,

1030
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,180
and romantic.

1031
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:27,970
Have everybody

1032
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,530
witness your wedding together.

1033
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,850
I have an idea.

1034
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,020
Ask all the people who come

1035
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,290
to hold up the same sign

1036
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,570
and shout the same cheer.

1037
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,730
All of them will witness

1038
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,420
your love.

1039
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,940
Isn't that a plot from love novels?

1040
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,490
It's like a fan meeting.

1041
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,930
What's wrong with a fan meeting?

1042
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,690
You know what?

1043
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,530
I tried it, it worked.

1044
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,130
Don't be absurd? Cut it out.

1045
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,330
Hold the sign alone

1046
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:46,810
and waving it

1047
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,930
looks too silly!

1048
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,290
Are you mocking me?

1049
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:49,890
Am I the only fool here?

1050
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,700
It's the 21st century.

1051
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,450
Your bossy style won't work.

1052
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:51,780
What?

1053
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,410
What's wrong?

1054
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,490
-But...
-Look, your suit and tie.

1055
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,210
How dare you come out

1056
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:54,930
wearing like a clown.

1057
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,330
It's fashion.

1058
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,050
-Look at the shirt.
-Okay, okay.

1059
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:57,930
These are casual pants.

1060
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,250
Don't listen to him, listen to me.

1061
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,210
-Ignore him. Mine will work.
-You...

1062
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:00,850
Stay aside.

1063
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:02,700
What are you doing?

1064
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:03,740
Do you want a fight?

1065
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,050
Come on.

1066
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:04,810
I'll break your waist.

1067
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,620
-Bring it on!
-Sit down.
