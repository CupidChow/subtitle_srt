4
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,729
Morning.

5
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,810
Morning.

6
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,000
It seems like it's not early anymore.

7
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,360
To me, you're not late.

8
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,920
I'm leaving. Thank you, Director Lu.

9
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,050
Aargh!

10
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,560
Last night...

11
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,920
I...

12
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,170
We...

13
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,250
We...

14
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,320
We...

15
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,360
We were drunk?

16
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,320
We drank a little too much.

17
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,200
Yes, it was a little too much.

18
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,250
But...

19
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,040
How did we end up at a hotel?

20
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,570
Why do you ask me about this?

21
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,050
How do I know what was going on?

22
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,480
I was drunk anyway.

23
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,690
I don't remember anything after falling asleep.

24
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,040
Anyway...

25
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,090
I fell asleep, too.

26
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,520
Who knows if you

27
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,800
sleepwalked?

28
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:38,970
I...

29
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,240
Lu Yiyao, enough said.

30
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,960
I'm leaving if you still act like this.

31
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,370
I just want to figure out,

32
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,720
did anything happen

33
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,130
between us

34
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,330
last night?

35
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,050
No

36
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,530
or yes?

37
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,720
Don't you know in your heart

38
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,450
if something happened or not?

39
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,450
Lu Yiyao, you...

40
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,240
Lu Yiyao.

41
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,920
If you asked me like this again,

42
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,360
then I wouldn't care about being disgraceful.

43
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,640
I'll tell the whole world

44
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,730
everything that we did.

45
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,810
Let's see if I dare to do so.

46
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,280
As you said, LM Deer Sing Group has indeed

47
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,610
encountered a huge crisis.

48
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,040
But if this hadn't happened,

49
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,970
I'd never have considered

50
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,040
your investment.

51
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,280
Ms. Lu is always so straightforward.

52
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,250
I believe that Mr. Zheng, you would understand

53
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,690
even if I didn't say this out.

54
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,610
You can just regard this as buying

55
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,290
an opportunity to make money with LM Deer Sing Group.

56
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,240
Okay.

57
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,450
I will.

58
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,450
Ms. Lu,

59
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,400
then I'll make a move now.

60
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,480
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

61
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,200
Mr. Zheng, let me show you the way out.

62
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,920
Mr. Zheng.

63
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,880
I hope that I'll have the opportunity

64
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,210
to learn from you.

65
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,720
Of course.

66
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, goodbye.

67
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,360
Hello, everyone!

68
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,600
My darlings.

69
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,080
Today, I'm here

70
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,890
at the LM Deer Sing Home Furnishing Store again.

71
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,409
Let's check out

72
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:41,210
what will be introduced today.

73
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,720
This couch is really...

74
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,640
It's really very comfortable.

75
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,409
It's even more comfortable than the one at my home.

76
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,960
The smell is also very refreshing.

77
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,330
There's no smell of formaldehyde.

78
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,920
Smelling like formaldehyde? That's a lie.

79
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,330
Don't you believe

80
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,440
those online marketing accounts

81
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,320
hyping there.

82
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,520
I think that...

83
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,050
This couch

84
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,850
smells as good as

85
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,840
chocolate.

86
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,840
I love it so much.

87
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,010
What should I do?

88
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,850
Guys,

89
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,930
add it to your cart now, okay?

90
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,650
Such a fool.

91
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,330
I want to take it home.

92
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,280
I love it.

93
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,290
A chocolate-flavored couch.

94
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,360
What kind of description is this?

95
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,850
Isn't she hostile to Ms. Lu?

96
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,330
How come she

97
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,520
speaks in LM Deer Sing Group's favor now?

98
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,840
She's offering help in its hour of need?

99
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,800
This lady is quite interesting.

100
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,450
She looks pretty cute.

101
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,370
Peng Bo.

102
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,090
Help me stop Professor Luo.

103
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,690
Stop him.

104
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,890
Ling Rui.

105
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,350
-Ling Rui.
-Professor, are you looking for me?

106
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,400
[Doctor's office]

107
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,640
Why am I looking for you? Where's Ling Rui?

108
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,320
Ling Rui is not here.

109
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,440
I see.

110
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,530
Don't think that

111
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,600
after avoiding Mr. Luo, you'll be all right.

112
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,440
You've yet to talk

113
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,050
to your wife, right?

114
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,610
Say something, bro.

115
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,730
You're not talking again.

116
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,360
Say something.

117
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,400
What do you think of this report?

118
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,809
Just do it according to

119
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,809
what I told you before.

120
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,330
Didn't I explain to you clearly?

121
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,370
Got it.

122
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,559
Understood.

123
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:43,929
Professor Luo.

124
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,240
You may leave now.

125
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,360
You're here to collect your medicine?

126
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:47,960
Yes.

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
You can just come to me next time.

128
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,210
You're also in charge of the pharmacy now?

129
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:51,960
No.

130
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
I mean that if your son

131
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,280
is too busy to accompany you next time,

132
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,010
I'll take care of you

133
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,530
when you need something.

134
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,840
Don't say this.

135
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,920
How dare I trouble you,

136
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,050
Professor Luo?

137
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,200
You shouldn't have.

138
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,640
I don't know

139
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,610
what Ling Rui

140
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,560
is up to nowadays.

141
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,170
Has he bought a flight ticket?

142
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,570
Has he booked a hotel?

143
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,760
He didn't even tell me

144
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,930
when he'll leave.

145
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,320
Where is he going?

146
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,730
He's going to Germany to further his studies.

147
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,960
He's already got the offer letter.

148
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
Didn't he tell you?

149
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,850
He even got the offer letter?

150
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,480
Ling Rui...

151
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,890
There's nothing here.

152
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,720
What is exactly

153
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,450
all this?

154
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,250
Mom.

155
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,120
Didn't you ask me to come home to cook?

156
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,730
Where are my aunts?

157
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,440
It's none of your business

158
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,520
to care about their whereabouts.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,240
You didn't tell me anything.

160
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,120
Mom.

161
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,600
Let me tell you a piece of good news.

162
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,050
I got an offer letter

163
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,930
from the German Institute.

164
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,650
I...

165
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,370
Does Fangning know about it?

166
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,370
How can I just leave

167
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,760
when LM Deer Sing Group is in this state now?

168
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,080
I don't know how to tell her about this.

169
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,320
What a pity

170
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,010
if you're not going.

171
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,800
Don't worry.

172
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,880
I've asked a friend

173
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,080
to contact the person

174
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,250
who is in charge of this in Germany

175
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,440
to see if it can be

176
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,640
deferred, via

177
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
a video call.

178
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,280
If there's a turnaround for LM Deer Sing Group,

179
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,690
then everything

180
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,570
is going to be fine, right?

181
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,720
I'm not forcing you

182
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,050
to make any decision.

183
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,880
I just want to remind you.

184
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,560
Don't make

185
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,000
Mom.

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,890
a decision that'll make you regret it.

187
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,720
-Mom.
-That's such an incredible opportunity.

188
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,090
Don't worry.

189
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,280
I cherish this opportunity very much.

190
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,400
I won't miss it.

191
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,000
[Done. You can thank me now.]

192
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,450
[Thank you.]

193
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,930
Okay.

194
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Okay.

195
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,130
No problem.

196
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,400
Okay.

197
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,370
I know it.

198
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,040
Thank you.

199
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,960
Goodbye.

200
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,370
There's good news?

201
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,040
Mr. Zheng has already

202
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,840
agreed to invest.

203
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
They'll confirm the details

204
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,000
of the contract with me immediately.

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,770
I want to let Gao Erfan do the follow-up.

206
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,570
We can hold a board meeting

207
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,650
this afternoon.

208
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,210
Do we still need to wait

209
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,520
to sign the contract?

210
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,650
We can't wait any longer.

211
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,840
LM Deer Sing Group will suffer more losses

212
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,090
if we continue waiting.

213
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,290
The LM Deer Sing Group today

214
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,280
can't wait anymore.

215
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,210
Okay.

216
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,280
Simon.

217
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,520
Simon.

218
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Are you okay?

219
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,760
I know that

220
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,680
many things happened in the company of late.

221
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,050
You might be feeling very stressed.

222
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,200
You need to lift your spirits

223
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,440
particularly during this period of time.

224
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,410
Keep it up.

225
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,800
Keep it up.

226
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,490
Convening a board meeting?

227
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,400
Why are we having

228
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,080
the meeting now?

229
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,320
It's better to make things clear

230
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,690
by holding a press conference.

231
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,240
They should hurry up

232
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,800
and deny LM Deer Sing Group's responsibility for that.

233
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,400
Mr. Li.

234
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,840
Mr. Yang, let me answer the call.

235
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,810
You go in first.

236
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,770
Hello.

237
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,530
Okay, I got it.

238
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,550
[LM Deer Sing Group]

239
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,610
Did I hear it right, Fangning?

240
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,640
You mean that

241
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,970
LM Deer Sing Group will compensate for

242
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,050
all those unqualified products,

243
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,080
even for those that

244
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,240
we're not sure if there's any problem?

245
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,130
As long as any customer requests a refund,

246
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,480
LM Deer Sing Group will agree?

247
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:22,920
Yes.

248
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,960
Don't you think you did too much

249
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,410
for the public relations crisis?

250
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,050
These are the problems

251
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,400
of the brands which were brought into LM Deer Sing Store.

252
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,680
Why does LM Deer Sing Group need to be held responsible

253
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,650
for all the losses?

254
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,200
Right?

255
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,270
Yes.

256
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,530
-Yes, it's unreasonable.
-Yes.

257
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,360
Why should we be held responsible for the refunds?

258
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,120
Every board director here

259
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,920
has been with LM Deer Sing Group for so long.

260
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,840
You know for sure that

261
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,120
the problems are with the brands,

262
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
but not us.

263
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,640
But customers

264
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,570
won't think so.

265
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,810
They'll just think that

266
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,120
LM Deer Sing Home Furnishing Store

267
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,640
can't even guarantee

268
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,840
the quality of its products

269
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,960
although it keeps boasting that they're eco-friendly.

270
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,930
If we can't win

271
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,930
our consumers back,

272
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,170
they'll never

273
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,560
step into LM Deer Sing Store again.

274
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,880
It'll also bring

275
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,770
a very serious impact

276
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,010
to our own brands.

277
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,560
I understand what you mean.

278
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,640
But isn't it too extreme

279
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,120
to handle it in your way?

280
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,930
It's way too extreme.

281
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,290
I know, and I understand.

282
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,610
But regaining consumers' trust

283
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,480
is essentially an

284
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,730
insurmountable challenge.

285
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,920
Everybody,

286
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,930
LM Deer Sing Group's stock price has been plummeting

287
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,240
since yesterday.

288
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,250
If we don't adopt an extreme method

289
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,290
immediately

290
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,770
to regain LM Deer Sing Group's credibility,

291
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,770
everything will be too late

292
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,760
when the stock price

293
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,690
has bottomed.

294
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,650
It can't drop anymore.

295
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,800
I

296
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,010
just have one question.

297
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,690
The refunds that we are paying

298
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,250
on behalf of the factories

299
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,640
are a massive amount of money.

300
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,760
May I ask,

301
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,800
where does the money come from?

302
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,260
If you want to use

303
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,710
LM Deer Sing Group's circulating capital

304
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,660
to fill the void,

305
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,240
then how are we going

306
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,130
to keep LM Deer Sing Group running in the future?

307
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,960
I still remember that recently,

308
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,660
our company has a bank loan

309
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,570
which needs to be repaid.

310
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,050
I have calculated.

311
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,990
The projects that are currently

312
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,640
run by our company

313
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,540
won't be

314
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,650
affected at all.

315
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,130
As for the bank loan,

316
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,450
I've found

317
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,400
a new investor.

318
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,450
Is it?

319
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,840
Is it reliable?

320
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,400
Fangning,

321
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,840
if your investment doesn't work,

322
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,120
then just let it be.

323
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,770
I happen to have a few investors here

324
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,120
who have always wanted to invest in LM Deer Sing Group.

325
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,050
You can discuss

326
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,800
this with them right away.

327
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,450
I've also contacted the brands' manufacturers.

328
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,290
They're willing to

329
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,200
make refunds for

330
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,240
the defective products.

331
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,920
They're also in favor

332
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,400
of our payment plan.

333
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,880
As long as they have enough

334
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,050
funds to make the refunds,

335
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,930
LM Deer Sing Group's advance payment

336
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:47,970
can be recollected.

337
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,690
Everyone,

338
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,890
now is the critical moment

339
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,170
to rebuild LM Deer Sing Group's reputation.

340
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,330
We want everyone to understand that

341
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,840
LM Deer Sing Group

342
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,400
doesn't care about the gains nor losses at a particular period of time

343
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,720
because LM Deer Sing Group

344
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,170
will definitely sustain

345
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,440
and grow for good.

346
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,720
-It makes sense.
-What he said makes sense.

347
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,560
Yes.

348
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,840
I agree with General Manager Lu's suggestion.

349
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,450
Since Ms. Lu

350
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,450
has already given her assurance,

351
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,080
then

352

I don't have any questions now.

353
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,930
I support Lu Fangning's decision.

I stand by her.

That's the only way.

The strategy of making refunds

has already had an effect.

376
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,630
Public opinion is slowly in favor of LM Deer Sing Group.

377
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,650
The customer flow at LM Deer Sing Store

378
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,700
has also gradually increased.

379

The first challenge has been overcome.

380
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,109
As we expected,

381
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,500
the cash flow for refunds

382
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,550

to LM Deer Sing Group.

384
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,980
Three days later,

385
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,030
there's a bank loan

386
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,869
that needs to be repaid.

387
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,099
So,

388
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,990
how is it for Mr. Zheng's investment now?

389
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,380
The details of the contract have been finalized.

390
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,520
It can be signed right away.

391
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,270
I think that

392
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,780
there shouldn't be a problem.

393
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,790
Okay.

is very important to us.

396

You need to be more careful.

397
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,200
I always feel that the occurrence

398

of these two issues regarding the quality of our products

399

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,660
My name

521
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,010
is Gao Erfan.

522
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,170
It seems that

523
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,020
Ms. Lu is used to taking this seat.

524
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,540
You still don't want to leave, do you?

525
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,730
You know what?

526
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,670
This is how it's like, getting betrayed

527
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,090
by someone you trusted, Ms. Lu.

528
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,660
But this is not necessarily

529
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,410
a bad thing.

530
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,290
After all,

531
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,810
most people

532
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,650
will look back on their lives

533
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,750
and figure out what they actually did wrong

534
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,320
to be in such a state now.

535
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,670
I just want you

536
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,520
to pay the price

537
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,070
for your sin.

538
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,390
You know Lu Yue.

539
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,380
Those postcards

540
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,810
were sent by you all these years.

541
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,710
Ms. Lu, this is my

542
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,680
annual leave application form.

543
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,830
You're so steadfast

544
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,350
in your plan to travel the world.

545
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,650
Yes.

546
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,380
How could I not know Lu Yue?

547
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,320
We had a really close relationship.

548
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,840
If she was not dead,

549
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,290
we would get married

550
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,020
and have children,

551
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,410
traveling around the world,

552
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,840
to wherever she wanted to go.

553
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,520
If it wasn't because of you,

554
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,960
ten years ago,

555
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,010
I wouldn't be cooling my heels

556
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,410
just for a piece of bad news about her.

557
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,240
Fangning.

558
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,430
[Gao Erfan calling]

559
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,910
Do you know how I lived my life

560
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,670
during all these years?

561
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,220
Lu Fangning, you don't.

562
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,740
I know.

563
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,600
I won't forget about it

564
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,360
for my whole life.

565
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,490
So

566
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,890
I want you to remember this forever.

567
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,120
Your birthday is her death day.

568
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,040
And you

569
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,790
are the murderer who killed her.

570
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,680
I didn't kill her.

571
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,070
Yes.

572
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,040
You just wanted her

573
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,390
to celebrate your birthday with you.

574
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,350
But if you didn't

575
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,320
ask her to go back...

576
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,410
You tell me.

577
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,860
Why would she die?

578
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,910
You should be

579
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,680
feeling guilty

580
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,850
and agonized over her death forever.

581
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,740
And bearing in mind at all times

582
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,210
that you killed her.

583
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,290
If it wasn't because

584
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,490
of your selfishness and naivety,

585
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,830
we'd have lived

586
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,650
our own lives

587
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,680
a long time ago.

588
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,940
But now...

589
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,260
You thought you founded

590
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,270
Infinity

591
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,400
and that was an act of atonement?

592
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,330
Listen, you don't deserve to do so.

593
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,230
You

594
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,240
don't deserve

595
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,540
to fulfill Lu Yue's wish for her.

596
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,000
So

597
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,740
you came to LM Deer Sing Group three years ago

598
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,050
and applied to be my assistant

599
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,740
just for all of this today,

600
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,700
right?

601
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,460
Yes.

602
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,980
I took

603
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,040
three years

604
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,920
to stay by your side

605
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,220
and made this happen.

606
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,770
If you didn't insist

607
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,530
on establishing Infinity,

608
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,450
perhaps I wouldn't

609
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,090
get this opportunity so soon.

610
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,570
The more you wanted

611
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,490
to build Infinity,

612
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,050
the more you'd eager for instant success.

613
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,350
Then it'd make LM Deer Sing Group

614
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,780
more vulnerable.

615
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,960
So anyway,

616
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,050
I had to make sure your plan

617
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,230
was rolled out smoothly,

618
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,410
then used it

619
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,070
to drag down LM Deer Sing Group.

620
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,670
In the beginning,

621
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,760
there'll indeed be some

622
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,810
cash flow pressure,

623
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,740
but after the first batch

624
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,410
of products is launched,

625
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,920
this issue will be alleviated soon.

626
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,140
A few cash flow problems

627
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,650
have also happened before,

628
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,160
but Ms. Lu resolved them smoothly.

629
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,340
Not to mention that

630
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,980
Ms. Lu is here now.

631
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,990
I don't think we need

632
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,080
to worry too much.

633
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,550
Mr. Zheng.

634
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,190
I hope that I'll have the opportunity

635
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,540
to learn from you.

636
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,620
So you've done all of this?

637
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,790
Yes.

638
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,870
Even Mr. Li's

639
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,210
approval of your

640
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,060
compensation agreement

641
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,330
was also instigated by me.

642
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,340
I also didn't expect that everything

643
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,730
would go so smoothly.

644
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,250
Do you know it? Lu Fangning.

645
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:26,930
If you insisted

646
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:27,980
on letting those manufacturers

647
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,580
to pay for the refunds as a compensation,

648
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,890
LM Deer Sing Group might still have a bit of a chance

649
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,660
to survive and won't collapse in such a short time.

650
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,350
You were so selfish before

651
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,990
and would never take risks

652
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,380
all by yourself.

653
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,900
So what changed you?

654
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,110
I think it's Dr. Ling.

655
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,850
If that's the case,

656
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,200
then I have to thank him.

657
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,790
After all, he changed you,

658
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,890
and that gave me such a good opportunity.

659
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,700
Unfortunately,

660
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,340
I'm afraid you wouldn't want

661
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,730
to thank him as I do.

662
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,950
I actually hesitated before.

663
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,980
It was just that Fangyu's incident

664
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,940
proved to me again that

665
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,340
your family

666
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,440
isn't worthy

667
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,780
of my sympathy.

668
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
So?

669
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,100
You're now

670
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,740
LM Deer Sing Group's largest shareholder.

671
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,340
What do you want to do next?

672
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,770
What do I want to do?

673
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,630
The person I love the most in my life

674
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,700
was ruined by you.

675
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,340
Then similarly,

676
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,580
I'll ruin

677
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,630
you and LM Deer Sing Group

678
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,200
all together.

679
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,300
All.

680
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,880
Hello, Ling.

681
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,690
Hi, Professor.

682
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,920
Nice to meet you. All right.

683
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,930
Let's start now.

684
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,860
Okay.

685
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,410
The first thing

686
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,960
I'd like to start

687
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,270
is looking at your research direction.

688
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,140
I've been conducting a medical study

689
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,100
on the

690
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,700
early drainage tube

691
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,720
removed after Whipple

692
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,860
for pancreatic cancer.

693
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,020
That's a good consideration.

694
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,630
We performed at our operation last week.

695
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,400
The patient had a recurrence of a pancreatic cancer

696
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,380
two years after surgery.

697
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,280
So what we did is...

698
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,960
Excuse me, sorry.

699
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,470
Ling Rui.

700
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,020
Fangning.

701
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,920
Sorry, Professor.

702
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,690
Hello?

703
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,260
What happened just over there?

704
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,810
I don't know.

705
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,970
[LM Deer Sing Group]

706
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,070
Drink some water.

707
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,800
Thank you.

708
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,440
Is it really Mr. Gao?

709
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,760
Yes.

710
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,659
He was my sister's

711
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:24,710
boyfriend.

712
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,030
He wanted

713
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,010
to avenge my sister, so...

714
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,040
At least

715
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,929
there's someone in this world

716
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,730
who misses Lu Yue

717
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,460
so much, just like you.

718
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,400
Do you think that

719
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,340
my sister would be happy

720
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,230
if she knew it?

721
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,540
No.

722
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,820
No matter how much

723
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,250
she hated her family,

724
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,980
she wouldn't want it to disappear completely.

725
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,740
Not to mention that

726
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,840
you're still here.

727
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,340
All of this

728
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,480
is Gao Erfan's own decision.

729
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,910
It has nothing to do with Lu Yue.

730
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,610
You need to defeat him

731
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,540
and win LM Deer Sing Group back.

732
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,550
You must show him absolutely no mercy.

733
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,100
Fangning.

734
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,160
You've been doing very well.

735
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,980
I'll always be by your side.

736
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,470
Hello, Ling Rui.

737
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,110
What's the matter?

738
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,370
Why did you run away just now?

739
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,080
I'm sorry.

740
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,610
I can't make it.
