00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,700
It's this time again.

177
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,620
But it's okay.

178
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,820
Fangning will accompany you this time.

179
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,460
You can't stay there forever.

180
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,540
So both of you are also going

181
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,300
on a honeymoon?

182
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,420
What honeymoon?

183
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,660
What?

184
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,380
Take care of yourself.

185
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,580
Control yourself.

186
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,660
Don't go too far.

187
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,300
We're just going home to visit our relatives.

188
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,780
We won't have to do farm work.

189
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,500
Why should I take care of myself?

190
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,380
I will be on a holiday.

191
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,300
Kind of. I'm still working there anyways.

192
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,340
But you should work overtime as always.

193
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,780
Never be too kind to yourself.

194
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,900
Yes, Ms. Lu.

195
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,420
Don't be too kind to me too.

196
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,580
Call me if there's an emergency.

197
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,180
Unless it's at night.

198
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,820
I wonder if Ling Rui

199
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,940
likes the clothes Cai Siyu prepared

200
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,060
for me this time.

201
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,450
I don't care. I'll just change a style.

202
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,660
Which pajamas should I take?

203
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,060
This one is good.

204
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,460
No, no.

205
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,300
What am I thinking?

206
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,780
It's a serious business trip.

207
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,140
You…

208
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:47,940
Would you like some water?

209
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,180
No, thanks.

210
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,660
You've packed up your things?

211
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,300
Yes.

212
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,120
I quite look forward to it.

213
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,260
Me too.

214
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,900
Actually some things are not necessary.

215
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,420
The necessities are prepared well already there.

216
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,380
I've prepared the necessities well.

217
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,500
Me too.

218
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,830
-Let's go to sleep.
-Turn the light off.

219
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,140
I mean.

220
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,100
-It's time.
-Yeah.

221
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,220
It's late now.

222
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,300
Yeah, yeah.

223
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,380
I said it too simply just now.

224
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,220
Have… Have an early rest.

225
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,900
-Good night.
-Good night.

226
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,780
See you tomorrow.

227
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,510
See you tomorrow.

228
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,770
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

229
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,100
Ling Rui.

230
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,020
Is this your hometown?

231
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:08,740
Yes.

232
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,380
Good.

233
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,550
Golden rice field.

234
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,460
Golden waves of barley.

235
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,900
Oh, rice fields.

236
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,630
They are not in season yet.

237
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,700
It doesn't matter.

238
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,580
It looks good this way, too.

239
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,420
Beautiful.

240
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,830
Well.

241
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,620
How about this?

242
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,940
Yes.

243
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,700
Where?

244
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,310
Here.

245
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,700
The color might have been edited.

246
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,430
But you can see the flowers.

247
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,380
You see here, and here.

248
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,390
The flowers look nice.

249
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,830
It's okay. It's okay.

250
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,580
We're not here

251
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,510
for sightseeing anyway.

252
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,820
We can photoshop the pictures anyway.

253
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,940
All right. Let's go.

254
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,660
But,

255
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,450
we seem to have got off the bus early.

256
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,290
Right.

257
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,500
We got off one stop earlier.

258
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,670
Let's wait for the next bus then.

259
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,900
There are only two scheduled buses here.

260
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,780
That was the last scheduled bus.

261
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,140
I'll call a taxi.

262
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,390
You can't get a taxi here.

263
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,620
But it's fine.

264
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,180
We can take a

265
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,230
free ride from the villagers.

266
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,380
Free ride.

267
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,910
That's nice.

268
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,860
I've never taken a

269
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,830
free ride in my life.

270
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,270
That's good.

271
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,780
Sir.

272
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,460
Yeah.

273
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,740
Can you give us a free ride?

274
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,060
Our destination is the village ahead.

275
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,070
All right, no problem.

276
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,070
Okay.

277
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,820
Sir.

278
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,790
Can you

279
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,070
put those two

280
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,460
down first?

281
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,990
What?

282
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,220
The two cuties.

283
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,390
The two sheep.

284
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,470
How about this?

285
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,950
I'll buy them, but I won't take them.

286
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,070
So you can tie them to the roadside.

287
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,740
And you can

288
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,820
pick them up later.

289
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,830
Are you insane?

290
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,670
You can name a price.

291
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,110
Double or triple is all fine.

292
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,260
No way. No way.

293
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,340
I won't take you.

294
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,180
You can walk there.

295
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,190
Go ahead. Go ahead.

296
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,460
It's okay, we can wait.

297
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,430
But Ling Rui,

298
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,710
we've been waiting for so long.

299
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,460
Ling Rui?

300
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,580
Are you Dr. Ling?

301
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,750
Yeah, that's me.

302
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,300
You know me?

303
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,310
Of course.

304
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,510
Come on, get on.

305
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,730
I'll put the goats down.

306
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,540
There is no need.

307
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,910
I'm sorry for what I said.

308
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,140
We'll sit here together.

309
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,110
Come on, get on.

310
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,390
-So cute.
-Let's go.

311
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,380
Are you okay?

312
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,910
Sit still, Dr. Ling.

313
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,620
Okay.

314
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,530
Let's go.

315
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,190
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

316
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,570
Little White.

317
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,350
So cute.

318
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,180
You're so cute.

319
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,020
Hello.

320
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:05,910
Are you scared?

321
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,980
They seem to be more scared than I am.

322
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,460
It's okay.

323
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,500
You can touch them, here.

324
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,310
Be good, be good.

325
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:15,830
They are very gentle.

326
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,270
You can try it.

327
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,620
Why don't you feed it with this?

328
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,350
Little White.

329
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,500
Be good.

330
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,550
It's eating.

331
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,420
Here you are, Little Black.

332
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,540
Let's take a picture.

333
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:41,980
Okay.

334
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:52,750
Here we are.

335
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:53,540
You first.

336
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,230
Okay.

337
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:55,750
Be careful.

338
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,590
Watch out.

339
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,670
Thank you, sir.

340
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,780
It's okay.

341
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,060
Let me take it.

342
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:01,940
Dr. Ling.

343
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,780
We'll take our leave then.

344
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,260
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

345
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,990
You're welcome.

346
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,180
I'll come to visit you in my spare time.

347
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,810
All right.

348
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,050
Take care, bye-bye.

349
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,819
You're welcome. You're welcome.

350
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,510
Bye-bye, Little Black and Little White.

351
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:12,710
Go ahead.

352
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,020
How are you feeling?

353
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,290
I'm fine.

354
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,099
So,

355
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,910
we're officially in your hometown now?

356
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:24,579
Yes.

357
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,230
But it looks as if

358
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,310
it's going to rain.

359
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,550
Never mind.

360
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,790
There is always sunny rain here.

361
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,430
Okay.

362
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,710
Let's go.

363
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:50,860
Careful.

364
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,070
Hello, is there anyone?

365
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,870
We want to stay here.

366
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,630
How many of you?

367
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,910
We have a booking.

368
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,860
Two rooms.

369
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,750
I want the best

370
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,590
rooms here.

371
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,340
Your suites.

372
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,620
There are not many rooms left.

373
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,900
Only a double room.

374
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,550
Don't look at him.

375
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,500
All couples live in one room here.

376
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,470
We started this year.

377
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,590
There wouldn't be a hotel for you

378
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,870
if you came earlier.

379
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,710
Let's go.

380
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,150
How about taking a look first?

381
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,140
This way.

382
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,710
Mediterranean Pastoral Suite.

383
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,230
Take a look.

384
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,510
Beautiful, isn't it? This is the best.

385
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,550
The sofa.

386
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,950
Pretty, isn't it?

387
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,030
The furniture here

388
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,980
was picked by me.

389
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,030
It's pirated.

390
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,980
What?

391
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,950
My mom bought them from a big supermarket.

392
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,030
It's expensive!

393
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,150
It's just some furniture, okay?

394
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,110
So meddlesome.

395
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,910
I'm not being meddlesome.

396
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,310
This is

397
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,150
the Inspiration Series

398
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,870
imported by our shopping mall in 2018.

399
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,790
I'll not tell you

400
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,710
the product number.

401
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,310
You won't understand anyway.

402
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,830
Little girl, where did you buy the sofa?

403
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,070
Tell me the address.

404
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,670
I'll go sue them.

405
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,430
Why are you so troublesome?

406
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,390
You're finding faults with me.

407
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,470
You want a discount?

408
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,150
We don't do that here.

409
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,830
You can leave if you're not satisfied.

410
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,630
Little girl.

411
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,190
She does not mean that.

412
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,590
You must be scared.

413
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,950
There is only one hotel here.

414
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,150
You'll have to sleep on the street if you don't like it here.

415
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,270
You rascal!

416
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,310
Why are you here?

417
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,350
I told you to stay at the counter.

418
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,470
What if Dr. Ling comes

419
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,790
and can't see us?

420
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,830
Sister Gu.

421
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,870
Ling Rui?

422
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,300
Why didn't you tell me

423
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,190
so I could go pick you up?

424
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,150
It's okay.

425
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,350
Come here.

426
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,150
You are Brother Ling Rui?

427
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,990
She must be Xiaoying.

428
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,590
Yes.

429
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,670
You were so little the last time I saw you.

430
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,230
Now you've grown so tall.

431
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,270
Brother Ling Rui.

432
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,550
I'll have the senior high school entrance exam next year.

433
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,950
Please enlighten my brain.

434
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,030
No way,

435
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,210
he is mine.

436
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,070
Who are you?

437
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,910
How can you be so rude?

438
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,950
Stay here.

439
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,590
Ling Rui, this is?

440
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,290
This is my wife.

441
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,390
Lu Fangning.

442
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,910
You bring your wife here?

443
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,750
Good, good.

444
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,870
Mrs. Ling.

445
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,080
If you don't like

446
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,830
the room,

447
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,870
I can change it for you.

448
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,440
And this, pirated.

449
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,310
I'm so embarrassed. I'll change it tomorrow.

450
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,630
I'll give you a new one.

451
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,990
Ling Rui, come to see this room.

452
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,870
Okay.

453
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,150
Knowing you're coming back,

454
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,710
I've prepared

455
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,990
the biggest room for you.

456
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,550
The bedsheet

457
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,670
and the quilt cover are new.

458
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,190
Thanks, Sister Gu.

459
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,550
Mrs. Ling, are you satisfied?

460
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,390
I'm quite satisfied.

461
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,190
Thanks, Sister Gu and Xiaoying.

462
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,350
That's great.

463
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,870
You can take a rest here.

464
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,310
We'll not bother you then.

465
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,990
-Okay.
-Thank you.

466
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,000
-Okay.
-Um…

467
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,630
Brother Ling Rui, enlighten me.

468
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,880
Let's go.

469
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,670
What's wrong?

470
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,550
I'm wondering

471
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,120
what magic you've

472
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,310
cast on to the people here,

473
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,070
making them so

474
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,720
obsessed with you?

475
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,190
Aren't you tired after a day of the ride?

476
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,070
No.

477
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,000
It's nice to see

478
00:21:59,310 --> 00:21:59,870
your childhood hometown.

479
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,390
This is actually

480
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,310
a normal town here.

481
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,550
Less prosperity and buzz

482
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,430
compared with big cities.

483
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,990
But every time

484
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,870
I come back,

485
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,470
I gain inner peace.

486
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,200
It's quite comfortable here.

487
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,670
-What are they selling?
-Crabs.

488
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,910
Miss, take a look at the crabs.

489
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,880
How about we buy some

490
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,750
for dinner tonight?

491
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,560
-Okay.
-Dr. Ling.

492
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,790
You don't have to buy.

493
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:24,870
I'll send you

494
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,920
some cooked ones tonight.

495
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,830
You live in Sister Gu's hotel, right?

496
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,880
It's okay, we can buy them ourselves.

497
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,190
No, I insist.

498
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,670
Just go.

499
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,470
Go have fun.

500
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,400
I'll send them to you tonight.

501
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,030
Thank you.

502
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,750
Never mind.

503
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,390
All right, you two go have fun.

504
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,200
Careful, Dr. Ling.

505
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,040
All right, thank you.

506
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,750
You're welcome.

507
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,670
You're such an idol here.

508
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,520
How can you be so adorable?

509
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,350
I just can't believe it.

510
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,120
What?

511
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,800
Let me have a try.

512
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,230
Ling Rui. I'm thirsty.

513
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,110
Dr. Ling.

514
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,080
Have some water.

515
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,390
Here you are. The water.

516
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,350
Uncle Liu.

517
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,190
It's okay.

518
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,110
We can buy it.

519
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,950
Hold this. Hold this.

520
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,070
Your wife is so pretty.

521
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,840
I need just one bottle.

522
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,550
Thank you, thank you.

523
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,750
Take it.

524
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,870
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

525
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,230
It's nothing.

526
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,550
Bye-bye.

527
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,150
Everyone here

528
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,750
looks up to you.

529
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,200
I don't believe that.

530
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,950
Will dogs even listen to you here?

531
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,710
-A dog!
-It's okay.

532
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,440
Dog!

533
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,390
Don't be afraid.

534
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,070
-It's okay, it's okay. Don't be scared.
-It's coming

535
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,150
It's coming, it's coming.

536
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,230
It's okay.

537
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,310
It's coming, it's coming.

538
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,670
Sit down, sit down.

539
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,150
It's quite good. Are you going to come down?

540
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:37,990
No.

541
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,560
Then let's go.

542
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,270
Ling Rui, you're back?

543
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,670
Hello.

544
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,030
Hello.

545
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,310
-You're back?
-Yes.

546
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,950
I'm back.

547
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,160
-Ling Rui.
-Hello, Sister Zhang.

548
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,440
-Ling Rui, you're back.
-Hi, Uncle Zhou.

549
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,930
Hello, Uncle Zhou.

550
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,450
Do you want sugar-coated haws?

551
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,350
You want sugar-coated haws?

552
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,830
No, no.

553
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:54,910
Ling Rui is back.

554
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,550
Hello, hello.

555
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,310
Your wife is pretty.

556
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,280
Hello, Dr. Ling.

557
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,830
Hello, hello.

558
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,290
[Flower Room]

559
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,910
Are you going to take a rest?

560
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,990
I'll go to see

561
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,950
if there is anything to eat.

562
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,640
No.

563
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,080
Be good.

564
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,520
No way.

565
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,670
Be good.

566
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,390
I won't.

567
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,520
All right, you must first tell me

568
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,110
what the heck

569
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,390
have you done here?

570
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,920
Why is everyone

571
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,760
treating you so well?

572
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,910
They probably want to carry you up

573
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,520
and parade through the town.

574
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,720
Why are you smiling?

575
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,830
Before this, someone would send me

576
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,030
whatever I need.

577
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,110
Now it's just one question

578
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,280
and there's no answer?

579
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,000
Let me tell you.

580
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,550
Someone really came.

581
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,630
You can ask her.

582
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,640
All right.

583
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,190
I'm leaving.

584
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:54,640
Okay.

585
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,030
Smell good?

586
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,280
Are they for me?

587
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,870
No.

588
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,750
All right, go ahead.

589
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,910
But after I tell you,

590
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,320
you should do me

591
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,310
a little favor.

592
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,230
You're even asking for something.

593
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,710
Sure.

594
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,230
Brother Ling Rui

595
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,720
was the first provincial top scholar

596
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,840
from our town.

597
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,590
My teachers always say

598
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,110
he is the pride of the town,

599
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,390
and an unprecedented

600
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,550
genius.

601
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,360
Yes.

602
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,430
That is true.

603
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,080
And,

604
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,870
Brother Ling Rui is extremely filial.

605
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,080
I heard that brother Ling Rui's mother,

606
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,150
Aunt Zhu,

607
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,560
once had depression.

608
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,750
It was brother Ling Rui

609
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,720
who took care of her.

610
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,790
But he still was able

611
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,200
to become the top scholar in the province.

612
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,160
Depression?

613
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,000
Yes.

614
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,750
He contacted a big hospital

615
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,710
and established a medical station in the town.

616
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,480
He helped many people cure their diseases.

617
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,680
And,

618
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,560
he comes here every year

619
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,590
to see the sick.

620
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,790
He is so awesome.

621
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,310
He indeed is.

622
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:57,790
I'm done.

623
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,630
Are you helping me or not?

624
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,280
Say it. What do you want?

625
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,440
Writing your homework is not okay.

626
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,080
Help me to secretly take

627
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,960
Brother Ling Rui's favorite thing

628
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,080
for me.

629
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,880
Maybe a pencil case

630
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,310
or a book.

631
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,910
I'll take it as my lucky charm.

632
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,990
I just might be in the top three

633
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,000
in next year's senior high school

634
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,960
entrance exam.

635
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,840
Usually,

636
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,190
I'm a clean freak.

637
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,480
But, show me your hand.

638
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,150
Brother Ling Rui likes

639
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,840
me the most.

640
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,110
No.

641
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:33,600
Wait.

642
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,200
Hey!

643
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,760
I don't want your hand.

644
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:37,710
Love you.

645
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,240
Well…

646
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,720
Ling Rui, if you feel

647
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,910
uncomfortable this way.

648
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,430
I'll go to another room.

649
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,150
It's okay.

650
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,830
It's fine.

651
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,280
We've been on a trip the whole day.

652
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,560
Very tired.

653
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,160
I have to go to the health center

654
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,470
tomorrow morning.

655
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,560
Why don't I sleep first?

656
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,040
Okay.

657
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,630
Good night.

658
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,000
Good night.

659
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,040
Um…

660
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,600
Ling Rui.

661
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,360
Yes.

662
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,040
Are you really tired?

663
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,280
Actually…

664
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,510
I'm not that tired.

665
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,840
Me either.

666
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,400
Then…

667
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,800
How about we go ahead

668
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,000
and get prepared?

669
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,080
Prepare what?

670
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,240
Scented candle?

671
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,150
I didn't bring that.

672
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,240
Wine?

673
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,360
No wine.

674
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,680
How come I didn't prepare anything?

675
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,520
Actually,

676
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,800
there are somethings

677
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,560
we don't have to prepare for.

678
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,000
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

679
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,080
Let me check it out.

680
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,880
Coming.

681
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,160
Who is it?

682
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,830
Surprise.

683
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,640
Dr. Ling.

684
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,320
Why is she here?

685
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,400
Why is she here?

686
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,040
Yeah, why is she here?

687
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,720
Why?

688
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,000
Why is the insane woman

689
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,960
Tang Ping here?

690
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,960
How did she get here?

691
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,640
How did she know

692
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,400
we're here?

693
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:39,800
It might be…

694
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,360
Fate.

695
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,280
Why am I hearing her voice?

696
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,000
She… she is.

697
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,200
She is in the room next door.

698
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,680
Because of the poor sound insulation.

699
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,280
So she heard

700
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,120
everything that we said?

701
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,960
Lu Fangning,

702
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,200
the sound insulation is so bad.

703
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,440
I can hear clearly

704
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,080
whatever you do.

705
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,880
I'm changing my room.

706
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,040
Me too then.

707
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,800
I'll go to another hotel.

708
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,260
I've looked it up.

709
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,930
This is the only hotel in the town.

710
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,490
Fangning,

711
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,960
let's forget about it today.

712
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,960
No way, we can't.

713
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Now that she's here today,

714
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,280
who knows what tricks

715
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,160
she will play tomorrow.

716
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,930
But,

717
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,960
there is no but.

718
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,940
Ling Rui, look at me.

719
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,320
♫ The vengeance of hell ♫

720
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,960
♫ boils in my heart. ♫

721
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,360
♫ The flame of ♫

722
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,050
♫ death and despair ♫

723
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,970
♫ surrounds me ♫

724
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,560
♫ If you do not ♫

725
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,800
♫ kill Sarastro to avenge me ♫

726
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,480
♫ kill Sarastro to avenge me ♫

727
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,290
Fangning,

728
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,640
we don't have to force ourselves tonight.

729
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,680
♫ Disowned may you be forever ♫

730
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,410
♫ Abandoned may you be forever ♫

731
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,120
Morning.

732
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,560
Darling.

733
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,640
Eat more this morning, all right?

734
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,210
Where should we go shopping today?

735
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,570
I'm going too.

736
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:13,340
[Nanshanzhen Activity Center]

737
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,130
Tang Ping.

738
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,969
You'd better not

739
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,520
waste your time here.

740
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,850
Ling Rui will only

741
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,570
love me forever and ever.

742
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,600
What I care about is

743
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,190
my future

744
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,040
with Dr. Ling.

745
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,639
Now, I just need to assure

746
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,230
you two won't

747
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,880
do something bad.

748
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,920
Ms. Tang,

749
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,840
I remember that I

750
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,440
made it clear to you…

751
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,150
I'm sorry.

752
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:29,960
Keep your mouth shut now.

753
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,560
That's right.

754
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,630
I'll take care of this.

755
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,520
Tang Ping.

756
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,010
Do you still remember

757
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,850
Wei, Fanfan,

758
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,120
Han, Liangliang

759
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
and Dingding.

760
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,800
You've always been

761
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,710
defeated by me

762
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,050
for all these years.

763
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,600
How dare you mention them!

764
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,200
Lu Fangning, you bad girl!

765
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,410
Wait and see.

766
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,690
I'll make you suffer

767
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:06,610
tonight.

768
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,520
Pingping, let me explain.

769
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,120
Don't come closer.

770
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,600
You accepted my gift.

771
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,080
I'm just too fond of you.

772
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,490
And you said in your live streams

773
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,730
that you want people to follow you more

774
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,280
and like you more.

775
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,890
I don't mean it like that.

776
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,400
No.

777
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,170
Let's take a picture then.

778
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,480
Or I can take a picture of you.

779
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,730
Stop following me.

780
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,610
I'll call the police if you come closer.

781
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,440
Pingping.

782
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,960
Then see you next time.

783
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,440
What should I do?

784
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,200
Tell my dad?

785
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,730
No.

786
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,210
My dad is going to kill him.

787
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,130
This one.

788
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,650
This one is just a freeloader!

789
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,170
And this one?

790
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,490
This one only knows who to lick my shoes!

791
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,050
Shall I go to Lu Fangning for help?

792
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,120
What's wrong?

793
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,480
Why are you shouting here?

794
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,760
Because you will only scold me.

795
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,330
What are you saying?

796
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,040
What's wrong?

797
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,130
I…

798
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,920
That means,

799
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,200
you don't know his name,

800
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,290
contact way

801
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,760
and any useful information?

802
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,330
No.

803
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,010
How about his picture,

804
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:42,920
video, or voice recording?

805
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,600
No.

806
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,130
How about your brain? Do you have a brain?

807
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,520
No.

808
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,370
I really thought he was my fan.

809
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,360
Fan?

810
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,200
What kind of fan is he?

811
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,650
Shows up in front of you again and again

812
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,560
and waits at your door.

813
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,450
He's not a fan.

814
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,000
He's a freak.

815
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,610
A stalker, you know that?

816
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,930
What do you practice in

817
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,730
the judo gym normally?

818
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,410
You only know how to take pictures.

819
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,410
See?

820
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,730
You can't beat him now.

821
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,730
And you can't outrun him.

822
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,680
You don't even have a brain.

823
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,290
Stop it.

824
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,010
I'm already scared.

825
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,090
What should I do now?

826
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,970
I can only ask you for help

827
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,850
after thinking about it again and again.

828
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,760
Lu Fangning,

829
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,250
help me.

830
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,200
I'm done.

831
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,890
I'm screwed.

832
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,120
I'm doomed.

833
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:29,690
You'd better disappear.

834
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:30,890
You shut up.

835
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,120
Be quiet for a while.

836
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,530
I'll go if you don't shut up.

837
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,200
I'm leaving.

838
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:40,730
Didn't your dad teach you

839
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,720
when you were little?

840
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,930
If something bad happens,

841
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,810
go to the police.

842
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,520
The police?

843
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,160
Listen carefully.

844
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,570
Okay, I understand.

845
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,410
All right, I know.

846
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,770
Where did she go?

847
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:24,840
Fangning.

848
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,330
I'm done with my work.

849
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:30,720
Let's go eat.

850
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:34,680
Wait a second.

851
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,850
Maybe later. Later.

852
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,330
She refused to dine with me?

853
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,010
Is she really upset?

854
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,610
What are you looking for?

855
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,600
You need my help?

856
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,410
You…

857
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,850
I can't let Ling Rui

858
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,400
meddle in this kind of thing.

859
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,010
You can't do it.

860
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,530
Rest assured.

861
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,490
I can take care of it on my own.

862
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,130
I'll look for you later.

863
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,760
See you at night.

864
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,450
I can't do it?

865
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,290
She'll take care of it on her own?

866
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,650
It's about your honor as a man.

867
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,730
How come you don't have any strength as a man?

868
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,130
Was it because of last night?

869
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,450
Is she despising me?

870
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,320
I didn't see him.

871
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,530
