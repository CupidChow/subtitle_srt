[Episode 26]

4
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,560
Today is the weekend.

5
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,640
I guess a visiting professor

6
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,580
won't come either.

7
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,970
I think it's very simple

8
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,520
after you've explained.

9
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,120
You can apply this...

10
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,850
Thank you, teacher.

11
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,370
Apply this here.

12
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,009
Correct.

13
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:55,920
This step.

14
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:58,840
Ling...

15
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,370
This step is like this.

16
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,520
This question can even be solved like this?

17
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,850
Then a question like this

18
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,720
can be solved using this method

19
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,560
in the future, right?

20
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:20,250
Thank you, teacher.

21
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,570
[He really hates me, right?]

22
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,060
[I understand.]

[But...]

25
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,280
Miss Lu,

26
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,360
the school hopes that

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,480
this color

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,320
can match its logo.

29
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,920
I was wondering if you can change it?

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,600
[He's such a good man,]

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,040

Bas...

36
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,650
It can be remained also.

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,520
I understand.

38
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,840
Artists usually have their own

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,440
insistence on what should be done,

40
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,220
right?

41
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,130
[Haven't you already told yourself that if he ignores you,]

42
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,340
[you'll do the same, too?]

43
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,920
[Why did you want to call him?]

44
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,530
Fool.

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,920
So stupid.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,260
Stupid?

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,540
Miss Lu,

48
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,460
did I do something wrong?

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,820
Miss Lu.

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,380
What did I do wrong?

51
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,420
You can just point it out.

52
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,260
I'll correct it

53
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,440

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:29,960
Well...

55
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,780
I'm sorry, everyone.

56
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,560
I was thinking of another case

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,890
in my mind just now.

58
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,480
Show me the suggestions from the school for the amendments.

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,120
Thank you.

60
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,360
Who did you refer to

61
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,690
when you said "bastard" and "fool" just now?

62
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,730
I meant

63
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,280
no matter how despicable the customers are,

64
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,090
we have to treat them

65
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,300
as fools.

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,840
To be meticulous and patient.

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,120
This is the valuable experience

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,160
I've gained from my work for so many years.

69
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,810

-Well said!

71
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,510
-It's a wise opinion.
-Let's jot it down quickly.

72
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,180
-Jot it down.
-Okay.

Is there anything opposite?

106
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,900
How long do

107
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,010
we need to look at this?

108

I was not looking at anything.

109
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,860

How do you use the rope?

112

He ignored me in the first place,

but cared about my stomach afterward.

that you didn't tell me?

158

[Why did he ask that?]

159

I'm sorry.

163

The wrong file was taken,

but the staff in the school's office is off work now,

Shall we

167
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,860
eat together then?

168
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,280
Okay.

169
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,500
I said,

170

let's eat together.

171
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,770
Sit down.

172

Little grandpa, I'm still a kid.

173
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,700
I'll be ruined

174
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,580
sitting like this all day.

175
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,210

even if you don't want to play with me.

177

It's time for lunch.

I want to eat fried chicken and pizza.

181
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,010
Your mom

182
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,220
told me not to let you eat fried chicken and pizza.

183
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,250
But it's okay to eat instant noodles.

184
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,370
I won't eat it.

185

Mom said

189

that little grandpa treated her very well before.

190
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,430
Why do you treat me like this?

191
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,380
Because your mom is a girl,

192
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,090
but you're a boy.

193
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,370
Of course it's different.

194
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,860
Little grandpa, this is discrimination.

You didn't want to answer the phone?

It must be an advertisement

Of course.

It was because of work.

Little grandpa.

349
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,500
Little grandpa.

350
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,380
Little grandpa.

351
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,140
Why did you hang up on me?

352
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,420
Why did you pick me up

353
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,220
an hour late?

354
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,490
Baby, change your shoes.

355
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:26,820
Come.

356
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,570
Give me slippers.

357
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,180
Didn't you say that you've already

358
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,130
grown up

359
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,300
and are not clingy anymore?

360
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,180
What happened?

361
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,100
Mom,

362
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,220
you didn't know how boring

363
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,660
little grandpa's house was.

364
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,060
He didn't even watch TV.

365
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,180
He didn't go out, too.

366
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,820
Except eating and being in a daze,

367
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,660
he just checked out Weibo

368
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,740
awhile.

369
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,660
By the way, he also had a workout.

370
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,010
But he only pulled the rope three times.

371
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,380
I don't know if it works.

372
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,300
How did he pull it?

373
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,070
Like this.

374
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,610
You're so good. Weren't you happy?

375
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,220
By the way, Mom.

376
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,180
What does "plagiarism" mean?

377
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,860
It means

378
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,580
that a person

379
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,620
produces another person's article

380
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,430
by writing in his own words

381
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,740
again.

382
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,860
Then what about "coupling"?

383
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,910
What does "couple" mean?

384
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,270
Oops, this...

385
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,890
This...

386
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,180
Is it copying?

387
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,020
But why must copying the documents

388
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,830
be done with the boss?

389
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,820
It's not the case.

390
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,750
It doesn't mean so.

391
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,540
Let me tell you.

392
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,140
How am I going to put it into words?

393
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,490
It's just like fries and tomato sauce.

394
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,830
They're compatible.

395
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,580
So

396
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,780
they're paired together.

397
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,060
They're a match made in heaven.

398
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,370
Do you understand?

399
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,910
It's like some people like ice cream very much,

400
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,620
and they eat it with fries.

401
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,300
So fries and ice cream

402
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,260
are also a perfect match.

403
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,500
Correct.

404
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,340
Simply pairing is wrong.

405
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:54,950
Of course.

406
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,190
So we can't learn,

407
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:56,940
okay?

408
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,100
Mom,

409
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,900
have you done something like this?

410
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,660
Didn't mom tell you

411
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,340
the first thing to do when you're back home?

412
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,380
-To wash hands.
-To wash hands.

413
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,500
Right, go now.

414
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,740
Okay, go and wash your hands.

415
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,510
Go now.

416
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,780
What else am I thinking?

417
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,660
How dare I have any other thoughts?

418
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,340
Lu Fangning.

419
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,190
You can't think about it anymore.

420
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,700
Be conscious.

421
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,460
Why was I so unlucky?

422
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,300
How come

423
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,540
I always bumped into him?

424
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,060
Mom, you...

425
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,100
There's something fishy with you.

426
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,590
What's wrong with me?

427
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,300
You're blushing.

428
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,200
You even "fried eggs" on the sofa.

429
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,260
Lu Youyou, let me ask you.

430
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,180
Why did you come back?

431
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,660
I came to look for dad.

432
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,900
What about me?

433
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,390
You were to bring me back here and to work.

434
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,820
Correct.

435
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,540
Right.

436
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,900
There're too many temptations in this world.

437
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,140
I can't be attracted by

438
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,100
his handsome look.

439
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,140
Youyou,

440
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,460
we'll go back soon.

441
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,620
Why? There're danger and trap?

442
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,060
It's way too dangerous.

443
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,700
[Please let us know your choice]

444
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,680
[Person in charge, Shen Zhuo]

445
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,220
Shen Zhuo?

446
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,660
I'm done.

447
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,100
Mom.

448
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,500
-You're awake?
-What are you doing?

449
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,860
Mom is packing things.

450
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,700
Go to brush your teeth and wash your face now.

451
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,620
We'll be leaving

452
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,580
once we've finished breakfast later.

453
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,260
Where are we going?

454
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,420
We're going back.

455
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,460
Why are we going back?

456
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,900
What about your job?

457
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,700
Your mom is very smart.

458
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,680
I stayed up all night

459
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,580
and finished

460
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,260
all the work.

461
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,040
Come, give me a kiss as my reward.

462
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,940
I don't want to go back.

463
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,340
Youyou!

464
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,060
Lu Youyou, look at me.

465
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,700
Is your last name Lu?

466
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,230
Are you still my son?

467
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,660
Let me tell you.

468
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,940
You can't act shamelessly.

469
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,540
No matter how big is the scene you make this time around,

470
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,720
I'll definitely leave.

471
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,800
If you don't want to leave,

472
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,540
I'll leave you

473
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,240
alone here.

474
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,720
You go and live with your little grandpa.

475
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,880
Don't pout.

476
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,520
Darling, I'm here.

477
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,080
Open the door.

478
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,860
Why did you close the door?

479
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,220
Open the door. I was wrong.

480
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,060
Why did you close the door?

481
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,740
Lu Fangning.

482
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,320
Lu Fangning.

483
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:45,740
I was wrong.

484
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,140
I'm such a bastard.

485
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,580
How dare I manipulated Lu Youyou to deceive you?

486
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,660
He's just a kid.

487
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,920
He's only five years old.

488
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,020
I couldn't believe that I actually brought him on my own

489
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,460
and took a plane for over ten hours.

490
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,300
If something happens,

491
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,980
will I be held responsible for it?

492
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,900
How am I going to be held responsible for it?

493
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,740
Shen Zhuo, I warn you.

494
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,190
Don't act here.

495
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,400
Don't prank me

496
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,310
with my son.

497
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,140
I admit it.

498
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,060
At that time, I really...

499
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,960
Who let you sit?

500
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,140
There was "water" in my brain. [*One is out of his senses]

501
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,030
No.

502
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,510
It was "soy sauce".

503
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,300
I had no choice since my hands are in such a state now.

504
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,840
If you didn't come back and appear,

505
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,380
then I'd have to go home

506
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,740
and inherit the soy sauce business.

507
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,790
Isn't it good to inherit the business?

508
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,040
I feel that your vibe

509
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,110
suits it well.

510
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,700
Shen Zhuo, do you think

511
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,900
that since we've known each other for more than ten years,

512
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,140
and are now doing business together,

513
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,020
you can simply test

514
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,030
my limits?

515
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,040
I don't dare to.

516
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,520
I'll never dare to.

517
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,580
The preparation for the exhibition

518
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,620
has been done.

519
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,160
Are you here

520
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,700
to pick us up today?

521
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,660
There's a great opportunity.

522
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,310
What is the opportunity?

523
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,040
I mean

524
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,380
there's a

525
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,420
great opportunity

526
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,700
right in front of us.

527
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,510
An art park contacted me,

528
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,520
hoping that our brand

529
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,660
can enter their park.

530
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,550
The terms they offered are

531
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,360
unbelievably incredible.

532
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,910
We definitely have the upper hand.

533
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:27,860
I even went to see the park

534
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,980
a few days ago.

535
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,720
Their vibe

536
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,630
matches ours really well.

537
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,150
We're compatible.

538
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,190
Let me tell you.

539
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,340
This is a perfect opportunity

540
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,270
for us

541
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,420
to enter the domestic market.

542
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,630
If you didn't grab this opportunity,

543
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,400
you were not

544
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,910
Lu Fangning.

545
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,340
After opening the shop, you'll be assigned a greater percentage of profit.

546
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,390
I used to be allocated more than you.

547
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,790
How about 90 percent of the profit goes to you?

548
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,700
This is a new chapter

549
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,950
in my design career.

550
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,700
It's a perfect opportunity for Youyou

551
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,980
to become the third generation of an affluent family again.

552
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,800
How is it, Ms. Lu?

553
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,590
To accept or not to accept?

554
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,750
Okay, I'll accept.

555
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,460
Where is my son?

556
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,300
Why is he not here

557
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,070
to welcome his dad?

558
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,360
Nonsense. It's the godfather.

559
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,140
Sit here and don't move.

560
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,780
Lu Youyou.

561
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,700
Youyou.

562
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,860
Youyou.

563
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,270
Youyou.

564
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,150
You're still mad at me?

565
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm sorry.

566
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,550
I heard

567
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,670
that if people keep sleeping on their stomachs,

568
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,750
their faces will be flattened,

569
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,990
and they won't look good.

570
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,750
Okay, as you wish now.

571
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,660
We can't leave now.

572
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,870
Uncle Shen is here as well.

573
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,150
Really? You didn't lie to me?

574
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,190
That's true.

575
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,510
Don't feign ignorance here.

576
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,550
Uncle Shen was presenting a big show

577
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,430
outside just now.

578
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,070
Don't tell me that you didn't hear it.

579
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,270
What's wrong again, naughty little boy?

580
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,270
You said just now

581
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,980
that you wanted to leave me alone here.

582
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,880
It hurt my

583
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,190
young soul deeply.

584
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,800
You're not allowed to say anymore

585
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,620
that you're going to abandon me.

586
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,820
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

587
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,100
I'm sorry.

588
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,870
You women are irrational.

589
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,070
You're not allowed to hug me.

590
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,480
Please apologize to me.

591
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,540
I'm sorry.

592
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,110
For what?

593
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,590
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu Youyou.

594
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,790
I'll never say

595
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,910
that I'm leaving you alone again.

596
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,860
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

597
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,430
Okay, I forgive you.

598
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,710
You can go

599
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,920
to heat up the milk for me now.

600
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,710
Thank you for being magnanimous.

601
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,280
You're big-hearted.

602
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,510
But before that,

603
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,550
you still have to grant me

604
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,990
a little wish.

605
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,640
What is it?

606
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,030
From today onward,

607
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,440
unless I give you the permission,

608
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,990
otherwise

609
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,470
you'll have to stay at home obediently.

610
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,990
Don't simply run around. Got it?

611
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,150
Why?

612
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,470
If you don't want to,

613
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,270
from now on, you'll call Shen Zhuo your dad then.

614
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,630
Mom, I'm willing to.

615
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,520
Really?

616
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,030
I'm willing to.

617
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:54,080
[Cai Siyu's Weibo]

618
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,390
There was no need to plagiarize the story

619
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,510
that I'm together with my boss.

620
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,590
I confessed to him on the spur of the moment,

621
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,230
and I succeeded.

622
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,510
Where are we going?

623
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,910
Go to bed.

624
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,230
Go to bed?

625
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,480
Where to sleep?

626
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,200
Go over there.

627
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,710
Last night,

628
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,590
we...

629
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,350
We...

630
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,420
We got drunk?

631
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,800
Don't play this trick with me.

632
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,910
When will the contract be signed?

633
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,190
What is it?

634
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,270
You're feigning ignorance?

635
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,640
You promised to give me

636
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,720
90 percent of the profit

637
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,430
for five years.

638
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,950
Are you still afraid of me tricking you?

639
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,790
Seriously.

640
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,320
Yes.

641
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,030
You made it happen.

642
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,590
It makes sense

643
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,710
for you to be allocated more.

644
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,870
Why did you say that I made it happen?

645
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,750
I didn't do anything.

646
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,750
Not you?

647
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,550
We've become famous all over the world.

648
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,630
That's not possible.

649
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,590
I guess this awesome deal

650
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,840
fell into our laps.

651
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,950
I mean it.

652
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,720
This is Mr. Cao.

653
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,270
Mr. Cao,

654
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,310
this is my partner,

655
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,040
Lu Fangning.

656
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,030
-Hello.
-Hello.

657
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,710
Miss Lu and Mr. Shen,

658
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,920
I like your products

659
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,310
very much.

660
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,120
I'm also looking forward to this partnership.

661
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,110
I sincerely hope to see your brand

662
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,270
entering our park.

663
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,950
Thank you for your trust.

664
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,350
I hope that we can have an excellent partnership.

665
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,750
There's no offense.

666
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,910
I'm just curious.

667
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,350
Two of you

668
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,270
look compatible together

669
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,310
and are managing a home furnishing brand,

670
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,190
so I was wondering if two of you

671
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,310
are husband and wife?

672
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,840
That's absolutely impossible.

673
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,430
How could I possibly...

674
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,880
I'm sorry.

675
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,230
The question I asked is too personal.

676
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,590
Let's stop here today.

677
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,390
We'll talk about

678
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,670
the details later

679
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,080
after both of you have made a decision.

680
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,150
Be careful.

681
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,110
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

682
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,750
I think there's something fishy.

683
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,150
He talked to us for a while

684
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,630
and confirmed the partnership.

685
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,910
He even said that he's known us for so long.

686
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,480
This is so strange.

687
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,670
What did you just say?

688
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,050
Why being together with me...

689
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,350
It's okay. Come on, you have a chance.

690
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:36,990
He...

691
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,830
Why is he here?

692
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,750
Don't tell me that person

693
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,840
is Youyou's

694
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,750
father?

695
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,200
You spoke too loud.

696
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,350
He doesn't know about it.

697
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,750
He's coming.

698
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,710
What do I not know?

699
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,150
Don't know...

700
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,760
Don't know... Don't know

701
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,110
how well Shen Zhuo treated me

702
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,590
when we were abroad.

703
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,110
I'm sorry.

704
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,770
Ling Rui,

705
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,190
you haven't met Shen Zhuo, right?

706
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,520
This was my classmate, Soy Sauce Prince.

707
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,550
An emerging talent in the design industry.

708
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:12,470
I know.

709
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,990
He's your partner.

710
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:15,630
By the way.

711
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,400
Well...

712
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,990
Why did you happen to be here

713
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,390
and also know

714
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,870
Mr. Cao?

715
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:22,750
It was not a coincidence.

716
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,430
Mr. Cao was my patient.

717
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,310
Later on,

718
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,320
we became friends.

719
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,950
So he was looking for me to...

720
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,870
Recently, he's been looking for

721
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,450
some independent brand designers

722
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,070
to collaborate with his park.

723
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,450
I thought of your studio

724
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,930
and mentioned it to him.

725
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,910
You have a talk first.

726
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:48,960
I still have other things to do. I'll make a move first.

727
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,870
Where are you going?

728
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,350
You have no

729
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,800
family or friends here.

730
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,150
What can you do?

731
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,070
I...

732
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,410
To remove the plaster of the Paris cast.

733
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,190
By the way, he needs to remove the plaster of the Paris cast today.

734
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,470
I have to go with him,

735
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,910
as his relative.

736
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,510
Let's go together.

737
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,190
There's no need to trouble you.

738
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,230
Not at all.

739
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,710
My hospital is just nearby.

740
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,120
If there's any problem,

741
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,830
I can still help.

742
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,850
If that's the case,

743
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,060
then please take care of Shen Zhuo.

744
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,770
I'll make a move first.

745
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,429
I guess there's a need to have a family member beside

746
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,909
for the removal of plaster of Paris cast.

747
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,460
[Shenzhen Huiren Hospital]

748
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,030
Does it hurt?

749
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,760
It's okay.

750
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,530
Director Ling,

751
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,830
or I'll let you do this.

752
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:50,949
No, you carry on with it.

753
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,469
I'll make a move first.

754
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,400
I'll wait for you.

755
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,070
What if she runs away again?

756
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,870
I'll wait for you?

757
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,190
Shen Zhuo, did you hear that?

758
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,270
What did he mean?

759
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,910
Did he discover something?

760
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:18,600
What should I do?

761
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,240
This family member.

762
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,270
If you grasp his arm again,

763
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,070
I might have to give him

764
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,750
-a new cast.
-Sorry.

765
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,490
I'm sorry.

766
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,150
I'll wait for you?

767
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,800
I'll wait for you?

768
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,350
This family member.

769
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,030
I think

770
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,510
that you better don't flatter yourself.

771
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:41,970
What do you mean?

772
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,550
The person you just talked about

773
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,390
is Director Ling, right?

774
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,470
Don't worry.

775
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,950
Director Ling

776
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,230
won't be interested

777
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,310
in you.

778
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,670
Why can you be certain

779
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,160
that Director Ling

780
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,890
won't be interested in me?

781
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,670
I've been in this hospital for four years.

782
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,680
I've seen countless people like you.

783
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,610
All were defeated.

784
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,880
Do you know why?

785
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,470
Why?

786
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,990
Director Ling is sick.

787
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,510
He was hurt badly

788
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,650
by his ex-wife before.

789
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,440
You're talking about divorce, right?

790
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,840
It was a divorce, right?

791
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:26,790
A divorce.

792
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,710
Getting divorced is normal now.

793
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,390
It's not a big deal.

794
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,790
The abnormal one is his ex-wife.

795
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,240
I just don't understand

796
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,120
why such a good person like Director Ling

797
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,800
would be into her in the first place.

798
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:40,910
I also heard

799
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,720
that not only does this woman look mediocre,

800
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,000
but also she's vicious.

801
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,360
When they first got married,

802
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,690
she already started torturing Director Ling.

803
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,870
Not letting him go home.

804
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,970
After that,

805
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,550
not only did she hinder him from work,

806
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,000
but she also forced him to switch careers.

807
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,440
In the end,

808
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,720
guess what?

809
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,480
His ex-wife ran away.

810
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,400
She ran away with another guy.

811
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,990
Is it that this woman

812
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,160
is heartless?

813
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,870
Garbage.

814
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,120
She caused the medical field

815
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,920
to nearly lose

816
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,320
such an excellent doctor.

817
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,080
Doctor.

818
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,590
The version that I heard

819
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,040
seems not to be like this.

820
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,720
I heard

821
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,330
that Dr. Ling's ex-wife

822
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,710
is beautiful,

823
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,790
has milky skin,

824
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,890
and is kind-hearted.

825
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,000
Like a gold.

826
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,720
No, like a diamond.

827
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,670
Not only is she from a noble background,

828
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,950
but also she

829
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,320
has a generous heart to take care of

830
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,040
the underprivileged.

831
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,890
Do you know how precious this is?

832
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,530
I heard

833
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,640
that she donated a lot of money

834
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,880
to the sick children in this hospital.

835
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,990
Have you heard of it?

836
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,590
There seemed to be such a thing.

837
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,880
So

838
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,630
gossip is like this.

839
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,510
There's no real version

840
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,750
with people spreading it around.

841
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,080
-Like me...
-Director Ling.

842
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,610
Is it done?

843
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,960
It's almost done.

844
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,240
I have a stomach ache.

845
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,850
I have a stomach ache.

846
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
-You have a stomach ache?
-Yes.

847
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,000
Stomach ache might be serious.

848
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,150
I have to check for you properly.

849
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:11,800
Let's go.

850
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,880
I'm leaving.

851
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,800
Well...

852
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,430
Your stomach hurts?

853
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,360
Where does it hurt?

854
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
Is it here?

855
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Or it's here?

856
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,170
I... My stomach doesn't hurt.

857
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,490
You look so uncomfortable.

858
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,810
Are you sure you don't need to have a detailed check-up?

859
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,920
-No.
-Is it here?

860
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,760
I got it wrong just now.

861
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,920
I have gastric pain.

862
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,070
There's a little discomfort with my gastric.

863
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,970
Sit down.

864
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,760
You always

865
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,030
have gastric pain.

866
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,640
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

867
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,530
You still remember?

868
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,200
Of course I remember.

869
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,720
After all, you're my ex-wife with

870
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,640
milky skin and a diamond heart.

871
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,570
By the way.

872
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,760
I heard from Mr. Cao

873
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,400
that you and Mr. Shen

874
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,400
only have an ordinary partnership relationship.

875
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,670
The medicine is ready.
