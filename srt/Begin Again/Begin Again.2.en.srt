Check.

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:40,950
Uncle Hua?

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,320
-You are back.
-Having a walk?

8
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,470
Ling Rui is back.

9
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,350
I'm back.

10
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,920
-Ling Rui.
-Hello, Aunt Li.

11
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,000
Change another hand.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,710
Sister Fang.

13
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,030
Use your left hand.

14
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,360
This way.

15
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,430
This way.

16
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,150
Then, use this.

Yes.

You're off early.

-This shoulder.
-Yes.

Your mother

Mom, are you done?

27
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,840
Yes.

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,910
Let's go home and have lunch.

29
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,190
Okay, where's my musical instrument?

30
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,670
My bag?

31
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,790

Let's go.

36
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,510
Look at how bad this woman is.

37
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,280
I told you.

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,590
I know the ending will be like this.

39
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,320
Look.

40
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,590
What's it, little aunt?

41
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,750
Ling Rui,

42
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,670
I'm going to die.

43
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,190
So, you are saying that

44
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,230
the one who owed you four million yuan

45
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,550
is the aunt of Dr. Ling Rui.

46
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,310
Yes, sister.

47
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,750
Sister Yazhi told me that

48
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,910
she has a nephew named Ling Rui,

49
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,230
working as a surgeon in the city hospital.

50
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,310
And Sister Yazhi

51
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,350
is really good.

52
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,630
So, she is not going to

53
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,150
deny the debt.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,990
And, their aunt...

55
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,550
Shut up!

56
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,150
I took the little asset

57
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,590
your former uncle-in-law gave me
before the divorce.

58
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,590
And, I did some investment.

59
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,710
I lost all the money in it.

60
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,480
I also...

61
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,950
-Also...
-I also...

62
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,630
What?

63
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,910
I also owed four million yuan.

64
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,310
Now, they are urging me to return it.

65
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,950
I don't have the money.

66
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,880
Ling Rui, don't...

67
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,310
Don't tell your mother

68
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,510
and my sister.

69
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,670
If they find out, I am doomed to die!

70
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,190
Okay, little aunt. Don't worry.

71
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,550
I will

72
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,030
deal with this.

73
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,630
Okay, okay.

74
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,270
Okay. No problem.

75
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,190
Okay. Goodbye.

77
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,310
Yes... Yeah.

78
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,670

81

Okay.

84
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,190
I'll pay attention to that in the future,

85
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,909
and call you Ms. Lu.

86

It's so generous of you

89

Yes. For my mother too.

General Manager of LM Deer Sing Group,

Lu Fangyu's sister,

124
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,590
and the creditor of your aunt, Ling Yazhi.

125
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,190
I'm the one you are responsible for.

126
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,270
Ms. Lu,

127
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,590
I'm willing to

128
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,790
bear all the debt

129
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,630
on behalf of Ms. Ling Yazhi.

130
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,950
But, because the amount

131
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,670
is relatively huge,

132
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,030
it may take a while to pay off them.

133
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,350
I totally understand.

134
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,740
So,

135
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,830
can you give me an extension?

136
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,550
I came up with

137
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,270
an overall plan

138
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,390
for this problem.

139
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,350
An overall plan

140
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,510
that benefits both of us.

141
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,590
Let's make it to two million.

142
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,070
But, you need to marry me

143
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,340
for just one year only.

144
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,110
The two million

145
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,270
can be offset after a year.

146
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,150
You don't have to thank me.

147
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,950
I need a marriage

148
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,150
to deal with my family.

149
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,350
And, you're the right guy.

150
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,590
You don't have to thank me

151
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,750
for giving you this chance.

152
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,750
I'm sorry. I reject the offer.

153
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,750
Two million five hundred thousand yuan?

154
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,790
It's more than half of the debt.

155
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,590
Three million.

156
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,470
Three million a year.

157
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,710
It's several times your annual salary.

158
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,620
Think about it.

159
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,100
If we cooperate happily,

160
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,950
this will make a win-win situation.

161
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,510
Smooth.

162
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,510
Four million, all of it.

163
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,790
You just have to keep up

164
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,830
a year's marriage with me.

165
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,430
One year later, the debt will be

166
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,990
canceled.

167
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,030
I think I'd better go.

168
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,510
Later,

169
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,030
I'll think about

170
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,750
the specific repayment plan.

171
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,870
Then, I'll inform Ms. Lu.

172
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,659
You won't lose anything.

173
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,710
Wait! Wait!

174
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,150
Lu Fangning,

175
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,470
apologize to me.

176
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,790
This is a workplace.

177
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,270
Influencers are not welcome here.

178
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,790
I'm not an influencer. I'm a celebrity.

179
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,790
They are the same.

180
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,430
Don't be too arrogant,

181
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,140
or I'll ask my father not to vote for you.

182
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,630
I'm so scared.

183
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,470
You!

184
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,750
Security.

185
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,940
Don't call security.

186
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,670
Security.

187
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,860
Don't do that.

188
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,260
Security.

189
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,670
Get this madman away from me.

190
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,270
How dare you say that!

191
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:10,990
Tang Pingping.

192
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,430
-Dad.
-Pingping.

193
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,620
You're looking for me?

194
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,470
-I...
-You're in the wrong place.

195
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,590
I was just there.

196
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,910
Fangning, you are here too.

197
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,590
Look at my silly girl.

198
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,950
She can't even remember where my office is.

199
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,750
Let's go.

200
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,750
I won't go.

201
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,110
I want her to apologize to me.

202
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,430
She broke my arm.

203
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,470
It really hurt!

204
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,910
Apologize for what?

205
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,990
Didn't you just twist it?

206
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,550
It's alright.

207
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,720
No.

208
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,350
Dad.

209
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,710
Don't vote for her.

210
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,270
Okay, okay.

211
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,750
I won't. I won't.

212
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,070
Fangning, don't worry.

213
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,950
I'll definitely vote for you

214
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,750
at the next board meeting.

215
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,230
-Thank you, Uncle Tang.
-What did you say?

216
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,620
You!

217
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,270
-It hurts.
-Dad!

218
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,870
It hurts!

219
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,860
It hurts!

220
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,870
Mister, sit over there.

221
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,420
It hurts.

222
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,140
-Sit down first.
-Dad.

223
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,980
Come here.

224
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,990
-It hurts.
-Sit down first.

225
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,620
Mister,

226
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,470
are you feeling the pain in the upper chest

227
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,630
or the lower end?

228
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,790
Do you feel stuffy or tight?

229
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,550
I... I...

230
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,470
I didn't sleep well.

231
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,510
I'm afraid of getting angry.

232
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,430
Uncle Tang, drink some water.

233
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,500
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

234
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,020
Doctor,

235
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,430
how is my father?

236
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,060
You'd better take him to the hospital
as soon as possible

237
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,790
to do some detailed examination

238
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,380
in thoracic surgery
and internal medicine department.

239
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,660
So, you can know what's going on.

240
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,670
It hurts. It hurts.

241
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,260
Which department are you from?

242
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,700
I'm from the General Surgery Department.

243
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,220
General Surgery Department?

244
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,430
Then,

245
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,910
when are you usually at the hospital?

246
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,900
Dr. Ling,

247
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,710
I think

248
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,060
you can help with nothing here.

249
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,950
You can leave.

250
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,300
Mister,

251
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,870
remember to go to the hospital for a check-up.

252
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,550
Thanks.

253
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,670
Lu Fangning.

254
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,110
You brought such a

255
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,190
handsome guy here.

256
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,740
Do you have any agenda?

257
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,260
I'm asking you.

258
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,420
Why don't you come with us tonight?

259
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,940
I told you many times.

260
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:27,820
I'm not going.

261
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,100
Just go with me.

262
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,140
And it's me

263
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,950
who'll pay for it.

264
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,060
It's just a blind date.

265
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,430
I'm not going.

266
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:38,740
Okay.

267
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,150
What are you doing?

268
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,340
What are you doing with my food?

269
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,870
You don't eat the meat every time.

270
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,660
And, I don't have enough to eat.

271
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,550
It's not a big deal for me to eat some.

272
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,830
But, I have to eat it too.

273
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,550
But,

274
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,510
it's reasonable that nobody can get you

275
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,270
the most handsome guy of
General Surgery Department

276
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,230
merely through a blind date.

277
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,350
Especially, you're the most handsome guy

278
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,860
who is dedicated

279
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,980
to the medical cause.

280
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,540
Am I right?

281
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,500
Tell me something about it.

282
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,950
The lady behind the curtain...

283
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,670
Who is she? Why don't I know her?

284
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,300
She shouldn't be from our department.

285
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,270
Because I don't even know her.

286
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,670
And,

287
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,230
she shouldn't be a patient's next-of-kin.

288
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,070
You're not a person who does such a thing.

289
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,510
Stop it! Just eat.

290
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,540
Did anything happen at home?

291
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,550
I haven't seen the look

292
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,740
for a long time.

293
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,150
There's something wrong indeed.

294
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,270
It's the same bank account number, right?

295
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,470
What are you doing?

296
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,300
I'll send you the money.

297
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,470
The most probable cause to your problem

298
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,580
is money.

299
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,060
You don't have to do that.

300
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,590
A huge amount?

301
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,470
More than your mortgage.

302
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,990
And, you're still in the mood to eat?

303
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,460
You...

304
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,940
Food is essential.

305
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,270
I don't want to waste it.

306
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,500
So what are you going to do?

307
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,020
I've already figured it out,

308
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,670
although

309
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,910
it's a little tricky.

310
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,180
Come on.

311
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,070
Let me send you some.

312
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,620
Or what if

313
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,990
you disappear someday.

314
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,470
If you, the most handsome guy
in the hospital, disappear,

315
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,580
where can I find you?

316
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,100
Why do you talk so much?

317
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,260
Don't talk nonsense and just eat.

318
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,670
You should know

319
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,060
to never trust repeated criminals.

320
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,790
Look at you.

321
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,870
What's the use of being so handsome?

322
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,950
It will be nice if a female boss

323
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,500
marries you one day.

324
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,750
Gao Erfan,

325
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,300
what do you think of my negotiation skills?

326
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,980
How is it?

327
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,350
There is no contract that you can't win.

328
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,070
Did my skill deteriorate?

329
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,060
You mean

330
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,790
yesterday's negotiations with
representatives of Yi Rui?

331
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,310
I think your performance

332
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,310
is perfect.

333
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,230
And all the terms

334
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,740
correspond to our goal.

335
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,110
I don't think there's any problem.

336
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,270
Then, who has a problem?

337
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,820
Ling Rui?

338
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,830
Dr. Ling?

339
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,110
What's wrong with him?

340
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,660
I offered to marry him

341
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,740
by raising the condition from

342
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,510
two million to four million.

343
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,550
But, he didn't want to accept it.

344
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,340
Why?

345
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,820
Well.

346
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,990
Say it.

347
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,220
Say it.

348
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,660
In my humble opinion, Ms. Lu...

349
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,540
You were negotiating a marriage,

350
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,780
not a business.

351
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,950
Imagine it.

352
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,100
If a man

353
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,140
tells you

354
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,220
how much money

355
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,300
he can give you

356
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,230
and how can both of you

357
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,470
make a win-win situation
when he's about to marry you,

358
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,820
will you feel happy?

359
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,060
I will.

360
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,380
Why not?

361
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,420
Bravo.

362
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,950
Then I...

363
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,430
Say it.

364
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,620
Ms. Lu,

365
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,660
my holiday and bonus for next month...

366
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,230
Say it.

367
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,630
Anything but money.

368
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,670
How and what to negotiate?

369
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,300
Sure enough, about true feelings.

370
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,910
Show him your true feelings

371
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,990
and enthusiasm.

372
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,670
We won't go to the company.

373
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,500
How about my bonus?

374
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,150
Where are you going after work?

375
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:30,860
I have something else

376
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,590
and I have work to do

377
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,630
afterward.

378
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,350
What can you have?

379
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,500
You are going home to work?

380
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,430
Come on.

381
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,140
Where are you going?

382
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,430
Dr. Ling.

383
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,980
Hello.

384
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,620
You...

385
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,780
I'm Tang Ping.

386
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,110
Ping is the...

387
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,300
An apple (Ping Guo) a day.

388
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,870
I remember.

389
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:53,980
Ms. Tang,

390
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,460
what can I do for you?

391
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,190
After you left,

392
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,230
I thought

393
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,790
I have a lot

394
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,940
to say to you.

395
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,620
Then...

396
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,870
You two go on. I'll go first.

397
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,310
Okay.

398
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,500
Ms. Tang,

399
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,870
you're not my patient.

400
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,150
If you're in need,

401
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,470
you can go to
the medical management department,

402
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,670
on the fifth floor of the East area.

403
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,150
We're leaving.

404
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,300
Dr. Ling.

405
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,060
No.

406
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,500
See.

407
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,100
I made this for you myself.

408
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,900
I'm giving it to you.

409
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,350
Thanks a lot.

410
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,910
Well...

411
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,860
Actually, it's not that good.

412
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,950
Bribery is

413
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,140
against the rules everywhere, right?

414
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,750
It's not for you.

415
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,300
We have work to do. We'll leave first.

416
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,220
Dr. Ling,

417
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,020
can't we just

418
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,990
be friends?

419
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,700
I'm afraid not.

420
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,380
Don't go.

421
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,180
Peng Bo, let's go.

422
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,100
Dr. Ling.

423
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,460
Lu Fangning, why are you here?

424
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,910
Such a coincidence!

425
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,829
You are not friends, are you?

426
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,940
Let me introduce her to you.

427
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,180
This is Tang Ping.

428
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,829
The ordinary Ping.

429
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,740
It's obviously the Ping
who likes him at first sight.

430
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,190
Nobody knows what you're saying.

431
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:23,660
You!

432
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,109
It's just the pretty Ping.

433
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,060
The ordinary Ping!

434
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,070
And, this is my man, Ling Rui.

435
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,800
What?

436
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,860
-I'm not. -That's impossible.

437
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,780
He... I like him first.

438
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,740
Then, why don't you build a castle

439
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,900
for him?

440
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:44,940
Tang Ping.

441
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,100
How dare you

442
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,980
snatch my "future husband"?

443
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,180
What can you do about it

444
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,790
even he's your "father"?

445
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,790
Tang Pingping.

446
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,620
You're really getting bolder and bolder.

447
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,070
That's who I am.

448
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,860
Dare you touch me again?

449
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,430
-Okay!
-Again?

450
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,230
Okay!

451
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,870
-Again?
-Hey, ladies.

452
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,310
-Okay!
-Ladies...

453
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,420
Ladies, we're at the hospital.

454
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,100
Shut up!

455
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,300
Stop acting.

456
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,230
He's neither stupid nor blind.

457
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,910
He can see through your acting skills.

458
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,860
Dr. Ling.

459
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,380
Today, I am here

460
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,790
to talk about

461
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,350
the unfinished topic

462
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,630
last time.

463
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,580
This is for you.

464
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,820
Come with me.

465
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,220
Did you hear that?

466
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,190
He asked me to go with him.

467
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,500
Don't be arrogant!

468
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,830
Come back.

469
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,140
This patient...

470
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,150
How about

471
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,630
I'll take you to
the medical management department

472
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,940
or the Orthopedics Department?

473
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,790
No, thank you.

474
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,380
Get out of my way.

475
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,740
Please, marry me.

476
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,020
Ms. Lu.

477
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,900
I think

478
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,740
I've made it very clear before.

479
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,500
You can ask me some

480
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,540
normal questions now.

481
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,940
For example, why did I choose you?

482
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,580
Never mind. You don't have to talk.

483
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,140
Let me tell you.

484
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,180
We met three times before.

485
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,060
You have a good personality,

486
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,030
body, and vigor.

487
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,340
I'm very satisfied with...

488
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,630
I'm moved.

489
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,820
Ling Rui.

490
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
I'm being serious.

491
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,990
The heart is on the left.

492
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,980
Ms. Lu.

493
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,070
I still want to discuss my repayment plan

494
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,420
with you.

495
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,740
Are you serious?

496
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,180
This isn't

497
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,180
a simple thing.

498
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,180
I can't believe there's someone

499
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,950
who takes the initiative
to pay back money these days.

500
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,340
Why?

501
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,900
Your dignity?

502
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,550
Actually, you don't have to do this.

503
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,780
In the matter of gender equality,

504
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,820
we can try

505
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,060
to materialize it.

506
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,700
I know you don't have much savings.

507
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,710
All of your money

508
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,300
has been donated to charity

509
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,870
in various names

510
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,180
since you started working.

511
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,260
But, it doesn't matter.

512
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,630
I allow you to use me,

513
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,140
in the name of Lu Fangning's husband.

514
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,790
Thus, we can help more people

515
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,140
to get more the help they need.

516
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,220
I know you are going to Germany.

517
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,500
-We can...
-Ms. Lu.

518
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,940
I do want

519
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,150
to help more people

520
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,030
and realize

521
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,180
my dream.

522
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,220
But I won't

523
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,380
break my rules for this.

524
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,100
Marriage is not a business.

525
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,510
There's no shortcut to anything.

526
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,540
Marriage is originally the reorganization of

527
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,580
two families.

528
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,950
This isn't a shortcut at all.

529
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,220
This is for the better.

530
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,780
You should render great love in your heart.

531
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,020
You should render
the spirit of sacrifice and dedication.

532
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,110
So I have to sacrifice my marriage?

533
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,060
To you?

534
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,870
Definitely.

535
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,860
Thank you for helping my family.

536
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,780
Also, please.

537
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,910
Stop mentioning it again

538
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,900
in the future.

539
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,700
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

540
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,180
And,

541
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,060
Ms. Lu,

542
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,740
please don't tell

543
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,580
my family about this.

544
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,830
I don't want them to worry.

545
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,540
This flower

546
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,260
can't be put in the ward.

547
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,910
Ms. Lu, please take it back.

548
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,620
Thanks.

549
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,580
Sure enough, it's fragile

550
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,940
and useless.

551
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,220
Just a waste of money.

552
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,180
Ms. Lu.

553
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,030
Do you want to call Lawyer Deng?

554
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,310
Lawyer?

555
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,100
Yeah.

556
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,540
It's natural

557
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,820
to let lawyers handle the debt collection.

558
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,220
Let me think about it again.

559
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,340
Go out.

560
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,260
So embarrassing.

561
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,060
Pingping.

562
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,220
Let dad tell you something.

563
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,700
Don't go to the company

564
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,180
when you're free.

565
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,950
Don't act perfunctorily!

566
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,070
If you go a few more times,

567
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,540
my heart, liver, and my lungs

568
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,460
can't stand that anymore.

569
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,180
Dad, you're not that weak.

570
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,030
What's the matter?

571
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,710
What did you just say?

572
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,980
I said

573
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,300
my heart, liver, and my lungs... What's wrong?

574
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,100
Dad,

575
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,380
you are ill.

576
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,340
No.

577
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,100
I'm just getting old

578
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,700
and feel a bit out of breath.

579
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,380
The great doctor

580
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,340
said before

581
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,900
that you were really ill.

582
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,700
I am fine.

583
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
I eat and sleep well.

584
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,620
There's nothing wrong with me.

585
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,300
You're ill. You have to go to the hospital.

586
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,140
I'm not ill. I'm not going to the hospital.

587
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,390
You are. You're going to the hospital.

588
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,460
I'm not ill.

589
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,580
No. Let's go to the hospital.

590
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,820
Just go. You're ill.

591
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,420
There isn't much problem.

592
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,460
Just go home and have a good rest.

593
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,580
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

594
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,060
Dad, come in.

595
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,620
Dr. Ling.

596
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,540
Hello.

597
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,620
You...

598
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,580
Didn't you ask my dad to see a doctor

599
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,420
last time?

600
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,100
So, I brought him here.

601
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,380
Have a seat.

602
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,100
But this is the General Surgery Department.

603
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,100
You're so skillful.

604
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,660
Of course, my father trusts you.

605
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,060
Isn't that, dad?

606
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,100
Yes.

607
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,790
Alright.

608
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,620
I'll help mister to make an appointment

609
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,700
for some examinations.

610
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,500
And we'll know which department to go to

611
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,180
after the test results come out.

612
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,190
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Ling.

613
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,860
You're welcome.

614
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,580
Dr. Ling.

615
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,940
I brought you

616
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,270
coffee.

617
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,780
I can't take this. Thanks.

618
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,980
It's just a cup of coffee.

619
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,300
This is my sincere thought.

620
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,660
Can't you even accept it?

621
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
You can leave it here.

622
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,460
Thanks.

623
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,490
Okay.

624
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,520
Not me,

625
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,020
but Tang Ping?

626
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,820
Gao Erfan, get in here.

627
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:53,900
Ms. Lu.

628
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,420
Call Lawyer Deng.

629
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,020
Now.

630
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,890
[Reciprocal Account Name: Peng Bo]

631
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,780
Don't come in.

632
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,980
If you dare to come in,

633
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,390
you are trespassing.

634
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,140
Stop.

635
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,620
I will tell the TV station to expose you.

636
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,580
Yea.

637
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,420
You... Don't move.

638
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,460
If you dare touch me,

639
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,700
I'll sue you for sexual harassment.

640
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,980
I have filmed it.

641
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:34,780
What's the matter?

642
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,740
Mr. Ling Rui, right?

643
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,300
Yes, I am.

644
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Hello, Mr. Ling Rui.

645
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,060
I'm entrusted by my client

646
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,900
to collect

647
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,940
Miss Ling Yazhi's

648
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,740
debts of four million yuan.

649
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,100
Given her financial situation,

650
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,980
we think it is necessary

651
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,740
to know about her family's repayment ability.

652
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,700
If it's determined that
she is incapable of repaying,

653
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,620
we'll bring up a reasonable lawsuit

654
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,740
shortly.

655
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,940
What?

656
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,100
What... Four million yuan?

657
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,500
What's going on?

658
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,900
Ling Yazhi, you...

659
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,980
Where's your client?

660
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,420
My client is downstairs.

661
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,300
You have her business card.

662
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,620
You should know what to do.

663
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,820
What's going on?

664
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,180
Lu Fangning.

665
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,700
Yes?

666
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,460
Do you want to punch me?

667
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,500
Ling Rui.

668
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,500
Usually,

669
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,500
I don't give

670
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,580
anybody a second chance.

671
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,210
But, I can make an exception

672
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,860
for you.

673
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,460
No.

674
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,340
This confirmed

675
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,900
my decision to reject you.

676
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,100
You only want to achieve your goal

677
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,900
and impose your will on others.

678
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,660
You keep saying that you want to get married.

679
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,100
But do you know the feeling of

680
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,300
love and being loved?

681
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,100
Do you know

682
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,540
the importance of family to a person?

683
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,860
You only think about yourself.

684
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,180
But you disregard

685
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,380
other's feelings and wishes.

686
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,700
If you care,

687
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,780
you won't easily

688
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,300
hurt other people's families.

689
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,540
You're a debtor.

690
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,220
You've no right to judge me.

691
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,620
Lu Fangning,

692
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,700
you are a selfish and

693
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,420
childish person.

694
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,260
Fangning,

695
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,420
will you stop

696
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,580
being childish?

697
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,260
Enjoy your food.

698
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,090
Let's eat.

699
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,380
A great day begins in the morning.

700
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,810
I got up early in the morning

701
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,460
to prepare this.

702
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,300
But all of you don't even appreciate it.

703
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,500
Even you're worried,

704
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,140
you have to eat.

705
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,740
Am I right?

706
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:04,940
Mom!

707
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,540
You always say

708
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,180
people live on meals.

709
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,460
I promise you, okay?

710
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,460
If it doesn't work out in the end,

711
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,540
I will ask you for help.

712
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,980
I was waiting for you to say this.

713
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,700
I've thought it through.

714
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,860
I... I have to find another house.

715
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,210
Or we'll have no space

716
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,020
for these things

717
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,530
if this house is mortgaged,

718
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,340
am I right?

719
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,180
Zhang Aidi has a house.

720
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,980
It seems that I have to

721
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,890
talk to this woman again.

722
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,500
I did some math.

723
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,460
I can help gather a little

724
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,780
by withdrawing the investment money.

725
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,050
Ling Rui can earn it back

726
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,140
for me.

727
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,930
Am I right, Ling Rui?

728
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,410
Sure enough.

729
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,660
All right, let's eat.

730
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,260
-Let's eat.
-Enjoy.

731
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,250
Let's eat.

732
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,260
Aunt,

733
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,700
there are the freshly made fried dough sticks.

734
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,370
Try it.

735
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,020
-Okay.
-This is freshly made.

736
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,260
The dumpling looks tasty too.

737
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,900
I'll start with this.

738
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,330
It's delicious!

739
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,210
It's delicious!

740
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,500
Is it delicious?

741
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,500
Yes.

742
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,690
Yes.

743
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,930
Is it delicious?

744
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,740
-Nice?
-Ouch.

745
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,300
-Mom, why are you pinching me?
-Does it hurt?

746
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,220
-Harder!
-It hurts!

747
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,330
-Harder!
-It should hurt.

748
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:21,770
It hurts!

749
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,700
Let him remember this.

750
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,340
I tell you.

751
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,180
He should tell us

752
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,820
whenever he's in trouble.

753
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,820
If you dare lie to me again,

754
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,340
I'll force you to marry

755
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,860
the cousin's daughter of

756
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,820
the aunt who lives next door to Zhang Aidi.

757
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,660
Believe it or not?

758
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,620
I believe!

759
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,020
-Do you? Do you?
-I do!

760
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,140
-Stop pinching.
-Does it hurt?

761
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,540
It really hurts!

762
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,450
Aunt Wang's

763
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,820
uncle's daughter?

764
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,770
Another aunt's daughter

765
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,390
is okay too.

766
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,020
Okay?

767
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,660
I was wrong.

768
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,860
I was wrong.

769
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,580
What about me?

770
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,340
It was my fault.

771
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,210
Why didn't you scold me?

772
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,380
You can beat me too.

773
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,540
Nice try.

774
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,530
Do you know

775
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,850
what's the worst punishment?

776
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,250
It's that you obviously made a mistake,

777
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,770
but you don't get punished, right?

778
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,730
How hard it is for you!

779
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,140
Think about it.

780
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,020
Yes.

781
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,340
That's the greatest pain

782
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,180
in the world.

783
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,010
Let's eat.

784
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,820
Mom, eat the bamboo shoot.

785
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,330
Delicious.

786
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,580
You just ignore me. I'll eat by myself.

787
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,340
Come.

788
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,770
Little aunt, eat this.

789
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,290
It's delicious!

790
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,460
The shrimp dumplings are made very well today.

791
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,900
Right?

792
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,580
Mr. Yang.

793
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,370
Ms. Lu.

794
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,020
It's been a while.

795
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:43,770
Have a seat.

796
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,580
Have a seat.

797
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,620
What would you like to drink?

798
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,330
Two hot lattes.

799
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,610
Okay, just a moment, please.

800
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,700
Stop touching your "glib tongue".

801
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,900
Can you look at the waiter and talk?

802
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,140
Didn't anyone teach you manners?

803
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,090
I don't want to drink a latte.

804
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:11,659
I've been looking for a chance

805
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,170
to talk with Ms. Lu.

806
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:15,620
What for?

807
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,300
Ms. Lu,

808
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,090
you run Deer Sing Group so well.

809
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,900
But a woman like you

810
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:23,340
may not truly understand about

811
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,260
how to run a business.

812
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,980
Ling Rui wouldn't say such stupid things.

813
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,330
Thanks.

814
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,300
You're welcome.

815
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,380
Thanks.

816
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:40,690
Oh, no!

817
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,770
I'm starting to hallucinate.

818
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,650
Professor,

819
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,380
we've been in the hospital all-day.

820
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,660
But you asked me to come here after work.

821
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,940
Is there anything you want to say to me?

822
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,980
You should be the one

823
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,980
who has something to say to me, right?

824
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,980
Peng Bo told you?

825
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,540
You should have told me first,

826
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,340
not him.

827
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,370
He barely has spare money.

828
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,980
Don't worry.

829
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,530
About money,

830
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,010
I'm not very good at it,

831
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,620
but

832
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,970
my wife manages it well.

833
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,460
Take it.

834
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,540
Thank you, sir.

835
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,090
But I can handle this

836
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,820
by myself.

837
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,420
You're still so stubborn.

838
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,490
I knew it would be like this.

839
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,820
I...

840
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,850
I'm just trying to carry out my duty.

841
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,420
I know.

842
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,410
You can deal with everything.

843
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:57,940
Okay.

844
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,620
Let's get down to business.

845
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,700
How is

846
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:02,740
the German Institute going?

847
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,260
A new subject

848
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,740
has already been declared.

849
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,530
Then, there can be no further delay.

850
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,540
Pancreatic cancer has always been

851
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,980
a difficult problem to overcome
for General Surgery Department.

852
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,220
Your father's illness

853
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,490
is also the root of your medical study.

854
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,420
Over the years,

855
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,770
you always want to

856
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,540
do research there.

857
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,900
Don't be distracted by other things.

858
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:31,890
Ms. Lu.

859
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,460
Is there anything

860
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,610
you want to say to me?

861
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:39,850
Ms. Lu.

862
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,010
Ms. Lu.

863
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,260
I came here because

864
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,780
I hope that you and Director Yang

865
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,220
can vote for me

866
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,660
at the board meeting.

867
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,860
I knew it.

868
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,580
What can I get in return?

869
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,130
I can assure you

870
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,100
after Infinity passed the voting,

871
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,650
the company's profit

872
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,130
will at least double in the next year.

873
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,780
Don't tell me these baseless things.

874
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,090
No one can tell what will happen next year.

875
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,250
How about this?

876
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,260
I'll sign a contract with you in private.

877
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,340
If I can't achieve

878
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,690
our goals,

879
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,900
I can give you

880
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,050
a share of my equity.

881
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,460
Fangning.

882
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,610
You know what I want.

883
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,650
You know that.

884
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,460
I don't know.

885
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,730
I have a proposal

886
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,930
that satisfies both parties.

887
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,250
I've no idea.

888
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,260
Would you like to hear it?

889
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,460
Well, maybe I can help you.

890
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,140
Go to my penthouse

891
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,300
and I'll tell you in detail.

892
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,890
By the way,

893
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,300
did you put the drugs on the nightstand?

894
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,210
You should know

895
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,530
I made an appointment with Lu Fangning,

896
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,170
right here at the penthouse.

897
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,450
Yes.

898
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:56,860
I'll use it later.

899
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,850
I'll grab a bottle of wine before I go up.

900
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,100
And let her have a "taste".

901
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,960
Okay.

902
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:27,970
Fangning,

903
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,940
I rent

904
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,980
this room all year round.

905
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,460
How's the environment?

906
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:32,540
Do you like it?

907
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:33,890
Pretty good.

908
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,010
Come, drink some water.

909
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:36,810
Thanks.

910
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:40,770
By the way,

911
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,010
Mr. Yang, the idea you said

912
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,810
that can satisfy both parties,

913
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,690
what is it?

914
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,610
We're not rushing.

915
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,780
Since we're here,

916
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,370
let's talk about something else.

917
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,300
Drink some water first.

918
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,490
Excuse me.

919
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,650
Hello.

920
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,580
Ms. Lu.

921
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,890
There's an appointment with...

922
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,130
I'm in a meeting.

923
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,940
I know. I will be there.

924
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,810
Send me the exact time

925
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:21,410
and place.

926
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,300
Okay, don't worry.

927
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:23,780
I'm hanging up.

928
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,930
Ms. Lu is really busy.

929
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,410
Indeed.

930
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,730
So, let's make a long story short.

931
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,860
Mr. Yang, can you tell me

932
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,010
the proposal now?

933
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,650
Let's get married.

934
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,130
Get... Get married?

935
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:42,900
Don't you have a wife?

936
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,690
It doesn't matter.

937
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,330
As long as you agree,

938
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,010
I can divorce her.

939
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,370
But...

940
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,820
Fangning, don't hesitate.

941
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,450
I know your dad

942
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,530
always forces you to go on blind dates

943
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,300
and wants you to give birth to a child.

944
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,060
Instead of marrying a person

945
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,860
you don't like,

946
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,140
you should marry me.

947
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,370
We can cooperate and run the business well.

948
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,610
Think about it.

949
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,890
Your current shares in Deer Sing

950
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,140
and the Yang family's share

951
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,090
can bring LM Deer Sing Group

952
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,770
a bright future that is under our control.

953
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,890
Forget about Infinity.

954
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,770
We can create ten of them,

955
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,690
and still have a smooth sail.

956
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,970
But,

957
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,290
there are no feelings between us.

958
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,370
Marriage is not necessarily

959
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,210
based on feelings.

960
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,690
You get what you want,

961
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,290
and I get what I want.

962
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:34,890
Isn't that quite good?

963
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,250
Let's work together.

964
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,180
Ms. Lu.
