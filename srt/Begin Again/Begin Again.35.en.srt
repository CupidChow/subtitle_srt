[Episode 35]

4
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,910
Youyou.

5
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,229
What should you call me?

6
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:38,740
Little Grandpa!

7
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,990
What should you call her?

8
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,509
Auntie Cai.

9
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,750
You can't call us like that.

10
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,750
Why?

11
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,270
She is my girlfriend.

12
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:52,950
If you called her that,

13
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,350
the relationship would be messed up.

14
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,630
Then should I call Auntie Cai

15
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,740
Little Grandma?

16
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,030
No.

17
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,100
I don't want to be

18
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,190
your grandpa's girlfriend.

19
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,430
Youyou,

20
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,870
you should call me Uncle Simon from now on.

21
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,940
If I were

22
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,470
your Little Grandpa,

23
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,950
I might not get married.

24
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,470
Then you would

25
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,630
only get one red pocket.

26
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,990
If you call me

27
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,190
Uncle Simon,

28
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,350
you can get two red pockets

29
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,550
from me and Auntie Cai

30
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,670
during Lunar New Year.

31
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,070
Isn't that a better deal?

32
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,870
You're happy.

33
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,900
You're smart.

34
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,740
Why are you

35
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,510
so serious with a kid?

36
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,070
You're so much older than him.

37
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,829
Right?

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,620
Besides,

39
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,550
who said I'm going to marry you?

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,710
You...

41
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,430
Who is old?

42
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,110
Then why are you so eager to get married?

43
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,550
Look at

44
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,700
Fangning and Ling Rui.

45
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,470
They have a happy life.

46
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,500
We're different.

47
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,470
How could you tell without trying?

48
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,940
Is this a matter of trying?

49
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,190
Well,

50
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,350
if it doesn't work out, we can always get a divorce.

51
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,550
Lu Yiyao, what's wrong with you?

52
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,940
Why are you thinking about divorce before we get married?

53
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,430
No, wait.

54
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,830
I'm not going to marry you.

55
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,150
Give me a kiss.

56
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,220
Call me Uncle Simon.

57
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,829
Uncle Simon.

58
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,990
Right.

59
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,870
Good.

60
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,100
What do you want? I can get you some.

61
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,350
Never mind.

62
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,060
Aren't you going to have anything?

63
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,510
No, I'm on a diet.

64
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,990
I don't want to look fat on the camera.

65
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,670
Well,

66
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,190
I saw photos

67
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,950
of your new drama.

68
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,780
I think you're in great shape.

69
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,790
You're not fat, really.

70
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,070
You saw them?

71
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,790
Really? I look pretty, right?

72
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,550
The director said I did well

73
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,500
for that love scene.

74
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,790
He's going to give me

75
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,150
a heartbreak scene next.

76
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,830
I believe I can do well.

77
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,550
What's wrong?

78
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,670
It's embarrassing.

79
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,910
I didn't mean that.

80
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,430
I'm not blaming you.

81
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,710
I understand.

82
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,430
One doesn't have to

83
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,900
own what one likes.

84
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,870
Enough about that.

85
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,909
Today is Lu Fangning's birthday.

86
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,100
Let's not

87
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,230
talk about the unpleasant stuff.

88
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,950
Here.

89
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,700
Have some.

90
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,470
This is your favorite.

91
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,150
Don't go on a diet.

92
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,270
I'll gain weight.

93
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,910
No, you won't.

94
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,190
I think

95
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,790
you're already very beautiful.

96
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,980
You know what?

97
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,500
I don't want to lose weight,

98
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,790
and I don't want to be a superstar.

99
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,110
I just want someone

100
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,390
who truly cares about me

101
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,870
and likes me.

102
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,550
That's what I want.

You know?

Yes.

106
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,230
I know.

107
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,430
Do you really get it?

108
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,150
I knew it!

109
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,230
Do you get it now?

110
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:37,909
You're here.

I've always been proud of you.

Nothing,

are the wishes

171
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,870
my sister wanted to realize

172
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,470
before 30 years old.

173
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,350
That was why I wanted to have a child

174
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,710
with you so badly back then.

175
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,990
Your wishes came true.

176

I've always wondered

00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,310

to be a man of perfection.

179
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,670
Maybe

180
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,310
you're the gift

181
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,950
from my sister.

182
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,510
Fangning,

183
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,790
no matter what you want to do,

184
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,230
I'll always be there for you

185
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,460
until you realize your dreams.

186
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,710
So where's my gift?

187
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,910
Isn't the party

188
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,270
the gift

189
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,510
you wanted?

190
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,110
That's all?

191
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,830
What else do you want?

192
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,670
Well,

193
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,150
let me show you

194
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,470
how magnanimous I am.

195
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,030
Listen,

196
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,510
I would be very happy

197
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,940
no matter what you give me.

198
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,270
Thank you.

199
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,790
Thank you, too.

200
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,910
Daughter-in-law,

201
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,310
I'm so happy today.

202
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,470
You must be tired

203
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,070
from being here all night.

204
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,380
Go home and rest well.

205
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,350
-Okay.
-Don't stay up too late.

206
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,300
Let's go home.

207
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,230
Rest well.

208
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,510
In-laws, I'm going home.

209
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:08,950
Drive safely.

210
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,710
See you.

211
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,550
See you.

212
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,230
Tell Ling Rui when you arrive.

213
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,070
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Auntie.

214
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,870
-Goodbye, Auntie.
-Goodbye.

215
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,790
Well, Fangning,

216
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,790
we should leave too.

217
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,310
I'll send her home.

218
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:19,980
Don't worry.

219
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,590
Don't show off here.

220
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,510
I'm going now.

221
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,030
Listen to me.

222
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,790
Don't get too tired.

223
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,030
That's enough.

224
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,150
Bye.

225
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,870
Off you go.

226
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,110
Don't miss me.

227
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,470
Peng Bo.

228
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,310
See you.

229
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,260
-Goodbye.
-Peng Bo.

230
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,670
Good luck.

231
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,550
Good boy.

232
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,070
Dad, I didn't really

233
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,510
have the time for you today.

234
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,150
I'm very happy.

235
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,190
You're not a kid, save it.

236
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,190
You have

237
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,540
your son now.

238
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,950
Youyou.

239
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,030
Do you want to sleep with your daddy and mommy

240
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,460
or your grandma and grandpa?

241
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,100
With grandma!

242
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,940
With grandma and grandpa?

243
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,750
With grandma!

244
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,350
I have chocolate for you.

245
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,350
Grandma and grandpa!

246
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,030
Then you can sleep with grandma.

247
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,710
You naughty boy.

248
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,510
You just don't want to stay

249
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,430
and clean up with us, right?

250
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,580
-That's exactly it.
-That's right!

251
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,630
Okay, just go.

252
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,790
Rest well.

253
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,750
Don't worry, Sister.

254
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,310
-Dad, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

255
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,190
Don't worry, I'll take good care of him.

256
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,580
Don't let him play too many games.

257
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,430
-Okay.
-We'll take care of him.

258
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,390
Bye.

259
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,630
Say goodbye to your mommy.

260
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,190
Goodbye.

261
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,550
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

262
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,160
Goodbye.

263
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,770
Let me carry you.

264
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,110
Slow down.

265
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,030
-Let's go!
-All right.

266
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,870
Okay, it's time to go home.

267
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,750
We should...

268
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,030
No, you got it all wrong.

269
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,020
We are going to our own homes.

270
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,340
Okay, whatever you say.

271
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,510
Suit yourself.

272
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,110
-See you.
-See you.

273
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,100
I would give you a bigger surprise

274
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,140
for your birthday.

275
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,910
Who cares?

276
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,100
Where's Ling Rui?

277
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,670
Don't be so full of yourself.

278
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,740
[The wind chimes broke]

279
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,430
[when you left six years ago.

280
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,829
[Now,]

281

[I'm giving you a new one.]

282
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,940
The kid behind him.

283
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,750
Yes! Higher!

284
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,150
Here.

285
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,310
Keep the change.

286
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,310
Keep the change.

287
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,030
Grandma.

288
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,830
Thank you.

289
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,820
Young man.

290
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,710
Look.

291
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,710
It's the photo from when you were little.

292
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,030
[Fangning,]

293
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,750
[it's the first photo we had together.]

294
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,830
[You lost it,]

295
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,420
[now I got it back.]

296
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,510
[It's the beginning of our destiny.]

297
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,910
[You used to think]

298
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,310
[that everyone else]

299
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,860
[knew me better than you,]

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,630
[therefore,]

301
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,300
[I've recorded every day of the six years]

302
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,470
[in this diary.]

303
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,750
[I hope I could give it to you]

[when we meet again]

305
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,390
[so that you won't be upset anymore.]

306

[From now on,]

307
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,100
[you'll always be the one]

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,350
[who knows me the best.]

309
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:25,990
[MARRY ME]

310
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,550
Is it

311
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,750
a little too mushy?

312
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,230
I was worried

313
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,710
you might not like it.

314
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,390
But I decided

315
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,580
to take a leap of faith.

316
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,590
Fangning,

317
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,870
I'm going to proceed with

318
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,710
the last step now.

319
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,670
Do you remember the coin?

320
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,390
I've had it

321
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,990
melted into the ring.

322
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,950
It was

323
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,110
your deposit before.

324
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,030
Now

325
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,830
it's my turn.

326
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,550
Fangning,

327
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,470
are you willing to

328
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,870
marry me?

329
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,350
Although

330
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,390
you've melted your ring,

331
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,660
but I've always

332
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,070
carried mine with me.

333
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,110
You still have it

334
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,030
after so many years.

335
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,070
It has never left my side.

336
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,710
It's all right.

337
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,630
This ring

338
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,670
was a gift from my husband Ling Rui.

339
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,340
This one

340
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,750
is from my boyfriend Ling Rui.

341
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,390
I want them both.

342
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,350
Great.

343
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,430
You have both now.

344
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,310
You could never run away.

345
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,710
I never want to run away.

346
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,070
You're not going anywhere either.

347
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,390
Fangning,

348
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,670
over the past six years

349
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,870
we've missed out on too many things.

350
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,310
Consider these gifts

351
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,710
as my effort to make amend.

352
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,910
I want your birthday

353
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,270
to no longer be

354
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,710
a day of sadness,

355
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,870
but a day

356
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,190
to remember.

357
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,950
So all of this

358
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,910
is the real birthday present

359
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,630
you prepared for me, right?

360
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,830
Are you satisfied?

361
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,990
Very much so.

362
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,350
Thank you.

363
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,710
Actually,

364
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,230
the present I want the most is…

365
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,830
Okay.

366
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,430
Now I've received the deposit,

367
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,030
and you're mine.

368
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,390
Let's open the gifts inside.

[For the millions of fans, we packed a little surprise for you...]

370
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,580
Is it okay?

371
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,590
It's too much.

372
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,710
Go a little left.

373
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,390
Left. A little left.

374
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,710
Left. A little left.

375
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,510
Is it okay?

376
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,270
A little left. Just a little.

377
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,670
A little more left.

378
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,070
I'm still injured.

379
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,390
I'll give you paid leaves.

380
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,150
Come on.

381
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,510
A little left.

382
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,950
I'm a designer.

383
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,230
How could you order me around

384
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,950
for the hard labor?

385
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,070
Is it upright?

386
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,630
It looks…

387
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,420
Is it okay?

388
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,150
How obnoxious.

389
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,270

393
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,350
are you Ms. Lu Fangning?

394
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,300
Hello.

395
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,070
Hello,

396
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,710
a man asked me to

397
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,020
give you this.

398
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,190
Thank you.

What's wrong?

You look anxious.

417
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,070
Is it because I didn't give you the share?

418
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,870
Are you upset?

419

I'm serious.

420
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,980
I'm just as serious.

You've read the specific terms.

422
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,430
I'll leave the Deer Sing Group.

423
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,270
All my shares

424
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:14,830
will be handed to

425
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,030
Lu Yiyao for safekeeping.

426
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,910
If you need them,

427
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,910
he will give them to you.

428

If you don't want them,

429

whether you want to restart Infinity,

432

it's up to you.

433
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,950
Why?

434
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,100
You've found

435
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,750
what you really want to do.

436
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,390
The shares of Deer Sing Group

437
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,500
don't mean that much

438
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,750
to you now.

439
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,390
While Lu Yiyao has been working for

440
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,070
Deer Sing Group for years.

441
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,990
He didn't just do it for you,

442
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,110
he really wants to

443
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,470
protect Deer Sing Group.

444
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,310
Therefore,

445
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,070
it's only proper to let him have it.

446
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,230
I mean,

447
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,110
this is all too sudden.

448
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,350
Why are you doing this?

449
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,870
You already took it out on me.

450
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,270
I must reflect on my mistakes.

451
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,510
I plan to leave this place.

452
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,190
Fangyu sent me tickets.

453
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,190
He was such a show-off.

454
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,430
I couldn't waste them.

455
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,150
So...

456
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,670
what is your plan

457
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,190
after leaving?

458
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,670
What I'm going to do

459
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,070
is none of your business.

460
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,110
Come on.

461
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,950
If it's none of my business,

462
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,790
why did you come to

463
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,910
celebrate my birthday for me?

464
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,470
Since you've done that,

465
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,100
I'll consider that

466
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,830
that I'm a friend to you.

467
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,550
Besides, it's been years.

468
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,070
Why can't I just care about you?

469
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,950
I'm going to continue traveling around the world.

470
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,110
Don't worry.

471
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,310
I won't send you

472
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,190
postcards this time.

473
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,630
But if you need…

474
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,470
No, thank you.

475
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,470
It's been so long.

476
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,430
I haven't really lived for myself.

477
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,310
I want to see the world again.

478
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,310
Who knows?

479
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,750
Maybe I'll find out

480
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,910
what my purpose is.

481
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:56,750
Maybe

482
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,860
that's what Lu Yue wants.

483
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,790
It might happen soon.

484
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,150
Good luck.

485
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,030
Thank you.

486
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,550

The hair gel you used today

490
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,070
smells fine.

491
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,870
I like it.

492
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,020

494
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,230
let's get married.

495
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,940
No.

496
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,670
I'm still young.

497
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,990
Maybe I'll meet

498
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,430
someone better in the future.

499
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,990
[No.]

500
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,510
You feel insecure

501
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,830
because you're old.

502
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,670
Or perhaps you might not

503
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,190
meet another girl prettier than me.

504
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,670
Is that why you're getting impatient?

505
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,590
[No!]

506
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,980
Old man.

507
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,180
[Ling Rui and I]

508
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,750
[are going to have another wedding.]

509
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,350
[It's the real wedding.]

510
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,550
[I'm giving you a chance to be my best man.]

511
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,310
While I was single the whole time,

512
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,500
my friends are already getting married for the second time.

513
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,830
Cai Siyu,

514
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,390
your story should be

515
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,790
at the climax by now.

516
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,110
I'm coming.

517
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,820
Lu Yiyao?

518
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,110
Siyu.

519
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,110
I don't feel well.

520
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,670
Siyu.

521
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,670
I miss you so much.

522
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,590
Siyu.

523
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,830
Siyu.

524
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,430
I've turned thirty...

525
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,390
Thirty...

526
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,270
five,

527
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,510
six,

528
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,030
seven.

529
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,670
I'm almost forty!

530
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,150
Why am I so old?

531
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,550
The kid called me grandpa!

532
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,270
Why am I still alone?

533
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,030
Lu Yiyao.

534
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:04,910
Have you reached

535
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,950
male menopause?

536
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,230
Who said that? I'm only…

537
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,670
I've looked up the symptoms of male menopause.

538
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,910
Lack of concentration.

539
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,030
Loss of memory.

540
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,830
Hair loss.

541
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,300
I'm suffering from all of them.

542
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,780
It's okay.

543
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,750
Calm down.

544
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,180
One more thing...

545
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,750
My waist is getting weaker!

546
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,350
Lu Yiyao, what are you doing

547
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:40,990
at my home

548
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,190
drunk and crying?

549
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,460
I...

550
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,350
Sleep.

551
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,150
You...

552
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:52,910
Sleep.

553
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,950
I'm a little tired.

554
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,910
I am drunk.

555
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,990
Just like what you wrote in the novel.

556
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,310
Become a couple

557
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,070
when the boss is drunk.

558
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,750
That would solve my problems.

559
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,940
Solve what?

560
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,950
What are you afraid of?

561
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,150
You wrote those details

562
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,910
in your novels.

563
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,630
They aren't that detailed.

564
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,190
Siyu.

565
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,230
I,

566
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,550
I've prepared everything.

567
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,870
Let me show you.

568
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,190
See?

569
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,220
I just want to marry you.

570
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,550
I'm not demanding anything.

571
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,870
I'm just afraid

572
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,830
that

573
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,070
if you're

574
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,510
only my girlfriend,

575
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,270
and you don't give me any promise,

576
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,870
you might leave me

577
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,230
once a nicer,

578
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,070
better-looking guy shows up.

579
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,750
Don't think

580
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,469
so little of me!

581
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:22,350
I'm just worried.

582
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,989
Listen to me.

583
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,949
I'm already so old,

584
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,219
and my waist is getting worse.

585
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,310
Who would want a sorry old man like myself?

586
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,670
That's enough. Sober up.

587
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,030
I used to be a jerk.

588
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,310
It was wrong for me

589
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,190
to treat you that way.

590
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,429
It was my fault.

591
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,030
But I love you!

592
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,310
Do you know?

593
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,510
I love you, Siyu!

594
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,630
I'm begging you to forgive me.

595
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,949
Please, Siyu.

596
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,150
Forgive me.

597
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,030
Do you still love me?

598
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,710
I'm begging you.

599
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,910
I'm begging you.

600
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,420
That's enough.

601
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,790
You're not old.

602
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,350
You're so handsome.

603
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,630
You will still be

604
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,790
a handsome old man later on.

605
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,150
Actually,

606
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,990
I've always thought it was such a shame.

607
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,380
You have a nice figure,

608
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,150
but I didn't see anything that day

609
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,710
and nothing happened.

610
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,470
Wouldn't that be a shame?

611
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:52,830
Dr. Ling,

612
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,390
your project on pancreatic cancer

613
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,590
has won the recognition

614
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,230
of many international medical institutions.

615
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,790
You've achieved greatness at a young age.

616
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,780
This is the last question.

617
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,910
It's been the main discussion

618
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,860
of many female readers.

619
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,830
You're married

620
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,110
at such a young age.

621
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,220
It's said that your wife was

622
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,390
just as outstanding.

623
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,190
Dr. Ling,

624
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,870
could you tell us

625
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,990
about your wife?

626
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,310
Her name is Lu Fangning.

627
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,470
She's

628
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,910
funny,

629
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,550
bossy…

630
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,470
She's just an ordinary person.

631
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,030
But she

632
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,140
is hardworking...

633
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,030
and remarkable.

634
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,310
A person

635
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,390
will meet a lot of

636
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,500
unexpected problems in life.

637
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,820
But she's the one

638
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,670
whom I want to

639
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,950
spend my life with.

640
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:47,380
[Fashion Doctor: Feature Interview with Ling Rui]

641
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,270
I don't think this photographer

642
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,310
is as skillful as me.

643
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,550
Your daddy looks ugly.

644
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,230
See? His left face is so puffy.

645
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:51,950
I don't think so.

646
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,910
Daddy is always so handsome.

647
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,870
But he looks better in person

648
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,950
than in this photo.

649
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,910
Don't you think

650
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,070
I'm better at taking photos?

651
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:00,750
Mom,

652
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,150
then why did you buy so many copies?

653
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,710
You don't understand.

654
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,590
I can't let

655
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,740
your dad's handsome look

656
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,020
distract the others.

657
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,070
I've heard the good news

658
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,110
about you and Dr. Ling.

659
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,870
See?

660
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,460
Why two rings?

661
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,470
But these two

662
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,820
are not as bright as the one before.

663
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,350
I didn't know

664
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,190
Dr. Yu was suffering

665
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,070
from weak eye-sights.

666
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,350
But why do I have two?

667
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,780
It's because

668
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,190
I'm no ordinary woman.

669
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,740
It took two rings

670
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,990
to tie me close to him.

671
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,070
Anyway,

672
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,430
Dr. Yu, just remember,

673
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,830
Ling Rui is mine

674
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,350
from now on.

675
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,340
I know.

676
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,030
Well,

677
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,110
do you need me to keep an eye on him

678
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,430
so the home-wreckers inside

679
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,870
and outside the hospital

680
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,150
won't seduce him?

681
00:37:59,150 --> 00:37:59,750
What if

682
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,230
you are one of them?

683
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,670
Here's the deal.

684
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,670
I'm not interested in married men.

685
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,070
If someone's harassing him,

686
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,110
let me know at once.

687
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,790
Deal.

688
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,830
But…

689
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,230
What do you want?

690
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,830
3D Surgery Simulators.

691
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,750
I want three of those.

692
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,110
I'll settle for two.

693
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,950
One. At least one.

694
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,710
Two.

695
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,790
Cool.

696
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,470
Deal.

697
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,950
You must inform me firsthand.

698
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,030
I heard everything.

699
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,590
What was the deal?

700
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,470
I have to go now.

701
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,870
Don't forget my machines.

702
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,710
Dad.

703
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,790
Mom and that lady

704
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,030
made a deal.

705
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,070
A deal?

706
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,870
What deal?

707
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,350
Nothing.

708
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,590
I'm going to donate

709
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,220
some medical equipment to your hospital.

710
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,910
Really?

711
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,430
That's a good thing.

712
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,270
Why did you buy so many?

713
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,300
Because you're handsome.

714
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,790
I can't have enough of it.

715
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,550
But my photograph skill

716
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,540
is better.

717
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,670
-Of course.
-Yes.

718
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,390
Good-looking. Can't have enough of it.

719
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,070
-Can't have enough of it.
-Can't have enough of it.

720
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,670
Can't have enough of it.

721
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,350
Can't have enough of it.

722
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,430
Can't have enough of it.

723
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,750
It's so nice.

724
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,230
So nice.

725
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,340
I'm going to make breakfast.

726
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,270
Sleep in for a little.

727
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,750
Okay.

728
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,350
Ling Rui.

729
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,830
You've done so much for me.

730
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,550
Is there anything

731
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,790
I can do for you?

732
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,030
Aside from making breakfast,

733
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,390
you can do everything else for me.

734
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,270
What was that?

735
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,470
Is my cooking so awful?

736
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,750
Your cooking is amazing.

737
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,150
Fangning,

738
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,230
I need you

739
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,510
to be with me

740
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,390
when I'm happy

741
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,590
and sad.

742
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,030
I will.

743
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,740
When I'm hurt

744
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,830
and feel vulnerable.

745
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,430
I will.

746
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,670
Whether I'm successful

747
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,870
or hitting rock bottom.

748
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:20,830
I will.

749
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,150
When

750
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,830
I'm old

751
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,950
and ugly.

752
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,470
About that…

753
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,630
No promises.

754
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,830
What did you say?

755
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:46,990
I will

756
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,020
always be there for you.
