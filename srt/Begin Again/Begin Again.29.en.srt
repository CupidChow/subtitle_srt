[Episode 29]

4
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,530
I...

5
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,780
I want to tell you something.

6
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,500
What's up?

7
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,570
Actually...

8
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,380
Actually...

9
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,060
You know, six years ago,

10
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,620
I went to talk to Lu Fangning.

11
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,490
And I told her that

12
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,140
you received an invitation

13
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,020
from the German Institute.

14
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:56,970
I...

15
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,690
I was trying to get her to talk you into going.

16
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,100
But who knew that

17
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,340
she would divorce you straightaway.

18
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,660
And I certainly didn't expect her

19
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,580
to have a baby

20
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,100
without telling us.

21
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,810
Mom.

22
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,650
Calm down.

23
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,460
It's not your fault.

24
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,329
I've been holding it in

25
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:21,690
all this time.

26
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,770
I finally got the chance

27
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,210
to say it out.

28
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,770
It's okay. It's all over now.

29
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,660
-My heart hurts.
-Pretty Granny.

30
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,210
Are you not feeling well?

31
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,130
Granny's heart is aching.

32
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,090
Let me pat it for you, pretty Granny.

33
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,100
My baby.

34
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,130
Such a good boy.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,490
My head hurts.

36
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,010
It hurts so much.

37
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,450
Pretty Granny,

38
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,860
let me massage it for you.

39
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,540
Lu Youyou, my arm hurts.

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,620
Here.

41
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,300
-My shoulder hurts.
-Pretty Sis.

42
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,820
Let me massage it for you.

43
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,090
I'll be your doctor,

44
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,500
just like Dad.

45
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,300
Youyou.

46
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,090
Did you wash your hands?

47
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,660
Shut up.

48
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,620
It's been so long.

49
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,579
There's not even a phone call.

50
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,530
What in the world is going on?

51
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,780
Is he coming back or not?

52
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,610
Did Youyou betray me?

53
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,660
That's impossible.

54
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,050
What kind of grown-ups can handle those three moves?

55
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,380
Youyou finally got sent back.

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,420
Youyou!

57
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,620
Youyou!

58
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,580
-Hello.
-Hi.

59
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,210
What are you two doing here?

60
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:08,890
Is this because

61
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,530
you realized that you were being a bit harsh last time,

62
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,490
so you came here

63
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,820
to apologize?

64
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,810
We're all adults.

65
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,820
We should take responsibility for our words.

66
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,100
That's enough. Step aside.

67
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,180
Youyou.

68
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,210
Youyou.

69
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,420
Little Mommy is here to visit you.

70
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,420
Where are you?

71
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,660
Look

72
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,410
what I brought you.

73
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,660
All the finest toys.

74
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,610
Where are you?

75
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,580
I adore you so much.

76
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,659
Youyou.

77
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,530
Did you hear that

78
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,210
she just called herself 'little mommy'?

79
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,180
Yeah.

80
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,220
Doesn't she always

81
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,250
like to compete with you?

82
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,180
This time, she's okay

83
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,180
with being just the little mom.

84
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,170
What more could you ask?

85
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,250
My son would never want

86
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,290
a silly mom like her.

87
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,060
How ridiculous.

88
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,650
What about you?

89
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,010
You must be here to apologize.

90
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,260
Youyou.

91
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,370
Is Youyou here, Pingping?

92
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,980
-No.
-No?

93
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,460
I wanted to share

94
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,500
a short story with him.

95
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,730
You...

96
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,410
So you're here to see my son too?

97
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,850
I wrote a new book.

98
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,890
There's a kid in the story

99
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,300
who is about Youyou's age.

100
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,490
I want to use him as a model.

101
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,010
Alright.

102
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,740
You two can stop looking.

103
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,330
Lu Youyou isn't here.

104
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,460
He's at his dad's home.

105
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,340
His biological dad.

106
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,570
You two brought

107
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,500
so much stuff.

108
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,810
It must be hard to carry them around.

109
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,620
Just leave them here.

110
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
As for your new story,

111
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,410
if you're having any problems with it,

112
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,450
you can just talk to me.

113
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,090
I do have

114
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,500
some experience in this area.

115
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,820
What a pity that Youyou is not here.

116
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,090
What a pity.

117
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,540
I canceled a schedule for nothing.

118
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,490
I have yet to finish writing and conceiving

119
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,330
my new story.

120
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,500
I'll tell you about it next time.

121
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,890
Oh, yeah. I'll give these presents

122
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,330
to Youyou in person next time.

123
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,460
Yup. See you next time.

124
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,490
How can you two be like this?

125
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,500
How can you only care about the kid

126
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,580
but not the mom?

127
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,170
So all these that you've brought,

128
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,650
none of them is for me?

129
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,810
I'll tell you what.

130
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,140
Since you two

131
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,820
want to see Youyou so badly,

132
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,730
I have an idea.

133
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,210
I can take you to him.

134
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,980
I know the address.

135
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,930
Did you drive here?

136
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,770
I'll drive.

137
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,700
I drive fast.

138
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,020
You guys are my good friends.

139
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,210
If you want to meet Youyou,

140
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,810
I'm sure Ling Rui wouldn't mind.

141
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,890
Isn't there...

142
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,370
Something wrong.

143
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,660
What's wrong with me?

144
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,810
What's wrong with

145
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,450
helping my friends to fulfill their dreams?

146
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,060
Was Lu Fangning

147
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,340
ever so helpful?

148
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,490
I don't think so.

149
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,860
She was never like this.

150
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,530
And she said that

151
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,540
she is our friend.

152
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,740
It's even more wrong

153
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,580
for her to say that you're her friend.

154
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,730
-Yeah!
-What's going on?

155
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,940
She'd never possibly call me her friend.

156
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,090
Oh my. Lu Fangning.

157
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:30,650
Are you out of your mind?

158
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,620
That's enough.

159
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,340
You guys can cut it out.

160
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,650
I'm still here.

161
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,820
Well...

162
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,409
Actually...

163
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,820
I want to see Youyou too.

164
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,890
Fighting for custody?

165
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,450
How could Dr. Ling be like this?

166
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,770
I'll tell you what.

167
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,980
I'm going to transfer you some money.

168
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,170
No, that wouldn't be enough.

169
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,460
I'll transfer you a large sum of money

170
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,210
so you can hire the best lawyers.

171
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,460
Plus, we can utilize

172
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,940
my influence in the media

173
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,620
to gain some compassion points

174
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,970
for a single mother like you.

175
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,410
Alright, you need to stay out of this.

176
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,220
What's wrong with Dr. Ling doing this?

177
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,900
He was kept in the dark for six years.

178
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,890
True.

179
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,650
Then I'll send Dr. Ling some money too.

180
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,970
Just a little bit

181
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,380
less than yours.

182
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,260
How is that?

183
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,140
He didn't do anything wrong.

184
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,850
I'm the one who's wrong.

185
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,540
If we can't do this the conventional way,

186
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,770
we can try some tricks instead.

187
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,260
What do you mean by that?

188
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,850
Seduction.

189
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:48,740
Is it different

190
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,890
from what I did before?

191
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,460
Of course, it's different.

192
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,580
You used to do it for love.

193
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,260
This time, it's for...

194
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,690
Dr. Ling

195
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,690
just wants a baby.

196
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,210
Just give him one.

197
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,180
Problem solved.

198
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,010
You get one, he gets one.

199
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,740
You each have one. How fair is that.

200
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,370
Seduction.

201
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,740
Why are you two acting like this?

202
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,260
Is one not enough?

203
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,780
Then, two.

204
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,170
Or three?

205
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,330
Four should be enough.

206
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,010
It's exhausting to have babies.

207
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,820
I feel bad for you.

208
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,820
Thank you.

209
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,650
Is quantity the problem here?

210
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,250
If the quantity is not the problem, what is?

211
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,010
If you have an idea, say it.

212
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,289
With your brain,

213
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,860
anyone can think of something like that.

214
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,010
So, what do you have in mind?

215
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,220
Still, seduction.

216
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,700
Then what's the difference?

217
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,780
Isn't that what she just said?

218
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,060
Well, it's kind of a cliche.

219
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,370
The way to a man's heart

220
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,490
is through his body.

221
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,220
Isn't that right?

222
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,170
Yup.

223
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,410
Yes.

224
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:54,980
I don't think

225
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,180
this is how the saying goes.

226
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,610
The stomach is part of the human body.

227
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,820
-Exactly.
-Look at yourself.

228
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,620
Trade yourself

229
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,940
in return for Dr. Ling's forgiveness.

230
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
It's a small price to pay.

231
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,460
Plus, you'll be getting two for the price of one.

232
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,650
What a great bargain!

233
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,610
You're right!

234
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,220
It's a great bargain!

235
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,890
Here.

236
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,300
Cheers!

237
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,090
What's with that reaction?

238
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,980
I think someone's just being a chicken.

239
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,850
Yeah.

240
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,060
Scared.

241
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,450
-Chickened out.
-Exactly.

242
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,820
She used to have thousands of tricks

243
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,010
up her sleeve.

244
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,780
I know, right?

245
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,770
How is she such a coward now?

246
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,650
Who says I'm a coward?

247
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,460
Who says I'm scared?

248
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,950
-So, when do you plan to go?
-So, when do you plan to go?

249
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,700
Right now!

250
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,980
Or... Tomorrow.

251
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,420
It's getting a little late out there.

252
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,700
I'll go tomorrow.

253
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,220
I'll definitely go tomorrow. Sit down.

254
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,980
Let me see

255
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,060
what your mom packed for you?

256
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,290
Why did your mom

257
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,650
pack two towels?

258
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,570
Did she tell you

259
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,260
how to use them?

260
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,050
Yes.

261
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,370
The yellow one is for my face

262
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,650
and the blue one is for the shower.

263
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,820
Put it back where it was.

264
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,010
-Put it back.
-Okay. Wait a second.

265
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,570
What?

266
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,530
We're going to have to wash your face with this one later.

267
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,340
Oh, okay. Then, take it.

268
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,010
Take it.

269
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,740
What are you doing?

270
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,420
I'm holding a towel.

271
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,770
Give it to Daddy.

272
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,690
Here.

273
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,610
-Daddy.
-What's wrong?

274
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,010
You're so great.

275
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,930
You haven't seen me for five years

276
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,170
and you're still considering

277
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,250
Mommy's feelings.

278
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,820
Are you still worried that

279
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,570
I might miss Mommy?

280
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,380
No wonder Mommy always says that

281
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,100
my daddy is an angel.

282
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,890
But I'm a good kid.

283
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,930
I'll be good and

284
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,100
stay with Daddy.

285
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,690
I'm not going to miss Mommy.

286
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,970
Youyou, you're so sweet.

287
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,420
Daddy needs to take this.

288
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,260
Who's that?

289
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,530
Is Mommy missing me?

290
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,770
Maybe not.

291
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,380
Are you answering it?

292
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,890
Yes.

293
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,580
Hello.

294
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,530
Yes.

295
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,140
Tomorrow?

296
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,530
What is it?

297
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:32,650
Wait a minute.

298
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,050
Alright, I get it.

299
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,370
I'll be there tomorrow morning.

300
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,500
Yeah.

301
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,540
Okay, bye.

302
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,140
-Youyou.
-What's up?

303
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,860
Daddy promised you that

304
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,610
I'm going to take you out

305
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,180
to play tomorrow, right?

306
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,530
Yeah. Why?

307
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,570
What's the matter?

308
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,020
Daddy might have to

309
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,300
apologize to you now.

310
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,580
What is it?

311
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,330
Is there anything wrong?

312
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,700
Because tomorrow,

313
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,140
Daddy has to go to the hospital.

314
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,620
There's an emergency

315
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,730
that Daddy has to take care of.

316
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,730
So, Daddy probably can't keep my promise.

317
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,010
Hospital?

318
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,380
I've got a new idea.

319
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,020
Daddy.

320
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,500
Can you take me with you?

321
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,570
You want to go to the hospital too?

322
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,260
Yeah.

323
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,180
I want to see

324
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,260
where Daddy works.

325
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,690
I'm a little doctor, after all.

326
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,340
You're a little doctor too?

327
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,650
Yeah. Did you forget?

328
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,460
I treated my grannies.

329
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,650
You treated your grannies?

330
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,530
Daddy almost forgot.

331
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,010
Alright.

332
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,690
Daddy will take you

333
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,620
to the hospital tomorrow.

334
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,700
Yay! I'm coming!

335
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,060
Let's go wash my face.

336
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,940
You want to wash your face?

337
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:49,730
Yes.

338
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,770
-Go, go, go.
-Wash your face.

339
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,300
Wash your face.

340
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,690
Wash your face.

341
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,890
So cute.

342
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,410
So handsome.

343
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,420
So lovely.

344
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,980
Have you guys watched enough?

345
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,700
He's so cute.

346
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,570
Later,

347
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,660
I need to discuss a case with the other departments.

348
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,650
Youyou will be here during that time.

349
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,180
Please take care of him for me.

350
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,370
Don't worry, Director.

351
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,700
We will definitely take good care of

352
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,850
your excellent achievement.

353
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,740
That's not necessary.

354
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,980
You be careful yourselves.

355
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,810
Be careful of what?

356
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,540
Baby.

357
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,620
Daddy

358
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,570
is going to be busy with work for a while.

359
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,700
You can stay here,

360
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,540
but do not disturb

361
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,820
these aunties and uncles,

362
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,530
okay?

363
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,980
Okay, Daddy.

364
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,090
High five.

365
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:36,810
One more time.

366
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,250
I'll get going.

367
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,460
My heart is melting.

368
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,410
Thanks.

369
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:44,900
This little face.

370
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,370
Don't scare him.

371
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,530
Little fingers.

372
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,620
Hey, there.

373
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,330
My last name is Yang.

374
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,780
You can call me Dr. Yang, okay?

375
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,130
Hi, Dr. Yang.

376
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,250
Good boy.

377
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,050
Is that my godson?

378
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,610
Get up, get up.

379
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,210
Let me have a look.

380
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,450
Excuse me, excuse me.

381
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,290
Get your hands off.

382
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,420
You know who I am, right?

383
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,490
No.

384
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,340
I finally meet you.

385
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,530
I'm your godfather.

386
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,340
I already have a godfather.

387
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,620
Listen to me.

388
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,330
The other godfathers

389
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,500
will have to come after me.

390
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,650
Your dad and I

391
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,930
grew up together.

392
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,860
And we've been

393
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,770
best friends for over a decade.

394
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:19,740
In the hospital,

395
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,090
we're also the best partners

396
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,300
and the best rivals.

397
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,850
As of today,

398
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,700
I'm your curly-haired godfather.

399
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,250
Come here.

400
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,770
Yeah.

401
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,260
Closer.

402
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,720
Yeah.

403
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,060
It feels so good.

404
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,970
No wonder Daddy

405
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,780
likes to touch Mommy's head.

406
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,690
He has got a sense of humor.

407
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,060
He's so different

408
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,250
from what Ling Rui was like.

409
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,740
Don't you guys have work?

410
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,780
Back to your work.

411
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,060
-Let's go.
-What about you?

412
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,290
Where's Ling Rui?

413
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,970
He has a case discussion.

414
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,730
How am I supposed to get her phone number?

415
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,330
Come here. Let godfather hold you.

416
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,450
Careful, careful.

417
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:11,770
Youyou.

418
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,050
Can godfather ask you

419
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,810
a question?

420
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,490
Okay.

421
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,490
Do you know

422
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,610
your mom's friend

423
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,450
with the name, Tang Ping?

424
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,780
My mom's friend?

425
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,730
You know...

426
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,900
The one who

427
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,290
might be a little silly

428
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,010
when she looks at you,

429
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,540
and kind of stupid when she talks.

430
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,930
The one

431
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,170
who is stupid and loud

432
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,410
but still accepted by Mommy?

433
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,780
Yeah, it's her.

434
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,860
Do you have her phone number?

435
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,260
No.

436
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,180
But I have Mommy's number.

437
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,250
Well, can you give me

438
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,450
your mommy's number?

439
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,570
Come here.

440
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,220
-Professor Luo.
-Professor Luo.

441
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,170
Hello.

442
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,580
Hi, Professor Luo. My name is Youyou.

443
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,930
My daddy is Ling Rui.

444
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,570
Do you know me?

445
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,260
Yeah.

446
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,650
Daddy told me that

447
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,850
Professor Luo is his teacher,

448
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,620
just like his daddy.

449
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,220
So you're

450
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,700
like Youyou's grandpa,

451
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,890
very important.

452
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,130
What a smart kid.

453
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,250
You're

454
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,850
the pride of medicine

455
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,260
and the future of the general surgery department.

456
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,050
Wait a minute.

457
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,980
Come on, kid.

458
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,570
This is a gift from grandpa.

459
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,620
I specifically picked the one with pictures.

460
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,570
You can take a look.

461
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,140
I'll teach you whatever you don't understand.

462
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,970
Professor Luo, don't you think it's...

463
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:28,980
Grandpa.

464
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,020
When did my dad

465
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,100
read this book?

466
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,820
18 years old.

467
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:34,820
Freshman year.

468
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,140
Then, I can't read it now.

469
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,980
Why?

470
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,330
Because I'm only five years old.

471
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,490
If I read this book

472
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,770
so many years earlier than Daddy did,

473
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,810
Daddy might think that

474
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,530
I'm so much smarter than him.

475
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,810
He'll be sad.

476
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,180
Grandpa.

477
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,130
Let's just keep this

478
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,570
as our secret.

479
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,610
Don't make Daddy feel bad.

480
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,450
Our secret? Alright.

481
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,290
Here.

482
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,610
Let's keep this between us.

483
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,140
Okay.

484
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,370
-Pinky promise.
-Pinky promise.

485
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,220
This kid's too smart.

486
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,609
He's like a prodigy.

487
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,329
Dr. Ling was right.

488
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,900
We should worry about ourselves.

489
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,300
I'm leaving.

490
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,849
Mom.

491
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,329
Auntie.

492
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,300
Auntie, I...

493
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,940
I'm here to pick up my son.

494
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,089
I'm not here to do...

495
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,420
Bad things.

496
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,050
Why that reaction?

497
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,540
What's going on?

498
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,250
She...

499
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,330
What if your scream...

500
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:36,820
Oh, no.

501
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,260
Disturbed our neighbors?

502
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,340
Did you just see a ghost?

503
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,490
Yeah.

504
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,980
Lu Fangning, the ghost.

505
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,730
She is right outside the door.

506
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,330
At the door.

507
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,130
I got this.

508
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,130
What are you doing?

509
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,690
Aunt...

510
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,300
Auntie...

511
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:08,810
I...

512
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,100
You're here all of a sudden.

513
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,610
I didn't have time to prepare.

514
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,970
Why don't you just keep

515
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,570
these books first?

516
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,290
We'll fill in the rest later.

517
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,220
By the way.

518
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,540
I highly recommend this one.

519
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,370
"Was It the Chocolate Pudding?"

520
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,380
You know what.

521
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,730
If things aren't well-handled,

522
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,770
more often than not,

523
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,980
children would see their parents' separation

524
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,900
as their fault.

525
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,810
Alright, that's it for now.

526
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,540
Okay.

527
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,930
Study hard.

528
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:39,930
Okay.

529
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,770
-I...
-Keep learning.

530
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,690
Okay. Uhm...

531
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,050
Two for the price of one?

532
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,210
Now I can't even

533
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,340
keep the little one.

534
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,410

537
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,770

540
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,570
What are you doing?

541
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,980
I'm taking out the trash.

542
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,890
You've already opened the door.

543
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,250
It's my turn now.

544
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,930
I'll throw the trash in her face.

545
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,250
You'll only be violating public cleanliness.

546
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,210
Just one bag.

547
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,570
Go ahead.

548
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,530
Don't worry about her.

549
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,460
Here you go.

550
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,490
Look through it carefully.

551
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,530
Ling Rui and Youyou are in the hospital.

552
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,700
There's still someone

553
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,140
who's nice to me in this family.

554
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,570
Thanks.

555
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,610
I'll take the trash out for you.

556
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,180
Youyou, did you like the candy?

557
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,170
Let me take you

558
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,900
to get something better,

559
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,300
okay?

560
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,690
Thank you, sweet Sis.

561
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,170
So cute.

562
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:33,940
Let's go.

563
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,820
Don't let your guard down.

564
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,210
He really is something.

565
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,140
Get lost.

566
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,810
Why are you getting this everywhere?

567
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:42,740
Let me help you with it.

568
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,460
Dr. Yu.

569
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,740
Ling Rui's child?

570
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,170
Hi, Auntie. I've seen you before.

571
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,580
Have you?

572
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,770
Did the auntie see me

573
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,980
and then purposely walk around me?

574
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,940
Youyou, what did you just say?

575
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,620
This auntie

576
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,140
has got my attention.

577
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,930
Sis,

578
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,660
I don't want to buy food anymore.

579
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,930
I'll be in the office and wait for Daddy.

580
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,970
Alright then, let's go.

581
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,530
Should I go in there?

582
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,980
If I go in now,

583
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,140
what would Ling Rui's colleagues think?

584
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,570
If I don't go in there,

585
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,010
it means I was

586
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,140
shut out of the door three times for nothing.

587
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,050
Which also means...

588
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,090
Which also means I carried these books for nothing.

589
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,570
How would I dare take the initiative?

590
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,250
I'd be lucky to get out of this in one piece.

591
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,090
We're off work now. I can finally ask you.

592
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,180
Is Dr. Ling's ex-wife

593
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,260
really that awesome?

594
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:26,610
Of course.

595
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,380
Or else, how could she

596
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,490
have given birth to such a smart kid like Youyou?

597
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,730
That's true.

598
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,810
But why

599
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,820
did she divorce Dr. Ling?

600
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,330
They said it was due to

601
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,610
incompatible personalities.

602
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,810
Divorce is actually something very normal.

603
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,570
But Director Ling

604
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,850
is so close to Dr. Yu.

605
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,060
Anyway, she is the ex-wife.

606
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,530
What ex?

607
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,940
Did Dr. Ling said that

608
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,020
he has got a girlfriend?

609
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,370
Cut the nonsense.

610
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,010
I saw it all.

611
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,930
Director Ling has the ring on his finger.

612
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:51,840
Stop it.

613
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,530
Tone it down. Don't let Youyou hear it.

614
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,060
It might leave a mark on the child.

615
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:55,600
Let's go.

616
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,290
[That's true.]

617
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,620
[I never even asked]

618
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,580
[if Ling Rui is still single.]

619
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,460
Auntie, would you like some candy?

620
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,900
I've got some really good candies.

621
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,380
No, thank you.

622
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,930
[Ling Rui's not here.]

623
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,050
[Should I just bring Youyou back?]

624
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,650
Am I cute, Auntie?

625
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,060
Cute.

626
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,780
There's no water.

627
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,730
I'll get it.

628
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,170
Auntie, have some water.

629
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:58,810
Thank you.

630
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,970
[What's wrong with Youyou?]

631
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,530
[He got won over so fast.]

632
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:06,700
[This doctor]

633
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,530
[looks kind of familiar.]

634
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,690
[Isn't she the one who had a blind date with Ling Rui?]

635
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,570
Auntie, do you like me?

636
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,740
Just so so.

637
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,690
That's what my little grandpa said.

638
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,620
You guys are alike.

639
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,210
I'm so unique.

640
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,540
How can I be like your grandpa?

641
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,690
We're not alike.

642
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,210
Little grandpa's so boring.

643
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,770
You're more interesting.

644
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,770
You think I'm very good?

645
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,500
Yeah.

646
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,530
What about your daddy?

647
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,660
Do you think he's good?

648
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,250
Of course, he is!

649
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,060
How about this?

650
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,660
Take your daddy as the standard.

651
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,740
Is there anyone around you

652
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,930
that is like your daddy?

653
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,460
Wouldn't that be perfect?

654
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,050
But someone like Daddy...

655
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,010
It's hard to find, right?

656
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,770
Your daddy already has your mommy.

657
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,170
Auntie is all alone.

658
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,890
I'm so lonely, kid.

659
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,610
Yu Shiyi.

660
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,450
The talented girl in med school.

661
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,530
Lu...

662
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,930
Nurse Liu.

663
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,980
How do I look?

664
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,420
Fine.

665
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,690
Compared to before?

666
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,940
As beautiful as ever.

667
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,650
Did I get it on my teeth?

668
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,530
No.

669
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,970
Youyou.

670
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,290
Mommy!

671
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,020
Mommy is here. Are you happy?

672
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,570
Yeah.

673
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,090
Go ahead. You can go to the toilet.

674
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,050
Mom, I don't want to go to the toilet.

675
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,250
Yes, you do.

676
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:24,580
Yeah.

677
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,330
I suddenly want to go to the toilet.

678
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,610
Good boy. Slowly.

679
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,380
Be careful.

680
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,020
Hello.

681
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,450
Hi, I'm Lu Fangning.

682
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:38,770
I know.

683
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,810
I'm Yu Shiyi.

684
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,890
I'm Youyou's mother,

685
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,370
Ling Rui's ex-wife.

686
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,570
I'm Ling Rui's classmate and colleague.

687
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,210
I know I have a pretty hand,

688
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,530
but Ms. Lu,

689
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,290
you don't have to

690
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,730
keep holding it.

691
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,410
I feel that

692
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,410
Youyou kind of like you.

693
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:09,770
This little guy

694
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,450
is slightly less annoying

695
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,930
compared to other kids.

696
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,890
[What is she trying to say?]

697
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,660
[Is she saying Youyou is annoying?]

698
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,490
Thanks.

699
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,260
It's probably because he inherited

700
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,850
some good genes from me and Ling Rui.

701
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,370
But I think

702
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,020
he's more similar to you, Ms. Lu.

703
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,300
[This woman...]

704
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,690
[Is she trying to say that Youyou isn't like Ling Rui?]

705
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,900
I know you.

706
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,850
Ling Rui told me that

707
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,220
you two were

708
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,940
in the same study group in college.

709
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,050
He said that

710
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,650
it was a very pure fellowship.

711
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,900
Young and naive.

712
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,650
Well, we were still immature.

713
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,370
But things are better now.

714
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,050
We're in the same department.

715
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,890
Our relationship could be closer.

716
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,330
[To what point?]

717
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,290
Speaking of which,

718
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,130
my relationship with Ling Rui

719
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,900
is much closer.

720
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,580
So close that we have a baby.

721
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,650
But I heard that

722
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,850
you two

723
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,220
have been divorced for six years.

724
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,170
You should know that

725
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,820
Ling Rui didn't even go to Germany for you.

726
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,210
Giving up his dream

727
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,580
for such

728
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,130
minor emotional injury.

729
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,570
It wasn't worth it.

730
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,010
Worth it or not

731
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,180
is not up to you.

732
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,770
Well, as far as I know,

733
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,610
because of me,

734
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,340
Ling Rui didn't even

735
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,530
change his phone number in the past six years.

736
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,370
He knew I had gastric problems.

737
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,450
So every time he saw me,

738
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,090
he'd tell me to

739
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,490
cut down on coffee.

740
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,770
The other day,

741
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,130
I was feeling just a bit unwell.

742
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,010
Straightaway, he dragged me to his office

743
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,010
to check on this

744
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,050
and that...

745
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,330
Checked on this...

746
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,570
Excuse me.

747
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,330
Ling Rui hasn't changed

748
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,330
his phone number

749
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,170
ever since college.

750
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,410
If it's really like

751
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,220
what you just said,

752
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,610
was he actually waiting for me?

753
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,260
Plus, Ling Rui is a doctor.

754
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,010
Don't you know

755
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,950
-how doctors are?
-Daddy.

756
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,890
-You're back.
-Everyone is somehow sick

757
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,290
-in our eyes.
-Why are you here?

758
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:04,730
Perhaps

759
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,970
when he saw you,

760
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,420
he thought your condition worsened.

761
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,770
Now, as for whether

762
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,290
it was worth it or not.

763
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,730
If it's not up to me,

764
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,570
is it up to you?

765
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,810
Of course, it's not up to me either.

766
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,700
Ling Rui's matter

767
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,980
can only be up to him.

768
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,290
That's right.

769
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,140
Then, how would you know that

770
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,490
he wouldn't be with me?

771
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,730
I just know.

772
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,570
Why?

773
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,490
Because Ling Rui is a virtuous person.

774
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,770
While he is good with me,

775
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,650
he would never

776
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,290
give other women

777
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,450
unnecessary attention.

778
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:43,900
Then, what about you?

779
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:45,890
Do you deserve

780
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,970
a good man like Ling Rui?

781
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,090
In the last six years,

782
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,970
was there never anyone else in your life?

783
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,020
Of course, I deserve him.

784
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,570
Besides,

785
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,130
I already have

786
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,050
a good man like Ling Rui.

787
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,420
Why would I be interested in someone else?

788
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,180
Why are you laughing?

789
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,290
Ms. Yu.

790
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,460
Dr. Yu.

791
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,060
Dr. Yu, I'm sorry.

792
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,500
Never mind.

793
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,780
Ling Rui.

794
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,130
When did you get here?

795
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,100
Just now.

796
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,420
That's just the way she is.

797
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,850
I apologize on her behalf.

798
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,250
It's alright.

799
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,260
I've understood everything

800
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,740
just now.

801
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,420
Why are you apologizing to me?

802
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,370
What did you understand?

803
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,530
For my sake, forget it.

804
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,250
I'll buy you a meal next time.

805
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,140
Good.

806
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,220
Then, let's go to the place

807
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,540
we used to go to all the time.

808
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,580
I'll keep that in mind.

809
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,090
No problem.

810
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,690
Ms. Yu.

811
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,420
Let's go.

812
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:41,900
Let's go.

813
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,330
Ling Rui.

814
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,370
I'm sorry.

815
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,380
I sort of

816
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,660
overreacted just now.

817
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:53,970
But...

818
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,850
But what?

819
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,650
I admit that my attitude was pretty bad back there.

820
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,020
But you didn't have to

821
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,700
apologize to Dr. Yu for me.

822
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,380
Really.

823
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,860
Did you defended her just now

824
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,490
because she's your...

825
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,940
My colleague and classmate.

826
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,050
I don't think so.

827
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,100
Lu Fangning.

828
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,370
Why did you

829
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,620
say those things

830
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,690
to Dr. Yu just now?

831
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,890
What did I say?

832
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,900
Things like I wouldn't get involved with anyone else,

833
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,820
that I'm the best man

834
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,060
in the world,

835
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,410
and that

836
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,130
you're not going to be with anyone else.

837
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,410
This is all because...

838
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,490
I was trying to protect him.

839
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,090
He's our son.

840
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,450
His image,

841
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,490
your image, and my image

842
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,930
are all important, right?

843
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,220
Mom, I wasn't there just now.

844
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,330
Youyou.

845
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,420
Cover your ears.

846
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,210
Mom, I'm covering my ears now,

847
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,780
but I can still hear you.

848
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,490
Then...

849
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,010
Then you just...

850
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,210
Just go and sit there.

851
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,420
Run. Move your short legs.

852
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:15,820
Okay.

853
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,540
You can say it now.

854
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,770
I...

855
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,660
I did this entirely for

856
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,770
the happiness of Youyou

857
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,890
in the future.

858
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,780
Really.

859
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,210
To be honest, Ling Rui,

860
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,250
I know you're a

861
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,250
mature man.

862
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,410
You have your requirements

863
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,610
concerning your family and relationships.

864
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,410
I can

865
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,060
fully understand it.

866
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,090
It's just that as Youyou's mom,

867
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,250
I think I have the right

868
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,260
to give you a heads up.

869
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,340
Just a heads up.

870
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,740
I think

871
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,060
she's not the kind of person

872
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,690
in every aspect...

873
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,260
Her personality, you know.

874
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,370
It's not exactly suitable to be Youyou's

875
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,340
stepmother.

876
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,700
That's all?

877
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,010
Yeah.

878
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,370
Okay.

879
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,210
I got it.

880
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,780
When I need something,

881
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,220
I'll let you know.

882
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,340
How about this.

883
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,660
I'll make a list of Youyou's preferences.

884
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,570
I'll text it to you later.

887
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,260
Is there a reason that you're here?

888
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,340
If there's nothing,

889
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,380
I'll get going.

890
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,260
Youyou.

891
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,810
I got something.

892
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:34,770
What's the matter?

893
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,010
Can Youyou

894
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,260
come to my place tonight?

895
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,140
Lu Fangning.

896
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,020
We had a deal.

897
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,970
I know. I just thought that

898
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,330
Youyou is still young now.

899
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,370
And he had just accepted you.

900
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,530
If he keeps having to go back and forth

901
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,820
between different living environments,

902
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,410
I think he might not get used to this.

903
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,410
He might not sleep well either.

904
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,090
I don't think

905
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,130
he looked uncomfortable.

906
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,570
Youyou can't leave me.

907
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,290
Well, he can't live without me either.

908
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,500
We need to get along.

909
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,050
You can see

910
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,170
how happy

911
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,170
Youyou was

912
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,010
when he called me 'daddy'.

913
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,340

915

916
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,179
Okay.

917

Then, let the three of us get along together.

918
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,570
Tonight,

919
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,489
Youyou and I will go to your place.

920
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,850
You wait here for me.

921
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,850
I'll go back to my office

922
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,170
to take care of something.

923
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,699
Come here, Youyou.

924

You stay here and watch Mommy.

928

Wait for me here, okay?

929
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,530
Okay, Daddy.

930

-Leave Mommy to me.
-Good boy.

My books are still in the office.

933
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:08,810
How was it?

934
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,660
Shouldn't you thank me for what happened just now?

935
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:11,770
Thank you for what?

936
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
Didn't you hear it?

937
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,420
Your ex-wife didn't get your son

938

939

Obviously,

941

I'm the catalyst

942

for your relationship.

943
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,890
She took the bait as soon as I put it out.

944
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,490
How have I not noticed that

945
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,010
you like to meddle in

946
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,290

947
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,490
Oh, please.

948
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,330

951
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,050
looks intimidating,

952
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,810
but she's actually

953
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:34,980
not that scary.

954
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,810
Just fool her a bit,

955
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,050
and she would believe it.

956
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,770
So you enjoyed fooling her?

957
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,050
Can I?

958
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,890
I mean, think about it.

959
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,450
Let her get jealous every day,

960
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,450
and your progress with her

961
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,780
could speed up by four times.

You can take off the word 'ex' in no time.

963

Isn't that a good deal?

964
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,060
No, thank you.

965
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,370
Why?

966
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,850
It's not necessary.

967
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,570
Alright.

968
00:35:58,810 --> 00:35:59,780
Then, you can just be alone

00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,100
So what other good qualities

1043
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,860
do I have?

1044
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,740
Give me more compliments.

1045
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,620
You...

1046
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,170
I don't think it's right to say in front of you.

1047
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,650
What's the big deal?

1048
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,570
As a fan,

1049
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,810
complimenting your idol

1050
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,220
should be a basic skill.

1051
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,220
I'll say more then.

1052
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,220
Go ahead.

1053
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,450
Even though you have bad acting skills, like to parade your ability,

1054
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,770
and you've done a lot of embarrassing things,

1055
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,940
I'd like to thank God that

1056
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,980
people don't take you

1057
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,500
as a villain.

1058
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,940
And you

1059
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,730
always do things

1060
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,010
without much consideration.

1061
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:51,980
You never think about the consequences.

1062
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,050
You've offended a lot of people,

1063
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,530
including the fans behind them.

1064
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,180
You may have

1065
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,100
a lot of haters than fans.

1066
00:39:59,300 --> 00:39:59,970
I...

1067
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:00,890
But...

1068
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:01,820
But?

1069
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,410
I think that...

1070
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,660
It's because you're very simple.

1071
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,090
You would rather fight yourself

1072
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,100
than scheme

1073
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,610
against other people.

1074
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,010
You're very kind.

1075
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:16,890
You never do things

1076
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,090
that would hurt other people.

1077
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,300
Even if you liked Ling Rui,

1078
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,930
you didn't go

1079
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,090
and expose the contract marriage

1080
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,340
between Ling Rui and Lu Fangning, right?

1081
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,850
And most importantly,

1082
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,620
you've always been

1083
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,970
really, really,

1084
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,180
genuinely trying hard.

1085
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,820
Even if this doesn't work out,

1086
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,900
and the other one fails,

1087
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,380
even if you're bad at acting,

1088
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,890
even if you just can't make a breakthrough,

1089
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,410
so what?

1090
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:42,930
Am I right?

1091
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,500
All of us

1092
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,700
have your back.

1093
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,770
Although all of your compliments

1094
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,380
don't sound good,

1095
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,700
why do they make me cry so much?

1096
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,490
Let me have a look.

1097
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,290
It's my endorsement. I can use it.

1098
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,020
Uhm...

1099
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,100
Do you want to

1100
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,890
use the restroom and touch up your makeup?

1101
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,300
Daddy, here you go.

1102
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,100
Thank you.

1103
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,490
Youyou is such a good boy.

1104
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,500
You even know how to change your own shoes.

1105
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,010
Come.

1106
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,570
Youyou.

1107
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,580
Why don't you play with your toys?

1108
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,330
Daddy would like to

1109
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,330
have a talk with Mommy.

1110
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,100
Okay?

1111
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,980
Okay.

1112
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,290
That's my good boy.

1113
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,900
Is he really going to sleep here tonight?

1114
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:01,850
Is he...

1115
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,170
Is he going to sleep with me?

1116
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,450
Do I really have to seduce him?

1117
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,260
No, no.

1118
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,900
I thought you were getting me water.

1119
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,540
Why are you drinking it yourself?

1120
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,700
It's because...

1121
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,060
It's cold water.

1122
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,410
I want to get some hot water for you.

1123
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,690
I'll get you some hot water.

1124
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:31,620
Don't worry.

1125
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,930
I'll just drink this.

1126
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,450
Ling Rui.

1127
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,850
I think

1128
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,660
you might want to reconsider.

1129
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,410
You can

1130
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,490
go home tonight,

1131
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,260
and come to pick Youyou up tomorrow.

1132
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,170
You can come in the morning.

1133
00:42:59,170 --> 00:42:59,890
Really.

1134
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:00,970
It won't take too much of

1135
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,130
your time together.

1136
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,850
Lu Fangning.

1137
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,130
I realized

1138
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,780
you really like to change your mind.

1139
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,860
To educate a child,

1140
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,540
the parents need to lead by example.

1141
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,700
No.

1142
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,050
It's just that

1143
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:17,930
I don't have your toothbrush,

1144
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,010
razor or anything else here.

1145
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,890
We can order them online.

1146
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,570
And the bedsheets,

1147
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,770
your clothes...

1148
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,810
I can use yours.

1149
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,250
Or...

1150
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,930
Do you mind?

1151
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,100
I don't mind.

1152
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,580
Why would I mind about it?

1153
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,020
But...

1154
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,940
But what?

1155
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,810
But I snore when I sleep.

1156
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,930
I didn't want to disturb your sleep.

1157
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,940
You never had that problem before.

1158
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,130
It just happened in the last six years.

1159
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,900
It's so bad that it can't even be cured.

1160
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,010
I mean it.

1161
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,340
So?
