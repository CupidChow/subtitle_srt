Do you know

5
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,640
who the bride is today?

6
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,759
No idea.

00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
Lu Fangning.

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,440
The general manager of LM Deer Sing Group.

9
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,960
The daughter of the Lu family.

10
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,400
Having a favorable family background
and with a beautiful look,

11
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,880
she is competent, powerful

12
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,840
and dominant.

13
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,930
No one in Deer Sing Group

14
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,280
dares to go against her.

15
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,480
Lu Fangning

Everyone who interacts with her

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
will all be conquered by her.

21
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,680
There is no exception.

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520
Of course, my son-in-law

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,320
should be great.

24
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,400
He can take a fancy to my daughter.

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,600
He must be extraordinary.

26
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,120
Ling Rui,

Ms. Lu.

31
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,839
I will report to you

32
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,920
today's work schedule.

33
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,410
Ms. Lu.

34
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,560
Today the opening price of Deer Sing is

35
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,400
35.65 yuan.

36
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,920
1.3 yuan higher

37
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,760
than we predicted yesterday.

38
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,720
The Finance Department

39
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,440
has finished auditing.

40
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,090
They found

41
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,560
a four million cash transfer record

42
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,520
from your brother, Mr. Lu Fangyu's

43
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,760
private account.

44
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,400
By the way,

45
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
this is the 38th time

46
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,159
your brother applies to meet you.

47
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,040
What would you like to do?

48
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,610
I won't see him.

49
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,880
Freeze his credit cards.

50
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,640
He will have three days

51
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,600
to return the money.

52
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,040
Yes. This is the earning statement
of the month.

53
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,600
The Finance Department

54
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,490
has completed it.

55
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,400
It showed a year-over-year increase

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,240
of 27%.

57
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,320
This is ahead of the industry's average.

58
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,200
If this trend continues,

59
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,890
the turnover at the end of the year

60
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,760
will be at least two times more than
that of the previous year

61
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,159
if everything goes well.

62
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,840
At 2.00 p.m., you have a conference call

63
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,120
with Fengmu Group, the supplier.

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
In a while, you will have to attend

65
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
the board meeting

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,720
to discuss the R&D

67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,600
of the new brand.

68
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,680
Above is

69
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,280
today's schedule.

70
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,159
If there are any changes,

71
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:57,880
I will report to you immediately.

72
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,710
Ms. Lu.

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,360
Ms. Lu, one last thing...

74
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,160
Mr. Lu wonders

75
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,330
when are you free
to have a blind date this week?

76
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,840
When I went through A106

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,960
of the first floor,

78
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,560
I saw

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,440
an empty shelf

80
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,960
with nothing display on it.

81
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,000
I will inform the person in charge

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,680
to arrange it again.

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,600
Can you explain

84
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,080
why does the household magazine shelf

85
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,770
opposite of the B209 store

86
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,680
on the second floor

87
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,400
has a fashion magazine

88
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,320
on it?

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,080
I will send someone to handle it.

90
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,400
I saw a female employee of M311

91
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,440
sitting on our brown leather sofa

92
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,200
which cannot be sat on.

93
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,920
She was flirting with her client.

94
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,409
I will notify the HR

95
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:35,520
to fire her

96
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,440
and pursue the responsibility

97
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,880
of the staff who recruited her.

98
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,000
Fire, fire, fire!

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
You only know to fire the staff.

100
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Do you think you are in a drama,

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,880
acting a potent boss?

102
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,650
Do you think you look handsome?

103
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,159
Just a warning will do, isn't it?

104
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,800
Yes.

105
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,720
What did you say just now?

106
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,000
Mr. Lu asked you...

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,010
The previous one.

108
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,800
There's

109
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,480
a regular board meeting later.

110
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Why do we need to spend money again?

111
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,560
Why are you building another new brand?

112
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,800
Just tell me.

113
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,250
How does that make sense?

114
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,960
Mr. Lu is semi-retired.

115
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
Ms. Lu is so young,

116
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,490
and is eager to prove herself.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,360
After all, she is a girl.

118
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,600
It's natural for her to have short sight.

119
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,680
Yes.

120
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,650
Just because she's a Lu?

121
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
What's so great about that?

122
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,640
It's great to have the surname Lu.

123
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,680
But, to take this seat,

124
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,760
one needs to be capable enough.

125
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,730
However,

126
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,600
I don't have any tips

127
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,520
to share with you.

128
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
I'll just

129
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
give you a suggestion.

130
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,480
Do more, speak less.

131
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,880
Besides,

132
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,040
the broad director who spoke just now.

133
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,080
Please look at Deer Sing's profit

134
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,240
last year.

135
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,760
The turnover is three times more than

136
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,640
that of the year before.

137
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,760
To be specific,

138
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,120
285%.

139
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,520
I welcome anyone

140
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,640
to screw Deer Sing Group up in this way.

141
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,080
Everyone, please have a look at the data.

142
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,280
According to the basic data,

143
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
the mean age of Deer Sing Group's
main customers

144
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,920
is increasing.

145
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
Basically, every month,

146
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,840
we lose young customers.

147
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,490
Before other household brands

148
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,200
take away the youth market completely

149
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,600
and surpass

150
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
Deer Sing Group's market share,

151
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,320
we must surpass ourselves.

152
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
Infinity

153
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,400
is our new weapon

154
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,360
to take over

155
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,680
the youth market.

156
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,540
[Infinity]

157
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,970
Everyone,

158
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,650
I don't have to

159
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,360
prove myself.

160
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,880
I am a member of the Lu family.

161
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,800
I can do nothing

162
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,280
because my family has enough money.

163
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,040
But board directors,

164
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,960
if you want to double

165
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,640
your income next year,

166
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,920
this is the chance.

167
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,280
A week later,

168
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,560
we will be here again to vote for

169
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,120
the establishment of Infinity.

170
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,840
You are welcome

171
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,280
to bring along your brains...

172
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,760
Your love for Deer Sing in your brains.

173
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,120
The meeting is dismissed.

174
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,840
What does she know?

175
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,120
Narrow view.

176
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,560
Birds of a feather.

177
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,480
Hypocrites.

178
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,960
Ms. Lu.

179
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,320
The market survey of Infinity

180
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,200
and the brand planning

181
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,530
have been ongoing for a year.

182
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,160
But the board members are against it.

183
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,440
I am afraid that we cannot make progress.

184
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,640
How many possibilities do we have?

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,520
According to the rules, we need
more than half of the votes

186
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,600
to get the proposal passed.

187
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
Now, we have 17 directors.

188
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,160
Mr. Li and Mr. Yang at the meeting,

189
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,000
and other three directors

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,080
have stood firm against this.

191
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
Mr. Tang still holds a wait-and-see attitude.

192
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,919
Other directors haven't expressed
their stands.

193
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,000
Besides, Ms. Xiao who was absent

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,240
has a high status on the board.

195
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,559
Her vote is very important.

196
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,039
Recently, no one has clearly stood for

197
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,720
the setup of Infinity.

198
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,560
To speak generously,

199
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,840
there will be 16 votes against you.

200
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,240
There is one vote for me.

201
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,520
Your own vote.

202
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,160
Why Xiao Yingzhi

203
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,960
has been absent for

204
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
the board meeting?

205
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,880
Ms. Xiao is on maternity leave.

206
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,520
She just delivered last week.

207
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Let's go to the hospital.

208
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,240
Do we need to prepare any gifts?

209
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,680
Lu Fangning?

210
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,160
Yingzhi.

211
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,200
You have recovered so well!

212
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,840
How can you look prettier than

213
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,600
when you were

214
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,160
in the company?

215
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,280
You are really glowing.

216
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,560
Let me have a look.

217
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,680
You have recovered so well.

218
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,120
Oh, baby.

219
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,800
The baby is so cute.

220
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,880
He looks just like you.

221
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,000
Yingzhi, what's his name?

222
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,680
Ms. Xiao, Ms. Lu.

223
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,640
Take your time.

224
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,760
I've got to go.

225
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,370
Go ahead.

226
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,240
Do you have dissociative personality disorder?

227
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,800
Ms. Xiao is so humorous.

228
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,040
I have sent the baby diapers,

229
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,480
and have come here

230
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,840
to pay you a sincere visit.

231
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,120
I won't bother you any longer.

232
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,560
I know you are here

233
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,240
for the voting.

234
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,440
But I can tell you now

235
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,640
that I'm not going to vote for it.

236
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,480
Ms. Lu,

237
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,640
Infinity is

238
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,920
a household brand

239
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,960
mainly for young people.

240
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,440
But, as far as I know,

241
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,610
Ms. Lu,

242
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,960
in your life,

243
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,880
you have nothing

244
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,840
other than your career.

245
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,160
How can you make me believe that

246
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,480
a person with no spice of life

247
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,640
can run

248
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,520
such a brand well?

249
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,200
For you,

250
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,440
what is life?

251
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,920
Do I have to give birth to a child,

252
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
feed him and raise him to have a life?

253
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,880
Don't you want to take a look, Ms. Lu?

254
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,450
I believe, in the near future,

255
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,360
you will not have

256
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
such opportunities.

257
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,280
Alright. Let me see

258
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,840
what is it on earth

259
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,080
that makes

260
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,120
our demonic woman to give up

261
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,560
the opportunities for earning money

262
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,680
so willingly?

263
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,760
He's so small.

264
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,560
Well.

265
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,320
Since you are here,

266
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,560
why don't you stay longer?

267
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,690
Also,

268
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,520
I can go out enjoy the scent of coffee.

269
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,960
Take good care of him.

270
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,280
Here.

271
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,280
Are you holding it or not?

272
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,760
It's okay if you don't want it.
But, why are you crying?

273
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,760
Don't cry!

274
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,160
It's not me who made you cry.

275
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
I didn't scold you.

276
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,760
Don't cry!

277
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,160
It seems like

278
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
I was bullying you.

279
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,560
Xiao Yingzhi.

280
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,890
Xiao Yingzhi, sorry.

281
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,480
Your baby is crying.

282
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,200
Well.

283
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,320
Stop crying!

284
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,680
This is not working.

285
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,360
Don't cry!

286
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,720
Well.

287
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,240
Let me try.

288
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,050
You can hold him like this.

289
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,800
Support his head with one hand.

290
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,240
Then, use the other hand

291
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,400
to support his bum and thighs.

292
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
The newborns

293
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,960
have a soft spine.

294
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,040
So, you must be careful.

295
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,200
Although babies were born,

296
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,120
they also enjoy sounds and embrace.

297
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,120
You can calm him down

298
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,680
by letting him listen
to your voice and heartbeat.

299
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,240
Then, he will feel safe.

300
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,360
Do you want to touch him?

301
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,760
Babies also like

302
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,680
being touched.

303
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,450
Are you that terrifying, baby?

304
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,960
He smiled.

305
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,850
All right, so,

306
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,730
lie down

307
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,410
and have a rest.

308
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,920
He's so cute.

309
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,560
I was just passing by

310
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,840
when I heard the baby crying.

311
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,760
So, I decided to drop by.

312
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,680
Thanks, doctor.

313
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,760
It's my job.

314
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Take your time. I shall leave first.

315
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,640
[Mr. Li]

316
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,480
You are here

317
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,840
just for this?

318
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,320
Who did it? Let me have a look.

319
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,720
Mr. Li,

320
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,850
Yingzhi has recovered well.

321
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,760
Don't worry.

322
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,800
Gao Erfan's photography skills

323
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,960
have really improved.

324
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,440
Here.

325
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,680
Lu Fangning.

326
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,200
Lu Fangning.

327
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,720
Lu Fangning.

328
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,440
Good photos. I will give you an increment.

329
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,800
Hello.

330
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,840
No need to make appointments for now.
Leave him alone first.

331
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,200
I will deal with the contract.

332
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,760
I am at...

333
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,960
Hello.

334
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,640
Which room am I in?

335
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,480
It doesn't matter.

336
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,160
So,

337
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,920
I will see you in the hall

338
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,800
of the hospital.

339
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,760
Okay, bye.

340
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,520
I am finished. Please continue.

341
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,280
You are not leaving yet?

342
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,600
I am so sorry.

343
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,120
Well...

344
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,490
Today, I forgot my business card

345
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,640
when I came out.

346
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,650
Later,

347
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,690
we can get to

348
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,480
know each other properly.

349
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,640
Miss,

350
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,520
do you know that

351
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,920
this is my office?

352
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,880
Doctor,

353
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,880
have you ever thought that

354
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,840
maybe it's our fate

355
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,320
that guides me into your office?

356
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,530
How?

357
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,520
Phone number? WeChat?

358
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,600
I can accept both.

359
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,800
Have you seen Director Ling?

360
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,080
I just saw him entering his office.

361
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,200
Alright.

362
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Follow me.

363
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,319
Ling Rui,

364
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
here is the working schedule

365
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,960
for the next week.

366
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,800
Do you want to have a look?

367
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,599
I will look at it later. Leave it here.

368
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,560
No one is here. Why did you pull the curtain?

369
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,079
Open it.

370
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,000
I... I am changing.

371
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,720
Stop staring.

372
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,880
No, I need you to sign here.

373
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,440
Open the curtain now.

374
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,040
I will sign it later. Later!

375
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,660
[Ling Rui]

376
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,040
I am changing my trousers. Don't move!

377
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,360
Come on.

378
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,120
Hurry up.

379
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,280
Hurry up!

380
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,170
I am taking off my trousers. Don't open it!

381
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,850
Come on.

382
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,040
Let me have a look.

383
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,680
There's nothing to see.

384
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,560
Just a glance!

385
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,240
Just let me have a look.

386
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,960
There's nothing to see.

387
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,730
-No!
-Just once!

388
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,240
Just let me have a look.

389
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,210
Are you hiding someone here?

390
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:45,720
Just let me have a look.

391
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,200
Let me have a look.

392
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,120
Let me have a look.

393
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,040
-Let me have a look.
-Peng Bo.

394
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,480
Okay.

395
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,560
You are mean.

396
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,330
I am leaving.

397
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,160
Hi.

398
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,280
I... I am leaving.

399
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,360
Con... Continue.

400
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,530
He's gone.

401
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,080
You're blushing.

402
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,160
Why are you so shy?

403
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,240
I don't even feel shy.

404
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,400
By the way,

405
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
I was talking about your abs.

406
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,800
I was saying that

407
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,840
your abs are hard.

408
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,040
Thanks.

409
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,760
I should be the one to say thanks.

410
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,640
This is an office.

411
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,080
You shouldn't enter without permission.

412
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,240
I didn't.

413
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,560
There was an emergency.

414
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,360
An emergency?

415
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,400
Nothing. It's over now.

416
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,320
After all, for the things just now,

417
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,560
you can just regard them as

418
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,240
me losing control of myself

419
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
and coveting for beautiful things.

420
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,280
That's all.

421
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
That's a compliment.

422
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,640
Anyway,

423
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,000
I will apologize

424
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,960
for bothering you.

425
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
I accept your apology.

426
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,200
But, please don't do this anymore.

427
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,640
If you meet someone else,

428
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,400
you may get bullied.

429
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,240
Girls should know

430
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,520
how to protect themselves.

431
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,250
Thanks.

432
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,410
Same to the boys.

433
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,880
Dr. Ling,

434
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,200
you look really good.

435
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,320
You buttoned wrongly.

436
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,800
Ms. Lu.

437
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,200
-Gao Erfan.
-Yes!

438
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,360
Have you ever seen an angel?

439
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,280
Do I look like someone

440
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,490
who'll get bullied easily?

441
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,120
You have done well today.

442
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,080
You said about raising my pay just now.

443
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,840
By how much?

444
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,800
Next, we'll have to convince

445
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,560
the old man.

446
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,600
You can have a half-day off.

447
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,600
Thanks, Ms. Lu.

448
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,890
I heard that last month,

449
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,800
for no reason,

450
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,520
you wanted to change the spokesperson
of the company.

451
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,680
The month before last month,

452
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,400
many people saw

453
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,120
the partners of our company

454
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,080
walked out of your office,

455
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,520
looking really embarrassed.

456
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,240
Let me ask you.

457
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,160
Where are your manners?

458
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,840
What do you really want?

459
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,010
Your wife has delivered misinformation.

460
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,520
The spokesperson of the company is a female.

461
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,530
The partner is also a female.

462
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,280
I am a female too.

463
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,880
I will not

464
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,800
be rude to them.

465
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,760
But to you, it's different.

466
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,200
Ms. Lu is a female?

467
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,880
If you don't remind me,
I wouldn't have known that.

468
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,040
My mother gave birth to me.

469
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
You didn't raise me.

470
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,130
You might really have no idea.

471
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,530
Alright.

472
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,760
I won't say too much.

473
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,200
Prepare yourself.

474
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,000
Get ready to get married.

475
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,760
I won't get married.

476
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,440
Why?

477
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,280
You're not young.

478
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
You are a woman.
If you don't want to get married,

479
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:36,960
what are you going to do?

480
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,160
I am smart and wealthy.

481
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,040
Why should I get married?

482
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,800
Does marriage do any good to me?

483
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,680
Mom.

484
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,880
Don't eavesdrop.

485
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,720
Smart and wealthy.

486
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,800
Is this why you don't want to get married?

487
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,600
You are a woman.

488
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,520
If you don't get married or bear a child,

489
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,960
your life as a woman

490
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,920
will not be complete.

491
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,330
Get it?

492
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,320
When you set the sales target

493
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,400
of the company,

494
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
you didn't say that.

495
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,480
You are so eloquent.

496
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,000
Remember.

497
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,520
Within a year,

498
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,800
if you can get married

499
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,400
and bear a child,

500
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
then it's okay.

501
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,090
If you can't do that,

502
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,160
even if the entire board

503
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,520
approve of Infinity,

504
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,640
I have the

505
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,400
veto power

506
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,760
to ban Infinity with just one vote.

507
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,160
You're the one

508
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,920
who has no right to ban Infinity.

509
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,200
Fangning.

510
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,000
Sister.

511
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,480
Are you having dinner at home?

512
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,680
I will cook for you.

513
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,600
I don't want to eat your cooking.

514
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,560
It's terrible.

515
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,760
Look at what you have done.

516
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,240
Sister.

517
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,040
Don't leave in such a hurry!

518
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,640
Wenbin,

519
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,800
did you hear what your good daughter

520
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,720
say to me?

521
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,640
She has no respect even to me,

522
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,720
much less to you,

523
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,840
the Chairman's wife,

524
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,960
and the lawful stepmother.

525
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,440
You can stay where you like.

526
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,160
Sister.

527
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,680
I cannot afford to pay back

528
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,560
of four million yuan.

529
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,280
Seeing that

530
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,640
I'm your brother,

531
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,000
give me some extension, please?

532
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,400
Sister, I didn't use the money

533
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,720
to do anything bad.

534
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
I only lend it out.

535
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,000
Please, give me one month.

536
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,280
One month.

537
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,800
Five days.

538
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,520
I will give you five more days.

539
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
If you still cannot pay it,

540
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,240
for the rest of your life,

541
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,680
you'll not get your credit card back.

542
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,560
Sister.

543
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,840
Sister.

544
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,600
Mr. Lu is semi-retired.

545
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,400
Ms. Lu is so young,

546
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,280
and is eager to prove herself.

547
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,880
After all, she is a girl.

548
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,200
It's natural for her to have short sight.

549
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,810
In your life,

550
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,840
you have nothing,

551
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,760
other than your career.

552
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,880
How can you make me believe that

553
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,290
a person with no spice of life

554
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,640
can run

555
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,440
such a brand well?

556
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,720
Remember.

557
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,280
Within a year,

558
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,600
if you can get married

559
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,250
and bear a child,

560
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,960
then it's okay.

561
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,680
If you can't do that,

562
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,560
even if the entire board

563
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,920
approve of Infinity,

564
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,040
I have the

565
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,680
veto power.

566
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,240
To ban Infinity with just one vote.

567
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,190
[Gao Erfan]

568
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,000
Ms. Lu,

569
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:21,920
Chairman

570
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,130
just announced to the board

571
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,080
that they would suspend

572
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,520
the establishment of Infinity.

573
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,480
Okay.

574
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,600
Okay.

575
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,560
In fact, my wishes

576
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,360
are really simple.

577
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,680
Before 30 years old,

578
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,640
I want to get married,

579
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
have a baby

580
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,160
and

581
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,080
my own household brand.

582
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,640
Old fox, I promise you

583
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,410
to get married and have a child in a year.

584
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,880
But, you'd better keep your words.

585
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,930
Don't play any trick

586
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,800
to hinder me.

587
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,680
Although I agree to

588
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,360
your terms,

589
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,600
it doesn't mean that

590
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,720
I agree that

591
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,120
a woman should act like a woman.

592
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,760
Marriage and family are never reasons

593
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,200
to trap a woman.

594
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,400
Listen to me carefully.

595
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,840
You and my destiny

596
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,440
are no match for me.

597
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,280
You can place his head here.

598
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,560
Arms, here.

599
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,840
It's not that hard.

600
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,720
I will have my own baby.

601
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,720
Mr. Right...

602
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,280
Ms. Lu,

603
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,440
this is the blind date list

604
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,130
prepared for you.

605
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,200
What do you think of this one?

606
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,040
Ugly.

607
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,440
What about this one?

608
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,000
Uncultured.

609
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,840
He's good.

610
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,040
Spoilt.

611
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,680
These are young and talented men

612
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,840
who match

613
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,000
your intelligence and age.

614
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,960
I think your Chinese is not good.

615
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,840
You don't know
what's a young and talented man.

616
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
Intelligence and age?

617
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,600
At least let me know your standard.

618
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,000
So, I can have a direction

619
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
in finding men who match your standard.

620
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,520
Anyhow, none of these are acceptable.

621
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,520
How do I find other candidates?

622
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,240
Do you like someone like me?

623
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,520
Just tell me if I'm wrong.

624
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,930
You don't have to do this.

625
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,360
Hello, everyone.

626
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,760
It's been a while.

627
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,170
I miss you too.

628
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,200
Don't you always say that

629
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,760
I'm very athletic?

630
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,370
Today, I'll show you

631
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,520
the results

632
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,920
of my daily practices.

633
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,920
This is where

634
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,040
I usually practice.

635
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,360
It's quite tiring.

636
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,080
But, the coach said that I have potential.

637
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,810
So, cheer for me!

638
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Raise your hands.

639
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,800
Focus.

640
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,600
Coach.

641
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,720
Am I fighting

642
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,760
against the female coach today?

643
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,640
I've informed her.

644
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,370
She's on leave today.

645
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,440
Perhaps

646
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,560
you can practice with her?

647
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,000
Lu Fangning?

648
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,760
Ready, go.

649
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,320
Please save me some face, Fangning.

650
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,520
My fans are watching.

651
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,280
Let me win one round.

652
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,690
Whatever happened before

653
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,280
shall be forgotten.

654
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,520
Come on.

655
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,560
She broke my arm.

656
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,960
Lu Fangning, you broke my arm.

657
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,640
Stop filming.

658
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,040
It hurts.

659
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,240
Dial 120.

660
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,250
Yes.

661
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
Lu Fangning,

662
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,770
if you dare to leave me with the ambulance,

663
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,960
I will tell my father to

664
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,960
vote against you

665
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,760
during the board meeting.

666
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,810
Send me to the hospital now.

667
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,760
The nearest one.

668
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,400
I want to go to the hospital.

669
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,320
Hospital...

670
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,560
Gao Erfan, send her in.

671
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,250
I need to deal with something.

672
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,000
Yes, Ms. Lu.

673
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,930
Where are you going?

674
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,560
Gao Erfan.

675
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,920
-Ms. Tang.
-Don't move.

676
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,080
Stay there!

677
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,330
Stay there!

678
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,880
You're responsible for this.

679
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
What did I do to you

680
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,520
to be responsible for this?

681
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,970
My arm is fractured.

682
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,480
If you dare to leave,

683
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,680
I will tell my father not to vote for you.

684
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,160
You're so noisy.

685
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,080
You!

686
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,720
Lu Fangning, wait a moment.

687
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,960
Push it.

688
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:16,560
What's the matter?

689
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,920
Your legs are broken too?

690
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,400
I don't care. Push it.

691
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,240
I think

692
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,560
you hurt your brain too.

693
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,480
Are you going to push it?

694
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,000
If you don't,

695
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,400
I will tell my father not to vote for you

696
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,080
I know. I know.

697
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,520
Your father, your father...

698
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,400
You keep talking about

699
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,680
your father.

700
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,320
Well, maybe I can bring you

701
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
to the Pediatric Department.

702
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,800
How about that?

703
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,480
You!

704
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,760
I know.

705
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,200
Ms. Tang Pingping,

706
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,240
I'll bring you to register and pay the bills.

707
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,080
Is that enough?

708
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,280
That should be the way.

709
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:56,850
-Hold this.
-Okay.

710
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,080
-Are we done?
-Yes.

711
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,840
Thanks.

712
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,480
Let me have a look.

713
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,080
This is so painful.

714
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,680
Miss, I haven't touched you.

715
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,720
I am just about to check and see

716
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,920
if you need an X-ray.

717
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,200
I don't want you to do the check-up.

718
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,440
Are you an intern?

719
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,880
I want the professional ones!

720
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
I want your director.

721
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,680
I want your director
to do the check-up for me.

722
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,280
Miss, if you keep raising a ruckus,

723
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,400
I'll have to call the security

724
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,170
to bring you out.

725
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,730
I want to see the doctor. I am sick.

726
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,610
I am making reasonable requirements.

727
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,200
How can you say that I am making a fuss?

728
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:27,960
Miss.

729
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,410
You are unreasonable.

730
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,560
Miss.

731
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,330
This is the emergency room.

732
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,640
Don't hinder

733
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,520
the doctor's job.

734
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,560
I didn't.

735
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,880
Please apologize to this doctor.

736
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,920
I am sorry.

737
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,800
Stand up.

738
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,600
Don't hog the medical resources.

739
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,480
Thanks, Director Ling.

740
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,560
Do you still need treatment?

741
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,520
Where is your next-of-kin?

742
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,360
Are they here?

743
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,760
There.

744
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,409
Excuse me, doctors.

745
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,400
This child

746
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,880
has an intellectual disability.

747
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,120
I'm sorry she troubled you.

748
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,760
It's alright. I can see that.

749
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:47,920
Where were you?

750
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,199
I have something to do.

751
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,239
You have to be responsible for this!

752
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,480
[Shenzhen Huiren Hospital]

753
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,720
Where is he?

754
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,640
He is gone in just a blink of an eye.

755
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,480
You are injured.

756
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Dr. Ling.

757
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,640
It's alright.

758
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,200
It's probably a scratch

759
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,440
left by a mad man.

760
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,640
I'll just apply some ointment.

761
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,160
Be careful.

762
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,290
It hurts!

763
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:32,960
It hurts so bad.

764
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,200
Can you help me?

765
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,650
Follow me.

766
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,760
Endure it.

767
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,480
It hurts.

768
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,570
I am disinfecting your wound.
Endure it for a while.

769
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,360
I have managed it.

770
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,130
If there is nothing else,

771
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,840
you can leave now.

772
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,840
Dr. Ling,

773
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,120
will you marry me?

774
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,730
What?

775
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,440
I mean

776
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,960
do you have a girlfriend?

777
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,200
This is my privacy.

778
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,520
I am afraid that I can't reveal it.

779
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,880
That means you don't have one.

780
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,560
That's strange.

781
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,600
You have a good look, a good body,

782
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,520
and mild temperament.

783
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,650
On top of that, you're a surgeon.

784
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,040
You should be quite popular.

785
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,640
If there's nothing else,

786
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,360
please leave.

787
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,040
I have to work. Thanks.

788
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,210
It doesn't matter. I'll find out.

789
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,980
Thanks, Ling Rui.

790
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,920
Dr. Ling.

791
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,680
Gao Erfan, look into Ling Rui's background.

792
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,120
Now.
