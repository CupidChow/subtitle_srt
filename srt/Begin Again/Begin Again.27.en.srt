00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,930
Mine, too.

not to have unrealistic imagination.

But...

It was Dr. Ling who

22
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,530
took her away just now.

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,690
Director Ling is soft-hearted.

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,920
I'm sorry.

25

Why are we here?

29
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,560
We're here for shopping, of course.

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,800
Why are we here if not for shopping?

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
Shopping is fine,

32
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,240
but this is LM Deer Sing Store.

33
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,610
It's been so many years.

He won't mind?

It's been six years,

40

but Ling Rui didn't even look for a girlfriend.

41

It's been 16 years,

42

but I never saw that you had a boyfriend.

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,290
Fine.

This naughty little boy.

60
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,640
You're going to create trouble for me again?

61
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,090
Mom doesn't know about it. You're a coward.

62
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,530
If Lu Fangning knows it,

63
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,760
she'll surely kill me.

64

This is Lu Fangning's child?

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,329
Murder is a crime.

67
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,410
Mom won't commit a crime because of you.

68
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,520
I know that.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,290
But

70
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,410
she'll make me feel agonized.

71
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,130
Since you're so afraid of her,

72
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,850
how can you be my father?

73
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,320
He's the father of Lu Fangning's child.

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,329
I don't deserve to be your father.

75
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,610
Are you satisfied now?

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,890
-Lu Youyou.
-It has nothing to do with you.

77
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,850
What is it? No.

78
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,570
This is the father of Lu Fangning's child.

79
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,810
Why does she have a child?

80
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,760
Let's go.

81
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,370
There're quilt cover sets over there.

82
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,370
Don't you want to buy a pink one?

83
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,410
Let's go.

84
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,290
It has nothing to do with us.

85
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,050
Then let me ask you.

86
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,730
What are you doing here?

87
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,080
I came to look for dad.

88
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,320
Mom is unreliable.

89
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,490
So I have to rely on myself.

90
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,890
Looking for dad?

91
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,330
Then why did you come to LM Deer Sing Store?

92
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,010
Didn't mom

93
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,250
work here before?

94
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,210
You know everything.

95
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,810
Let me ask you again.

96
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,730
There're so many people

97
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,170
here,

98
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,570
how do you know who your father is?

99
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,050
Of course it relies on the

100
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,930
telepathic connection between a father and a son.

101
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,600
What are you doing?

102
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,330
I'm sensing it.

103
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,490
You little kid.

104
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,810
Take it for me.

105
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,930
Ling Rui is back.

106
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,010
He's at home?

107
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,280
Remember not to mention it.

108
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,360
If you do...

109
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,250
You're back?

110
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,570
Ling Rui is back?

111
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,010
The dishes are ready.

112
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,610
When my mom comes back,

113
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,570
we can start eating.

114
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,440
Okay.

Ling Rui.

116
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,090
Why are you

117
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,680
having potato chips?

118
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,440
I thought you never ate snacks?

119
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,290
You're in a good mood today?

120
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,920
Not bad.

121
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,290
I'm like this every day.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,410
What happened to you?

123
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,570
Aunt,

124
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,810
I met Lu Fangning

125
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,130
in the hospital today.

126
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,040
You're still thinking of her?

127
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,040
Ling Rui.

128
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,290
Listen to my advice.

129
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,130
It's been so many years,

130
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,850
and she also has her own life.

131
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,360
You should also start

132
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,120
looking for your life partner again.

133
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,890
Aunt, in fact...

134
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,880
Ling Rui,

135
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,690
Lu Fangning

136
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,650
already has...

137
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,450
Sister.

138
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,010
Why are you screaming?

139
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,370
You scared me to death.

140
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,240
Didn't you tell me not to say?

141
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,240
Well...

142
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,730
I can't keep it to myself anymore.

143
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,450
No, you can't say it.

144
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,360
You can't say it.

145
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,690
What happened to Lu Fangning?

146
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,840
Say it.

147
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,130
Ling Rui,

148
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,410
Lu Fangning

149
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,690
has forgotten you long ago.

150
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,930
She has a kid

151
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,090
with another guy.

152
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,530
Today, your little aunt and I

153
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,650
bumped into them

154
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,800
in the

155
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,170
LM Deer Sing Store.

156
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,760
You can ask your little aunt.

157
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,170
Sister, Ling Rui is angry.

158
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,560
What should we do? He's angry now.

159
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,130
What's the matter with you?

160
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,890
You didn't let me talk about it, but you did so yourself.

161
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,440
He has already met Lu Fangning.

162
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,720
Even if I don't say it, he'll know it sooner or later.

163
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,090
What should we do now?

164
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,680
Well...

165
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:30,930
How about this?

166
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,210
You just ask

167
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,080
the girl who is to your liking

168
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,890
out tomorrow.

169
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,450
That's great. Just keep wearing this.

170
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,370
When your mom sees you later,

171
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,330
her heart will melt right away.

172
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,320
Youyou.

173
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,760
Uncle Doll.

174
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,530
You're so good.

175
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,280
What a coincidence, Dr. Ling.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,130
Let me do the introduction. This is my son.

177
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,450
Little kid,

178
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,450
is your mom

179
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,570
Lu Fangning?

180
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,330
Yes, Uncle Doll.

181
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,000
Dr. Ling, you're leaving?

182
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,450
Aren't you going in,

183
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,610
Dr. Ling?

184
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,400
Youyou,

185
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,930
you know that person

186
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,410
who appeared just now, right?

187
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,330
He's Uncle Doll who looks like dad.

188
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,010
Let me tell you.

189
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,570
Don't tell

190
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,970
what happened just now

191
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,320
to your mom for the sake of our lives.

192
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,200
Got it?

193
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,890
You little kid.

194
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,660
Let's go.

195
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,970
I haven't changed my number, too.

196
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,410
Remember that.

197
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,410
You're back?

198
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,880
Mom, we went out today to...

199
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,850
It's fine.

200
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,600
Kids

201
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,610
just need to

202
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,680
go out and have fun more

203
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,010
to see what the world outside is like.

204
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,930
How about this?

205
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,730
If you want to go out and have fun

206
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,920
next time,

207
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,090
you can just tell me

208
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,050
or Uncle Shen Zhuo,

209
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,840
okay?

210
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,600
Then I'll go to wash my hands and read.

211
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,840
You're so good.

212
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,770
Go now.

213
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,680
Look how sensible my son is.

214
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,570
He even takes care of his own cleanliness.

215
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:11,930
Shen Zhuo.

216
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:12,970
Fangning.

217
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,450
I've thought about it.

218
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,930
Before that,

219
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,970
90 percent of the profit would go to me,

220
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,160
and that was really not fair.

221
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,530
How about this?

222
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,050
I...

223
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,840
Just 80 percent of the profit will go to me.

224
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,250
Don't be too grateful to me.

225
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,560
It's good.

226
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,960
Thank you, boss. I'm so appreciative.

227
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,760
But Fangning,

228
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,370
what did you do

229
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,050
with Dr. Ling

230
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,250
in the hospital today?

231
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,210
What could we do in the hospital?

232
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,490
We just talked about the past.

233
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,360
Talking about the past? Then you and him...

234
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,850
Have you told him

235
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,450
that you have

236
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,530
a five-year-old son?

237
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,610
I haven't said yet.

238
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,130
It'll be something unexpected for him.

239
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,170
I think it'll be

240
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,450
mind-blowing for him.

241
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,040
-It'll not be good for his health.
-Yes.

242
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,530
How about this?

243
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,810
After that,

244
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,440
I'll talk to him

245
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,080
about this properly at a suitable time.

246
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,290
But the most important thing now

247
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,410
is to trigger the feelings of the past.

248
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,890
Everything will be easy to deal with once there's a good relationship.

249
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,600
Right?

250
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,410
What are you thinking?

251
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,970
Didn't you still

252
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,880
think about escaping earlier?

253
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,650
I'm not going to care about you two anymore.

254
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,130
You're leaving?

255
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,930
I'm going back to design.

256
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,650
If there's nothing important,

257
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,770
don't ever come to me.

258
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,290
It'll affect my work.

259
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,170
Ling Rui,

260
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,640
I seem to owe you a meal.

261
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,520
Is my phone or his

262
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,250
out of order?

263
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,130
Mom.

264
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,360
You're awake?

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,410
-Get up.
-Let's have a hug.

266
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,690
Happy weekend, baby.

267
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,010
I don't want to go to my little grandpa's house.

268
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,290
All right.

269
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,890
Just take it that little grandpa is getting old

270
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,600
and be considerate of him.

271
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,930
Where do you want to go?

272
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,130
Amusement park.

273
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,650
-Amusement park.
-Amusement park?

274
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,490
You scared me to death.

275
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,250
Do you think he's fine?

276
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,810
You go and ask.

277
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,640
Thank you.

278
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,280
Ling Rui, are you okay?

279
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,970
I'm fine.

280
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:19,920
You...

281
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,530
You're really fine?

282
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,810
I'm really fine.

283
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,890
Aunt is not in a good mood today.

284
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,490
Ling Rui,

285
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,090
regarding what I just told you,

286
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,730
what do you think?

287
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,610
Just go and join in.

288
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,690
You just go and meet the girl

289
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,530
considering that two of your aunts

290
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,290
are very worried and guilty now.

291
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,840
It doesn't matter if you don't like her.

292
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,050
You can turn her down when you come back.

293
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,450
Just go and meet her, okay?

294
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:21,880
Ling Rui?

295
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:24,770
Okay.

296
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,050
I'm full.

297
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,810
-It's done.
-Okay.

298
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,810
Let's go.

299
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,050
The 98th time.

300
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,000
I got together with the boss.

301
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,050
The 99th time.

302
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,270
[Cai Siyu's Weibo]

303
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,010
The 100th time.

304
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,690
A new day has started.

305
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,930
It's already the tenth day.

306
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,010
Why can't I think of

307
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,800
a fantastic beginning?

308
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,850
Coming.

309
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,000
Lu Yiyao?

310
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,360
What are you doing here?

311
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,210
I'm looking for you for something.

312
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,130
Mr. Lu Yiyao.

313
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,810
What are you going to do

314
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,690
at such an early time?

315
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,610
To stroll around.

316
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,210
Let me ask you something.

317
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,290
Six years ago,

318
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,450
we two...

319
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,290
Had we...

320
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,600
What are you going to say?

321
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,730
Had we...

322
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,850
-Slept...
-Had we slept together?

323
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:48,890
No.

324
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,690
For this question, six years ago,

325
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,930
I'd already answered you.

326
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,800
Then what you wrote on Weibo

327
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,850
wasn't like that.

328
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,850
[Damn.]

329
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,640
[I just wrote it on the spur of the moment.]

330
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,170
[I forgot that there's also another party.]

331
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,090
That was because I wanted to clear

332
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,250
myself of the accusation of plagiarism.

333
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:02,920
I simply wrote it.

334
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,200
You simply wrote it?

335
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,090
Your tone was so serious.

336
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,450
Obviously, you did it on the spur of the moment.

337
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,130
How could there be any premeditation?

338
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,930
I can't even remember

339
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,610
the memories from six years ago clearly.

340
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,960
I might get it wrong

341
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,760
at that particular moment.

342
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,930
How could someone like you,

343
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,890
who treats a relationship so seriously,

344
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,600
get it wrong?

345
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,250
Lu Yiyao.

346
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,010
You already believed it six years ago.

347
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,530
Why do you even care about it now?

348
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,970
Does it matter?

349
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,250
I didn't get pregnant and give birth

350
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,440
by keeping it from you.

351
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,850
I also didn't make a fuss everywhere.

352
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,970
I just used this

353
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,770
as a source of inspiration

354
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,490
to write a novel

355
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,000
and make a small amount of money.

356
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,040
Couldn't I do so?

357
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,370
I just want to know the truth.

358
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,130
Okay, the truth.

359
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,050
The truth...

360
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,010
Come here.

361
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,810
You don't believe the truth I said.

362
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,930
What is it?

363
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,440
Are you disgruntled now?

364
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,160
Then you should cherish it more at that time.

365
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,610
Cai Siyu.

366
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,770
Well, how could you...

367
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,810
What's wrong with me?

368
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,920
You came here by yourself.

369
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,640
Tell me.

370
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,570
So what if it's real?

371
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,730
So what if it's fake?

372
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,450
Don't tell me that you want to be held responsible

373
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,320
and marry me?

374
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,330
You thought I'd be very happy?

375
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,480
Scumbag!

376
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,570
How could I not want to?

377
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,370
I endured for a week.

378
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,490
I endured it a hundred times.

379
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:37,840
Do you know

380
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,610
what I'm thinking every day?

381
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,760
I miss you every day.

382
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,560
You're all over

383
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,130
my mind.

384
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,240
What do you want me to do?

385
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,440
What nonsense.

386
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,720
I didn't ask you to miss me.

387
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,970
I got it.

388
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,570
Are you aging?

389
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,970
So you're reminiscing about the old times.

390
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:56,850
I'm getting old?

391
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,440
Let me think

392
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,610
how much older are you than me.

393
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,250
Uncle.

394
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,650
-Un...
-No.

395
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,330
I should call you old uncle.

396
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,570
Are you going to be in menopause soon?

397
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,490
You're calling me old uncle?

398
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,010
Old uncle.

399
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:08,810
If there's nothing else,

400
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,960
please leave my house now.

401
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,440
The door is there. See you.

402
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,090
But you...

403
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:13,890
You haven't told me yet.

404
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:14,800
What to tell you?

405
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,610
I'm very busy.

406
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:23,930
I'm free.

407
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,040
That's good.

408
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,690
You help me to do the cleaning then.

409
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,530
You...

410
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:36,970
I...

411
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:37,920
Don't want.

412
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,330
[Why is he staring at me?]

413
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,480
[There's nothing to look at.]

414
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,560
[Why is he still looking at me?]

415
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,290
[Still looking at me?]

416
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,680
I'm heading out.

417
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,720
Where are you going?

418
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,440
It's none of your business. I'm very busy.

419
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:31,970
I'm free.

420
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,050
Just do whatever you want.

421
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:35,880
Don't follow me.

422
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,410
No peeking.

423
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,410
Don't follow me.

424
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,150
[Marketing Content]

425
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,010
How is it?

426
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,400
Are you satisfied with the marketing content?

427
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,010
Ms. Cai, it's like this.

428
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,610
The content is very good.

429
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,490
It's very natural and provocative.

430
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,850
It's just that...

431
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,050
What's wrong?

432
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:01,890
I've revised several times

433
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,290
based on

434
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,730
your requests.

435
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,650
You were involved in an issue

436
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,730
of plagiarism on Weibo before.

437
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,450
Our boss

438
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,050
is a bit concerned.

439
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,170
I already clarified

440
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,450
that others slandered me.

441
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,690
I know.

442
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,880
But to dispel

443
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,010
the company's doubts...

444
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,690
How about this?

445
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,610
Take a look.

446
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,320
[Service Agreement for Content Marketing]

447
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,010
This price

448
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,490
takes into account the reading amount.

449
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,930
It'll be free of charge if it's not up to par.

450
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,730
Look, we won't force you.

451
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,410
If you feel that it's inappropriate,

452
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,490
you can turn it down.

453
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,330
Before this,

454
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,330
I started writing because

455
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,650
the terms had been confirmed.

456
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,040
I changed it so many times

457
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,480
also because we trusted each other.

458
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,450
I spent so much

459
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,160
time and energy.

460
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,730
-But you gave me...
-Ms. Cai.

461
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,610
I also can't decide on this.

462
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,850
The boss has been insisting on that.

463
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,170
I've got no choice as well.

464
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,650
You're...?

465
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:09,810
The actual person.

466
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,330
The actual person in Ms. Cai's novel.

467
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,130
The boss who got together with her.

468
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,160
Hello.

469
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,370
Hello.

470
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,040
This is the contract?

471
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,530
Right.

472
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,250
Let me have a look.

473
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,090
If the reading amount is not up to par,

474
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,770
Party A has the right not to pay remuneration to Party B.

475
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,130
Then does Party B have the right to delete

476
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,570
the promotion offered by Party A?

477
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,890
Moreover, in this contract,

478
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,480
there're many unreasonable clauses.

479
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,600
In order to protect Ms. Cai's

480
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
legal rights,

481
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,610
I need to look for a lawyer.

482
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,330
Moreover,

483
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,170
based on the contract signed between both parties before,

484
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,320
Ms. Cai has fulfilled her duties,

485
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,370
but she didn't get the corresponding pay.

486
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,410
So I need to look for a lawyer.

487
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,050
Then I'll go back and ask the boss again.

488
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,690
Ms. Cai, I'll make a move first.

489
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,970
Wait.

490
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,810
Please ask your boss

491
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,120
to talk to my lawyer

492
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,090
if there's anything in the future.

493
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,450
Goodbye.

494
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,160
Party B.

495
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,680
I'm Party B.

496
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,850
You thought I didn't want to scold him?

497
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,410
I even wanted to hit him.

498
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,250
But I still need to make a living.

499
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,970
Why did you come and create the chaos?

500
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,200
Lu Yiyao,

501
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,640
you weren't like this before.

502
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,410
Then I...

503
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,210
You can't help but tend to talk more now.

504
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,690
Is it because you're getting older?

505
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,250
No.

506
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,770
You...

507
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,170
You said I'm old?

508
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,450
I'm exactly referring to you, old man.

509
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,150
Move aside.

510
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,610
I don't want to.

511
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,610
Move aside.

512
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,770
Don't you understand?

513
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,280
No.

514
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,570
Wait for me.

515
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,410
Let's move the thoracic spine.

516
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,080
Is this still okay?

517
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,520
Come, make a turn.

518
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,040
Okay, change to the other side.

519
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:46,560
Come.

520
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,730
He even touches her?

521
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,730
Okay.

522
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,570
Next, let's have an

523
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,570
exercise for the hip joint.

524
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,330
Step on it and move forward.

525
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,520
Correct.

526
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,170
Lower your center of gravity even more.

527
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,930
Keep your back straight.

528
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,090
Tighten the abdominal core.

529
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,600
Stomach in a bit.

530
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,570
Come, take a small step forward.

531
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:03,930
Okay.

532
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,200
Relax.

533
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,720
Can you go further?

534
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,360
Okay.

535
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,130
Keep it up.

536
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,810
Keep your back straight.

537
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,130
-[You're even touching her foot?]
-Breathe in for three seconds.

538
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:14,970
Breathe out for three seconds.

539
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,330
[I haven't even touched it.]

540
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,530
Breathe in.

541
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,290
Breathe out.

542
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,730
Come, one more time.

543
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,610
Lower your center of gravity even more, come.

544
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:28,890
I think the ligament on this side

545
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,090
is better than the other side.

546
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,370
Right, good.

547
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,410
You even followed for this, too.

548
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,530
Old man,

549
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,130
this is really not for you.

550
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,490
Why is it not suitable?

551
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,400
I exercise every day, okay?

552
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,570
I see.

553
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,320
I know.

554
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,330
After all, you're free.

555
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,170
Siyu, this is your friend?

556
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,440
No, he came by himself.

557
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,290
Where do you want to exercise today, bro?

558
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,600
I'll take you to exercise later.

559
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,490
There's no need.

560
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,370
I exercise every day.

561
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,570
Coach, look.

562
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,770
People are definitely different from one another.

563
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,450
Your muscles

564
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,880
are really impressive.

565
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,320
It's so-so.

566
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,360
I have a fast metabolism

567
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,730
now.

568
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,320
My metabolism will slow down

569
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,040
when I get older,

570
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,930
and it'll be more difficult for the workout by then.

571
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,570
I see.

572
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,210
It'll be difficult?

573
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,290
Look.

574
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,330
Look at me.

575
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,770
I do bench press.

576
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,890
One hundred and ten kilograms.

577
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,090
One hundred and ten kilograms?

578
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,650
Then you're pretty amazing.

579
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,560
I can only push 100 kilograms at most.

580
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,530
Your friend is cool.

581
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,330
Bro.

582
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,930
You're almost there. Do practice more.

583
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,250
You're so amazing?

584
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,090
Then let's go.

585
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,330
Show us.

586
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,530
There's no need. I can do it myself.

587
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,250
Are you sure you don't need to warm up first?

588
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,970
Lad,

589
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,570
you're too young.

590
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,850
Come on.

591
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,560
I didn't rest well these two days.

592
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,530
I'll do deadlift then.

593
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,770
There'll be no problem with the deadlift.

594
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,050
Come on.

595
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,210
Why don't you work out?

596
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,370
Go ahead, and I'll accompany you.

597
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,450
I...

598
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,280
I'm here, little aunt.

599
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,770
Remember to

600
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,250
talk to the girl nicely.

601
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,810
She's also a doctor.

602
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,560
She can surely get along with you.

603
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,370
By the way, her last name is Yu.

604
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,090
Got it.

605
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,650
Miss Yu?

606
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,730
Mr. Ling?

607
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,360
She's arrived.

608
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,040
Little aunt, I'll hang up first.

609
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:25,969
Okay.

610
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,570
-Why is it you?
-Why is it you?

611
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:36,969
Waiter.

612
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,850
Get me another cup of hot Americano.

613
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,010
Okay, wait a moment.

614
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,330
Don't tell me you deliberately came

615
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,850
on a blind date to run into me

616
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,690
just because of

617
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,120
the joke I made the other day?

618
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,130
Then why did you come on a blind date?

619
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,810
Because I'm bored.

620
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,570
Since I'll be treated to a meal,

621
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,170
I'll take the opportunity to come out

622
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:55,810
and observe

623
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,330
the wonders of the world occasionally.

624
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,090
It's quite interesting.

625
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,210
How about you?

626
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,330
When I'm at home,

627
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,120
I can't always use the ring as an excuse.

628
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,290
I have experience in such a thing.

629
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,160
Thank you.

630
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,570
I have a good way.

631
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,490
First of all, you must pretend

632
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,570
that the two of us

633
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,880
didn't know each other.

634
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,450
So no one

635
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,890
will force us to get along.

636
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,810
Since the introducer is not here,

637
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,930
we two can leave right away

638
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,040
after drinking coffee.

639
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,880
I happen to want to see

640
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,600
today's newly introduced medical equipment.

641
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,370
Speaking of which,

642
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,570
do you want to go together?

643
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,330
Didn't you say that we'll separate after drinking?

644
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,970
That's right, too.

645
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,160
Why would you

646
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,530
be interested in medical equipment?

647
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,450
But there's one more thing.

648
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,890
Both of us have to

649
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,000
say the same thing.

650
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,570
After I go back, I'll say

651
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,880
that you're not to my liking

652
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,520
and that I don't think you're good enough for me.

653
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,800
But it's hard to be convincing

654
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,240
since you're so excellent.

655
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:54,810
Let me think again.

656
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,280
Or you can just say

657
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,920
that you're not good enough for me.

658
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,930
Okay, this is good.

659
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,130
It's impossible that I'm not good enough for you.

660
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,290
Then others will definitely think

661
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,130
that you have a unique taste.

662
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:09,930
All kinds of weirdos

663
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,370
will probably come and harass you.

664
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,490
It's very good.

665
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,410
As long as you think it's good.

666
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,480
Why do you stop, mom?

667
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,210
What are you looking at?

668
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:21,800
Oh.

669
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:23,450
Mom...

670
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,210
Mom will play a game

671
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:24,810
with you, okay?

672
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,490
Let's play...

673
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,170
You know that woman?

674
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,450
Shall we walk sideways?

675
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,570
It's okay. Let's go.

676
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:31,970
Looking at your reaction,

677
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,330
I don't think you're okay.

678
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,720
-Youyou.
-Uncle Doll.

679
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,440
Youyou, come down.

680
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,570
Lu Youyou.

681
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,960
Don't tell me she's your ex-wife?

682
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,800
Youyou, come down.

683
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,210
She's really your ex-wife?

684
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,440
Drink coffee.

685
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,240
It's really troublesome.

686
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,760
What is the trouble?

687
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,840
You want to be noticed by her,

688
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,650
and don't want to be noticed by her.

689
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,570
Don't worry about it. Drink coffee.

690
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,690
Don't waste it. Drink it.

691
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,450
What are you doing?

692
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,370
Don't move.

693
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,960
Mom, do you know Uncle Doll?

694
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,810
Why don't you go in?

695
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,760
Because...

696
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,800
Because we're playing

697
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,930
hide-and-seek.

698
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,210
I can't let him see me.

699
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:26,720
Let's go.

700
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,890
Mom brings you to eat ice cream.

701
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,320
Mom, it doesn't match fries.

702
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,410
It doesn't match?

703
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,570
Mom, let me help you.

704
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:42,570
Lu Youyou.

705
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,800
Listen to me. They're coming.

706
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,170
Dad.

707
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,400
Kid.

708
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,850
You can't simply call a person your dad.

709
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,770
Aunt, do you know my dad?

710
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,810
What is your relationship with him?

711
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,170
I...

712
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,970
Lu Youyou.

713
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,050
Come over.

714
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,170
Come over.

715
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,850
I'm sorry, Ling Rui.

716
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,530
I'm sorry.

717
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,050
Mom, what a coincidence.

718
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,850
We ran into dad.

719
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,290
How do you know

720
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,160
that he's your dad?

721
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,330
I...

722
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,370
I'm his father?

723
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,050
Youyou.

724
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:13,930
Yes.

725
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,250
Your name is Youyou, right?

726
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:15,920
Yes.

727
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:17,770
Youyou,

728
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,930
can you

729
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,090
go home first?

730
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:21,730
I have something

731
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:22,970
to talk to your mother about.

732
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,040
Mom.

733
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,250
You go home first. Be good.

734
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,000
Uncle Doll,

735
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,520
don't bully my mom.

736
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,250
Be good.

737
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,240
Go now.

738
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,800
The child has gone back.

739
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,250
We can have a good talk.

740
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,490
Ling Rui.

741
00:39:58,890 --> 00:39:59,610
Lu Fangning.

742
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,200
Tell me seriously,

743
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,050
Youyou is the child of you and me,

744
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,080
right?

745
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:16,970
How old is he?

746
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,170
Five years old.

747
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,570
That means

748
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:26,850
six years ago,

749
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,370
you left

750
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,170
the divorce agreement and left me.

751
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,440
Then you found out

752
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,890
that you were pregnant.

753
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,650
Ling Rui, I'm sorry.

754
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,480
-I...
-Lu Fangning.

755
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,000
Why didn't you tell me?

756
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,960
Why did you choose to

757
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,440
raise Youyou alone abroad?

758
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:50,970
I...

759
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,210
I just didn't want to

760
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,730
disturb your life.

761
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,530
Did you know

762
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,890
what you were doing?

763
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,720
Just now, that was the first time

764
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,330
Youyou called me dad during these six years.

765
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,370
And I thought

766
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,810
that was just a joke.

767
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,130
I'm sorry.

768
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,000
Six years ago,

769
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,520
why did you leave without saying anything?

770
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:22,970
Do you know that I was

771
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,370
looking for you crazily?

772
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,890
Or

773
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,210
you thought that it was for my sake

774
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,600
to support me

775
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,810
to further my studies at the German Institute,

776
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,690
and that you sacrificed for me?

777
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,970
How did you know that?

778
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,370
Lu Fangning.

779
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,570
You said you didn't want to disturb my life,

780
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,320
but you made the decision for me

781
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,490
without my knowledge.

782
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,240
You...

783
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,410
You still don't understand.
