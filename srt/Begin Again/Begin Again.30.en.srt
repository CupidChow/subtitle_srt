4
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,150
So?

5
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm just here to take care of Youyou.

6
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,120
Don't take it wrongly.

7
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,170
Youyou, what are you playing with?

8
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,910
Can I join you?

9
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,120
Okay.

10
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,419
Let's find the pieces then.

11
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,300
All right, how?

12
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,750
We just need to

13
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,670
find the pieces of delicacy.

14
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,490
And bring them to the diner

15
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,530
so that we can

16
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,290
use this to make delicacies.

17
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,140
Let's start then.

18
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,600
Okay.

19
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,820
Put this in first.

20
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,490
Okay.

21
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,960
You got it wrong.

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,680
Wrong?

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,470
No.

24
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,030
The second one.

25
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,620
The third one.

26
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,300
Did I take it wrongly?

27
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,610
I wasn't thinking of anything.

28
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,460
Why is it so warm in here?

29
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,340
It's too stuffy in here.

30
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,180
What the hell?

31
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,850
Bro, do you need napkins?

32
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,940
There's a promotion.

33
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,480
With every set,

34
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,540
you get a lanyard with a Bai Jing design.

35
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,480
Right, the napkins you're using.

36
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,280
It feels nice.

37
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,300
A lanyard?

38
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,060
All right.

39
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,240
Then I want the one with Tang Ping's image.

40
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,970
Oh, no.

41
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,490
We don't have one with Tang Ping.

42
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,790
Only those with Bai Jing's image.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,640
Why don't you have those with her image?

44
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,980
She is the ambassador too.

45
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,829
Very few people ask for hers.

46
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,300
We don't keep much stock of it.

47
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,760
Bai Jing is very popular.

48
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,350
It's okay you don't like it.

49
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,950
Your girlfriend must like it, right?

50
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,800
You can give it to your girlfriend,

51
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,850
or your female colleagues.

52
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,560
Right?

53
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,450
All right, I'll ask for ten sets.

54
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,050
Okay, I can give you an extra one,

55
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,440
eleven lanyards with Bai Jing's image.

56
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,829
But I want lanyards with Tang Ping's image.

57
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,260
I really don't have any.

58
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,030
You see?

59
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,579
So you should

60
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:56,250
try your best to

61
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,720
satisfy the needs of customers, right?

62
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,980
You don't decide

63
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,030
who gets popular.

64
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,660
Right?

65
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,840
That's only

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,010
your superficial delusion.

67
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,480
What if people like me ask for one

68
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,320
with Tang Ping's image

69
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,540
and you don't have that?

70
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,590
You'll miss a good

71
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,640
business opportunity.

72
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,990
You seem to be a big fan of Tang Ping.

73
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,840
You don't have to know

74
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,020
whose a fan I am.

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,150
How about this?

76
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,790
I want a box of this,

77
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,140
but all with Tang Ping's image.

78
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,450
All right. Wait here.

79
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,580
I'll call the office now.

80
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,520
And, report my feedback

81
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,820
to your company.

82
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,500
Okay, no problem.

83
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,420
Thank you.

84
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,440
Mr. Wang, yes!

85
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,120
He wants those with Tang Ping's image.

86
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,290
Yes, Tang Ping.

87
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,010
A box.

88
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,810
Welcome back, Miss Pingping.

89
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,460
Thank you, Peng Bo.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,050
Did you see everything?

91
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,560
Of course I saw that.

92
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,409
But don't worry

93
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,090
about my sales number.

94
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,350
Since you're a doctor,

95
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,740
you may not have much money.

96
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,340
I'll boost my sales volume

97
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,060
with my own endorsement fee.

98
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,030
Don't worry about that, Miss Pingping.

99
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,290
I should do that.

100
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,060
So don't worry about it.

101
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:09,840
I have

102
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,380
good news

103
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,180
to share with you.

104
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,440
Really?

105
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,700
You can go ahead.

106
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,810
I'm doing love scenes next.

107
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,860
Really?

108
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,790
When?

109
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,180
The investors

110
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,440
added few love scenes

111
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,570
to make up

112
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,450
for the duration.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,540
Oh my.

114
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,550
That'll be great.

115
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,360
May I

116
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,320
see the script?

117
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,150
Miss Pingping,

118
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,960
are you ready for this?

119
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,010
I'm all set.

120
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,110
Then,

121
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,750
could you run it by me?

122
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,430
Of course.

123
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,800
I should

124
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,850
explain the plot first.

125
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,790
Now, imagine this place

126
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,010
as a bus.

127
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,900
We're colleagues

128
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,620
and always take the same bus home.

129
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,250
Okay.

130
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,140
Today,

131
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,980
we happened to

132
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,400
sit in the same row.

133
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,040
I fell asleep.

134
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,340
Okay.

135
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,820
Say, "Ready, action."

136
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,380
Ready, action.

137
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,180
The bus jolts.

138
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,890
I see.

139
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,350
Miss Pingping.

140
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,060
Stop it.

141
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,950
Miss Pingping.

142
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,470
Um.

143
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,320
You didn't look like you were on a bus.

144
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,800
You were just shaking like an earthquake.

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,470
I...

146
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,970
Well, I enjoy the immersion.

147
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,230
I don't take the bus

148
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,860
very often.

149
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,800
As a layman,

150
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,480
I know that you're asked to

151
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,340
show the feeling of the first awakening of love,

152
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,070
yet you acted like a hungry beast.

153
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,670
That is not true at all.

154
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,190
If you're so great, show me how it's done.

155
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,590
♫ Even the pedestrians look like him ♫

156

157
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,740
♫ The wind passed through the window and kissed me on my cheeks ♫

158

♫ Asking gently, how are you? ♫

159
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,130
♫ The plane flew by and left a trail behind ♫

160
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,240
♫ Perhaps the sky wants to flash a smile ♫

161
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,540
♫ The softness in my heart was touched ♫

162
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,750
♫ The number of dreams I've had since your departure ♫

163
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:51,470
♫ I waited till dawn the first time I want to see you ♫

00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,730
♫ Want to see you the second time, control emotion ♫

♫ How many times have I wanted to see you ♫

166
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,290
♫ I've lost count ♫

167
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,550

♫ How many times have I wanted to see you ♫

170
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,260
♫ I listen to my heart ♫

171
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,790

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:08,250
♫ Want to see you the second time Control emotion ♫

176
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,940
♫ How many times have I wanted to see you ♫

177
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,240
♫ I've lost count ♫

178
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:22,170
♫ Gradually get used to the new date ♫

179
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,400
♫ How many times have I wanted to see you ♫

180
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,620
♫ How many times have I wanted to see you ♫

181
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,220
♫ I listen to my heart ♫

182
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,070
♫ And decided to travel there ♫

183
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,030
♫ To hold you ♫

184

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,760

189
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,800

♫ I've never wanted to escape from the palm of your hand ♫

194
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,870

195
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:04,690
♫ And our future ♫

196
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,770
Ling Rui stayed here last night.

197
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,940
It smells great.

198
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,960
Youyou, are you full yet?

199
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,750
Yes.

200
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,220
Okay, Dad is going to clean up then.

201
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,030
Okay.

202
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,050
Morning, morning.

203
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:08,520
Morning.

204
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,240
Morning.

205
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,849
Morning.

206
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,380
-Morning.
-Where is the breakfast?

207
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,480
Mom,

208
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,150
I've had

209
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,910
breakfast with Dad.

210
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,270
Dad made great porridge.

211
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,359
Great.

212
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:24,990
So yummy.

213
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,210
There is no porridge for me.

214
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,390
It should be eaten when it's still warm.

215
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,060
I didn't know

216
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,190
when you would wake up.

217
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,450
So I didn't prepare your portion.

218
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,220
Now it's...

219
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,350
It's okay. It's okay.

220
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,370
I can prepare it by myself.

221
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:35,950
Okay.

222
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,060
Youyou.

223
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,400
Anything else

224
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,660
you want to bring?

225
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:47,840
Ling Rui,

226
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,440
where are you taking Youyou?

227
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,830
My mom and aunts

228
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,380
are taking Youyou out for fun.

229
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,810
I'll send him there.

230
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,820
But don't worry.

231
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,460
I'll get him back before dinner.

232
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,340
No problem.

233
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,740
And you?

234
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,300
You don't need to send me.

235
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,140
I mean,

236
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,860
what's your plan for today?

237
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,210
Our university today...

238
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,180
No, not our university.

239
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,520
Our design exhibition

240
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,910
is will go live today.

241
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,260
And, well...

242
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,600
It's the first time

243
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,240
that our studio has held an exhibition here.

244
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,330
Though it's not grand,

245
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,720
the school expects much of it.

246
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,770
So we must all take part.

247
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,110
Shen Zhuo and I are both going.

248
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:24,880
Youyou.

249
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,690
Nothing else, right?

250
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,570
No.

251
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,080
Here.

252
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,010
I've brought all my favorites with me.

253
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,230
Okay, that's good.

254
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,490
Mom,

255
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,410
can I visit

256
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,170
your exhibition?

257
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,350
No.

258
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,450
We have a deal.

259
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,500
You'll go to the coffee shop

260
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,970
with Grandma.

261
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,100
Don't you remember that?

262
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,160
Be a man of your word, okay?

263
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,970
Okay then.

264
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,390
Mom.

265
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,030
I'll go rooting for you next time.

266
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,740
Bye-bye.

267
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,710
You're the best.

268
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,970
Have fun with Grandma.

269
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:51,640
Be good.

270
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,270
All right.

271
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,330
Right, have you done any field inspections

272
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,380
at the art park?

273
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,480
I didn't.

274
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,580
It's a good chance.

275
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,250
There won't be the next one

276
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,840
if you miss it.

277
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,060
Okay, I'll consider it.

278
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,460
If you're not having

279
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,890
a stable job at home,

280
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,360
it's best that Youyou lives with me.

281
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,990
I'll go. I'll definitely go.

282
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,970
I'll consider it carefully.

283
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:12,970
You have my word.

284
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,700
Then it's up to you.

285
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,750
-Mom, bye.
-I'm waiting for your answer.

286
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,800
Um, bye.

287
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,280
Would you

288
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,330
-do the dishes for us?
-No problem.

289
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,760
Let's go, Youyou.

290
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,060
Have fun.

291
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:26,960
Bye.

292
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,500
You're pregnant!

293
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,550
Yes.

294
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,980
Who is the father?

295
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,030
I don't know.

296
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,120
Cut.

297
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,880
Pass.

298
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,060
Please take a break, Ms. Tang Ping.

299
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,740
Ms. Xinxin, prepare for the next scene.

300
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,520
Hello, Siyu?

301
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,490
How about me

302
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,920
treating you to desserts?

303
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,390
It's too early to have dessert.

304
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,600
Countless people are rushing me

305
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,230
to post an update.

306
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,120
Goodbye.

307
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,330
What updates?

308
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,630
It's always about

309
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,570
"I love you, you love me."

310
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,450
"I don't love you

311
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,540
when you love me."

312
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,430
Love or not, just give it some thought.

313
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,190
It's not like you're a prodigy writer.

314
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,330
Where is my muse? My muse!

315
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,500
Hello, Fangning.

316
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,560
Where are you? Let's meet up.

317
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,400
Ling Rui was mean.

318
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,880
He didn't even send his best wish.

319
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,420
Would he come or not?

320
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,140
Lu Fangning,

321
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,000
why are you here wandering?

322
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,840
Go inside.

323
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,850
You know how I hate

324
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,110
this kind of situation.

325
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,370
I can't handle it without you.

326
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,740
Ms. Lu, what are you doing?

327
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,090
I know you've had

328
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,010
a hard time recently.

329
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,230
But look,

330
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,570
we have the results here.

331
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,080
Your efforts have paid off.

332
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,510
The designs of our studio

333
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,560
are going

334
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,830
to make a wave in the news,

335
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,520
return to its prime, and make history!

336
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,370
Let's amaze those students.

337
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,250
Forget it.

338
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,050
Those students

339
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:45,850
have their eyes

340
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,780
wide open

341
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,290
to nitpick on us.

342
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,930
My designs are perfect.

343
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,150
What can they nitpick?

344
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,630
But it's

345
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,600
quite a pity

346
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,910
that you can't let people who know you

347
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,330
see the achievements you have now.

348
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,650
How about I call the one

349
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,740
who tore apart your family

350
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,960
several years ago?

351
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,930
Who was it again? I'll call him.

352
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,540
Fangning.

353
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,110
Ling Rui.

354
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,580
Why are you here?

355
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,020
I just sent Youyou home.

356
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,410
Then I remembered your exhibition

357
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,710
was going live today.

358
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,180
I came here to check it out.

359
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,440
Congratulations.

360
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,700
Thank you.

361
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,540
What's wrong?

362
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,680
It's dirty.

363
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Thank you.

364
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,260
I just changed my clothes today.

365
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,150
Right.

366
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,090
Long time no see.

367
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,100
You pretended to be

368
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,450
Youyou's father the last time,

369
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,590
Mr. Shen.

370
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,060
Father?

371
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,790
What do you mean?

372
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,100
You must be kidding, Mr. Ling.

373
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,330
You're pulling a joke on me.

374
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,250
Right?

375
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,640
I didn't get the chance

376
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,770
to thank you.

377
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,030
Mr. Shen.

378
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,550
For what?

379
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,980
I must thank you

380
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,280
for sending Youyou home.

381
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,060
Outside of our apartment,

382
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,610
Mr. Shen

383
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,790
said he was Youyou's father.

384
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,570
Godfather.

385
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,590
Godfather.

386
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,850
I mean it.

387
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,420
Is the exhibition hall nearby?

388
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,810
-Godfather?
-Godfather.

389
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,120
Yes, he is.

390
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,420
Yeah.

391
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,640
You can go ask Youyou.

392
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,580
So I got it all wrong.

393
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,170
Godfather?

394
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,230
I'm the godmother. We're like a couple.

395
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,460
I remember now.

396
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,350
That was why you ran away so fast

397
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,650
and worked so hard.

398
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,660
I hope you can keep up

399
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,590
the good work

400
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,810
and give it your best.

401
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,530
For Youyou's future,

402
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,700
Godfather.

403
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,340
It's my fault. My fault.

404
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,350
I'm a sinner.

405
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,360
All right? You two.

406
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,160
Leave the knotty students

407
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:05,920
to me.

408
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,100
I'll deal with them, okay?

409
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,520
Bye. Bye.

410
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,090
You treated him like that

411
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,630
on purpose, right?

412
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:29,610
Yes.

413
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,920
How come you're…

414
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,440
Because I don't like it

415
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,290
when Youyou calls another man father.

416
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
I got it.

417
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,040
Ms. Lu,

418
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,980
the students want to consult you

419
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,660
about a design case.

420
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,830
Oh, okay.

421
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,090
I'll get there in a minute.

422
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,190
Thank you, Teacher Liu.

423
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:56,530
You're welcome.

424
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:58,880
I...

425
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,640
You can go first.

426
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,810
I'll pick you up later.

427
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,330
We'll have dinner with Youyou.

428
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,630
Here is the case.

429
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,020
The students have been

430
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,410
assisting me all the time,

431
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,510
so I planned to take them out

432
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,140
to a nice dinner when it's over.

433
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,030
All right. We can have dinner together.

434
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,710
Together?

435
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,400
Carry on. I'll come later.

436
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,540
Wait a minute.

437
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,790
What? Who are you?

438
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,720
The one who sold soy sauce,

439
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,100
don't you think I won't recognize you

440
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,070
because you wear glasses now.

441
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,400
You're Tang...

442
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,370
You're Lu Fangning's

443
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,500
defeated opponent, Tang, right?

444
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,340
That's me.

445
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,600
What do you want?

446
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,700
I'm here to

447
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,630
exact punishment on heaven's behalf!

448
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,720
Why did you pretend to

449
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,270
be Lu Youyou's father?

450
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,150
Why do you want to break up

451
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,160
Lu Fangning and Dr. Ling?

452
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,420
I didn't.

453
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,630
Don't deny it.

454
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,860
I quit, so they could be together.

455
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,830
I won't allow you

456
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,710
to destroy it!

457
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,880
I couldn't win his love,

458
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,640
so I won't let another character

459
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,440
sideline me!

460
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,610
Are you crazy?

461
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,000
Who likes Lu Fangning?

462
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,050
You like her.

463
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,730
Me?

464
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:20,490
Yeah.

465
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,280
If you didn't like her,

466
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,260
why did you

467
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,060
tell Dr. Ling

468
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,110
you were Lu Youyou's father?

469
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,110
If you were

470
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,080
Youyou's father,

471
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:27,840
their relationship

472
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,420
would fall apart

473
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,630
for good!

474
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Why wouldn't you

475
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,150
let them be together?

476
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,620
There could only be one reason.

477
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,510
You are

478
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,530
in love with Lu Fangning.

479
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,630
That does

480
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,930
make sense.

481
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,700
But deep down,

482
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,210
do I like Lu Fangning?

483
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,390
Impossible.

484
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,650
I was not

485
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,950
the innocent boy anymore.

486
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,510
I won't fall for

487
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,470
Lu Fangning's feint.

488
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,610
I'd rather be in love with you

489
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,790
than with her.

490
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,230
Why would you say that about me?

491
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,490
Why do you like me?

492
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,480
Can't I like you?

493
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,110
You are

494
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,330
more considerate, gentle,

495
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,970
and lovely

496
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,570
than that lunatic Lu Fangning, right?

497
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,100
So, I'm better than Lu Fangning?

498
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,190
Of course.

499
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,670
So you like me more.

500
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,190
Maybe...

501
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,660
If you want to see it that way,

502
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,470
yes.

503
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,630
You have no idea

504
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,420
what I've been through

505
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,310
over the past six years.

506
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,110
I was afraid to voice my frustration.

507
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,250
I stood on my knees!

508
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,970
We're partners.

509
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,730
How could she treat me like that?

510
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,200
If it weren't for her misfortune

511
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,960
of losing her company,

512
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,600
I wouldn't work with her.

513
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,520
Yes.

514
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,700
That's exactly who Lu Fangning is.

515
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,630
You know what?

516
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,890
There have been many boys

517
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,150
who like me since my childhood.

518
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,960
Fanfan, Dingding, Liangliang, and Pengpeng

519
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,310
were always trying to win my heart.

520
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:48,980
But Lu Fangning

521
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,620
took them from me.

522
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,670
You know why?

523
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,350
Because she was jealous of me.

524
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:53,980
Yes.

525
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,320
Cause I was better than her,

526
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,750
prettier than her,

527
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,920
and I had a better figure.

528
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,020
I didn't expect that

529
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,320
Lu Fangning was such a jerk.

530
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,170
She flirted with me

531
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,050
while we were in university

532
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,170
all the time.

533
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,950
I was too silly

534
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,870
and I took that

535
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,630
as a hint of her interest in me.

536
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,620
I didn't expect that

537
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,340
Lu Fangning was such a fraud.

538
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,220
A fraud!

539
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:14,880
Cheers.

540
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,610
Cheers.

541
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,600
I checked the reviews.

542
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,860
This restaurant

543
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,120
seemed good.

544
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,090
The chefs here

545
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,170
are first-class.

546
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,060
Yes, I've been here before.

547
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,790
Their cuisines are unique.

548
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,510
Great.

549
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,270
It's a pity

550
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,490
that Master Shen couldn't come.

551
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,830
Leave him alone.

552
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,010
He never mistreats himself.

553
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,440
I bet he's having a feast right now.

554
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,170
- Good then.
- Thank you, Ms. Lu.

555
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,340
Go ahead. Suit yourself.

556
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:40,760
Enjoy it.

557
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,680
Try this.

558
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,740
How shall we

559
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,490
address your husband?

560
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,740
I'm her friend. My name is Ling Rui.

561
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,550
Ling Rui.

562
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,070
It sounds familiar.

563
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,790
I know, sir.

564
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,220
The star professor

565
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,430
from the medical school

566
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,610
whose posters get stolen

567
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,120
by female students

568
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,380
every time he gives a speech.

569
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,220
Right?

570
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,190
-Yes.
-Yes, yes.

571
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,780
Yes, yes.

572
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,590
I've heard a lot about you.

573
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,600
Ms. Lu's friends

574
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,280
are no

575
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,500
ordinary commoners.

576
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,510
We've all heard about your feats.

577
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,610
What feats?

578
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,380
It's nothing.

579
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,480
Like teachers, doctors also

580
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,040
serve society.

581
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,310
Thank you so much

582
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,570
for helping Fangning

583
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,580
with the exhibition.

584
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,800
Eat heartily.

585
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,060
Okay.

586
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,350
Thank you.

587
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,240
Come on, let's eat.

588
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,130
Go ahead.

589
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,330
Professor Ling.

590
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,400
You do not seem like

591
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,670
an ordinary friend of Ms. Lu.

592
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,680
-Right?
-Yes.

593
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,200
Something is going between you two.

594
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,830
That's right!

595
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,290
Yes.

596
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,830
Are you dating?

597
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,550
Yes.

598
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,560
It's possible.

599
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,610
I feel so.

600
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,770
Me too.

601
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,860
All right. Stop it.

602
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,120
I won't treat you to dinner again

603
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,670
if you keep prying on their privacy.

604
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,970
Why can't I move my hands?

605
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,850
There is no problem.

606
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,950
I can't get inspiration!

607
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,860
The annoying old man

608
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,830
said he'd be free every weekend,

609
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,180
why isn't he coming?

610
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,120
I knew it.

611
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,800
Is it this room?

612
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:46,640
I'm sorry.

613
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,690
Teachers and students,

614
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,820
I'm here for someone.

615
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,040
Ye.

616
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,060
This is for you.

617
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,500
There are people here. What are you doing?

618
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,140
To send you the flowers.

619
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,230
I've been waiting for you

620
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,030
at the dorm entrance.

621
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,080
Your roommates said you were here.

622
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
It wasn't easy to find you.

623
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,720
Just accept it.

624
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,650
I don't want them.

625
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,700
How can a girl

626
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,790
send flowers to a boy?

627
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,850
Why not?

628
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,280
I don't like it.

629
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,790
You don't like it?

630
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,100
Flowers are impractical.

631
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,980
But never mind,

632
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,330
you can like me.

633
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:17,840
Take it.

634
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:18,890
No.

635
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,650
All right.

636
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,790
Take a chair and sit down.

637
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,220
Thank you, Teacher Liu.

638
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,530
Move over a little bit.

639
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,040
Sit down.

640
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,270
Ms. Lu, Professor Ling.

641
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,870
I hope you wouldn't mind.

642
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,550
This is a follower

643
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,100
of the very best student

644
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,280
in our major.

645
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,750
The girl

646
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,920
has no bad intentions.

647
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,310
She is cute.

648
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,320
She does look cute.

649
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,670
It's okay. I don't mind.

650
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,680
It's okay.

651
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,940
All right.

652
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,460
Don't you feel embarrassed

653
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,350
with so many people here?

654
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,260
No.

655
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,830
The more, the merrier.

656
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,090
Why didn't you

657
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,030
reply to my message?

658
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,160
I...

659
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,180
Just eat.

660
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,360
I know you care about me.

661
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,860
Just say it if you like me.

662
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,510
It's a bit easier for girls to woo boys.

663
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,360
The Internet tells the truth.

664
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,290
Oh, come on.

665
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,310
It's too mushy.

666
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,400
That's right.

667
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,040
Does this scene remind you of something?

668
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,030
No.

669
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,240
That's right.

670
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,040
Yeah.

671
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,970
Who likes girls wooing boys?

672
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,470
I don't.

673
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,390
Enough.

674
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,860
I almost forget the serious topic

675
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,250
because you interrupted.

676
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,900
The exhibition

677
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,790
held by our major

678
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,130
and Ms. Lu

679
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,220
was a success.

680
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,910
The leader of the university praised us.

681
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,380
Thanks to

682
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,020
Ms. Lu and Master Shen.

683
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,570
Since Master Shen is not here,

684
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,600
I'll propose a toast to Ms. Lu.

685
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,230
Good.

686
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,320
-Good.
-Yes.

687
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,330
Thank you.

688
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,220
Bottom-up!

689
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:47,970
Sir,

690
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,990
she's had too much wine.

691
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,540
I'll take this for her. Cheers.

692
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,470
All right.

693
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,530
Ling Rui, you can't drink much.

694
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,120
I'm fine.

695
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,770
Why can't Professor Ling drink?

696
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,510
-Professor Ling is so cool.
-Impressive!

697
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:04,600
Impressive!

698
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,700
Professor Ling is so cool.

699
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,320
Why do you...

700
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,940
I'm sorry.

701
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,780
You go ahead.

702
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,740
I'll answer a call.

703
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,180
Sis,

704
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,070
I bet he's your new friend.

705
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,450
You may not know that.

706
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,540
The students

707
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,760
from medical school told me

708
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,520
Professor Ling would never have any trouble with drinking.

709
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,170
It takes more than ten shots o make his face red.

710
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,250
Yeah.

711
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:35,600
That's true.

712
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,300
-That's right.
-Yes.

713
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,860
He sure can drink.

714
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,190
Yes.

715
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,870
Really?

716
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,610
Yes.

717
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,650
What's wrong?

718
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,670
Nothing.

719
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,040
Stop it.

720
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,690
You've had enough.

721
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,080
Here, Professor. Thank you.

722
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,520
Okay, here. Ms. Lu and Professor Ling.

723
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,070
Let's have a toast

724
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,290
to celebrate.

725
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,090
-To celebrate.
-Cheers!

726
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,310
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

727
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,250
Lu Fangning.

728
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,360
Why do you come back to the campus?

729
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,540
Because I have something

730
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,800
to ask you here.

731
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,690
Over there, over there.

732
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,850
Why did you ignore me?

733
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,760
I've told you that.

734
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,080
To avoid unnecessary troubles.

735
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,040
Troubles?

736
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,510
Who is the trouble?

737
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,280
You or me?

738
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,220
You're drunk.

739
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,980
I think so.

740
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,250
I feel a little bit drunk.

741
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,260
But I'm happy.

742
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,670
What's wrong with you?

743
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,940
You drank as much as I did.

744
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,420
How are you still so calm?

745
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,040
Your ears are red.

746
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,210
You used to recite

747
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,480
the medical books

748
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,340
when you got drunk, right?

749
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,020
Now you've changed.

750
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,410
Your ears turn red.

751
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,350
I noticed it.

752
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,430
Let's go sit over there.

753
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,170
You shouldn't have drunk so much.

754
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,390
I'm fine.

755
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,690
You can't drink as much as you used to.

756
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:33,800
I...

757
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,990
I haven't had social activities

758
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,090
for so many years. That's for sure.

759
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,720
What's about you?

760
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,370
When did you learn to drink so well?

761
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,680
You can drink more than I do.

762
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,820
I had been practicing

763
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,680
after you left.

764
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,790
Come here.

765
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,360
Let me ask you.

766
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,710
Do you feel like

767
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,230
the silly girl today

768
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,200
reminded you of me?

769
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,580
You two are quite similar

770
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,970
in some ways.

771
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:16,640
I knew it.

772
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,380
Silly girl. Silly girl.

773
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:22,860
I knew that's how

774
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,810
you thought of me.

775
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,490
I bought you flowers and wooed you.

776
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,380
I thought I was cool.

777
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:31,760
But actually,

778
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,240
I never considered

779
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,330
your feelings.

780
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,690
I saw the boy today.

781
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,220
He felt a little embarrassed, right?

782
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,050
I'm sorry.

783
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,020
Previously,

784
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,990
I've brought you

785
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,120
so many troubles.

786
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm sorry.

787
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,510
I'm sorry.

788
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,860
You're too drunk.

789
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,830
You can't see straight.

790
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,530
You're talking nonsense.

791
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,770
I can.

792
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,580
It's been six years.

793
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,690
Ling Rui.

794
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,480
It's been six years.

795
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,510
Both you and I have changed.

796
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,750
We're not the same as before.

797
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,150
So I figured it out.

798
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,640
What did you figure out?

799
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,030
If you want to

800
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,890
be in a relationship

801
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,110
or get married, that's okay.

802
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,700
You don't have to tell me.

803
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,380
You don't have to tell me

804
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,950
who you're in love with.

805
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,160
And I won't

806
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,890
harass you

807
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,480
in any capacity.

808
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,520
You don't have to

809
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,870
worry about Youyou.

810
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,800
He is a good boy.

811
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,070
I'll tell Youyou

812
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,900
that he has

813
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,130
a great father.

814
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,070
And he has the right to

815
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,570
pursue his own happiness.

816
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,880
So don't worry.

817
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,710
About Ms. Yu,

818
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,680
if you like her,

819
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,770
commit to the relationship.

820
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,220
I'm serious.

821
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,750
I said

822
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,310
she was a bad person, right?

823
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,820
I said it out of spite.

824
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,720
I think she is nice.

825
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,020
Youyou likes her too.

826
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,780
If you two

827
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,710
form a family together,

828
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,770
I'll be happy for you.

829
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:47,920
All the best.

830
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,190
Do you

831
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,540
really think so?

832
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,070
I won't bother you anymore.

833
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,480
What are you doing?

834
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,360
Lu Fangning.

835
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,100
I know you're not that drunk.

836
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,380
Can you see it clearly now?

837
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,690
Who am I?

838
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:32,820
Ling Rui.

839
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,750
Who am I to you?

840
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,220
My ex-husband.

841
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,490
Your ex-husband.

842
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:45,970
Lu Fangning.

843
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,070
From the moment

844
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,540
you showed up

845
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,800
in my life six years ago,

846
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,270
you've been like this.

847
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,850
You come and go as you want.

848
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,290
Yes.

849
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,110
You chose for me

850
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,990
to go to Germany.

851
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,220
But so what?

852
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,690
To forget you,

853
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,000
I can handle alcohol

854
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,230
better than you now.

855
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,940
Are you satisfied?

856
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,450
After I came back,

857
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,600
I went to your apartment...

858
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,710
to see if the light

859
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,180
would be on again.

860
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,750
I went to Deer Sing's mall,

861
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,940
wondering I might meet you.

862
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,700
I wanted to check on you secretly.

863
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,060
But I never saw you.

864
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,220
Why didn't you come back?

865
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,910
Were you too busy?

866
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,760
Were you sick?

867
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,810
Didn't you miss me at all?

868
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,500
You fought with someone over me

869
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,270
when you felt like it,

870
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,950
as if you loved me so much.

871
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,860
You avoided me when you felt upset.

872
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,500
What about the next time?

873
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,650
Are you going to leave

874
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:18,580
without a word

875
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,090
taking Youyou with you?

876
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,510
Lu Fangning.

877
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,870
You always decided without considering my feelings.

878
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,400
We have

879
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,960
a son now.

880
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,810
Yet you told me

881
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,210
you wouldn't bother my life anymore.

882
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,280
Listen carefully.

883
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,140
Youyou is our kid,

884
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,410
he's the eternal bond between us.

885
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,780
Don't you ever take him away.

886
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,890
I will always be

887
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,560
part of your life.

888
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:03,560
Ling Rui.

889
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:08,750
Do you think

890
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,650
I don't have the right

891
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,570
to ask you to stay

892
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,490
as your ex-husband?

893
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,050
Is that so?

894
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,710
I...

895
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,490
Let's make it work this time.

896
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:37,620
What do you mean?

897
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,130
We'll start over.

898
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,150
I...
