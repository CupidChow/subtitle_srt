if I'm dreaming now.

You should pinch yourself.

won't you feel bad?

Before I came,

75
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,220
I thought in the first place that

76
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,150
these sets of clothes

77
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,240
you prepared

78
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,480
weren't quite suitable for me.

79
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,130
But

80
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,440
it turns out that

81
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,290
they're both decent, elegant,

82
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,880
and make me look very friendly.

83
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,520
It's good that you're satisfied with them.

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,800
You have to look beautiful.

85
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,720
How have you been during these two days?

86
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,570
It's been so-so.

87
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,690
What do you mean?

88
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,770
What's wrong?

89
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,170
You look a bit down in the dumps.

90
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,480
You and Simon...

91
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,450
Because of the recorder?

92
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,409
Is it because of the recorder?

93
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,050
Ms. Lu.

94
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,250
Regarding this matter,

95
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,400
I haven't apologized to you yet.

96
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,330
If it wasn't because of my recorder,

97
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,090
there won't be so many troubles.

98
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,490
Why do you have to apologize to me?

99
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,250
Those are essential facts.

100
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,330
I dare to take responsibility for what I've done.

101
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,400
It's not a big deal.

102
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,330
Don't be like this anymore.

103
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,250
Show me a happy face.

104
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:03,770
How about

105
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,690
I give you a pay raise afterward?

106
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,880
And double bonus.

107
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,250
Thank you, Ms. Lu.

108
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,930
Why did you think

109
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,250
that I'm suitable

110
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,200
for that kind of mini skirt for a lady?

111
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,410
You look good in whatever type of costume.

112
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,690
Today's light

113
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,250
will probably make them look good.

114
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,440
Why are your hands so cold?

115
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,570
Are you nervous?

116
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,730
I've never taken part in this kind of photoshoot before.

117

It's my first time,

118

00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,360
The products of a brand in LM Deer Sing Store

176
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,970
were found defective.

177
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,320
This time around

178
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,770
is just a routine inspection.

179
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,770
They didn't regard LM Deer Sing Group

180
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,520
as a typical one.

181
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,290
We've already contacted

182
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,040
the merchant

183
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,880
to see how to deal with it.

184
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,440
Ms. Lu

185
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,320
has been notified.

186
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,850
She'll go directly to the store.

187
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,640
You might bump into her

188
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,280
in the store.

189
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,400
How's the situation?

190
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,730
This is the inspection report at the time of purchase.

191
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,160
Leqi has entered LM Deer Sing Store

192
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,800
for three years.

193
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,890
Product quality

194
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,480
has never been a problem.

195
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,570
The procedures are also very complete.

196
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,890
Before entering the store,

197
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,200
the company had also conducted random inspections,

198
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,000
and no problem was found.

199
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,320
How about Leqi's side?

200
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,320
We've already contacted them.

201
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,370
They said there was no problem with the products.

202
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,600
I guessed they would say so.

203
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,000
We can only know the actual outcome

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,640
after checking.

205
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,650
Gao Erfan,

206
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,800
you sorted all the people

207
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,530
who had dealt with

208
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,440
this batch of products before.

209
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,120
There must be a detailed review of all the procedures

210
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,000
to identify

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,600
the exact problem.

212
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,400
Also,

213
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,010
we'll announce publicly that

214
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,050
Lu Ming will treat

215
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,490
this matter seriously

216
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,770
and give the public an explanation.

217
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,010
Tonight

218
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,610
might be a bit hard for us.

219
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,800
We need to check

220
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,800
all the products in the store again

221
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,680
to make sure that

222
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,450
there won't be another Leqi.

223
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:01,920
Yes.

224
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,320
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,240
I've told you that

226
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,330
you don't have to come with me.

227
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,450
I'm in a hurry.

228
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,160
I can't return home

229
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,530
in awhile.

230
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,080
I'm fine.

231
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,330
It's good that you can handle it.

232
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,120
I also have to go back to the hospital first.

233
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,960
Be careful.

234
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,480
Thank you for your hard work, Simon.

235
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,760
I'm leaving.

236
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,160
Peng Bo.

237
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,650
Is everything okay in the wards during these few days?

238
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:31,800
You're back.

239
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:33,810
Nothing happened.

240
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,270
[To Ling Rui]

241
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,000
Are you exhausted

242
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,800
after going back this time?

243
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,130
When is the express delivery?

244
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,090
This morning. What happened?

245
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,780
[Interview notice]

246
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,280
Your expression...

247
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,960
What is this?

248
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,720
Ling Rui.

249
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,330
You've received it, right?

250
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:07,920
I heard that this time around,

251
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,360
you should be on the list.

252
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,240
Professor.

253
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,450
Great.

254
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,480
That's great.

255
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,210
This is the notification letter sent

256
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,120
by the Pancreas Institute

257
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,090
in Germany?

258
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,960
My goodness, Ling Rui.

259
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,840
Finally, you're going to succeed.

260
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,560
This fellow...

261
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,570
What kind of expression is this?

262
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,010
This is something to be happy about.

263
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,920
Why didn't you even smile?

264
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,850
Of course I'm happy.

265
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,130
When will you

266
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,920
join the orientation?

267
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,640
They asked me

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,280
to attend an interview in Germany in a week.

269
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,610
Why do you need to go for an interview

270
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,560
when you've received the notification letter?

271
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,800
You know nothing.

272
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,720
The person in charge of the project

273
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,240
which Ling Rui will join this time around

274
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,720
will be his mentor in the future.

275
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,960
Of course he needs to visit him.

276
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,440
Don't worry.

277
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,480
It's just part of the procedure.

278
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,680
There won't be any problems.

279
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,960
Besides conducting research normally,

280
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,530
Professor Cliff

281
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,880
is just a simple-minded person.

282
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,920
He's one with a kind personality.

283
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:08,880
When are you leaving?

284
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,720
Do you need to apply for leave?

285
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,520
I can sign now.

286
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,240
You can go now.

287
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,680
Professor Luo.

288
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,240
It's a week later

289
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,440
for the interview.

290
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,320
He's been waiting for so long.

291
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,040
I hope that he can go right away.

292
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,640
Right now.

293
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,440
Immediately.

294
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,560
Professor.

295
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,930
He has a family.

296
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,120
No matter what,

297
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
he needs to inform his family.

298
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,200
Moreover, he'll leave for three years.

299
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,240
How can he leave now?

300
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,760
It'll delay his plan of getting a baby.

301
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,240
Gosh.

302
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,000
Don't bother him

303
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,800
at this time, okay?

304
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,320
This is really a big deal.

305
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,720
Hello, it's me.

306
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,160
How's the preparation

307
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,040
for the next action?

308
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay.

309
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,960
Always get ready.

310
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,080
Listen to my signal.

311
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,440
Dr. Ling.

312
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,680
Ms. Lu is inside.

313
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,360
You can go in.

314
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,600
Okay, thank you.

315
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,920
Hello, this is the general manager's office.

316
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,200
You're here.

317
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,090
Have you had your meal?

318
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,240
Not yet.

319
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,840
Here's the food delivered to you by me.

320
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,040
Let me answer it.

321
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,760
What's it again?

322
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,400
Ms. Lu.

323
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,560
Two brands

324
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,760
wanted to withdraw from our store.

325
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,480
Hold them up for now.

326
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,080
Ask them to hold their horses.

327
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,760
Okay.

328
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
What's the situation now?

329
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,480
I can still handle it.

330
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,640
How about you?

331
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,520
You went to work today.

332
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,200
Did any young nurse harass you?

333
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,400
I'm always cold.

334
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
I didn't give a smile at all.

335
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,080
Really?

336
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,160
How is it like? Show me.

337
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,440
Your eyes are still smiling.

338
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,200
Change to another look.

339
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,520
That's more like it.

340
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,120
You're so good.

341
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:16,720
Thank you.

342
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,240
Fangning.

343
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,280
I have something to tell you.

344
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,360
What happened?

345
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,040
Today, I received...

346
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,880
Oh, I'm doomed.

347
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,640
I asked them to go and check the store,

348
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,720
but I forgot to tell them

349
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,040
that the newly entered brands

350
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,600
also need to be checked.

351
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,080
It'll be miserable if there's a mistake again.

352
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,960
I have to go to the store.

353
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,600
Did you just say

354
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,120
that you want to

355
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,030
tell me something?

356
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,800
There's nothing.

357
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,640
You go ahead.

358
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,880
I'll tell you again

359
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,200
when you've done your stuff.

I'm sorry.

368
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,760
There were even more things to settle when I reached the store.

369
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,520
Why are you still here?

370
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,200
Were you asleep?

371
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,080
I'm really sorry.

372
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,400
I'll still have to be here

373
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,800
and wait for updates from the store.

374
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,760
I can't go back yet.

375

These two factories

480
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,030

481
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,040
which were revealed swiftly,

482
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,110
causing the public

483
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,150
to have a bad impression on LM Deer Sing.

484

Moreover, many brands

485
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,640
have terminated their cooperation with LM Deer Sing Group one after another now.

486
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,830
Today's stock price reached a limit down.

487
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,310
If things don't get better,

488
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,440
the shareholders

489
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,550
will definitely create chaos first.

490
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,200
This matter was exposed too quickly

491
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,270
with too many coincidences.

492
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,110
I've asked someone to look into it,

493
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,080
but it takes time.

494
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
The most important thing now

495
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,680
is to prevent the news from spreading like wildfire.

496
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,230
I'll personally go to Leqi

497
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,230
and Hanping's factories.

498
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,110
It's indeed better

499
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,080
for the manufacturers to give an explanation.

500
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,230
I'll go with you then.

501
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,910
Wait a minute.

502
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,680
Okay.

503
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,160

504
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,600
Is sister-in-law okay?

505
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,190
When I took the subway this morning,

506
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,560
I heard from the news,

507
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,110
they were all talking

508
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,110
about her company's issue.

509
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,830
It's a big mess.

510
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,600
Yes.

511
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,680
Go away.

512
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,560
There's nothing to gossip about. Go away.

513
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,310
I'm concerned about the director now.

514
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,320
Well,

515
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,270
you go over there.

516
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,560
I have something to talk to him about.

517
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:19,800
Just go over there.

518
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:31,960
Regarding your studies in Germany,

519
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,870
you haven't told her, right?

520
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,160
You said an affirmative sentence.

521
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,590
Based on what I understand about you,

522
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,830
you'll never say at this time.

523
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,790
Bro, can you say something?

524
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,630
You've already said an affirmative sentence.

525
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,510
What do you want me to answer?

526
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,270
You always bottle things up.

527
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,590
When are you going to tell her?

528
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,470
The interview will start in two days.

529
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,190
Okay.

530
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,310
What are you thinking?

531
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,630
Have you booked the flight ticket?

532
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,310
Have you got in touch with Germany's side?

533
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,720
Yes, this interview is only part of a procedure.

534
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,400
But you don't even go through the procedure.

535
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,080
Doesn't that mean you're giving up?

536
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,590
I think Lu Fangning is quite capable.

537
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,600
It's no use for you to worry here.

538
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,480
Since you have the time,

539
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,120
you should think

540
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,790
about your future.

541
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,680
Oh my goodness, bro!

542
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,230
I...

543
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,400
I'm so worried about you.

544
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,240
Just eat,

545
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,990
it's all yours.

546
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:55,230
[Leqi]

547
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,440
Ms. Lu,

548
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,590
I really don't know

549
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,320
where the problem lies.

550
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,710
We've always kept our feet on the ground

551
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,390
while doing our jobs.

552
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,720
We've also received

553
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,790
a lot of returned orders now.

554
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,470
It's also not a small loss.

555
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,150
Now is not the time to talk about this.

556
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,710
The most important thing is to figure out the solution.

557
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,950
What say you?

558
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,470
I have a solution here.

559
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,630
That's to recall all the products

560
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,440
in the same batch.

561
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,240
As long as the customers have inquiries,

562
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,150
we'll refund them,

563
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:06,960
no matter if they think

564
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,230
the product is defective or not.

565
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,710
I've allocated all my funds

566
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,960
for the expansion of the factory

567
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,510
and the import of new equipment.

568
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,550
Aren't you causing difficulty for me now?

569
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,190
That's the only solution for now

570
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,790
which can regain

571
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,320
the customers' trust towards us in their minds.

572
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,840
It's worth it in the long run.

573
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,990
For Hanping's side,

574
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:23,830
I'll also go

575
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,800
and discuss it with them.

576
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,710
Ms. Lu,

577
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,790
I know that your solution

578
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,870
is also good for us.

579
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,910
But

580
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,150
Hanping is the same as us.

581
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,720
We're all emerging companies.

582
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,150
If you want us to utilize the cash flow

583
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,510
for the refunds,

584
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,350
my whole factory's operations

585
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,760
can only be discontinued.

586
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,640
Look.

587
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,830
I'm raising so many people.

588
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,110
If we stop production,

589
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,150
my business

590
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,280
will be considered going bankrupt.

591
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,230
Ling Rui.

592
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,560
I got you.

593
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,630
What brought you over?

594
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,790
How did you know that I'm here?

595
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,070
I went to the company and couldn't find you.

596
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,590
I guessed you would be here.

597
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,510
Is it difficult to solve

598
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,190
LM Deer Sing Group's crisis?

599
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,430
In fact, it's not impossible to solve it.

600
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,320
It should be all right for Lu Ming

601
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,790
to get through this crisis.

602
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,120
It's just that those two factories

603
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,350
may no longer

604
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,110
be revived.

605
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,630
Do you think

606
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,110
if I should lend them a helping hand?

607
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,230
If you happen to save them,

608
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,510
will you encounter any difficulty?

609
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,550
Those two factories

610
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,070
hire hundreds of employees.

611
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,790
I thought

612
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,720
that you surely would ask me

613
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,910
to help them.

614
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,670
I'm not that holy.

615
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,640
The Savior needs to save himself first.

616
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,750
Moreover,

617
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,470
LM Deer Sing Group's survival

618
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,480
is also related to many people's lives.

619
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,390
You're running a business.

620
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,710
The concepts of conscience,

621
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:10,830
original intention,

622
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,630
and compassion

623
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,310
can only be practiced

624
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,030
with the premise that the company can survive.

625
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,910
Besides,

626
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,390
if you have a way to protect yourself,

627
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,230
you don't need to think about

628
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,070
the temporary gains nor losses.

629
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,550
After all,

630
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,230
it'd be a good deed

631
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,480
if you can help others.

632
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:28,910
Okay.

I have something to ask for your help with.

You ask me to come over.

666

Is there any solution?

667
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,190
I'm thinking to let LM Deer Sing Group take

668
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,550
all the responsibilities for now.

669
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:51,870
What do you mean?

670
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,790
Before the issue

671
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,150
gets worse,

672
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,150
I want LM Deer Sing Group

673
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,710
to bear all the losses in advance.

674
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,230
To meet all the needs of customers,

675
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,070
including returns, refunds, and even compensation.

676
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,510
For the products' environmental issues,

677
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,470
the direct responsible parties

678
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,990
are their brand manufacturers.

679
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,540
After all,

680
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,430
LM Deer Sing Store is just

681
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,390
a sales platform for these brands.

682
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,190
We shouldn't take all the responsibilities.

683
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,630
Of course I know.

684
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,790
I'll also hold those

685
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,870
manufacturers accountable for these.

686
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,990
But the point

687
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,910
is they totally don't have

688
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,470
the ability

689
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,150
to afford all the compensation.

690
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,790
There's only a dead end for them.

691
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,790
Moreover, the key to the problem

692
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,190
is to appease public opinion

693
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,630
by meeting customers' needs.

694
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,150
What I worry about is that if we do so,

695
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,110
we'll need to contribute a lot of funds.

696
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,430
That's too risky.

697
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,830
Is there any better way?

698
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,580
Let's issue a statement publicly

699
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,590
that we'll strictly check for the parties responsible for these.

700
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,630
As long as we dare to face the problem,

701
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,550
LM Deer Sing Group's reputation will soon be rebuilt.

702
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,510
How long is required?

703
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:52,990
It's feasible.

704
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,830
But you need enough

705
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,980
funds to support the effort.

706
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,750
Also, it's not that

707
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,350
you can execute it

708
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,670
after Simon and I

709
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,420
have agreed.

710
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,030
What about the board?

711
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,910
Have you thought about it?

712
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,260
Of course I know that

713
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,230
there's a huge risk for this.

714
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,870
But LM Deer Sing Group's credibility

715
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,230
must be rebuilt immediately.

716
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,870
I've asked Gao Erfan to contact

717
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,750
all the investors

718
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,990
who approached us before.

719
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,390
I'll also filter out those investors

720
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,190
who are competent enough

721
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,750
and are willing to help us as soon as possible.

722
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,750
I believe that we'll have a bargaining chip

723
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,740
in front of the board.

724
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,430
For my side,

725
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,430
there're also a few trustworthy

726
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,270
investors who are close with me.

727
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,990
I can convince them.

728
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:38,750
Okay.

729
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,420
I'll go and ask

730
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,260
those investors

731
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,430
to see if they're still interested.

732
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,300
According to the current

733
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,100
situation of our store,

734
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,910
we must filter out

735
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,830
the most suitable

736
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,990
investor within two days.

737
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,020
Little bear,

738
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,900
thank you for eating with me.

739
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,310
Come on.

740
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,990
I toast you.

741
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,140
Bottoms up.

742
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,830
Boss must be so worried

743
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,510
that her hair is even falling out now.

744
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,700
By thinking so,

745
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,950
we ordinary people

746
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,150
still live a more comfortable life.

747
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,450
Come on.

748
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,230
Let's clink first.

749
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,030
Okay.

750
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,830
In fact, I asked you out today

751
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,780
is because our...

752
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,790
Look at you.

753
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,909
You talk about the work from the beginning

754
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,750
when you invited me out for a meal?

755
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,429
Fine. Then

756
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:19,940
I toast you again.

757
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,500
I get drunk easily.

758
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,620
You may drink more.

759
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,900
Okay, I'll drink it.

760
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,469
Who is this woman?

761
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,150
Both of them are single.

762
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,100
What does it mean that they're eating together at night?

763
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,429
It's a difficult period of time for LM Deer Sing Group now.

764
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,060
I can't believe that he still has time

765
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,340
to dine with a woman.

766
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,940
Yiyao.

767
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,530
It's actually okay that LM Deer Sing Group can't hold on,

768
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,460
or

769
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,060
you can come to my company.

770
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:54,989
Although your last name is Lu,

771
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,310
this world shows us that

772
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,910
those long united shall be divided.

773
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,470
Why do you care so much?

774
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,950
How come you still touch him?

775
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,870
Lu Yiyao.

776
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,870
Don't you stay away from strangers?

777
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,350
Why did you change your mind now?

778
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,380
Come on.

779
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,870
Have a drink.

780
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,420
Okay.

781
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,060
Then I represent LM Deer Sing Group

782
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,100
to toast you again.

783
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,180
Cai...

784
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,980
Who is this?

785
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,710
This is LM Deer Sing Group's employee,

786
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,910
Miss Cai Siyu.

787
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,620
This is Ms. Xu.

788
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,590
We're here

789
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,220
to talk about the investment in LM Deer Sing Group.

790
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,430
Ms. Xu.

791
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,270
Well...

792
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,950
This is our first time meeting,

793
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,390
I'll toast you first.

794
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,620
Well.

795
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,380
Ms. Xu,

796
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,020
I'm sorry that

797
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,390
I was reckless just now.

798
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,540
I'll punish myself for a shot.

799
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,990
Well,

800
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,070
Director Lu

801
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,750
usually doesn't drink a lot.

802
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,860
I'm still quite okay with it.

803
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,380
I'll toast you on behalf of Director Lu.

804
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,350
What are you doing?

805
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,870
Ms. Xu,

806
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,750
I'm also an employee of LM Deer Sing Group.

807
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,390
LM Deer Sing Group has encountered such a huge crisis,

808
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,230
I...

809
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,110
On behalf of my colleagues,

810
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,430
I toast you,

811
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,340
hoping that you

812
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,260
can help us.

813
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,540
That's enough.

814
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,910
It's okay, Director Lu.

815
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,790
I'm still okay.

816
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,990
I'll treat you

817
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,830
well today.

818
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,100
If this is the case...

819
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,510
Waiter,

820
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,660
get us ten more bottles.

821
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,380
That's enough.

822
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,430
Let me drink it.

823
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,940
Director Lu, you can't drink too much.

824
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,100
I'll drink it.

825
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,590
Don't drink anymore, okay?

826
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,020
I'll drink it.

827
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:38,790
I'll drink it.

828
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,990
That's enough, don't drink anymore.

829
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,140
I'll drink it.

830
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,270
I'm still okay.

831
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,660
Don't drink it.

832
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,540
Give it to me.

833
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,710
Don't drink anymore.

834
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,190
That's enough.

835
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,900
She's gone.

836
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,540
Why did you come here again?

837
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,820
You were creating chaos here.

838
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,300
What are you talking about?

839
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,830
I did it for you.

840
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,660
If I didn't see you,

841
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,340
you may be with that Ms. Xu...

842
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,510
Right?

843
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,390
You scumbag don't appreciate it.

844
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,270
I just wanted to help you.

845
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,950
I was just here to talk about...

846
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,460
Just to have a talk?

847
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,980
Okay, if you want to have a talk, then drink it.

848
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,070
Drink it.

849
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,660
Okay, I'll drink it.

850
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,420
Let's see what will happen if I don't help you. Drink it.

851
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,900
Aren't you capable of drinking a lot?

852
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,700
Then you should drink it, too.

853
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,150
Okay, I'll drink it.

854
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,350
Come on.

855
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,180
Don't stop. Continue.

856
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:55,020
♫ The rose petals have a potent fragrance ♫

857
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:04,830
♫ I don't mind walking on the streets alone ♫

858
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:14,340
♫ The movies are always full of disappointment and farewells ♫

859
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:22,470
♫ But who will watch them with me ♫

860
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,310
♫ Slowly, we get closer ♫

861
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,900
♫ I like you ♫

862
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,750
♫ Only you ♫

863
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:38,550
♫ You're my one and only ♫

864
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:44,750
♫ Tonight, I'll let my mind wander ♫

865
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,820
Why are you swaying?

866
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,900
I drank too much.

867
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,860
We...

868
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,660
Where are we going?

869
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,990
Go to bed.

870
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,110
Go to bed?

871
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,260
Where to sleep?

872
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,350
Go there.

873
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,270
Go there to sleep.

874
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:26,030
♫ I want to travel to Paris and Tokyo, and eat chocolate by the sea ♫

875
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,390
♫ As long as I'm with you ♫

876
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:37,860
♫ We can lie on the beach and count the stars ♫
