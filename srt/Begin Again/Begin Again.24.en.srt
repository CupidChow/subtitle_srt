00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,870
Hello, Ling Rui.

5
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,490
What's the matter?

6
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,750
Why did you run away just now?

7
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,460
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,990
I can't make it

9
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,460
You're awake?

10
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,790
-Morning.
-Morning.

11
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,340
Why are you looking at me like this?

12
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,030
I'm really all right.

13
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,340
Who am I?

14
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,900
I'm Lu Fangning.

15
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,230
Don't worry.

16
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,460
I can definitely save LM Deer Sing Group.

17
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,710
It's also okay

18
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,020
to be a "salted fish" (loser) occasionally

19
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,030
instead of Lu Fangning.

20
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,620
Salted fish is smelly.

21
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,300
I don't want to.

22
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,940
I don't want to be stinky Fangning.

23
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,620
I made salted fish porridge today.

24
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,940
Do you want some?

25
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,740
Of course.

26
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,060
You're finally back.

27
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,830
Go Erfan issued the notice

28
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,980
to suspend

29
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,780
all the operations of Infinity.

30
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,460
I received his email.

31
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,710
What exactly does he want to do?

32
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,620
He feels that I don't deserve

33
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,030
to fulfill the dream of my sister.

34
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,220
He wants to ruin LM Deer Sing Group

35
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,180
and us.

36
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,180
I'm really speechless.

37
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,140
So what do you want to do next?

38
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,540
I'll never let him

39
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,740
have his way easily.

40
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,980
As said on the phone,

41
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,020
when will you give me

42
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,950
Infinity's public relations plan

43
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,430
for all the dealers

44
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,540
and media?

45
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,220
Ms. Lu,

46
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,180
we still have

47
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,260
other things which must be done first.

48
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,940
I want a specific time.

49
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,980
Ms. Lu, a notice has been issued

50
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,020
that Infinity's

51
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,420
plan has been suspended.

52
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,300
Even if the project has been terminated,

53
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,350
we still need to give everyone an explanation.

54
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,940
Give it to me within today.

55
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,680
Ms. Lu,

56
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,650
you're no longer in charge of LM Deer Sing Group.

57
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,690
It's not like before that

58
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,280
everything is your call.

59
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,960
We're just employees.

60
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,800
Please don't make this too hard for us.

61
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,360
But I'm talking about work now.

62
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,680
What is it?

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,320
I'll do it.

64
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,399
I love working

65
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,959
so much lately.

66
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,839
Ms. Lu,

67
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,120
leave it to me.

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,230
Let's go.

69
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,600
Don't worry.

70
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,640

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,600
Come.

Thank you.

74

You're welcome.

75

I know that

76
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,800
you could make

77
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,690
those snobby employees follow your instructions

78
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,440
even if I wasn't there.

79
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,680
But

80
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,320
you can think of me as someone

81
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,560
who wants to play a protagonist.

82
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,800
Let me who is sweet and naive

83
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
to save the domineering boss once.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,640
You can treat it as an employee benefit?

85
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,680
Ms. Lu,

86
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
do you know

87
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,240
how the plot of a person like you

88
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,400
unfolds in fiction?

89
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,680
The first type is that

90
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,320
you've turned everything around,

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,200
solved your crisis in life smoothly,

92
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,360
and reached the peak of your life successfully.

93
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,000
The second type is that

94
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,640

and are at rock bottom,

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,810
but then you managed to turn things around

97
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,320
and have reached the peak of your life again.

98
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,880
The former one is more direct.

99
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
The latter

100
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,120
has a bit more plot twists.

101
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,120
But in the end,

102
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,480
you'd have reached the peak of your life.

suffer together with you.

177
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,800
Okay.

178
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,270
I got it.

179
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,670
[Divorce Agreement]

180
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,190
Sign it.

181
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,920
I wrote clearly on it

182
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,840
for the shares that

183
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,190
should be given to you.

184
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,270
I even added two more points for you.

185
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,950
You should be satisfied now.

186
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,390
Your stock

187
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,960
is worth nothing now.

188
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,640
It's too easy for you

189
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,720
to just give me these.

190
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I can only give

191
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,640
you this much.

192
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,200
I have nothing more to give you.

193
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,880
Hurry up and sign it.

194
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,360
Lu Wenbin.

195
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,880
What do you want to do?

196
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,110
Why don't you understand?

197
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,000
Everything I've done

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,320
is for your sake.

199
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,430
For my sake?

200
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,880
I haven't had a good life

201
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,920
ever since I married you.

202
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,550
I tiptoe around you every day.

203
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,840
You yell at me all the time.

204
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,320
It's good that

205
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,310
you have no money now,

206
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,320
I can finally

207
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,870
do whatever I want without caring about your feelings.

208
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,110
You want me to give up

209
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,520
this great opportunity and divorce you instead?

210
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,920
Let me tell you.

211
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,480
There's no way.

212
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,160
What exactly do you want?

213
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
-You.
-Shut up.

214
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,800
I want to be the lady of the house.

215
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,200
From now on, you have to listen to me.

216
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,910
Don't look down on me

217
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,080
because I'm a housewife.

218
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,630
My nest egg is enough

219
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,750
to support you for a lifetime.

220
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,230
From now on,

221
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,270
I'll

222
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,510
support you.

223
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,060
Don't yell here anymore, old man!

224
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,480
I...

225
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,830
Otherwise I...

226
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,480
I'll let you cook every day.

227
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,840
From now on,

228
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,280
you'll cook.

229
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,430
Our Lu family's woman...

230
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,510
Sister-in-law, don't keep blocking the TV.

231
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,520
What did I block?

232
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,280
Why are you like Ling Rui

233
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,110
who does the cleaning when something is bothering him?

234
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,080
Who is bothered?

235
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,070
I even won mahjong yesterday.

236
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,920
Who is bothered?

237
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,270
Seriously.

238
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,640
I've had enough of this.

239
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,950
What are you watching?

240
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,200
Let me take you to have fun.

241
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,910
Why did you turn it off?

242
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,560
What did he actually mean?

243
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,590
Is this kid

244
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,990
going

245
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,350
or not?

246
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,870
Just tell me something.

247
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,070
This immature kid.

248
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,390
Should I make the call or not?

249
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,430
Fangning.

250
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:06,920
Mom.

251
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,800
Is it enough? Do you want another bottle?

252
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
It's enough.

253
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,270
Fangning.

254
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,990
In fact, mom quite likes you.

255
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,670
Although

256
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,630
you're a little different from us,

257
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,110
you still work so hard

258
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,240
to get close to us.

259
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,600
After all, I'm a mother.

260
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,440
There's something that

261
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,230
I can't say.

262
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,200
You...

263
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,390
You go and talk to Ling Rui.

264
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,710
Let him go to Germany.

265
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,520
Look.

266
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,830
As expected, he didn't tell you.

267
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,750
He didn't tell me either.

268
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,070
I found out about this

269
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,790
when I came across Professor Luo last time.

270
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,510
I guess

271
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,350
the reason he kept it from us

272
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,150
is that he's unable to tell you

273
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,790
because of what happened

274
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,670
to your company.

275
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,150
I'm worried

276
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,310
that if he doesn't talk to you,

277
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,750
he'll miss this opportunity.

278
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,190
He's been working so hard

279
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,950
for all these years

280
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,109
just to go to Germany.

281
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,390
He's my son.

282
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,400
I know him well.

283
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,920
Ling Rui

284
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,830
treats his family members

285
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,950
as more important than anything.

286
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,600
Not to mention that

287
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,390
you're now

288
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,550
in such a state.

289
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,030
It's impossible for him

290
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,430
to leave you alone.

291
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,790
I don't want to interfere with your life.

292
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,400
I don't even want to...

293
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,310
I'm afraid of affecting your relationship.

294
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,270
I want to...

295
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,590
I just want to...

296
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,110
Can you

297
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,910
talk about this with him

298
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,670
sometime?

299
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,390
Fangning,

300
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,710
what is it that

301
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,430
you're looking for me in such a hurry?

302
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,600
Are you...

303
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,350
Peng Bo.

304
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,270
Tell me.

305
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,030
Is it that Ling Rui

306
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,110
had already received

307
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,230
an offer letter from the German Institute?

308
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,470
I think that since he already missed it,

309
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,000
it's pointless to talk to him about this anymore.

310
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,070
So Ling Rui

311
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,720
really rejected it.

312
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,990
Ling Rui

313
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,550
had actually been hesitating

314
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,470
whether he wanted to go

315
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,390
after what happened to you.

316
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,630
So in the end

317
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,670
after negotiation,

318
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,190
it was changed to a video interview.

319
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,910
But I don't know

320
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,630
why he left halfway

321
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,040
through the interview on that day.

322
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,110
So

323
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,950
this was to no avail eventually.

324
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,910
Do you know

325
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,310
the date

326
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,790
of his interview?

327
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,670
It was a Friday.

328
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,470
-How do you expect me
-It's all her fault.

329
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,070
to look for work at this age?

330
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,270
It's all Lu Fangning's fault.

331
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,590
If it wasn't for her

332
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,950
to let our company compensate,

333
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,990
could LM Deer Sing Group

334
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,590
have ended up like this?

335
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,750
And for Infinity,

336
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,310
she invested so much in its early stage,

337
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,390
and that put so much

338
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,790
financial pressure to LM Deer Sing Group.

339
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,510
But Ms. Lu doesn't mean to let it happen either.

340
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,190
She doesn't mean so?

341
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,190
She has shares on her hands.

342
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,110
Of course it doesn't matter.

343
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,550
She'll be fine no matter what happens.

344
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,550
These people are the most despicable ones.

345
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,070
They just think about themselves

346
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,670
and totally disregard

347
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,670
other people's lives.

348
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,150
What happened?

349
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,190
Why is there a layoff all of a sudden?

350
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,150
Leader, I won't be sacked, right?

351
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,830
I have 25 years

352
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,790
of mortgage which hasn't been paid yet.

353
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,390
I just sent my money back home

354
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,670
last month.

355
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,030
Why is there

356
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,590
a layoff suddenly?

357
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,310
I won't be sacked, right?

358
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,710
Don't ask anymore.

359
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,990
I myself don't even know

360
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,230
if I'll be laid off.

361
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,430
That's right.

362
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,400
-What should we do in this situation?
-What should we do?

363
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,470
What should I tell my family?

364
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,190
I just got the job here.

365
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,390
I don't know what

366
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,350
my girlfriend will think of me.

367
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,950
Mr. Gao, after this layoff,

368
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,960
the company has successfully got through the brand crisis.

369
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,950
But there's still a 30% reduction

370
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,630
in the turnover.

371
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,350
Do you want to reformulate

372
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,670
the plan for the next quarter?

373
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,920
Gao Erfan.

374
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,350
Today's meeting ends here.

375
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,710
The meeting is dismissed.

376
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,310
Goodbye, Mr. Gao.

377
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,950
Gao Erfan.

378
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,430
Are you crazy?

379
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,470
After sabotaging LM Deer Sing Group

380
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,350
and suspending Infinity,

381
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,150
you even laid off employees and split up various departments.

382
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,590
How far will you go

383
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,710
to be satisfied?

384
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,670
It's a very reasonable business approach

385
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,270
to have asset restructuring

386
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,150
by eliminating departments with low production efficiency.

387
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,350
Are there any questions?

388
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,470
You'll ruin

389
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,910
the lives of thousands of employees.

390
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,270
Our grudges have nothing

391
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,630
to do with them.

392
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,310
So?

393
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,830
You want to be a heroine?

394
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,630
You want to save them?

395
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,270
Okay.

396
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,230
I'll give you a chance.

397
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,910
Sell ​​all the shares

398
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,030
that Lu family owns

399
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,390
and leave LM Deer Sing Group willingly.

400
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,790
Then I might be magnanimous

401
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,950
and compassionate

402
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,270
and give you

403
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,150
a better price.

404
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,790
I'll definitely save LM Deer Sing Group.

405
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,190
I'll eliminate one more

406
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,310
department of LM Deer Sing Group

407
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,350
if you stay one more day.

408
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,230
Gao Erfan.

409
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,230
I just want you

410
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,350
to see for yourself

411
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,350
that how many people

412
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,310
will get hurt

413
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,350
because of your selfishness.

414
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,140
The first one is Ling Rui.

415
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,020
I know

416
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,750
that he gave up

417
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,030
the opportunity to go to the German Institute.

418
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,990
It was probably because of you.

419
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,430
You know

420
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,220
that after he gave up the chance this time,

421
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,790
there won't be the second one in his life basically.

422
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,310
Lu Fangning,

423
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,820
you should know perfectly

424
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,070
that what it means

425
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,510
for Ling Rui to go to Germany.

426
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,990
You should also know

427
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,990
that how much effort

428
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,190
he has put into it.

429
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,220
But you

430
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,550
forced him to marry you

431
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,870
and caused his career to be affected.

432
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,350
You foisted everything you wanted

433
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,630
on him.

434
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,470
This time is Ling Rui.

435
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,060
The last time was your sister.

436
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,310
How many people do you still want to hurt?

437
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,750
I'm very curious. I would like to ask you,

438
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,790
what's the difference

439
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,910
between the old you and now?

440
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,070
There's no difference.

441
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,700
You're always so selfish

442
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,380
and childish.

443
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,380
[Fangning, can you not be]

444
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,860
[this childish anymore?]

445
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:31,790
Sis,

446
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,630
can you come back

447
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,940
[Receiver: Sister]

448
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,870
to celebrate my birthday with me?

449
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,230
Please.

450
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,200
[Sending short message now]

451
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,630
I'll see you in that park

452
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,830
that we usually go

453
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,310
to at eleven o'clock tonight.

454
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,190
Do you know

455
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,990
the date of his interview?

456
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,070
It was a Friday.

457
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:32,820
Fangning.

458
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,870
You've done a great job.

459
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,990
I'll always be by your side.

460
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,190
It turns out

461
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,670
that I've always been like this.

462
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,260
Why do you look so pale?

463
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,780
Are you sick?

464
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,380
Dad.

465
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,830
I'm sorry.

466
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,660
In fact,

467
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,670
you shouldn't take the blame for what happened to my sister.

468
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,300
During all these years,

469
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,750
I didn't really hate you.

470
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,150
The person I hate is myself.

471
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,900
What happened to you?

472
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,190
It was my birthday at that time.

473
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,820
I asked my sister to come back, no matter what,

474
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,110
and let you make her stay on the spot.

475
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,550
I told my sister

476
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,230
that I didn't know

477
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,030
why you were there.

478
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,830
In fact, it wasn't true.

479
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,820
It wasn't like that.

480
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,900
I knew.

481
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,910
I knew that

482
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,390
you peeked at my phone.

483
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,820
But I wanted her to stay,

484
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,140
so I lied to everyone.

485
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,990
The person who killed my sister

486
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,670
was not you,

487
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,500
but me.

488
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,710
No.

489
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,300
It wasn't so.

490
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,990
Do you think I couldn't find her

491
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,270
even if you didn't say anything?

492
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,230
Ningning, I...

493
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,740
I don't know why you

494
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,420
want to tell me all these things today.

495
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,670
But this

496
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,150
was really not your fault.

497
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,900
It really wasn't so.

498
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,670
If someone

499
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,870
really had to take the blame,

500
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,350
then it'd be me.

501
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,510
No, Dad.

502
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,550
-No.
-It was my fault.

503
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,000
-Dad, I was selfish.
-If someone had to take the blame,

504
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,950
then it'd be my fault.

505
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,130
I killed my sister.

506
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,430
-It was not your fault.
-It was my...

507
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,340
-It was my...
-It was not like this.

508
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,380
-It was my fault.
-It was my...

509
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,340
-I was childish.
-It was an accident.

510
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,180
It had nothing to do with you.

511
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,990
I killed my sister!

512
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,670
No.

513
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,190
Ningning, listen to me.

514
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:29,700
I...

515
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,070
I may be really old.

516
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,110
Recently,

517
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,910
I've been here,

518
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,900
thinking about

519
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,070
a lot of things by myself.

520
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,100
Do you know?

521
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,710
I'd always been proud of your sister.

522
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,030
I hoped that she'd be my successor.

523
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,950
I tried hard to train her,

524
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,460
and she was also very obedient.

525
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,500
But I don't know

526
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,220
why so many things happened afterward.

527
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,390
I also tried hard to understand.

528
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,420
I...

529
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,100
I couldn't understand for a long time.

530
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,220
Later on,

531
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,460
I put the hope

532
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,670
in you.

533
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,020
Ningning, you've really

534
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,190
done well.

535
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,540
It's really good.

536
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,780
But I don't know

537
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,990
why I still pushed you.

538
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,300
Sometimes I thought

539
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,710
that subconsciously,

540
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,580
I wanted to give all

541
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,950
my love for your sister

542
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,820
to you. I...

543
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,430
So I hoped

544
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,940
that I could help you look for

545
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,790
a nice guy to get married

546
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,860
and have babies.

547
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,780
I hoped that you could be happy.

548
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,790
But when everything had been done,

549
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,780
I suddenly realized that you were so far away,

550
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,900
yet so close to me.

551
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,140
I... But I thought

552
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,390
that I really couldn't reach you.

553
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,100
In fact, thinking about your three siblings,

554
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,510
we should be envious of your little brother the most.

555
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,940
He lives such a pure

556
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,780
and clean life.

557
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,790
He just wants

558
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,230
to do whatever he wants to.

559
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,380
He doesn't care about what others say.

560
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,540
But looking at you now,

561
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,110
are you happy?

562
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,990
I... I kept foisting

563
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,030
the happiness

564
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,780
that I thought you should want on you.

565
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,630
I knew you didn't understand.

566
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,430
But I believed

567
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,910
that you'd understand one day.

568
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,500
But are you happy?

569
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,390
No.

570
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,470
I...

571
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,100
Ningning.

572
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,700
So for all of this,

573
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,020
it's Dad's fault.

574
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,590
I'm sorry to you.

575
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,510
Let's stop talking about it.

576
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,780
Ningning.

577
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,180
If you really feel tired,

578
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,100
then forget it.

579
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:39,900
Just leave it.

580
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,990
It's not a big deal.

581
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,670
Dad is getting old.

582
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,030
I don't want to fight anymore.

583
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,430
You should do what you want to do

584
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,940
and live the life

585
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,500
that you think is happy.

586
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,900
As long as you're happy,

587
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,270
just go ahead.

588
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,150
I'm happy if you're happy.

589
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:03,860
It's true.

590
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,550
Dad.

591
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,940
Dad.

592
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:25,700
Dad.

593
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,420
Take care.

594
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,910
What happened?

595
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,020
Little uncle.

596
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,940
Yes?

597
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,340
Dad and I have decided

598
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,260
to give up all the shares of LM Deer Sing Group.

599
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,460
But you can keep your shares.

600
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,430
After all, he doesn't treat you as his enemy.

601
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,710
There's no need.

602
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,260
The three of us,

603
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,180
brother, you, and I

604
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,550
are always together through thick and thin.

605
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,340
Thank you, little uncle.

606
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,980
You've never

607
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,110
been so formal to me before.

608
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,580
By the way,

609
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,380
I remember you mentioned before

610
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,660
that you have a friend who studies medicine

611
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,460
in Germany.

612
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,580
Yes.

613
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,580
What is it?

614
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,700
I might have to trouble him.

615
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,060
Ling Rui

616
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,020
gave up

617
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,700
the opportunity to go to Germany for me.

618
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,380
I don't want him to sacrifice for me.

619
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,180
This is always been his dream.

620
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,620
Didn't you still doubt Ling Rui's

621
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,660
feelings for me

622
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,100
previously?

623
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,900
You don't need to doubt now,

624
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,780
although it's in this way.

625
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,500
Little uncle.

626
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,500
In fact,

627
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,100
I have many

628
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,390
wonderful memories of you.

629
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,580
I'm very happy.

But I don't hope

631
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,590
that one day,

632
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,620
I'll be afraid to recall them.

633
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,270
