Founding Infinite.

5
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,270
All this while

6
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,870
has been my sister's wish,

7
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,520
if

8
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,110
she hasn't left yet.

9
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,150
The person standing here now

10
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,190
is not me.

11
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,920
It's her.

12
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,670
So I have been

13
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,830
trying so hard to be her.

14
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,670
But actually,

15
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,840
these are just my

16
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,430
bad imitation of her.

17
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,590
I will never be her.

18
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,789
Lu Yue.

19
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,410
Is completely

20
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,640
different from me.

21
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,820
This is

22
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,770
the eldest daughter of the Lu family,

23
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,800
Lu Yue.

24
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,950
Now,

25
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,100
she has completed her studies.

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,950
On this occasion today,

27
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,220
I'm grandly introducing her to you all.

28
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,670
There is only one reason.

29
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,060
I am going to retire.

30
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,780
She is gentle.

31
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,760
Kind.

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
Considerate.

33
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,250
Completely in line with all of my dad's

34
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,220
expectations of her.

35
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,780
That's so-so.

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,040
I think

37
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,840
my sister can paint a picture

38
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,850
better than this one.

39
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,590
Don't you think

40
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,160
I'm like a picture too?

41
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,320
No.

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,000
I think you are better looking than the person in the painting.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,520
You are more beautiful.

44
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,520
I didn't know at that time

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,200
what did she mean.

46
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,360
Until one day.

47
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,570
If you want to leave home

48
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,650
and be with him,

49
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,280
you can go die for me now!

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,010
Until one day,

51
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,360
she chose to leave,

52
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,680
to escape us.

53
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,360
Choose not to do be

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,600
the portrait is known as the Eldest Daughter of the Lu Family.

55
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,510
Big Sister,

56
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,330
can you come back

57
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,730
and celebrate my birthday?

58
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm begging you.

59
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,720
I will return.

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,600
See you at that park

61
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
that we frequently visit.

62
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,850
Fangning.

63
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,160
Be careful.

64
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,250
Let me put it down.

65
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,720
Did I keep you waiting?

66
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,960
Why are you so late?

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,920
Happy birthday.

68
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,330
What happened?

69
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,090
Sister, I've been waiting for you for a long time.

70
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,600
It's not twelve o'clock yet.

71
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,360
Let's take the cake home.

72
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,930
Let's go home and make a wish,

73
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,370
then blow the candles together, okay?

74
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,800
I came here in a hurry this time.

75
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,560
I didn't have time to prepare a gift.

76
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,200
I don't want any gifts.

77
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,040
I just want you to accompany me home.

78
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,840
You won't really have to leave, right?

79
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,370
You can't leave me alone

80
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,520
at home.

81
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,200
Do you like him that much?

82
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,850
Okay then.

83
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,080
I will give you a holiday.

84
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,160
Let you go for a week.

85
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,290
You can go out with him.

86
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,760
Isn't a week enough?

87
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,080
What about a month?

88
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,370
One month later,

89
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,240
-You must…
-Fangning.

90
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,770
There are some things

91
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,760
that you will understand

92
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,730
when you are older.

93
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,040
I will accompany you every year

94
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,080
on your birthday.

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,080
When I leave

96
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,240
this time,

97
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't know when

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,800
can I come back.

99
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,520
What do you mean?

100
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
How long are you going to be away?

101
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,960
So,

102
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,040
I will be with you today.

103
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,130
Celebrate your birthday.

104
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,600
Okay?

105
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,280
No.

106
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,360
But…

107
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,640
Don't be like that.

108
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,920
Come on.

109
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,880
Don't be upset.

110
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,600
No.

111
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,840
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

112
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,000
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

113
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,200
♫ Happy birthday to Fangning ♫

114
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,450
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

115
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,120
I wish our little Fangning

116
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,800
Happy 18th birthday.

117
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
18 years old.

118
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,520
You are an adult now.

119
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,480
Well,

120
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,960
I hope your life

121
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,440
will be like this box of sweets,

122
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,520
always sweet.

123
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,400
You even used it yourself.

124
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,350
Congratulations to our little Fangning

125
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,600
graduating from college at the age of 22.

126
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
Then you should

127
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,720
have your first boyfriend by then?

128
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,480
You have to cherish your first love.

129
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,320
I won't have any boyfriends.

130
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
I wish our little Fangning

131
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,230
Happy 26th birthday.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,640
At this time

133
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,240
in your life,

134
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,550
you should be embracing

135
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,800
the first peak of your career.

136
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,950
I hope that you

137
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,800
can create

138
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,720
a piece of the world that belongs to you.

139
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm so good

140
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,960
I can reach my first career peak

141
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,280
by 25.

142
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,750
So smart.

143
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,159
You are so awesome.

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,000
28 years old.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,040
You should have found

146
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,400
your other half in life.

147
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,320
I wish you

148
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,800
can be with someone you like.

149
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,720
Grow old together.

150
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,280
Be happy forever.

151
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,510
Our little Fangning is 30 years old.

152
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,440
30 years old.

153
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,200
The third decade of your life.

154
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,560
You'd have had a baby.

155
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,640
I hope you can

156
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,920
treat it well.

157
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,440
Give it a happy home.

158
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,360
No.

159
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,670
Children are troublesome.

160
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,470
Actually, in my life,

161
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,920
my wish in this life is also very simple.

162
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,270
Before 30,

163
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,440
Have a home,

164
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,160
a child,

165
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,830
and my own

166
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,000
-Furniture Brand.
-Furniture Brand.

167
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,880
How did you know?

168
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,110
You have told me that many times.

169
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,230
These things, to you,

170
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,640
are not difficult.

171
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,120
You can definitely do it.

172
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,960
Let's work hard together.

173
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,550
Let's continue.

174
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,590
No.

175
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,790
Lu Yue.

176
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,040
I'm leaving.

177
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,880

181

You have to remember

182
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,640
I will always be with you,

Can you not do this?

189

Unfortunately,

203
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,390
she didn't get her to wish at last.

204
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,630
A car accident

205
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,910
ruined it all.

206
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,230

207
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,670

I don't know who sent it to me.

212

213
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,910
remind me continuously.

214
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,550
Don't forget the pain.

Don't forget my sister.

216
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,190
That's why I

217

220
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,070
If she is still here,

221
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,870
she will do better than me.

Fangning.

223
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,790
Maybe your sister

224
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,430
doesn't want you to be

225

226
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,150
You two are different.

227

There is no right or wrong.

232

We just wish to repay.

Wish to repay?

234
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,590
Opportunities will not shape people.

You chose to be strong.

238

I sometimes hear

312

I am happy for him.

322

In the public eye, we siblings

323
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,820
seem reversed.

But I think

325
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,740
this is actually quite normal.

326
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,350

329
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,620
Nice job.

335
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,060
I have nothing to say.

336
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,500

341

share the same idea?

345
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,990
I think you are implying something again.

346
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,710
You must think that Chairman Lu

347
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,350
is getting older,

348
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,590

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,150
Deer Sing Group.

354
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,390
He will never interfere

355
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,340
with personal freedom.

356
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,430
Nor will he view

357
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,620
the career choices others made

358
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,750
with prejudice.

359
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,580
Why did you do this?

360
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,670
You deliberately let the reporter

361
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,620
expose the photos.

362
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,900
The interview was arranged beforehand

363
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,180
by you, right?

364
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,550
Why do you want to

365
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,390
turn this into a bigger issue?

366
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,340
Simon.

367
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,340
Everything is public now.

368
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,110
No one has

369
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,150
to hide anything now.

370
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,190
Isn't this great?

371
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,870
And I read the public opinion on the Internet.

372
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,180
Very good response.

373
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,390
We don't have to worry

374
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,580
about Deer Sing's image problem.

375
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,910
We even got some free promotions on

376
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,620
our spirit of keeping up with the times

377
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,100
as an entrepreneur.

378
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
What's the problem?

379
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,310
This will only make your

380
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,550
relationship with Big Brother

381
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,390
even worse.

382
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,070
Do you understand?

383
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,100
Letting things settle down slowly

384
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,220
is just the method

385
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,220
to avoid the problem.

386
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,500
I don't want the happenings in the past

387
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,270
to be repeated on Fangyu.

388
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,260
Okay.

389
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,150
Then why did you not

390
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,350
discuss it with me first?

391
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,270
I told you.

392
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,950
Please believe in me.

393
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,830
I will fix everything.

394
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,060
I'm afraid if I said it

395
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,740
you will react like this.

396
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,780
That's why I didn't tell you.

397
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,260
Finally,

398
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
with Ling Rui's encouragement,

399
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,030
I made this decision.

400
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,270
Ling Rui?

401
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,390
You are willing to listen to his opinion.

402
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,670
But not willing to discuss with me.

403
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,350
He doesn't even know what

404
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:58,860
happened before

405
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,030
in our house.

406
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,220
He will only exacerbate

407
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,780
the conflict between you and your Dad.

408
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,990
Simon.

409
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,670
This matter has nothing to do with Ling Rui.

410
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,060
It's my personal decision.

411
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,340
I hope you respect me.

412
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,940
And respect my decision

413
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,020
as the general manager of this company,

414
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,180
okay?

415
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,620
Yes.

416
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,060
They all said our Fangyu

417
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,230
danced too well.

418
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,220
They even came from abroad

419
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,380
just to invite him.

420
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,100
So, we reluctantly agreed.

421
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,060
Wenbin?

422
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,500
Of course he is unwilling.

423
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,220
After all, such a big company

424
00:22:59,220 --> 00:22:59,940
everything

425
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,900
relies on

426
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,940
Fangyu to take care of it.

427
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,700
But telecommunication is so developed now,

428
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,060
and Fangyu is smart.

429
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,180
I'm sure he can manage

430
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,500
both dancing and our business.

431
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,500
He just might be a little tired.

432
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:12,980
Okay.

433
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,980
Sure.

434
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,100
I will invite you to come and see them then.

435
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,900
Goodbye.

436
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,660
In two hours,

437
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,780
this is the 12th call I've picked up.

438
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,980
They want to ridicule me.

439
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,820
Let them watch.

440
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,580
Give them more

441
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,420
free tickets.

442
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,540
My son, I have an idea.

443
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,420
This is an opportunity.

444
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,940
Take this chance

445
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,100
to apologize to your dad.

446
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,820
Push all the blame

447
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,260
onto Lu Fangning.

448
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:49,980
I'm not going.

449
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
Over my dead body.

450
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,460
This is all clear.

451
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,460
This news,

452
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,900
these photos,

453
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,500
she exposed them all.

454
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,060
This is Lu Fangning's trick.

455
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,700
She thought by doing so,

456
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,420
she can drive you out of Deer Sing Group.

457
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,420
Mom.

458
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,660
Are you a screenwriter?

459
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,940
Big Sister is obviously helping me.

460
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,420
How can you be so ungrateful?

461
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,300
She's helping you?

462
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,380
You are brainwashed by her!

463
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,900
I've discussed this with her a long time ago.

464
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,340
This is my own decision.

465
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,740
Only by doing this

466
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,420
will Dad allow me to

467
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,580
keep dancing.

468
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,420
You are too young.

469
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,140
Too naive.

470
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,460
Too easily deceived.

471
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,300
Lu Fangning

472
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
is trying to win your trust now,

473
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,780
to drive you out of Deer Sing.

474
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,860
My son,

475
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,020
I am the only one who

476
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,770
really cares about you.

477
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,420
Mom.

478
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,170
Since 10,

479
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,220
I wanted to learn ballet.

480
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,020
You are the first one

481
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,660
to reject me.

482
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,820
Every time you hit me.

483
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,780
Every time you scold me.

484
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,260
You say all this

485
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,460
is for my own good.

486
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,260
The reason

487
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,180
I keep hiding this from you

488
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,300
is only because of Dad,

489
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,380
but also because of you.

490
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
This time,

491
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,340
can't you stand by my side?

492
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,940
No.

493
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,210
I can allow

494
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,500
anything else.

495
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,100
Only this

496
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,180
is absolutely impossible.

497
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,140
Fangyu.

498
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,980
You are too young.

499
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,340
Someday you will understand

500
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,860
my reasons for doing this.

501
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,780
I won't let anyone

502
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,820
take away

503
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,820
your things.

504
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,050
I will protect you.

505
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,380
Have you contacted the dance troupe?

506
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,500
Yes.

507
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,580
Later,

508
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,930
there is an important meeting.

509
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,380
I can't take you to the airport.

510
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,620
When you are abroad alone,

511
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,340
take care of yourself.

512
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,540
Be careful.

513
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,900
Big Sister,

514
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,370
if you suddenly act like this

515
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,020
even I'm a little uncomfortable.

516
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,570
Silly boy.

517
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,490
I'm leaving.

518
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,060
Go.

519
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,300
Take care of yourself.

520
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,140
Okay.

521
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,330
Call me if anything happens.

522
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,570
Go.

523
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,100
Okay.

524
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,780
Get lost.

525
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,130
Big Sister,

526
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,940
remember to visit me.

527
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,890
Don't you play around over there.

528
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,410

Sister, not so hard, please!

536

Don't you get lazy there, understand?

537

your ride,

540
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,130
and your tuition.

541

Do you hear me?

544

-I know you.
-Give me back

545
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,260
all the money you've siphoned

546
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,170

But I remember.

551
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,340
Regret

552
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,410
and frustration

553
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,250
are countless times worse

554
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,500
than fear.

555
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:47,930

556
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,100

Didn't I just experience a heartbreak

562
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,180
recently?

563
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,500

shouldn't be too much.

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,250
Shameless and stupid.

585

Wishful thinking.

Okay.

What do you need a recorder for?

this is our

602
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,930
Schematic diagram for the live conference.

603
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,610
Here is the entrance

604
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,330
we'll display our logo prominently,

605
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,690
and some brochures.

606
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,130
In the middle is the main stage.

607
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,380
Because our entire showroom

608
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,890
is a pillarless exhibition,

609
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:05,930
inline with

610
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,890
Infinity's

611
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,010
modern minimalist style,

612
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,170
we have built this big screen

613
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,690
and the main stage

614
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,010
consisting of three round platforms.

615
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,530
Didn't I say

616
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:16,970
that the whole venue

617
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,890
has to use Infinity's furniture?

618
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,290
What's going on with this stage?

619
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,170
This…

620
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,010
This is

621
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,650
a typical host stand.

622
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,970
So why is there

623
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,650
a typical host stand?

624
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,330
But Ms. Lu,

625
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,850
among Infinity's new products,

626
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,210
there is no table of this height.

627
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:34,900
If there isn't,

628
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,810
can't you find products from different series

629
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,980
and assemble them?

630
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,010
If you can't do it,

631
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,250
can't you find people from other departments

632
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,340
to help you?

633
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,730
Yes.

634
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:45,730
Do we have the confirmed

635
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,890

636
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,340
Yes.

637
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:49,490
We are still pending the

638
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,570
final answer from two guests.

639
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,450
How long will we need?

640
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,650
They said they would reply before 10 pm.

641
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,130
Why is it taking so long?

642
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,770
If they don't come

643
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,290
there will be two empty seats

644
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,170
in the front row.

645
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,170
Are you telling me

646
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,090
we are getting two random people

647
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,300
to sit in the front row and let reporters shoot them?

648
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,290
But they…

00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,960
I'll take a look over there.

706
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,570
Okay.

707
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,760
Mr. Sun.

708
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,560
Mrs. Sun.

709
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,890
Infinity.

710
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,920
Big Sister.

711
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,490
This is my repayment of your wish.

712
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,480
It's also a present from me to you.

713
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,120
Making my son lose so much face,

714
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,880
yet enjoying the limelight herself.

715
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,120
Don't bring the emotions at home

716
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,090
here.

717
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,050
Remember.

718
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,490
Control yourself today.

719
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,330
Understand?

720
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:52,680
I am just an old lady.

721
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,000
What can I do?

722
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,850
Do old ladies

723
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,960
dress up like you?

724
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,520
You are an elder.

725
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,920
You should look like one.

726
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,600
Smile.

727
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,970
Where are you going?

728
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,090
To the restroom.

729
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,000
Mr. Lu.

730
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,170
This is the recorder you wanted.

731
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:24,880
Okay.

732
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,850
The content has been restored.

733
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,970
Okay, good work.

734
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,290
Let me tell you.

735
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,400
Even if the marriage only lasts one year,

736
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,290
That's my wedding, Lu Fangning's wedding.

737
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,720
Ling Rui.

738
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,280
What are you doing?

739
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,170
Ling Rui.

740
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,560
Four million.

741
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,160
One-year marriage.

742
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,450
You are good at doing business, punk.

743
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,360
Lu Yiyao.

744
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,000
I can explain.

745
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,080
It's pointless!

746
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,720
What now?

747
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,600
Dare to do it but dare not admit it?

748
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,920
Let me tell you.

749
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,480
Even if the marriage

750
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,090
only lasts one year,

751
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,080
That's my wedding, Lu Fangning's wedding.

752
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,520
Did you hear that clearly?

753
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,840
Also,

754
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,200
what's going on with

755
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,280
Tang Ping's doctor ID.

756
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,360
You make Fangning sad

757
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,290
and sorry for you,

758
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,200
while you hook up with other women.

759
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,680
Lu Yiyao, there is a misunderstanding here.

760
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,120
Don't tell me these useless things.

761
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,050
I tell you,

762
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,210
I swore I won't let anyone

763
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,600
hurt Fangning.

764
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,560
Mrs. Lu, what are you doing?

765
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:45,760
I…

766
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,840
Hello?

767
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,800
The signal is poor here.

768
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,240
I'm listening.

769
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,210
You guys…

770
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,000
My voice recorder.

771
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,090
Lu Yiyao, you…

772
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,000
Fangning.

773
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,760
There's some problem at Aunt Yang's side.

774
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,890
Aunt Yang?

775
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,320
What trick does she want to pull this time?

776
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,690
She knows

777
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,680
the reason we got married.

778
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,160
Then she ran away.

779
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,320
Cai Siyu could not

780
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,200
find her at the venue.

781
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,760
How would she know?

782
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,290
Lu Yiyao.

783
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,400
Just now…

784
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,810
I understand.

785
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,840
Give a round of applause to Infinity,

786
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,000
Deer Sing Group's latest home furnishing brand.

787
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,600
Welcome to the official release today.

788
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,880
Dear guests, friends from the media,

789
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,000
you all must know Infinity

790
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,680
is a young brand

791
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,640
personally created by

792
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,190
the general manager of Deer Sing Group

793
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,520
Ms. Lu Fangning.

794
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,000
Thanks to Ms. Lu…

795
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,200
Who is she?

796
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,960
Mrs. Lu.

797
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
What does this mean?

798
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,600
Yeah.

799
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:07,960
Why is she up there?

800
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,440
What happened?

801
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Ms. Yang Yi, please…

802
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,760
Is this a part of the program?

803
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,760
I don't know.

804
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,200
This arrangement is weird.
