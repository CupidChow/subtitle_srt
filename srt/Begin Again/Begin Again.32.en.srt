00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,490
[Mr. Lu,]

177
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,530
I like you.

178
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,370
Can you be my boyfriend?

179
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,970
[They broke up.]

180
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,010
[She knew that]

181
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,970
[he had never loved her.]

182
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,420
[So, she scolded him for being a jerk.]

183
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,410
[In fact, he wasn't one.]

184
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,690
[In her heart,]

185
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,970
[he is a brave man.]

186
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,370
[Being able to hide his love,]

187
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,010
[for so long,]

188
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,010
[one needs more courage]

189
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,050
[than what it takes to embrace love.]

190
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,490
I told you I didn't mind.

191
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,210
I just don't care!

192
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,490
[She prays for one thing only.]

193
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,970
[She only prays that]

194
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,970
[the poor man]

195
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,170
[can smile more]

196
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,770
[and stop living this pitiful life.]

197
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,090
[So, she wants to leave him]

198
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:13,690
[without hesitation.]

199
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,450
[She wants to be freed of the urge]

200
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,970
[to embrace him once more.]

201
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,090
[Although he's]

202
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:04,810
[an obnoxious old man,]

203
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,130
[he's still handsome.]

204
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,370
[Lu Yiyao, you...]

205
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,090
I was asleep.

206
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,250
What about just now?

207
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,930
Just now...

208
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,730
I must have been sleepwalking.

209
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,130
Sleepwalking?

210
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,290
When you sleepwalk, you turn into a thug?

211
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,170
You're sick, okay? You need treatments.

212
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,170
Get up!

213
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,330
My waist!

214
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,330
Make it clear!

215
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,930
Explain!

216
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,250
Siyu,

217
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,010
will you give me another chance?

218
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,770
[What's going on now?]

219
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,410
[I was taking care of the sick CEO,]

220
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,010
[and now he's flirting with me.]

221
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,970
This time,

222
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,170
I don't care about anyone else.

223
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,410
I don't need any answers either.

224
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,530
I just want...

225
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,240
I just want to

226
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,410
stay with you.

227
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,370
[Illusions. These are all illusions!]

228
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,130
[I can't believe him.]

229
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,250
Ouch!

230
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,930
Did it hurt?

231
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,130
Are you awake now?

232
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,130
Listen,

233
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,570
I don't like you anymore.

234
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,610
You don't have to answer right away.

235
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,170
I just...

236
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,250
I just want you

237
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,650
to give me one more chance.

238
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,010
Let me try it again.

239
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,970
I don't want to try it.

240
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,290
Are you still mad at me

241
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,080
because of what happened that time?

242
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,210
Hear me out. Before…

243
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:46,930
Lu Yiyao,

244
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,330
don't be so full of yourself, okay?

245
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,610
I'm full of myself?

246
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:53,850
Fine.

247
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,170
Tell me,

248
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,570
of the novels you're writing now,

249
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,890
which male protagonist

250
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,530
isn't based on me?

251
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,530
You read my books?

252
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,850
No, no.

253
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,530
I'm asking you,

254
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,850
the male protagonist

255
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,930
in this novel

256
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,980
you're writing now,

257
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,440
isn't he just like me?

258
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,490
Male protagonists of romance novels

259
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,410
are all the same.

260
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,850
They are all like this?

261
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,410
Then I should read more of these.

262
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,370
Anyway,

263
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,690
I just saw a detail.

264
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,010
It sounded just like me.

265
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,130
Perhaps I should read it out to you?

266
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,370
Lu Yiyao, you...

267
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,650
Yes, I admit it.

268
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,530
When I think of you,

269
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,650
I feel particularly inspired.

270
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,820
I feel immersed in the story.

271
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,250
I wrote every novel

272
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,730
based on parts of your image.

273
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,930
So what?

274
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:41,640
I just

275
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,930
make use of you.

276
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,160
Make use of?

277
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,210
Use me if you want.

278
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,490
I won't make a fuss about it with you.

279
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,450
Use the real me as your material.

280
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,720
I don't need that.

281
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,480
Isn't it better to look at the real person and then imagine?

282
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,770
No.

283
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,130
A living man

284
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,200
is standing in front of you.

285
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,000
But you prefer an imaginary one.

286
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:13,609
Yes.

287
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,609
Is the imaginary man

288
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,810
better than a real man?

289
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,130
Why are you so wordy?

290
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,770
The imaginary man is certainly better.

291
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,089
The man in my imagination

292
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,200
won't lie to me,

293
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,960
won't toy with my feeling,

294
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,480
or make me upset.

295
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,609
He worries about me,

296
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,720
but I don't need to worry about him.

297
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,450
He will do everything

298
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,369
that I order him to do.

299
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,730
When I ask him to sleep, he will…

300
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,570
Anyway, he can do anything.

301
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,090
I can't understand it.

302
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,170
I don't need men like you

303
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,330
to understand it.

304
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,130
Listen carefully.

305
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,490
I live

306
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,650
a happy life alone.

307
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,170
Men are troublesome!

308
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,490
My waist!

309
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,170
Take it easy.

310
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,210
-Get out of the way.
-My waist!

Cai Siyu,

313
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,130
can you please keep your composure?

314
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,540
You can't be fooled by these tricks

315
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,370
he used six years ago.

316
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,450
No.

317
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,010
I need a distraction.

318
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,730
I need to…

319
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,570
I need to…

320
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,450
I need to work out in the gym

321
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,960
and get all sweaty.

322
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,410
Press down your center of gravity. Straighten your back.

323
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,610
Come on.

324
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,330
Old man,

325
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,090
this isn't the place for you.

326
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,450
Why?

327
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,040
I work out every day, okay?

328
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,890
It won't work.

329
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,850
I...

330
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,970
I'll watch some movies.

331
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,930
I'll date myself.

332
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,930
Cai Siyu,

333
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,010
you are so familiar with

334
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,810
these tricks.

335
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,490
Why can't you keep a level head?

336
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,210
It's no good.

337
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,570
I need to talk to someone.

338
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,250
Why are you here?

339
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,050
Youyou's not here.

340
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,810
Nobody will discuss novels with you.

341
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,770
Wait.

342
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,570
Ms. Lu,

343
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,890
my conception

344
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,170
is particularly complex this time.

345
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,690
I must discuss it with someone of your level,

346
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,370
someone who has your experience

347
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,450
in love.

00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,210
Your waist injury

350
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,490
is not that serious.

351
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,450
But you must rest well.

352
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,770
Remember to apply for the medicine.

353
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,170
Avoid vigorous exercises.

354
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,700
It will heal gradually.

355
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,970
You're not young. Take care.

356
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,890
Thank you, doctor.

357
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,770
That's all.

358
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,770
You may leave now.

359
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,490
Am I old?

360
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,410
My skin is quite good.

361
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,330
He said I was old. Really...

362
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,010
Simon,

363
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,290
what brought you here?

364
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:40,410
I...

365
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,050
I came to see a doctor.

366
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,010
Are you okay?

367
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,170
I'm fine. I had an X-ray.

368
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,970
I accidentally bumped into something recently.

369
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,890
I had some minor injury.

370
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,330
I'm glad you're alright.

371
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,010
Pay attention to your health.

372
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:53,810
If you need anything,

373
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,290
contact me anytime.

374
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,090
Okay.

375
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,290
I'm going to work now.

376
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,210
Wait.

377
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,010
Are you free after work?

378
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,890
Come on.

379
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,810
Ling Rui,

380
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,200
what do women

381
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,410
think nowadays?

382
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,260
Tell me, what's going on

383
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,450
in this man's mind?

384
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,810
Lu Yiyao used me.

385
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,530
Now he's turning over a new leaf

386
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,290
to win my back.

387
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,850
I won't let myself be fooled!

388
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,250
I will not forgive him!

389
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,690
A jerk should always be nailed to

390
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,890
the pillar of shame!

391
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,650
The past is the past.

392
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,970
The present is now.

393
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,730
I've already apologized to her.

394
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,650
I've admitted my mistakes

395
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,730
so sincerely.

396
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,690
Why can't she let go

397
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,610
of the past?

398
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,730
She's unpredictable.

399
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,490
It's getting on my nerve.

400
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,130
He even kissed me!

401
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:54,930
Did he really think

402
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,250
he was an overbearing boss?

403
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,330
He was disrespectful.

404
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,690
It was sexual harassment.

405
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,810
I must call the police.

406
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,770
It's obvious that she likes me.

407
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,250
But she doesn't admit it.

408
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,530
She lives

409
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,730
in her imagination every day.

410
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,450
She is unwilling to face the reality.

411
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,690
What's going on

412
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:10,930
in her mind right now?

413
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,130
What is he thinking right now?

414
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,490
Actually...

415
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,330
Actually, I don't know either.

416
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,530
It's okay, Ms. Lu.

417
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,610
This issue is indeed complicated.

418
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,130
It's normal if you don't know. Come on.

419
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,570
But, Cai Siyu,

420
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,890
let me ask you a question.

421
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,450
In terms of the forced kiss,

422
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,930
are you sure you didn't get the wrong meaning?

423
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,210
It depends on the look of that person.

424
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,970
Well, that guy

425
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,410
is quite handsome.

426
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,130
Did Dr. Ling do the same thing to you?

427
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,530
You and Dr. Ling, are you back together?

428
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,730
You reconciled with him?

429
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,890
Yes, we are back together now.

430
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,570
But is this a happy ending?

431
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,170
What happened to you guys?

432
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,890
Your problem seems more complicated than mine.

433
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,490
Here's the thing.

434
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,530
He's very gentle sometimes.

435
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,050
He's very thoughtful.

436
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,930
But sometimes,

437
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,890
he's very distant and bossy.

438
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,610
In short, he's not quite the same

439
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,370
as he used to be.

440
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,010
When he was with me,

441
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,170
he said we were meant for each other.

442
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:37,970
What does that mean?

443
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,770
Meant for each other?

444
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,500
Does he mean

445
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,770
we are meant for each other

446
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,690
because I gave birth to his son?

447
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,050
Or did he just say it casually?

448
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,130
Does Ling Rui want to

449
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,930
take revenge on me, or punish me?

450
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,290
If Dr. Ling did hate you,

451
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,290
it would be understandable.

452
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,650
After all, you were cruel enough

453
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,890
not to tell him anything six years ago.

454
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,050
Yes, I got it.

455
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,450
A jerk should always be nailed to

456
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,410
the pillar of shame.

457
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,170
A jerk like me must suffer the same fate.

458
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,020
But what could I do?

459
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,090
At that time,

460
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,450
I was young, impulsive, and carefree.

461
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,610
Besides,

462
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,690
he didn't tell me

463
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,490
he wouldn't leave for Germany.

464
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,490
Are you saying Dr. Ling refused

465
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,370
to go to Germany

466
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,890
six years ago because of you?

467
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,450
At that time,

468
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,490
I was informed of his decision.

469
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,570
Going to Germany for further study

470
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,610
was very important

471
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,730
for him.

472
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,170
It was his dream.

473
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,210
After I found out,

474
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,170
it bothered me

475
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,730
so greatly.

476
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,580
Poor thing.

477
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,770
It's okay.

478
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,890
Even Dr. Ling was a jerk.

479
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,450
So, in that case,

480
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,930
the husbands on my computer

481
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,250
never give me any worries.

482
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,210
Even if there were some tricks,

483
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,170
I'd be the mastermind.

484
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,130
And they are also…

485
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,730
Where is my laptop?

486
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,170
Where is my laptop?

487
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,290
Lu Yiyao.

488
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,650
Actually, I don't know either.

489
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,010
You don't know?

490
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,970
Come on.

491
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,690
How are you guys doing now?

492
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,290
We're back together.

493
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,050
Back together?

494
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,370
You just let her off so easily.

495
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,960
I had thought about

496
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,610
taking a stance.

497
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,650
I wanted her to realize she was wrong.

498
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,650
But on second thought,

499
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,730
it didn't matter.

500
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,040
Anyway, she has her way

501
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,450
of keeping me soft.

502
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,290
So, I admitted my defeat.

503
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,810
Can you please

504
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,930
not make me laugh again?

505
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,250
It's not about winning the argument.

506
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,130
I want to admit my defeat too.

507
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,010
But no one

508
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,250
gives me a chance.

509
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,610
It's okay.

510
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,410
You two have a happy ending.

511
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,170
That's good.

512
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,370
But am I

513
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,640
doing the right thing?

514
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,570
What did you do wrong?

515
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,050
I didn't even give her

516
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,290
a chance to say no.

517
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,290
I haven't told her

518
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,490
I was still in love with her.

519
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,410
I was afraid

520
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:47,940
she would

521
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,170
reject me.

522
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,490
So I made her stay

523
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,770
by any means necessary.

524
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,820
I was scared she might

525
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,130
secretly disappear from my life again.

526
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,810
However,

527
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,010
every time when I see her

528
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,530
act with cautions while I'm around,

529
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,210
I can't help but be angry again.

530
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:11,970
I'm angry at her,

531
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,810
and at myself.

532
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,650
So,

533
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,170
you asked the wrong person.

534
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,490
Come on, let's go.

535
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,650
Where are we going?

536
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,730
We haven't finished the beer yet.

537
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,570
Not yet.

538
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,250
You've had enough.

539
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,490
You can't drink anymore.

540
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,170
We can still order.

541
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,840
Boss, more beer.

542
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,170
Don't listen to him.

543
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,410
Stop drinking. You can't drink anymore.

544
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,170
You're drunk. Let's go home.

545
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,690
I can have more!

546
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,290
I'm telling you,

547
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,130
I sleep with others whenever I get drunk.

548
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,810
I need to overcome this bad habit.

549
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,210
I said,

550
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,450
I didn't want to go to bed.

551
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,490
You can't sleep here.

552
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,690
Let's go. Go home.

553
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,610
Have you paid for the bill?

554
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,010
Yes, I have.

555
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,370
Won't you consider getting it back

556
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,010
once Simon is home?

557
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,690
I've told you everything

558
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,390
[1806]

559
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,450
that had happened between us.

560
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,490
I really don't want to

561
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,580
meet him again.

562
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,730
I'll leave once I've got it.

563
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,090
It won't take long.

564
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,490
My baby.

565
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,810
All right, be quick.

566
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,290
Okay. That's all.

567
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,250
Let's go, Ms. Lu.

568
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,970
Are you okay?

569
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,530
-Fangning.
-Ling Rui.

570
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,770
-You...
-You...

571
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,010
Why are you at my house?

572
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,570
Why can't I be here?

573
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,420
I came to get my computer,

574
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,730
my moneymaker,

575
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,410
my treasure.

576
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,970
Here is the person you love.

577
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,010
Not there.

578
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,330
Hands off.

579
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,490
Do you deserve this title?

580
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,850
Of course you don't.

581
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,410
Jerk.

582
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,490
Jerk?

583
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,010
Why do you keep dwelling on the past?

584
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,930
I'm not as petty and narrow-minded

585
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,970
as you are.

586
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,610
You would starve if you lived in your fantasy.

587
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,410
Sure.

588
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,330
I can survive.

589
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,170
Women are unreasonable.

590
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,850
It's because

591
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,610
no man is good in real life.

592
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,610
Say it again.

593
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,570
I'll say it again if you want to hear it.

594
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,570
Every man

595
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,010
is a jerk!

596
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,170
You just

597
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,010
scolded Ling Rui too.

598
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,290
Wonderful!

599
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,130
Did I scold you?

600
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,730
Even if I did, so what?

601
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,970
I'm not wrong.

602
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,170
He is always so unpredictable.

603
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,090
Our Ms. Lu,

604
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,170
a cool and brave woman,

605
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,330
is living under his torment!

606
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,010
I'm not. I'm fine.

607
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,930
Stop using Ling Rui

608
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,250
as an excuse.

609
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,090
What about her?

610
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,650
She left without a word six years ago.

611
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,650
She even kept the son

612
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,210
she had given birth to a secret.

613
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,650
What's wrong with him being upset?

614
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,930
I'm fine too.

615
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,250
What's so great about Dr. Ling?

616
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,850
He didn't say anything and

617
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,450
refused to go to

618
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,930
Germany?

619
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,210
He took action before informing.

620
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:49,970
What's the difference between that

621
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:50,850
and what Ms. Lu has done?

622
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:51,690
Didn't he know

623
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,050
it would be a huge burden in her heart

624
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,730
once she knew about it?

625
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,130
Ling Rui had stayed with Fangning

626
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,450
when she had a hard time.

627
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,530
What he did was for her good.

628
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,170
That was your wishful thinking.

629
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,410
No one asked him to do so.

630
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,930
Ms. Lu donated so much money

631
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,130
to that institute.

632
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,320
Because she didn't want Dr. Ling

633
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,530
to sacrifice everything for her.

634
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,770
She did it for his good!

635
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,810
Women are just as terrible

636
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,650
with their wishful thinking.

637
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,040
Okay, let's not talk about the past.

638
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,090
Let's talk about the present.

639
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,330
We talk about it every day.

640
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,250
It's always the same thing.

641
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,290
It's always an apology.

642
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,770
What's the point of apologizing?

643
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,050
Why didn't she ask

644
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:20,850
Ling Rui whether

645
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,170
he still felt the same for her?

646
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,530
She was jealous,

647
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,250
then she pushed him away.

648
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,340
She is paranoid and hesitant.

649
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,970
Ling Rui was worried

650
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,570
she would leave, then he feared

651
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,320
she would be

652
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,450
reluctant to stay.

653
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,370
Why couldn't she

654
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,450
make things more subtle?

655
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,010
I...

656
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,690
As expected, only men understand men.

657
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,370
You don't understand women's

658
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,130
sensitive and fragile hearts at all.

659
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,650
Our Ms. Lu did this

660
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,330
because she didn't want Dr. Ling

661
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,570
to stay with her unwillingly

662
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,410
for the sake of the kid

663
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,890
and affect his life! Fool!

664
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,170
Fine. Fine.

665
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,050
I'll argue about

666
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,850
these trivial matters.

667
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,730
If you said so,

668
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,490
why not just make it clear?

669
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,610
Ling Rui just wants to hear one thing.

670
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,130
Why doesn't he say it first?

671
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,450
Ms. Lu also wants to hear

672
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,880
those three words?

673
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,410
Enough.

674
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:06,810
That's enough.

675
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,890
[Is Ms. Lu going to end my life?]

676
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,130
Cai Siyu.

677
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:17,050
If you have something to say, say it to my face.

678
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,450
I told her to say

679
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,490
what she said earlier.

680
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,810
We've made everything clear just now.

681
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,970
You two should have a good chat.

682
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,490
Sim...

683
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,490
Simon.

684
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,210
Would you like some coffee?

685
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,570
Would you like some water?

686
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,770
-I don't want any.
-I'm not thirsty either.

687
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,450
-Sit down.
-We should sit down first.

688
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,700
Take a seat.

689
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,450
-This isn't our home.
-This isn't our home.

690
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,010
Slow down. Slow down.

691
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,530
You almost gave me a heart attack.

692
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,130
It was horrible.

693
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,330
Well,

694
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,930
thank you.

695
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,570
You're welcome.

696
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,560
I was glad to help.

697
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:58,850
Just now I...

698
00:33:58,850 --> 00:33:59,730
Well,

699
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,130
these are different matters.

700
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,220
I know.

701
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,370
Okay, then I'll send you home.

702
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,970
[What should I do?] [Should I let him send me home?]

703
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,080
[Will I fall into his trap again?]

704
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,449
I planned it all.

705
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:19,409
Don't blame her.

706
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,210
It's okay.

707
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,080
Go upstairs.

708
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,889
Where to?

709
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,770
Simon,

710
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,560
this is your home.

711
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,770
My home.

712
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,080
Okay, then I'll send her home first.

713
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,120
Never mind.

714
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,570
I'll go back by myself.

715
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,929
You are drunk, so you can't drive.

716
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:43,120
Well, let's go home and rest well.

717
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,770
Good night, bye.

718
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,010
Good night.

719
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,050
Well,

720
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,850
we should

721
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,210
go home.

722
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,850
It seems like

723
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,130
there's something

724
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:13,850
we haven't finished.

725
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,770
We should pick Youyou up!

726
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,930
Yeah. We should pick him up. Let's go!

727
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,130
[We talk about it every day.]

728
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,450
[It's always the same thing.]

729
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,450
[It's always an apology.]

730
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,970
[What's the point of apologizing?]

731
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,930
Why didn't she ask

732
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,570
Ling Rui whether

733
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,250
he still felt the same

734
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,530
for her?

735
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,010
She was jealous,

736
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,770
then she pushed him away.

737
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,770
She is paranoid and hesitant.

738
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:48,970
[Why couldn't she]

739
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,370
[make things more subtle?]

740
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,250
Did I cause the misunderstanding?

741
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,980
It's impossible.

742
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,290
It's rare for me to

743
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,570
be so considerate and willing

744
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,090
to sacrifice my own interests.

745
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:01,850
Mom,

746
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:02,930
when you're done,

747
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,450
can you help me to brush mine?

748
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,250
Thank you.

749
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,170
Mom,

750
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,450
your teeth.

751
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,130
[Since we said so,]

752
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,850
[let's make it clear.]

753
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,010
[Ling Rui just wants to hear one thing.]

754
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,810
What does he want to hear from me?

755
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,330
They should have made it clear.

756
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,770
They almost got to the point,

757
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,370
why did I tell them to shut up?

758
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,330
Unbelievable.

759
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,690
[Fangning hasn't made her stance.]

760
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,570
[So this is what she was concerned about.]

761
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,770
[Now that I think about it,]

762
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,570
[what I did was a little inconsiderate.]

763
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,770
[I was wrong six years ago.]

764
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,410
[I'm still wrong even now.]

765
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,810
Dad,

766
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,850
help me brush my teeth.

767
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:08,970
Dad,

768
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,530
are you also ignoring me?

769
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,690
[I'm a man.]

770
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,810
[In any case,]

771
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,290
[I need to apologize first.]

772
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,410
I'm sorry.

773
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,330
It's okay, Dad.

774
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,410
I won't blame you.

775
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,090
It seems like

776
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,410
I need to find a good time.

777
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,170
I'm...

778
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,450
I'm making the bed. I'm done.

779
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,850
One for each of us.

780
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:05,650
Yeah.

781
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,330
Well.

782
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,090
Fangning.

783
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:12,930
Actually,

784
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,090
just one.

785
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,560
What?

786
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,330
One...one blanket is enough.

787
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,210
What do you mean?

788
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,050
One blanket is enough.

789
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,450
What? What do you mean

790
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,290
one blanket is enough?

791
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,090
Why?

792
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,130
Why for what?

793
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,860
Why is one blanket enough?

794
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,090
Because...

795
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,770
It's cold.

796
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,930
-It's not cold. It's warm.
-It's not cold.

797
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,400
I think

798
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,010
it's getting a little warm.

799
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,330
Well,

800
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,410
then I...

801
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,490
I will take this blanket away.

802
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,570
Okay.

803
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,130
Let's go to bed.

804
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:05,770
Okay.

805
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,090
It's weird.

806
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,770
Mom and dad aren't acting normally.

807
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,530
One brushed her teeth repeatedly.

808
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,330
One cleaned the house repeatedly.

809
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,530
Life is tough for me.

810
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,530
[Is this the right time?]

811
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,570
[What is it]

812
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:40,930
[that he wants to hear?]

813
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,210
Ling Rui,

814
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,050
you're still awake?

815
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,370
How about you?

816
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,650
Are you tired after the long day?

817
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,850
I am...

818
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,290
Youyou.

819
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,370
Youyou.

820
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,130
Mom, Dad,

821
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,570
you've been bonding for several days.

822
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:11,930
I also want to join you

823
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,130
for the bonding.

824
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:15,570
-Okay.
-Come on.

825
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:15,970
Come.

826
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,450
Come.

827
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,050
Come.

828
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,970
Come on.

829
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,410
Okay, now sleep tight.

830
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,530
Okay, let's sleep.

831
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,890
Come on.

832
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:36,770
Breakfast is ready.

833
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:40,530
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

834
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,400
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

835
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,610
-Good morning, mom and dad.
-Good morning.

836
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,240
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

837
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,980
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

838
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,460
What a great breakfast today!

839
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,570
Try it out.

840
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,530
I like it very much.

841
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,370
Youyou,

842
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,730
after breakfast,

843
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,050
we'll clean the dishes

844
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,130
and go to

845
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,570
Grandma's house, okay?

846
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,530
Okay.

847
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,290
Fangning,

848
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,130
how about

849
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,010
having lunch together later?

850
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,850
I need to have a word with you.

851
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,930
I also have something to tell you.

852
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:20,770
Hello?

853
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,610
Okay, okay, I'll be there at once.

854
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,410
Youyou,

855
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,050
have an onion ring.

856
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,090
What's wrong?

857
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,810
Mr. Cao called me.

858
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,410
He wanted to see me and it sounded urgent.

859
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:38,970
Maybe it's

860
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,090
about moving in.

861
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,410
Things should be fine.

862
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,370
I'll get prepared.

863
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,850
By the way,

864
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,370
I ran into Gao Erfan

865
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,570
in the park yesterday.

866
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,450
I think he knows

867
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,810
you've returned to open a store.

868

I'll be careful.

869
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,850
I must get going.

870
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,890
Finish your breakfast.

871
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,760

When we're free later,

874
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,170
I'll run this

875
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,130
by you again.

876
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,010
Okay.

Hello, Miss Pingping?

Hello?

881
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:16,970
Let's meet up.

882
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,490
I want you to meet someone.

883
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,450
A man.

884
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,530
He is important

885
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,400
to both you

886
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,770

00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,370
A man?

888
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,170
An important person that I must meet?

889
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,250
Miss Pingping,

890
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,610
are you in love?

891
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,770
As your big fan,

892
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,770
for the sake of your acting career,

893
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,290
I will definitely make the final check.

894
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,490
No problem.

895
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,850
She is introducing her boyfriend

896
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,010
to her boyfriend?

897
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,610
Then why does she think of me?

898
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,210
Hello.

899
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,890
Go ask Lu Fangning instead.

900
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,490
Do you want to

901
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,530
tell Lu Fangning about us?

902
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,090
I've badmouthed her

903
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:53,850
the other day.

904
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,170
Is she going to

905
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,130
rat me out?

906
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,170
Okay.

907
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,050
I'll be there.

908
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,050
Great.

909
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,090
A boyfriend check.

910
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,250
A boyfriend check.

911
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,090
My two boyfriends.
