[Episode 04]

4
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,940
Well done.

5
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,650
Don't be lazy. Come practice.

6
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,660
Yu, if it weren't for you,

7
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,380
I think

8
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,660
I wouldn't have learned

9
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,460
all of these.

10
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,060
Besides, at the most critical moment,

11
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,020
you lend me four million.

12
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,180
I'll make sure I learn it well.

13
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,020
If it weren't for you,

14
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,500
who uses

15
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,700
your multiple fail attempts

16
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,710
to motivate me,

17
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,060
a black swan with broken wings like me

18
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,070
would've given up

19
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,700
my dream way too soon.

20
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,180
It's just four million. It's worth it.

21
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,500
Our families

22
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,540
will meet soon.

23
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,740
-What if...
-Wait a minute.

24
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:36,980
We're meeting?

25
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,900
If my dad finds out

26
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,660
that we know each other here

27
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,060
he'll definitely break my legs.

28
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,340
For now, we shouldn't

29
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,180
scare ourselves.

30
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,380
When we meet,

31
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,220
we don't know each other.

32
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,140
I am that

33
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,820
pretty divorcee.

34
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,740
Then...

35
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,340
Then, I don't know you either.

36
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,700
I am

37
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,490
the black swan with a pair of broken wings.

38
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,300
This is good.

39
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,660
Continue. Your leg.

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,020
The tip of your foot.

41
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,660
Your knee.

42
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,450
Move your shoulder blade down.

43
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,930
Today,

44
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,370
we invite the Ling family

45
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,020
over.

46
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,730
I know that

47
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,140
this is not really appropriate

48
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,290
according to the Chinese custom.

49
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,700
Marriage is

50
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,300
not child's play.

51
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,180
But, this young couple

52
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,540
is busy with their career.

53
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,290
I think we shouldn't delay a happy event.

54
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,220
Therefore,

55
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,980
there's anything I missed out,

56
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,220
I hope Mrs. Ling can forgive me.

57
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,120
Although

58
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,540
this seems a little hasty,

59
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,020
but I think

60
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,300
if they

61
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,460
are happy

62
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,019
together,

63
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,700
we, as the parents,

64
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,200
should have nothing to worry about.

65
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,380
Mrs. Ling, I'm relieved

66
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,560
to hear what you said.

67
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,780
Before this,

68
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,130
Fangning

69
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,170
has briefly

70
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,220
told me about Ling's background.

71
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,060
Today,

72
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,810
given this opportunity
for us to gather around,

73
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,730
I hope that

74
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,659
Ling can personally

75
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,340
and formally

76
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,409
introduce yourself

77
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,780
to Aunt Yang and me.

78
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,580
-Uncle Lu, I...
-Dad.

79
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,180
I don't think this is necessary.

80
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,540
Before this,

81
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,700
I've briefed you a couple of times.

82
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,290
His age, occupation, origin,

83
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,330
and his family.

84
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,210
They are all here.

85
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,650
What else do you want to know?

86
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,800
Uncle Lu.

87
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,850
I did medicine

88
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,930
for my undergraduate.

89
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,370
Now, I'm working at the city hospital.

90
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,780
I'm a general surgeon.

91
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,660
Maybe you don't know much about me,

92
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,610
and

93
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,980
it's inevitable for you to worry.

94
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:06,890
But,

95
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,140
I promise you and aunt.

96
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,740
You don't have to worry.

97
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,060
I'll do my best

98
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,380
to secure our marriage,

99
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,820
and treat her well.

100
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,980
Great, great.

101
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,530
Good.

102
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,090
Ling Rui

103
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,220
is currently the deputy chief.

104
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,700
Throughout all these years,

105
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,490
he's been actively working,

106
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,970
trying to pursue his studies in Germany.

107
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,900
After

108
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,880
he comes back from Germany,

109
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,700
I think

110
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,340
he'll be an incredible man.

111
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:37,860
Well.

112
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,440
If any of you

113
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,570
feels uncomfortable in the future,

114
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,340
you can go to the hospital to find Ling Rui.

115
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,820
Yes, Aunt Yang.

116
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,120
Don't you have a bad hearing?

117
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,780
I can ask Ling Rui to help you.

118
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,300
It should be quite convenient for us

119
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,740
if Ling Rui and I have children in the future.

120
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,140
Deputy chief.

121
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,330
How much is your monthly salary?

122
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,340
Adding up my monthly pay and bonus

123
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,420
every month I can get

124
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
about fifteen thousand.

125
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,530
That's too little.

126
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,030
Our Aunt Gao

127
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,420
is paid approximately the same.

128
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,300
That's different.

129
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,140
Their talent is different.

130
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,590
That's right.

131
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,370
Ling Rui is also a volunteer.

132
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,290
He's very caring.

133
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,660
He contributes a lot to society too.

134
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,670
This...

135
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,200
Mom.

136
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,330
Aunt Gao made this.

137
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,300
Your favorite dish.

138
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,850
Eat more. The dishes are turning cold.

139
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,340
Right.

140
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,460
Fangyu is right.

141
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,810
You focus on chatting.

142
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,090
The dishes have turned cold.

143
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:29,880
Come.

144
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,170
I propose a toast

145
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,740
to welcome the Ling family

146
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,370
as our guest.

147
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,409
-Welcome.
-Cheers.

148
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,180
Welcome.

149
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,020
Cheers.

150
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,020
It was a hasty invitation.

151
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,020
I apologize for the poor hospitality.

152
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,300
Next time,

153
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,409
maybe we can meet at a good restaurant.

154
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,490
-Yes.
-Then,

155
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,460
we can sit down

156
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,380
to discuss

157
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,260
our children's wedding date.

158
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,340
Sure.

159
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,050
You're too nice.

160
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,490
We have a big family.

161
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,210
That's not an issue.

162
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,740
There are many rooms at our place.

163
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,020
-You can stay whenever you want.
-Lu Fangning.

164
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,450
Why you?

165
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,540
Should it be you, then?

166
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,780
Dr. Ling,

167
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,810
why are you marrying Lu Fangning

168
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,740
all of a sudden?

169
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,450
Are you indebted to her?

170
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,730
You must be indebted to her.

171
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,000
Lu Fangning,

172
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,140
you're too mean.

173
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,060
Because of money,

174
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,930
you forced Dr. Ling...

175
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,860
You saw it.

176
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,930
We are in love with each other.

177
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,340
Lu Fangning.

178
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,970
What are you doing?

179
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,659
Touching up my makeup.

180
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,250
-What are you doing?
-Don't move.

181
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,090
I will

182
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,970
clean it up for you.

183
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,340
Dr. Ling.

184
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,250
Professor Ling.

185
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:07,980
Not bad.

186
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,810
No wonder you're a smart student.

187
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,290
It felt great.

188
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,140
You did well too.

189
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,810
It's as if we have gone from elementary school

190
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,170
straight to the university.

191
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,020
Why don't we

192
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,140
pursue our studies?

193
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,170
What... what do you mean?

194
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,090
I mean

195
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,690
I'm very pleased

196
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,170
with our progress.

197
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Drive safe.

198
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,010
Firstly,

199
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,890
based on the principle of equality
and mutual benefit,

200
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,260
both parties have agreed

201
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,450
to marry on our own will.

202
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,010
Of course, during our marriage,

203
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,460
we cannot interfere with each other's freedom.

204
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,090
If there's any conflict that can't be solved,

205
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,820
we can divorce.

206
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,730
Secondly, if necessary,

207
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,500
you must fulfill

208
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,610
all obligations of a husband.

209
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,690
Because

210
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,420
I have a unique identity.

211
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,810
Sometimes,

212
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,980
you have to

213
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,890
be Lu Fangning's husband.

214
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,690
Just like today.

215
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,460
When

216
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,370
we almost got caught,

217
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,250
you'll have to

218
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,180
do some intimate acts.

219
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,780
Of course.

220
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,420
If you think

221
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,060
this is not fair to you,

222
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,210
we can add another clause.

223
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,620
I will also act as your wife

224
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,570
and accommodate to you

225
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,570
whenever it's necessary.

226
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,580
The third clause

227
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,820
is set

228
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,820
based on my personal kindness.

229
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,610
I'll protect

230
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,410
your privacy.

231
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,060
I'll not publish

232
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,970
your personal information

233
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,210
and your photos

234
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,140
on any social media.

235
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,090
Of course, if one day,

236
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,130
we have to announce

237
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,210
our relationship,

238
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,450
I will also

239
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,490
censor your photos

240
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,330
before I publish it.

241
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,740
The following clause

242
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,820
is not that important.

243
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,130
You only have to listen to it.

244
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,260
This is mainly about

245
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,050
the distribution of assets
after we get married.

246
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,300
If one day,

247
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,410
we both achieve our goals

248
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,220
in this marriage,

249
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,170
Party B needs to give up unconditionally.

250
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,140
That means

251
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,090
what is yours remains yours.

252
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,930
What's mine remains mine.

253
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,540
Some things may appear to be shared,

254
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,730
but are actually mine.

255
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,300
What do you mean by appearing to be shared?

256
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,020
Legal documents

257
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,290
contain

258
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,940
a lot of confusing expressions.

259
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,020
It's not important.

260
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,210
The rest are

261
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,210
just some formalities.

262
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,460
Sign it.

263
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,690
The contract is so ambiguous.

264
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,700
It's meaningless.

265
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,660
Cross it out.

266
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,480
And

267
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,730
I'll add one more clause.

268
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:34,610
All the rights and duties

269
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,220
stated in the contract

270
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,530
have to be done

271
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,780
without violating the law.

272
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,770
I, Lu Fangning, am the general manager

273
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,610
of Deer Sing Group.

274
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,460
Why would I do anything illegal with you?

275
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,890
I'll add this anyway.

276
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,530
I'll update you.

277
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,660
The patient

278
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,340
at Bed 52

279
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,820
has a special condition.

280
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,100
Remember to

281
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,340
-pay more attention.
-Okay.

282
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,490
Take his temperature regularly.

283
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,420
Understood.

284
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,170
Observe him closely.

285
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,420
Uncle Lu.

286
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,690
-Are you here for me?
-Yes.

287
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,540
Dr. Ling,

288
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,340
I'll go back to the office.

289
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,500
Sure.

290
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,140
Uncle Lu.

291
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,940
Is there anything

292
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,210
I can help you?

293
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,380
Nothing much.

294
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,730
I'm just here to see your working environment.

295
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,300
Am I disturbing you?

296
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,300
Of course, not.

297
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,450
You are worried

298
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,130
about Fangning and me, right?

299
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,570
Fangning

300
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,580
is actually

301
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,530
not born talented.

302
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,180
What she has today

303
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,330
is a result

304
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,660
of her foolhardy handwork.

305
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,290
She is

306
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,580
quite pretty.

307
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,140
But, there's something about her
that doesn't feel like a woman.

308
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,980
There are no rules

309
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,740
about how a woman should be like

310
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,090
and how a man should be like.

311
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,100
So, how is Fangning like?

312
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,370
She is whom I admire.

313
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,050
Sometimes,

314
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,340
she might be a little

315
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,380
willful,

316
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,180
capricious,

317
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,420
and unreasonable.

318
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,980
Sometimes,

319
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,860
she acts of her own will.

320
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,050
But, if everyone on earth

321
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,460
can understand her well,

322
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,740
then

323
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,370
your daughter would be too ordinary.

324
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,140
Ling Rui.

325
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,460
Now I know

326
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,370
why she likes you.

327
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,820
About the marriage,

328
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,100
have you thought it through?

329
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,100
Uncle Lu,

330
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,220
about our marriage,

331
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,580
I dare not promise too much.

332
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,690
But, at this moment,

333
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,340
I want to marry Fangning,

334
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,890
and I'm willing

335
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,300
to keep all the promises I make
in the marriage.

336
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,340
Ling Rui, tell me.

337
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,220
Is she blackmailing you

338
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,260
with something?

339
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,940
Is that why you have to marry her?

340
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,130
You can be honest with me.

341
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,460
I'll help you.

342
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,450
What about this?

343
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,820
Later,

344
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,500
I'll give you some of the company shares

345
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,220
for you to protect yourself.

346
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,690
♫ Your arrival in my world ♫

347
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,300
♫ Makes me believe in destiny ♫

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,370
♫ I'm moved beyond my expectation ♫

349
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,710
[Certificate Holder: Ling Rui, Lu Fangning]

350
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,370
♫ I can't move my gaze from you ♫

351
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,250
It's so troublesome to get married.

352
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
In fact,

00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,250
Someone like her?

528
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,540
All work, no life.

529
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,330
But, all she wants is

530
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,700
to produce household items for others.

531
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,180
You're different.

532
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,060
You're a warm and cheerful guy.

533
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,460
The two of you

534
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,020
seem completely different.

535
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,900
Maybe we are different.

536
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,260
But,

537
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,860
doesn't everyone

538
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,180
have the right

539
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,460
to choose the lifestyle they want?

540
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,340
I respect her, and I understand her.

541
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,180
Also,

542
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,170
we are getting married soon.

543
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,770
Getting married?

544
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,410
Congratulations.

545
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,060
I think

546
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,370
I should prepare

547
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,450
a wedding gift for you.

548
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,660
I didn't expect him

549
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,780
to be your fiance.

550
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,340
But, he was right.

551
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,420
I should not have

552
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,010
judged a book by its cover.

553
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,860
I wish you

554
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,010
a happy marriage.

555
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,330
Thank you.

556
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,610
I don't care if your marriage

557
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,940
is real or fake.

558
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,740
But, from now on,

559
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,740
Lu Fangning

560
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,170
is no longer alone.

561
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,650
I guess.

562
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,260
Anyway,

563
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,460
thanks for your vote.

564
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,130
Congratulations, Ms. Lu.

565
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:57,770
It has finally

566
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,180
passed the board meeting.

567
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,490
Bring Gavin to China immediately

568
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,540
to finalize the designs.

569
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,060
Besides,

570
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,220
implement the contract

571
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,980
we signed with the suppliers

572
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,100
and set up a production line immediately.

573
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,580
The materials are special.

574
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,890
There aren't many factories in China

575
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,780
that can produce this.

576
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,660
-Gao Erfan, you...
-Ms. Lu.

577
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,780
I'm afraid that

578
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,300
you have something else

579
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,610
more urgent than any of this

580
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,940
to deal with.

581
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,460
The wedding

582
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,580
on the upcoming weekend.

583
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,380
A wedding?

584
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,450
Who's tricking me into spending money again?

585
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:24,960
Yours.

586
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,680
Mine?

587
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,100
Yours.

588
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,610
Mine?

589
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,530
-Yours.
-What?

590
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,220
Right after the meeting just now,

591
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:29,940
all of the directors

592
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,930
received invitation cards

593
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,460
of you and Mr. Ling's wedding

594
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,540
from Chairman Lu.

595
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,530
The invitation cards are ready.

596
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,900
It's on this coming weekend.

597
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,340
Who wants a wedding?

598
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,220
I'm going to talk to him.

599
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,370
Wait a minute, Ms. Lu.

600
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,700
Think about it.

601
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,890
At this point in time,

602
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,020
it's better

603
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,740
if we do what Chairman Lu wants.

604
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,100
After all, your success didn't come easily.

605
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,700
Moreover,

606
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,620
getting married is a happy event.

607
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,330
Of course, we should celebrate it.

608
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,900
Share your joy

609
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,010
with others.

610
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,820
Celebrate it?

611
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,740
Share my joy?

612
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,850
You're right.

613
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,530
This is a matter that requires

614
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,020
so much time and energy.

615
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,980
Since I'm doing it,

616
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,250
I need to gain something from it.

617
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:11,860
Coincidentally,

618
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,940
we have just established Infinity,

619
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,540
and have solved the internal conflicts.

620
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,620
It's time

621
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,660
to invite our peers

622
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,900
to show their support.

623
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,340
The wedding is on.

624
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,860
We'll invite all our business partners

625
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,810
to my wedding.

626
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,810
This is wedding

627
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,130
will become

628
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,420
Infinity's marketing conference.

629
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,020
This...

630
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,370
Of course, it's up to Ms. Lu.

631
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:30,940
For the invitation card,

632
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,340
we'll use our marketing brochure.

633
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,460
During the wedding,
each guest will receive one.

634
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,900
After we decide on the wedding's itinerary,

635
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,420
nothing else matters.

636
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,530
But,

637
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,610
make sure to slot in

638
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,420
an introduction to our marketing slogan.

639
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,730
Infinity,

640
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,060
finite time,

641
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,900
infinite love.

642
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,900
Put it on the first page
of the invitation card.

643
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,370
Ms. Lu is so smart.

649
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,260
This is the legendary wedding
of the rich and famous.

650
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,140
My rental, my meal allowance,

651
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,730
my boyfriend,

652
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,500
and the headlines

653
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,370
of the month

654
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,340
will all depend on this event.

655
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,330
I want to get a south-facing room.

656
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,210
It will cost me 300 yuan more every month.

657
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,740
I'm not picky with my food.

658
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,530
Take-outs will do.

659
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,700
Uni Gunkan,

660
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,340
Durian Pizza, Ikura Don.

661
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,300
Also, I hope that

662
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,860
I can meet

663
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,780
a mature, mysterious,
and domineering boyfriend.

664
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,980
Am I asking for too much?

665
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,690
Bless me! Just let me meet

666
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,650
this month's target.

667
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,300
Please give me a piece of big news,

668
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,050
Lu Fangning.

669
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,130
The daughter and the general manager

670
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,340
of LM Deer Sing Group, Lu Fangning,

671
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,580
is holding a grand wedding

672
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,980
at the Pavillion Hotel.

673
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,700
This is the greatest wedding

674
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,500
of the year.

675
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,690
Lu Fangning, the bride,

676
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,420
is wearing

677
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,610
a simple pair of custom-made bridal trousers.

678
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,890
Paired with the wedding veil,

679
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,170
the outfit is simple yet lavish.

680
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,580
The groom is wearing a bow tie

681
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,890
on top of his black suit

682
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,860
which is decorated with an L logo.

683
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,540
The two walked side by side
as they entered the banquet hall.

684
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,650
Apart from

685
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:16,690
all the exaggerated compliments

686
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,570
for me,

687
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,050
this bulletin

688
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:19,980
mentions nothing

689
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,930
about the specialties

690
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,970
of Infinity,

691
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,900
leave alone

692
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,580
Infinity's launch date.

693
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,060
Did I make a mistake when I assigned the jobs,

694
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,610
or you're just incapable?

695
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,490
Ms. Lu,

696
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,170
it's your wedding after all.

697
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,010
Shouldn't we focus on...

698
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,020
We should focus on

699
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,290
the first introduction to Infinity.

700
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,370
Do it again.

701
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,010
The wedding is about to begin.

702
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,740
After you're done,

703
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,060
I can read it right away.

704
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,340
We'll send it out immediately
after the wedding.

705
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
Any problem?

706
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,370
No.

707
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
Ling Rui?

708
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,650
I've never heard of him before.

709
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,420
After he marries Lu Fangning,

710
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,250
he'll live a comfortable life in the future.

711
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,540
There must be something he's good at

712
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,660
to be able to marry Lu Fangning.

713
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,050
I wonder

714
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,340
what he's so good at

715
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,170
to be able to conquer our proud missy.

716
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,300
Yes.

717
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,420
He's my son-in-law.

718
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,210
Of course, he is a great man.

719
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,450
Think about it.

720
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,300
Only a man as great as a deity

721
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,860
can take a fancy on my daughter.

722
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,490
Indeed, only a smart person like me

723
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,060
knows how to pick

724
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,770
the best bridal dress for myself.

725
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,100
This is so comfortable.

726
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,610
Wen, go take a rest.

727
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,420
You've done well.

728
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,420
Let's go.

729
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:48,970
Okay.

730
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,330
-My daughter-in-law.
-Mom.

731
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,610
-Fangning.
-Aunt.

732
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,780
-Aunt.
-The bride is so beautiful.

733
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,650
Come have a seat.

734
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,010
You're so pretty.

735
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,660
My dearest daughter-in-law,

736
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,020
mom knows you don't need money.

737
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,060
But, I prepared

738
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,100
a red packet for you.

739
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,180
I wish you

740
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,300
a lifetime of happiness.

741
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,820
Mom.

742
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,260
This is

743
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,850
my favorite phrase.

744
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,860
We will make

745
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,730
a perfect family.

746
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,650
Fangning, here.

747
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,570
This is my gift for you.

748
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,620
This looks...

749
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,780
-This is too big.
-Keep it.

750
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,290
Thanks, aunt.

751
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,370
Open it.

752
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,660
Do you like it?

753
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,860
This is

754
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,140
my most sincere blessing

755
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,860
to both of you.

756
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,060
I have received it.

757
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,860
I truly have.

758
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,620
Tell me,

759
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,490
how do you feel?

760
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,970
She's getting married.

761
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,450
This is not a thesis presentation.

762
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,300
Fangning,

763
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,260
I've sent my gift

764
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,300
via phone.

765
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,130
Wishing you a happy marriage.

766
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,700
Check it out when you're home.

767
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,580
So secretive.

768
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,370
You don't have to know.

769
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,850
Ling Rui will know what to do

770
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,090
when the night falls.

771
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:41,600
Let's go.

772
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,940
Don't disturb the bride.

773
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,100
Mom, aunts,

774
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,580
then I won't go with you.

775
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,090
If you need anything, just talk to Gao Erfan.

776
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:48,980
I've told him to take care of you.

777
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:49,770
-Go on.
-Sure.

778
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,700
Okay.

779
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,850
Enjoy the food.

780
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,300
-Take a look at it.
-Let's go.

781
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,340
-Let's go.
-Our daughter-in-law.

782
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,420
We're leaving.

783
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,770
You're so pretty.

784
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,340
-I'm so happy today.
-Yes.

785
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,900
[Guidelines of a Happy Marriage]

786
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,450
I'll go find Ms. Lu.

787
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,170
What are you doing?

788
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:43,770
Let me through.

789
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,570
You can't go in there.

790
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,690
Go away.

791
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,780
You can't go in.

792
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,100
Get out of my way.

793
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,460
Lu Fangning.

794
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,010
Tang Pingping.

795
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,730
How dare you.

796
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,060
So?

797
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:57,850
I won't let you

798
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,860
marry him.

799
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,570
You'll never drag Ling Rui down.

800
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,650
I'm warning you.

801
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,420
Don't act like a madman here.

802
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,770
Your dad is inside.

803
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,620
So what?

804
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,810
Gao Erfan.

805
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,660
Ms. Tang, please follow me.

806
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,690
Sorry.

807
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,860
-Who are you? Get off me.
-I won't.

808
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,250
-Go away.
-I don't want to.

809
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,060
Who are you to Lu Fangning?

810
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,160
Why are you being so nosy?

811
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,610
I don't know her.

812
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,520
But, it's not good to ruin
someone else's wedding.

813
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,200
I'm just doing it for justice.

814
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,450
Are you insane?

815
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,420
Let go.

816
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,940
What are you doing?

817
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,940
My dress.

818
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,450
Tang Pingping.

819
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,580
Tang Pingping.

820
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,340
The quality of your skirt

821
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,380
is not that good.

822
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,260
You...

823
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,290
This is much better.

824
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,300
This is how

825
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,340
a bridesmaid should look like.

826
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,020
Lu Fangning.

827
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,860
I'm here.

828
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,980
Stop yelling.

829
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,980
How about this?

830
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,890
Later,

831
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,170
you'll be my bridesmaid

832
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,740
and give your blessings to Ling Rui and me

833
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,380
on the stage.

834
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,130
What do you think?

835
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,860
That's impossible.

836
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,780
I want to tell everyone

837
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,020
that you forced Ling Rui to marry you.

838
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,530
Shut up.

839
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,260
Tang Pingping.

840
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,260
What are you doing here?

841
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,180
I...

842
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,560
Fangning,

843
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,810
I'm so sorry.

844
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,980
This madwoman of our family is here

845
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,100
to cause trouble again.

846
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,980
It's okay, Uncle Tang.

847
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,140
Next time,

848
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,660
if she can't control her own emotions,

849
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,500
I suggest you

850
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,640
not to let her out so easily.

851
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,530
What do you think?

852
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,260
You...

853
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:36,860
Don't worry.

854
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,050
I'll look after her.

855
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,570
You're too embarrassing.

856
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,180
Let's go.

857
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,260
Sorry.

858
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,900
Dad.

859
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,780
You've made a scene.

860
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,060
I'm too ashamed

861
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,100
to stay for the banquet.

862
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,220
Let's go.

863
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,660
-Don't you want to be my bridesmaid?
-Let's go.

864
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,340
Sorry.

865
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,850
You just wait.

866
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,420
-Bye. -Take care. -Let's go.

867
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,500
-What's going on?
-Dad.

868
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,730
Come here.

869
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,740
-Go home.
-Dad.

870
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,340
Who are you?

871
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,719
Cai Siyu.

872
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,940
Why are you here?

873
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,770
I'm just passing by.

874
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,659
You're a reporter, right?

875
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,050
-Ms. Lu, no.
-Gao Erfan.

876
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,300
Give her a media pass.

877
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,130
We didn't invite

878
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:19,850
any media.

879
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,659
There's no media pass.

880
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,050
Make one now.

881
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,570
Ms. Cai

882
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,380
will be the only reporter

883
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,130
invited to our wedding.

884
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:26,810
Yes.

885
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,730
Thanks...

886
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,179
But, all of your scripts

887
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:31,889
will have to go through

888
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,120
Mr. Gao.

889
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,929
Is there a problem?

890
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,040
No problem.

891
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,130
Thanks.

892
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,560
Goodbye.

893
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,330
Your boss is so cool.

894
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,700
Ling Rui,

895
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,260
you'll be mine after tonight.

896
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,890
Chairman Lu,

897
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,300
are your legs strong?

898
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,820
What do you mean?

899
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,170
I'm afraid that

900
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,610
you'll step on my hem later,

901
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,140
and trip both of us.

902
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,180
Don't worry.

903
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,210
I won't let you fall.

904
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,990
♫ I'll love you forever ♫

905
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,690
♫ Love you forever ♫

906
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,000
♫ The man I love the most ♫

907
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,870
♫ I should've acknowledged it way earlier ♫

908
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,990
♫ I'll love you forever ♫

909
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:05,740
♫ Love you forever ♫

910
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,000
♫ The man I love the most ♫

911
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:12,370
♫ I should've acknowledged it way earlier ♫

912
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,710
Good.

913
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,990
♫ I'll love you forever ♫

914
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,140
♫ This is all predestined ♫

915
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,380
♫ I've made up my mind ♫

916
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,070
♫ to never leave you ♫

923
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:59,450
♫ I'll never let go of your hand ♫

924
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,330
♫ I want to grasp our presence ♫

925
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:11,510
♫ and our future ♫

926
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,580
I can hear you. Speak.

927
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,850
My face?

928
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,850
Why do you need to edit it?

929
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,460
Do you think I'm Tang Ping?

930
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,930
I don't care about how I look.

931
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,090
I care only about Infinity.

932
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,570
Infinity is the most important thing.

933
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,540
Ling Rui,

934
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,420
hold this for me.

935
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,900
Give me a moment.

936
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,580
No worries.

937
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,930
All of the bulletins

938
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,660
must have

939
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,700
Infinity's logo.

940
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,180
Put Infinity's logo everywhere.

941
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,460
If you're adding watermarks,

942
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,210
use its logo too.

943
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:48,980
Understand?

944
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,020
Yes.

945
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,100
Gao Erfan, listen to me.

946
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,380
Find someone

947
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,220
to publish all the news

948
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,100
on social media.

949
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:57,700
Do you hear me?

950
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,090
I want it to be the headlines.

951
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,740
Infinity is the most important thing.

952
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,940
Understand?

953
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,100
It hurts.

954
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,420
What happened?

955
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,570
During the toast,

956
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,460
I twisted my ankle.

957
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,620
Also,

958
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,980
don't reveal anything

959
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,140
about the groom.

960
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,580
Censor his face.

961
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,580
You twisted your ankle?

962
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,170
Let me help you over.

963
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,060
Open it.

964
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,530
The first guideline of a happy marriage,

965
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,180
familiarity and proximity.

966
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,690
What happened?

967
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,050
I can't move.

968
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,020
Can you

969
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,010
bring me there?

970
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,620
Which foot?

971
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,500
This one.

972
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:11,810
Anything will do.

973
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,260
Do you need to

974
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,530
ask such a trivial question?

975
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,770
I can't see the swelling.

976
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,740
Here... right here.

977
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,930
I'll go get the ice pack.

978
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,340
Sure.

979
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,730
Do as you say.

980
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,050
Here?

981
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,930
I wore the high heels for one whole day.

982
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,170
I'm so tired.
