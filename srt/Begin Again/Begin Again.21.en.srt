[Episode 21]

4
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,880
There's still no one.

5
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,910
Be patient and wait.

6
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,360
Why is there still no one?

7
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,440
Tang Pingping,

8
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,920
can you be more natural?

9
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,829
Be quiet.

10
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,480
Don't be like a thief.

11
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,880
No matter what happens

12
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,120
later on,

13
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,120
you must take him

14
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,520
to the designated location I told you.

15
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,960
Okay.

16
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,320
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,080
I scared you again.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,800
It's okay.

19
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,440
I'm sorry that

20
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,430
I embarrassed you today.

21
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,400
You aren't angry, are you?

22
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,720
Why would I?

23
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,560
Didn't I say that

24
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,480
we'll meet again?

25
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,440
Don't worry.

26
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm still your big fan.

27
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,720
That's good then.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
By the way,

29
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,079
these are for you to eat.

30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,720
Do you like them?

31
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,040
For me?

32
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,240
Yes.

33
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,440
Thank you!

34
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,000
Aiyah.

35
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,720
Aiyo.

36
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,720
What are you doing?

37
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,400
I...

38
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,920
It hurts.

39
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,240
You took candid shots!

40
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,000
Pervert!

41
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,320
What can a few photos indicate?

42
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,030
I did nothing.

43
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,400
You did nothing?

44
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,800
Do you see it?

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
The CCTV is there.

46
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,960
The police will tell you

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,000
whether you did it or not.

48
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm in the wrong.

49
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,600
It's my first time.

50
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,280
Please let me off the hook.

51
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,040
Right now,

52
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,200
you should be thankful

53
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,280
as you can be corrected

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,560
before making a huge mistake.

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,600
I'm still a student.

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
If I'm caught by police,

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,190
my life is over.

58
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,480
My future is gone.

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
This society always welcomes

60
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,190
the one who has turned over a new leaf.

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,760
It hurts.

62
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,600
Not bad.

63
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,200
Aren't you just

64
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,680
going to show others

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,240
by dressing like this?

66
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,160
You finally said this.

67
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,839
It's a modern era now.

68
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,839
You still said something like this.

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,790
Let me tell you.

70
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,600
Wearing a skirt

71
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,519
is for my own happiness,

72
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,840
but not for others to see.

73
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,120
How is it?

74
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,480
Well said.

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,760
You praised me?

76
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,680
Lu Fangning,

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,720
praise me again.

78
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,560
What you just said

79
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,600
was taught by me.

80
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,640
So you know what?

81
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,960
Your greatest strength

82
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,470
is that you know to learn from me.

83
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,040
I don't need to learn from you.

84
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880
Then you use your own words

85
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,800
to scold him again.

86
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:42,840
Scold him.

87
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,440
I need to see

88
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,159
whether he's willing to be scolded by me.

89
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,280
Stop there!

90
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,080
Who are you again?

91
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,640
Don't move.

92
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,120
Dr. Ling.

93
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:54,960
Ling Rui?

94
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you all right?

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,640
I'm fine.

96
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,560
Hit.

97
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,360
What are you doing?

98
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,880
Hold on.

99
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:05,840
Hit now.

100
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,600
Hit.

101
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,760
You pervert!

102
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,640
I'm beating you to death.

103
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,870
Pervert!

104
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,840
Scumbag!

105
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,200
Vile pervert!

106
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm beating you to death.

107
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,120
Here you are.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,640
Drop dead!

109
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,560
Pervert.

110
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,160
Drop dead!

111
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,960
Pervert!

112
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,400
Make sure you hit on him.

113
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,990
I'm hitting you to death.

114
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
I'm hitting you to death.

115
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,520
Scumbag!

116
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,040
-Drop dead!
-Help!

117
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,120
We finally caught that pervert red-handed.

118
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,159
Lu Fangning.

119
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,520
You're so smart.

120
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,520
He really is a habitual offender.

121
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,830
Darling.

122
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,880
You were so impressive just now.

123
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,030
That was because I heard before that...

124
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,240
Forget it.

125
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,560
I got it wrong.

126
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,640
It's great that you're fine.

127
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,480
Why would I be hurt?

128
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,190
But if

129
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,880
something happens to you,

130
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,160
I'll be worried to death.

131
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,640
You don't even know that

132
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,760
the hands of a surgeon

133
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,840
are very precious.

134
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,040
I used feet just now.

135
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,400
Yes, you're so smart and amazing!

136
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,960
Lu Fangning,

137
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,110
why are you so pretentious now?

138
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,800
You can surely

139
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,480
beat him just now.

140
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,600
Honey,

141
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,320
you said before that

142
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,840
you could handle it.

143
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,320
Did you refer to this?

144
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,760
For this matter,

145
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,720
I can do it for you.

146
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,470
Okay.

147
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,320
I still have to go to the medical room.

148
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,159
There's still something to deal with.

149
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,600
We're going to separate again.

150
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,710
What should I do?

151
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,920
I'll miss you.

152
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,480
We'll see each other later.

153
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,240
Come back early then.

154
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,520
I'll make a move now.

155
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,520
See you tonight.

156
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,790
Missing you!

157
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,310
Lu Fangning.

158
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,480
You've changed.

159
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,720
I'm better than who I was before.

160
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,600
Why are you following me?

161
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,360
I'm scared of being alone.

162
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,440
Then go home and look for your dad.

163
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,080
I won't.

164
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,120
Lu Fangning.

165
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,390
Go to the bar with me tonight.

166
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,520
No, I don't want to.

167
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,360
Do keep me company.

168
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,600
It shouldn't be a big problem.

169
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,240
But it'd be better for you

170
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,360
to go to a big hospital to check tomorrow.

171
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,600
Try not to move with the wound

172
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,440
tonight.

173
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Thank you, Dr. Ling.

174
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,720
You're welcome.

175
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,960
Dr. Ling,

176
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,680
we took you so long for this.

177
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,480
We're really sorry.

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,120
You haven't eaten yet, right?

179
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,640
I'll go and make the arrangement.

180
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,200
There's no need.

181
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,159
I...

182
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,640
My wife is still waiting for me.

183
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,600
I understand.

184
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,240
Well,

185
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,400
thank you then.

186
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,160
We'll make a move first.

187
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,720
Okay.

188
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,530
Thank you.

189
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,510
-Thank you, Dr. Ling. Thank you.
-Okay.

190
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,080
Thank you.

191
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,800
Remember not to move with the wound.

192
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,440
Okay.

193
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,240
Slow down.

194
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,160
Tang Ping.

195
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,800
Tang Pingping.

196
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,960
Tang Ping.

197
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,150
Tang Ping.

198
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,680
Tang Pingping.

199
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,800
You've fallen asleep?

200
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,520
You...

201
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,840
What are you doing?

202
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,960
What's wrong with her?

203
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,200
She was scared today,

204
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
so perhaps she's feeling sad.

205
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,720
But she can even be drunk like this

206
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,280
by drinking this wine.

207
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,520
She really can't drink.

208
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,120
Tang Ping.

209
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,160
Tang Ping.

210
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,440
Don't move.

211
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,280
Let's go out.

212
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,440
Let's leave.

213
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,800
Is she okay?

214
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,400
Aiyah.

215
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,960
She's okay.

216
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,160
Look. She's okay.

217
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,040
Look at me.

218
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
When Tang Ping was conscious during the day,

219
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,790
she was looking and staring at you

220
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,480
with bad intentions.

221
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,520
Who knows whether she'll take advantage of you

222
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,510
when she's drunk?

223
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,720
I can't let

224
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,960
my cutest Ling Rui

225
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,870
be taken advantage of by her.

226
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,840
You're also very cute.

227
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,440
Then do you want

228
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,960
to give me some rewards

229
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,040
for being so cute?

230
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,240
What rewards?

231
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,160
It's the lobby at the back.

232
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,960
It's crowded.

233
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
It's fine.

234
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,080
Come over.

235
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
Come here.

236
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,960
Come here.

237
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,030
What are you two doing?

238
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,040
What are you doing?

239
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Why did you come out?

240
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,440
Fangning,

241
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,630
where did you go?

242
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
Why did you leave

243
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,400
without saying anything?

244
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,280
I thought you'd never come back.

245
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,840
What nonsense are you spouting now?

246
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,080
What happened to you?

247
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,040
Are you drunk?

248
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,520
Why are you crying?

249
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,960
-Tang Ping.
-You're nasty.

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,760
I'm nasty?

251
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,630
You've been nasty since your childhood.

252
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,880
You clearly know that

253
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,680
since my childhood, I've always wanted

254
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,920
to be good friends with you.

255
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,120
Why have you been bullying me since my childhood?

256
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,670
You hate me, so I also hate you.

257
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,520
Do you know that

258
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,600
I really envy you?

259
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,790
You've been doing so well

260
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,440
in everything,

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,520
and everyone likes you.

262
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,880
But I can't do anything well,

263
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,320
and I've always been cheated.

264
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,400
Tang Ping.

265
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,960
Look at me.

266
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,080
Enough said.

267
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,240
What are you doing?

268
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,480
You drank too much?

269
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,680
Moreover,

270
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,000
why do you want to compare yourself with me?

271
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
Aren't you courting yourself humiliation?

272
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,600
I'm

273
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,830
such a great person,

274
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,560
right?

275
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,400
Okay, stop spouting nonsense.

276
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,720
By the way,

277
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,320
when I scolded that vile pervert

278
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,280
today,

279
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,160
I just imagined

280
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,070
myself like you.

281
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,520
So handsome!

282
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,360
I found out

283
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,880
for the first time that

284
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,080
cursing is such a cool thing.

285
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,920
I feel that it's so handsome.

286
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,400
I really like you so much,

287
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,560
Lu Fangning.

288
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,310
Enough said.

289
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,600
I actually

290
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,080
don't hate you either.

291
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,080
Tang Ping.

292
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,160
Tang Ping.

293
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,560
That's enough.

294
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,110
Tang Ping.

295
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,800
None of you men

296
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,640
is good.

297
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,040
But you

298
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,070
are considered not bad.

299
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,590
You...

300
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,240
You...

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,560
Tang Ping.

302
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,800
You're drunk.

303
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,480
Enough said.

304
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,990
Stop making trouble.

305
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,200
Go in and sleep.

306
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,880
You're drunk.

307
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,840
Lu Fangning.

308
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,760
I

309
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,320
love you.

310
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,520
Tang Ping.

311
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,200
Tang Ping.

312
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,030
Tang Pingping.

313
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,400
Think about it. I'm Lu Fangning.

314
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,960
Who have I served since my childhood?

315
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,790
She vomited, and I had to coax her to sleep.

316
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,120
That was awful.

317
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,840
Look.

318
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,720
Look.

319
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,960
She's like a pig.

320
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,240
I'm really unsatisfied.

321
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,120
Our romantic night

322
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,840
was ruined by this fool.

323
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,360
You're not allowed to leave me.

324
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,680
She needs you the most

325
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
right now.

326
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,280
I have to

327
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,600
temporarily lend you to her.

328
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,440
But I'm not willing to be lent.

329
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
It can't be helped.

330
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,640
I'm just too lovely.

331
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,360
Right.

332
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,880
You're indeed too lovely.

333
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,640
So sometimes

334
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,680
it's also quite troublesome.

335
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,200
But

336
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,390
you only love me.

337
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,000
Right.

338
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:24,950
Fine.

339
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,480
I'll stay with her tonight.

340
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,560
It's just that

341
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,950
before lending myself to her,

342
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,520
I want her to get

343
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,440
a little punishment.

344
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,520
What punishment?

345
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,120
Come here.

346
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,560
Come and sit here.

347
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,800
Why?

348
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,320
Darling.

349
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,480
Darling.

350
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,630
This is not that proper.

351
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,120
Just one kiss.

352
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,200
I don't allow that in front of me.

353
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,280
This is really not that good.

354
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,160
Yes.

355
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,080
Whose room is this?

356
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,760
Aiyah!

357
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,040
None of you men

358
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,200
is good.

359
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,560
Lu Fangning.

360
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,440
I

361
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,720
love you.

362
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,590
I must be crazy.

363
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,360
What did I say to Lu Fangning?

364
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,240
How can I meet her next time?

365
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,880
I want to go home.

366
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,840
I want to go home.

367
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,680
Going home.

368
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,020
[Greenhouse]

369
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,480
Miss Tang.

370
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,080
You're awake.

371
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
I...

372
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,560
Ready to leave?

373
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,200
Ling Rui,

374
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,590
why is my apple...

375
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,080
You're awake.

376
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,200
Do you want to have an apple?

377
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,680
I...

378
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,880
I'm not eating.

379
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,320
-You don't like it?
-Don't come over.

380
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,280
Don't come over.

381
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,800
Don't come over.

382
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,880
What's wrong?

383
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,960
It's that

384
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,960
I'm already full

385
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,720
from your PDA.

386
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,880
I don't have to eat this apple then.

387
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,480
This apple

388
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,920
is really not well peeled.

389
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,110
Honey.

390
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,560
It's too dramatic.

391
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,520
Well,

392
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,040
I'm not acting.

393
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,120
I was just being nice, asking

394
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
if you want to have breakfast?

395
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,080
What are you doing?

396
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,920
You stupid...

397
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,280
Silly girl.

398
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,910
Silly yet cute.

399
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,080
When you are outside alone

400
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,440
next time,

401
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,840
don't drink so much alcohol.

402
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,160
How dangerous it is for a little girl.

403
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,400
Okay.

404
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,960
You're...

405
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,560
Planning to leave?

406
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,950
You don't plan to continue

407
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,160
ruining my romantic time?

408
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,240
Aiyah.

409
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,880
After going back this time,

410
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,120
I want to live a good life,

411
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,200
work hard,

412
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,510
and make money properly.

413
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,280
Hopefully

414
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,430
when you see me next time,

415
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,880
you'll scold me less.

416
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,760
Or

417
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,760
shall we take you to the station?

418
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,280
There's no need.

419
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,240
I'm fine. Don't bother.

420
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,440
Dr. Ling.

421
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,000
Dr. Ling.

422
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,600
-Something happened.
-What happened?

423
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,230
Hurry up and go to the medical station

424
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,760
to take a look.

425
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,840
Several students fought

426
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,800
and they're injured.

427
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,400
Okay, I got it.

428
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll go over at once.

429
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay, hurry up.

430
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,280
Fangning.

431
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,840
I'm fine.

432
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,120
Patients matter. Hurry up and go.

433
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,520
Okay.

434
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,280
I'm sorry, Miss Tang.

435
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,320
How about I let Xiaoying take you there?

436
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,800
It's okay.

437
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,470
I have Lu Fangning to see me off.

438
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,400
Okay, I'll leave first. Fangning.

439
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,760
-I'm leaving.
-Bye-bye.

440
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,680
Xiaoying.

441
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,440
Come and see Sister Tang Ping off.

442
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,520
Let go of me.

443
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,720
So annoying.

444
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,120
Go down the stairs slowly, Xiaoying.

445
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,560
You're so warmhearted.

446
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,200
What's the matter? Why are you shy?

447
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,960
Aiyah, don't be shy.

448
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,360
What's wrong?

449
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,230
Don't walk hand in hand with me.

450
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,470
Why?

451
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,360
Haven't we reconciled?

452
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,360
You don't hate me anymore, right?

453
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,360
That's enough.

454
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,760
Okay.

455
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,440
Stop teasing you.

456
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,470
I'll wait for you.

457
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Why will you wait for me?

458
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,720
Didn't you say that

459
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,840
you're seeing me next time?

460
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,200
Goodbye.

461
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,560
See you next time.

462
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,040
Then

463
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,320
I'm leaving.

464
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,240
You can go now.

465
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,280
Leave now.

466
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
Leave now. What are you doing?

467
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,190
Bye-bye.

468
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,560
Bye-bye.

469
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,840
We must see each other again.

470
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
Goodbye.

471
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,280
Bye-bye!

472
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,360
Go now.

473
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,360
-Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye!

474
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,670
Brother Ling Rui's wife,

475
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,840
is this sister

476
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,830
just like you,

477
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,240
who also likes Brother Ling Rui very much?

478
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,070
What nonsense are you spouting?

479
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,800
But I think that

480
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,040
although she likes you so much,

481
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,240
she'd been messing around

482
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,630
between you and Ling Rui.

483
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,310
But it's obvious that

484
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,390
you only fancy Ling Rui.

485
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,760
After all,

486
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,440
Brother Ling Rui is so great.

487
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,920
Indeed.

488
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,240
As you can see,

489
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,350
I'm really quite lovely.

490
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:44,990
But

491
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,230
I only have Ling Rui in my heart.

492
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,800
Of course, Ling Rui is also very good.

493
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,360
But sister,

494
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,800
you don't have to be sad.

495
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,880
Why would I be sad?

496
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,750
In fact,

497
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
Brother Ling Rui

498
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,560
has had someone whom he's been into for a long time.

499
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,920
I know. It's me.

500
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,670
No.

501
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,440
It was really a long time ago.

502
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,120
I heard from my mother that Brother Ling Rui

503
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,350
has been into that girl

504
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,600
since high school.

505
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,760
Sister-in-law,

506
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,640
have you and Ling Rui

507
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,120
known each other for that long?

508
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,040
Well,

509
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,040
it's not that long.

510
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,680
Right?

511
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,880
I heard that

512
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,320
Brother Ling Rui

513
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,360
has been keeping a coin.

514
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,640
It was given by the one

515
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,240
whom he's into.

516
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,350
This is a gift for you.

517
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,430
A coin?

518
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,840
With the motif

519
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,080
of an amusement park on it?

520
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,640
How did you know?

521
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,320
Because that's mine.

522
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,910
But didn't you say that

523
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,920
you and Brother Ling Rui

524
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,560
haven't known each other for that long?

525
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,590
You're a little kid.

526
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,000
Why do you have so many questions?

527
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
If you keep asking me,

528
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,790
I won't help you

529
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,600
to get Brother Ling Rui's

530

lucky item.

531
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,360
Really?

532
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,240
Sister-in-law,

533
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,360
do you really want to give it to me?

534
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,080
Sister-in-law, you're so nice.

535
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,430
Here is the place

536
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,510
where Ling Rui used to go to school.

537
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,440
The person he's into

538
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,080
should be his classmate.

539
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,280
Senior, I'm into you.

540
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,990
No. Thank you.

541
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:26,960
[Books bring eternal benefits to me]

542
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,070
Is your hand hurt?

543
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,320
Let me see.

544
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,680
Don't move.

545
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,150
Why did you fight?

546
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:20,920
He laughed at me.

547
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,080
They all laughed at me.

548
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,240
They said I picked up food

549
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,670
and clothes for a living.

550
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,080
Saying that I was a beggar,

551
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,240
picking up what others didn't want.

552
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,680
Are you then?

553
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,840
Of course not.

554
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,000
Why were you angry then?

555
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,960
My family is poor.

556
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,960
Even the tuition fee is paid by the teacher.

557
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,640
We share the same clothes.

558
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,800
Finally, I got new clothes,

559
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,880
which were left unwanted by my classmate.

560
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,360
I have to go to school every day,

561
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,200
wearing old clothes that others don't want.

562
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,280
What a shame.

563
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,560
I still have to go to the teacher in the afternoon

564
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,240
to take the lunch that others don't want.

565
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,560
They must be mocking me

566
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,200
in their hearts.

567
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,640
They must be laughing at me.

568
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,160
Forget it, how can you understand?

569
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,350
I understand.

570
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,920
I also had

571
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,720
the experience of wearing

572
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,800
classmates' old clothes to school.

573
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,720
I also had

574
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,360
the experience

575
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,160
of standing in the corridor

576
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,440
and having bread given by the teacher.

577
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,120
I had experienced all of these.

578
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,320
So what?

579
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,320
You're smart.

580
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,280
You had excellent results.

581
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,080
So I have to study hard

582
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,640
to be like you.

583
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,560
Did you mean so?

584
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,520
What I want to say

585
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,800
is that I can understand your feeling.

586
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,720
Yes.

587
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,400
When I was in school,

588
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,510
my results were pretty good.

589
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,990
So maybe

590
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,920
I had to go to the podium frequently

591
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,520
to express my gratitude in public.

592
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,360
I need to thank

593
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,560
and bow.

594
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,080
To thank classmates and teachers for their help,

595
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,040
although some of them

596
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,920
didn't deserve it.

597
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,000
Didn't you have self-esteem?

598
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,240
Compared to self-esteem,

599
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,600
I have something more important.

600
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,920
I'm not asking you to abandon self-esteem

601
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,440
by telling you this.

602
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,480
I want you to keep it well instead.

603
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,920
If you're feeling angry

604
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,910
towards others due to this,

605
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,800
that's really giving up on yourself

606
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,880
and giving up dignity.

607
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,800
I'm not as strong as you.

608
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,040
I'm not strong, too.

609
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,920
I'll also be angry.

610
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,440
I'll also lose control.

611
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,350
Really?

612
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:41,960
Correct.

613
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,200
I'm just an ordinary person, too.

614
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,840
But fortunately,

615
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,840
at that time,

616
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,630
I met someone.

617
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,310
That person

618
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
once confessed her love

619
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,080
in front of me.

620
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,840
Although the way her using a coin

621
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,590
as a token of love

622
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,720
was childish,

623
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,040
it's been warming me up.

624
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,680
It's just like

625
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,680
a person who is about to drown

626
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,600
managing to grab a floating board.

627
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,710
She saved me.

628
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,880
And now,

629
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
I also hope to be your floating board.

630
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,400
Floating board?

631
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,120
I thought that it was me.

632
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,440
It's the coin again.

633
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,720
I didn't expect that this coin

634
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,960
is so important to him.

635
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,640
It's lucky that

636
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,430
I always carry it with me.

637
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,150
Forget it.

638
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,600
I'll reluctantly inherit you.

639
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,320
Where's the coin?

640
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,280
I'm doomed.

641
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Drop dead!

Pervert!

643
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,800
Let's swap. Okay.

644
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,430
It's not a game coin.

645
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Whose coin is this?

Come and get some sugar-coated haws.

648

I lost it again.

649
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,760
I really don't share an affinity

650
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,720
with this coin?

651
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,480
I even don't mind inheriting you.

00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,280
You still dislike me?

Hey.

Hello, my name is Ling Rui.

What's your name?

to come and help you with your homework.

No. I can't and I won't.

These inferior questions

666

You didn't say not to read.

671
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,600
Then I don't want to do homework here.

672

Where are you going to do it?

Let's play it after you've finished your homework.

I'll do it later.

half an hour should be enough.

I'm done.

Less than half an hour.

Come again if you like it.

00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,830
Thank you.

704
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,960
Let's go and do homework.

705
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:39,800
Be careful.

706
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,360
I'm done.

707
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,560
Little teacher,

708
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,480
don't you want to play?

709
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,360
I'm not playing.

710
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,000
Boring.

711
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,560
Hold the cotton candies properly.

712
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,910
It's the Queen's ride.

713
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:52,720
I'm coming.

714
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,360
Nanny,

715
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,800
can I borrow your camera?

716
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,440
Sure.

717
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,680
But I have no money.

718
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,560
You bought cotton candies

719
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,280
and paid me more than they cost

720
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,480
just now.

721
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,800
Just take it.

722
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,310
Remember to give it back to Nanny.

723
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,080
Do you know how to use it?

724
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,680
Yes, I do.

725
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:45,920
Good.

726
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,480
Thank you.

727
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:47,960
Be careful.

728
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:11,840
Little teacher,

729
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,280
show me my photos.

730
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,720
Am I pretty?

731
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,480
Am I?

732
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,000
-Am I?
-Yes.

733
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,680
You're actually quite good-looking.

734
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,360
You'll be my subject from now on.

735
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,680
Call me when anything happens.

736
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm The White Queen of the Golden Forest,

737
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,400
Ningning.

738
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,720
The kid behind.

739
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,000
Yes, higher.

740
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,310
One, two, three.

741
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,280
Here's one photo.

742
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,640
Sit properly.

743
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,430
Let's take one more photo.

744
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,030
Hello.

745
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,360
I'm sorry.

746
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,440
I can't teach you anymore in the future.

747
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:17,760
Hello,

748
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,760
this is the city hospital.

749
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,840
You lost our photo

750
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,960
just like that.

751
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,390
When you came to me,

752
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,880
my dad just passed away.

753
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:32,960
His surgery

754
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,240
was delayed again and again.

755
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,320
I thought it must be because

756
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,360
we were poor.

757
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,160
So I could only witness

758
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,080
his situation

759
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,160
getting worse.

760
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,120
At last,

761
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,840
I almost broke down.

762
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,590
Little teacher.

763
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:53,920
Finally, I found you.

764
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,430
What's wrong with you?

765
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,110
Is someone bullying you?

766
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,440
I'll teach him a lesson.

767
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,800
I'm the queen.

768
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,920
No one here is going to play with you.

769
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,240
What happened to you?

770
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,480
Tell me.

771
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,800
My family is rich.

772
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:11,960
My dad said that

773
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,710
in this world,

774
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,280
money can solve all the problems.

775
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,440
Look. I have money.

776
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,240
I'm giving you all of my money.

777
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,630
I don't want it.

778
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,880
What do you want?

779
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,280
I only have money.

780
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,200
What should I do?

781
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,480
How can I help you?

782
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,000
I can give you whatever you need.

783
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,240
You...

784
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,640
Why are you so kind to me?

785
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,400
Because you played with me in the amusement park

786
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,120
and looked at me laughing.

787
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,360
You have a great smile.

788
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,000
I don't want to see you like this.

789
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,160
I want you to laugh, too.

790
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,600
For this one,

791
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,880
I accepted it.

792
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,680
You can regard the money accepted

793
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,720
as the deposit.

794
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,240
I'll earn more money

795
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,480
when I grow up,

796
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,800
and I'll marry you, okay?

797
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,160
The White Queen of the Golden Forest.

798
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,800
Little teacher.

799
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,080
Long time no see.

800
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,880
Long time no see.

801
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,760
Unfortunately,

802
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,190
I lost

803
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,280
your marriage deposit.

804
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:06,950
Why is it with you?

805
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,360
All things that are lost

806
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,400
will be found.

807
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:13,880
It's like the fate

808
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,600
between us.

809
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:23,280
Fangning.

810
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:25,840
In your past,

811
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,520
I may not be special.

812
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,360
But you're very important

813
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,400
to me in my life.

814
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,040
It's you

815
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,840
who prevented me from

816
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,720
being in excruciating pain.

817
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,440
You made me realize

818
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,400
that someone would help me.

819
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:41,680
You made me realize

820
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:43,800
that I wasn't

821
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,520
a weak person,

822
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,400
and I could also bring hope to others.

823
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
If it was without you,

824
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,840
I might have done something

825
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,110
that I may regret later.

826
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,320
Afterward

827
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,400
I heard from Professor Luo

828
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,400
that for my dad's illness,

829
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,680
there was basically no chance for surgery.

830
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,760
It's them who tried their best

831
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,280
to extend his lifespan again and again.

832
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:05,960
So

833
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,200
I made up my mind to study medicine,

834
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,000
trying to overcome

835
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,080
this medical difficulty.

836
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,440
So that's why

837
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,520
you want to study abroad

838
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,400
so eagerly.

839
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,880
So it's because of this.

840
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,320
I thought

841
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,480
that I agreed with your marriage contract

842
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,480
was because I was grateful towards you.

843
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,800
But afterward, I found out

844
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:33,800
that I'd do only you

845
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,120
such a favor

846
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,280
in my life.
