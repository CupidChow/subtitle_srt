[Episode 15]

4
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,140
Is he handsome?

5
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,810
I know he's not as handsome as me.

6
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,259
Who's he?

7
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,289
You're being weird today.

8
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,140
I have a question.

9
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,460
Help me analyze the situation calmly

10
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,060
as an outsider.

11
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,220
Okay.

12
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,020
A friend of mine

13
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,169
has a female friend

14
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,610
who was very interested

15
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,090
in him.

16
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,900
But after he turned her down

17
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,050
a couple of times,

18
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,460
this female friend

19
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,410
became ice-cold.

20
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,930
What caused her to change?

21
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,780
Your friend?

22
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,380
My friend.

23
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,900
Could it be that

24
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,500
my friend said something harsh?

25
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,260
She's hurt?

26
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,700
She's angry?

27
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,500
It's really a friend of yours?

28
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,180
Really, he's my friend.

29
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,980
You really care about him.

30
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,900
Is she going to give up

31
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,490
and find someone else?

32
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,540
I don't think so.

33
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,420
According to

34
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,420
my observation on

35
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,500
all the women in love,

36
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,820
they are usually doing this

37
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,100
to send a signal

38
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,180
to the men.

39
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,100
It means that

40
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,700
"I might be leaving you."

41
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,020
"Be careful."

42
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,420
Do you understand?

43
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,130
Be careful.

44
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,050
What do you mean?

45
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,260
It means that

46
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,500
do something now

47
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,060
before I leave you.

48
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,340
What to do then?

49
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,130
The same, old tricks.

50
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,570
Go on a date.

51
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,500
Give presents.

52
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,579
Beg for her mercy.

53
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,220
Confess to her.

54
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,220
One more thing,

55
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,930
look pitiful.

56
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,020
You know what?

57
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,090
When you went on that business trip,

58
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,100
Mr. Yu and I thought

59
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,740
you and Fangning had a fight.

60
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,540
So, we told her

61
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,180
everything

62
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,100
about your past.

63
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,850
Oh, gosh.

64
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,690
You weren't there to see it.

65
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,620
Her feelings

66
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,660
are shown all over her face.

67
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,740
It's empathy.

68
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,100
I'm telling you, it works on her.

69
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,940
You know what?

70
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,260
Just stand up.

71
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,740
I'll give you a kick.

72
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,820
When you are injured,

73
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,690
I assure you that you will get along well

74
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,060
with your wife.

75
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,380
Both of you will be lovey-dovey.

76
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,220
It's my friend.

77
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,100
Right, right.

78
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,170
It's your friend.

79
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,339
I didn't say it was both of you.

80
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,930
I just used you as an example.

81
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,459
Just a friend.

82
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,540
We're not even that close.

83
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,450
Sure, sure.

84
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,180
You mentioned that

85
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,050
she cried after hearing about

86
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,580
my past?

87
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,980
Her eyes were teary.

88
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,860
But

89
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,610
I don't quite know

90
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,260
if she cried after she left.

91
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,180
You know, women are creatures

92
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,700
that need to be spoiled.

93
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,620
Tell her

94
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,940
what you have in mind.

95
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,060
After that,

96
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,380
do something romantic

97
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,770
and you can surely win her heart.

98
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,180
It's my friend.

99
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,010
Sure, sure.

100
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,300
Your friend.

101
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,620
Eat your noodles.

102
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,900
Stop thinking about it.

103
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,140
Isn't this about your friend?

104
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,460
What are you worrying about,

105
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:17,900
right?

106
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,170
Sense of ceremony.

107
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,420
Tell her my true thoughts.

108
00:05:48,050 --> 00:06:06,580
[Marriage Certificate]

109
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,940
Her birthday is coming soon.

110
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,060
Put that down.

111
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,420
Blow up more balloons, come on.

112
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,410
Stop playing around.

113
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,820
Blow up more balloons.

114
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,820
Okay.

115
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,780
Ling Rui.

116
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,260
Dr. Ling.

117
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,340
You are decorating for a birthday party?

118
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,580
Sure.

119
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,260
Mengmeng and Xiaoxuan

120
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,020
are celebrating their birthdays.

121
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,540
We are going to throw a party for both of them.

122
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,140
Join us if you're free, Dr. Ling.

123
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,260
Sure.

124
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,500
So that's how you decorate

125
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,620
for a birthday party.

126
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,570
It's pretty.

127
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,580
What about it?

128
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,340
Are you going to throw someone a birthday party?

129
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,290
I happened

130
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,300
to have some extra

131
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
colored stripes and balloons here.

132
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,020
Yang Jin and Yang.

133
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,530
Where are the balloons?

134
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,570
Here.

135
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,620
These balloons are sponsored by the hospital.

136
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,420
When you got home,

137
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,740
tie these stripes

138
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,410
on the balloons

139
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,020
like what we did.

140
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,980
Just make the room

141
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,940
look more lively.

142
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,450
Don't make it look gloomy.

143
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,020
Sure.

144
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,740
What else?

145
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,580
Well, they've asked

146
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,090
someone from the security department

147
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,010
to deliver the cake in a mascot costume.

148
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,090
But that mascot costume

149
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,810
doesn't quite agree with your style.

150
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,850
How do you know

151
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,940
it won't agree with his style?

152
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,340
It's not for me.

153
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,580
It's for my friend.

154
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,700
Then can I borrow the costume for him

155
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,420
when you're done?

156
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,490
Of course.

157
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,580
Anything else?

158
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,140
Also, pick a present

159
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,740
that she will absolutely love.

160
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,260
A present that she loves?

161
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,740
Hi.

162
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,090
Happy birthday!

163
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,450
What are you doing?

164
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,220
Nothing.

165
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,850
How do you decorate?

166
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,490
Let me help.

167
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,970
Dr. Ling, you should get some rest.
I'll do it.

168
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,860
Sure. Ling,

169
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,300
blow up some of the balloons.

170
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,420
Just let me

171
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,260
order you around for once.

172
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,860
I can't even tell you what to do?

173
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,740
Welcome, sir.

174
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,060
Hello, I'd like to order a cake.

175
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,860
Sure.

176
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,460
What kind of cake

177
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,260
do you want then?

178
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,580
You could have a look

179
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,330
at this brochure.

180
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,180
There's no need.

181
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,050
Just follow this design.

182
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,820
Excuse me?

183
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,060
I mean,

184
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,340
put this on the cake.

185
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,140
Sure. I see, sir.

186
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,820
Please send me the picture then.

187
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,700
Okay.

188
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
What on earth should I write?

189
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,060
If I tell you everything,

190
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,700
will you remember it?

193
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,850
Hello?

194
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,660
I received it again.

195
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,340
There's still no clue?

196
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,140
Keep on looking.

197
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,660
The money will be transferred to your account.

198
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,420
You're back.

199
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,820
Get well soon.

200
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,660
They prepared these.

201
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,540
They got it wrong.

202
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,420
It's okay.

203
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,260

204
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,500

Make a wish.

212
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,420
Ling Rui.

213
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,890
Did you prepare all of these by yourself?

214
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,540
I wanted to give you a surprise.

215
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,060
But I don't think it's very successful.

216
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,930
At least the cake is okay.

217
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,490
This is my gift for you.

218
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,700
I hope you like it.

219
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,180
Ling Rui, it just occurred to me

220
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,890
that I have to deal with
an emergency in the office,

221
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,609
I have to... I have to go now.

222
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,380
Thank you.

223
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,859
Fangning!

224
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,250
He's celebrating your birthday.

225
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,210
Lu Fangning, you're so stupid.

226
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,530
A coin?

227
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,100
Amusement park?

228
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,020
Why did he give me a coin
from the amusement park?

229
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,340
Oh, no.

230
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,330
No, no.

231
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,220
Hey, Ling Rui. What's up?

232
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,500
Fangyu,

233
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,180
do you know that

234
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,170
today is Fangning's birthday?

235
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,380
Of course, I do.

236
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,660
Ling Rui.

237
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,140
You didn't celebrate my sister's birthday,

238
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,060
did you?

239
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,860
Did she hit you?

240
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,970
We can't celebrate

241
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,650
her birthday?

242
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,660
Our eldest sister died

243
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,420
on the day of her birthday.

244
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,740
I was still too young at that time,

245
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,900
I don't quite know

246
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,890
what happened exactly.

247
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,420
Ling Rui,

248
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,060
are you okay?

249
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,340
Are you hurt?

250
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,860
Since our eldest sister passed away,

251
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,220
none of us

252
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,010
has celebrated her birthday.

253
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,860
Even though

254
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,620
she looks fine,

255
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,460
nobody dares to

256
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,050
mess with her on her birthday.

257
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,580
Why are you still...

258
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,180
I'm fine.

259
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,100
I think

260
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,060
she even thanked me.

261
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,100
What did you say?

262
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,140
She thanked you?

263
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,220
You really are her husband.

264
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,540
She's very tolerant of you.

265
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,690
I have to go now, Fangyu.

266
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,700
Where is it?

267
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
It's so cold.

268
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,890
Fangning, what happened?

269
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,860
What are you looking for?

270
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,780
Well,

271
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,490
the coin.

272
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,730
You dropped the coin?

273
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,420
Stop looking.

274
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,540
No.

275
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,420
You gave it to me, so it's mine now.

276
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,900
I have to find it. Just leave me be.

277
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,170
Stop looking.

278
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,050
Let's go home.

279
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,060
If you insist,

280
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,140
I will carry you home.

281
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,700
Let's go.

282
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,250
Let's go.

283
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,690
It's okay.

284
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,300
Here.

285
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,020
Take the medicine before you go to bed.

286
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,660
Are you going to stay here

287
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,500
and watch me sleep?

288
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,820
I can't sleep when you're watching me.

289
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,890
Why did you

290
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,820
thank me?

291
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,250
Because I know

292
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,940
you did everything

293
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,740
to make me happy.

294
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,250
Do you think

295
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,220
I like acting like a fool

296
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,060
to watch you

297
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,860
ride on the merry-go-round

298
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,500
and play bumper cars with you?

299
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,450
I did all of these

300
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,260
just to make you happy!

301
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,140
Excuse me.

302
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,820
In my eye,

303
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,940
Ling Rui is this amazing.

304
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,300
What can I do

305
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,500
to make you believe me?

306
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,820
Should I sponsor more patients

307
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,020
for your sake?

308
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,930
The vegetables that you like,

309
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,570
fish, Mapo tofu.

310
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,380
And the soup that I made.

311
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,540
Lu Fangning,

312
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,290
I should thank you, too.

313
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,860
I want…

314
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,090
What do I want?

315
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,940
Get married?

316
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,050
No, wait.

317
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,970
Fall in love, get married…

318
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,850
I think we've messed up the order.

319
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,580
Then let me sort it out from the beginning.

320
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,340
Figure it out step by step.

321
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,500
Ling Rui.

322
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,250
Ling Rui?

323
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,090
Where did he go this early morning?

324
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,820
Ling Rui has been investing?

325
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,860
The profits seem great.

326
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,740
He's quite good at it.

327
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,060
At this rate,

328
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,180
he will be able to

329
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,700
pay off his debt soon, won't he?

330
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,420
You woke up.

331
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,300
Where were you?

332
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,980
We were out of milk.

333
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,130
So, I went out and bought some.

334
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,450
Are you feeling better now?

335
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,210
I'm fine now.

336
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,330
By the way,

337
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,780
are there any restaurants that you like?

338
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,020
Restaurants that I like?

339
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,260
I mean,

340
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,330
which restaurant

341
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,260
do you usually go to?

342
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,540
[What does he mean?]

343
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,420
[Doesn't he like]

344
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,460
[homemade meals?]

345
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,100
[He doesn't even want to]

346
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,220
[cook for me anymore now?]

347
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,980
Never mind. Let's talk about it another time.

348
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,700
Ling Rui, I need to use the bathroom.

349
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,100
[What does he want to say now?]

350
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,450
I think it would be better for us

351
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,420
to call off the engagement.

352
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,540
I'm willing to bear

353
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,330
all of the consequences.

354
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,780
Right now,

355
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,740
he's trying to refuse me

356
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,140
before I make any moves?

357
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,380
It's over.

358
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,380
Yesterday, I...

359
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,260
Well done.

360
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,020
You even lost the coin

361
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,730
that he gave you.

362
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,020
Lu Fangning,

363
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,740
why don't you

364
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,340
know anything about love?

365
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:57,940
No.

366
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,380
I can't sit on the problem.

367
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,940
I found it.

368
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,610
Thank you.

369
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,580
You're welcome.

370
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,700
Thank you for helping.

371
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,700
I've finally found you.

372
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,820
I had been looking for you.

373
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,380
I will never

374
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,500
lose you again.

375
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,860
I will...

376
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,370
carry you

377
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,380
with me

378
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,420
all the time.

379
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,340
You're in a good mood.

380
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,580
Fangning and you...

381
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,940
Wait, no. How are things going

382
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,700
for your friend

383
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,580
and his female friend?

384
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,060
They sorted it out.

385
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,410
Everything will start again from the beginning.

386
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,130
Hello, Ms. Lu?

387
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,660
Start again from the beginning?

388
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,850
What does he mean?

389
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,140
Going back

390
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,250
to that time

391
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,460
where we didn't know each other?

392
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,820
Not married.

393
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,330
Not in a relationship.

394
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,020
So he's trying

395
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,180
to get a divorce?

396
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,500
Ling Rui.

397
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,290
I won't let you carry out your plan.

398
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,460
Fangning,

399
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,860
let's have dinner together tonight.

400
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,460
I can't go tonight.

401
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,210
I have to work overtime.

402
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,890
Why is the water drained?

403
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,220
I have no idea either.

404
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,220
Why are you following me?

405
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,540
I have a busy day today.

406
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,580
I can't drive you to work.

407
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,380
See you.

408
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,370
You're not going to drive to work?

409
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,380
I am.

410
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,090
The parking lot is that way.

411
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,660
I left something at home.

412
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,140
I have to go now. See you.

413
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,980
I can wait for you.

414
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,740
There's no need.

415
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,380
You can go ahead. Bye.

416
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,100
I'm starving.

417
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,180
Fangning.

418
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,100
It's almost lunchtime.

419
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,100
Let's have lunch together.

420
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,660
No, thank you.

421
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,060
What about dinner then?

422
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,610
I don't want to have dinner. I'm on a diet.

423
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,540
Diet?

424
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,620
I'm not hungry.

425
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,940
Fangning!

426
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,100
I'm not hungry!

427
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:53,160
[Deer Sing Group]

428
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,100
Please give me the list.

429
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,220
Okay.

430
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,950
Director Lu, here is the list.

431
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,500
Thank you.

432
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,100
Morning, Siyu.

433
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,900
Don't blame me.

434
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,570
I didn't mean to

435
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,500
ignore you just now.

436
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,890
Actually, I meant it.

437
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,500
But it's not that

438
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
I didn't want to talk to you.

439
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,300
I just…

440
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,450
I know.

441
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,650
We should keep our relationship
a secret in the office.

442
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,460
It's better for you.

443
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,450
What about after work?

444
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,380
Sorry?

445
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,450
Are we still

446
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,980
going on a date after work?

447
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,740
Where do you want to go?

448
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,260
Anywhere you like...

449
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,380
Director Lu.

450
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:18,900
Hey.

451
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,260
You don't have to act like this.

452
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,800
I'm your director.

453
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,610
It's normal for you to talk to me.

454
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,900
Right, I can talk to you.

455
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:19,820
Hi.

456
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,699
Hi, Andy.

457
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,699
Hi, Siyu.

458
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,210
Hi, Liu.

459
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,260
Come in.

460
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,810
Director Lu, I need you to sign these files.

461
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,890
Sure.

462
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,380
Remember to have lunch.

463
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,530
Remember to drink water.

464
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,010
See you in the parking lot after work.

465
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,220
Love you.

466
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,980
Please sign here.

467
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:00,860
I've signed it.

468
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,140
Thank you.

469
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,740
Director.

470
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,420
What should we do? Lock it!

471
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,980
Do you have a safe?

472
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,620
Trash bin?

473
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,970
Wait, wait.

474
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,740
Calm down.

475
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,290
Just act normal.

476
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,570
Stand up straight.

477
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,260
Come in.

478
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
I'm here for Director Lu's signature.

479
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,380
I saw that.

480
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,730
Why did you have to tell me?

481
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,380
What's the matter?

482
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,060
It's about

483
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,020
the condition brought up

484
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,700
by Bai Jing.

485
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,380
What are you doing?

486
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,020
Did you twist your ankle?

487
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,900
No, my shoe got dirty.

488
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,450
Your sticker fell off.

489
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,850
It's just a sticker.

490
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,090
You acted like

491
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,420
it was a love letter.

492
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,020
I should go now.

493
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,700
Sorry for interrupting.

494
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,250
Are you all right, Siyu?

495
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,170
See you, Siyu.

496
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,820
Ling Rui,

497
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,500
why... why are you here?

498
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,850
I'm waiting for you to finish your work

499
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,820
so we can have dinner together.

500
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,410
I already got an appointment tonight.

501
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,700
But...

502
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,540
your secretary told me

503
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,500
you don't have
any other appointments today.

504
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,250
She knows nothing…

505
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,940
I have an appointment with my job.

506
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,570
I have a date with my work.

507
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,740
I have a lot to do.

508
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,340
Why don't you...

509
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,260
You can just go…

510
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,060
It's all right. Take your time.

511
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,460
I'll wait for you.

512
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,300
Why are you still acting sneaky?

513
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,050
I told you it's fine now.

514
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,020
I got used to it.

515
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,740
Besides, if our colleagues

516
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,740
found out about our relationship,

517
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,540
wouldn't it be bad for you?

518
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,100
Siyu,

519
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,650
you really are a good girl.

520
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,340
I think so, too.

521
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,610
Director Lu, did you just like me

522
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,580
a little more just now?

523
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,730
Where are we going next?

524
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,530
Have dinner and watch a movie.

525
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,260
That's boring.

526
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,210
Let me take you to a place.

527
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,300
You'll definitely like it.

528
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,490
Sure.

529
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,100
Buckle up.

530
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,410
♫ The rose petals have a potent fragrance ♫

531
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,980
♫ I don't mind walking on the streets alone ♫

532
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,380
Pet shops? Why did you bring me here?

533
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,570
To commemorate the moment

534
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,180
when you made my heart skipped.

535
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:34,220
♫ But who will watch them with me ♫

536
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,780
♫ Slowly, we get closer ♫

537
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:41,500
♫ I like you ♫

538
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,250
♫ Only you ♫

539
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,980
♫ You're my one and only ♫

540
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:57,700
♫ Tonight, I'll let my mind wander ♫

541
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,500
He's not going to wait here forever, is he?

542
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:12,900
Is he not leaving

543
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,380
until he achieves his goal?

544
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,540
You're done?

545
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,210
Let's go.

546
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,220
I...

547
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,140
I haven't.

548
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,900
I need to use the bathroom.

549
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,500
Okay.
