[Episode 03]

4
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,680
By the way,

5
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,080
did you put the drugs on the nightstand?

6
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:39,880
You should know

7
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,280
I made an appointment with Lu Fangning,

8
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,080
right here at the penthouse.

9
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,759
I'll grab a bottle of wine before I go up.

10
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,840
And let her have a "taste".

11
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,000
Ms. Lu.

12
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,680
Ms. Lu.

13
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,190
Are you alright?

14
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,360
Why are you here?

15
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,120
It hurts.

16
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,600
The person who can bully me

17
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,770
has not been born yet.

18
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,040
You are overconfident.

19
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,120
Even if you can solve it this time,

20
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,800
can you guarantee that

21
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,160
you can always protect yourself?

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,000
I always

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,230
protect myself.

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,320
Everything the bastard said just now

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,720
has been recorded on my phone.

26
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,530
If he dares do anything to me,

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,010
I'll make sure to sue him,

28
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,960
until he goes bankrupt and goes to jail.

29
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,950
Why did you come back all of a sudden?

30
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,000
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
You worry about me.

32
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,680
What's wrong?

33
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,720
It's just gastric pain.

34
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,110
Judging from how you look,

35
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,440
you should go to the hospital.

36
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:32,990
I'll send you.

37
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,880
It's okay.

38
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,960
I've work to do later.

39
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,880
It'll be gone in a while.

40
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,160
You're in so much pain.

41
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,040
How are you going to work?

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,800
Leave.

43
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,800
I don't need your help.

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,360
Okay.

45
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,640
You don't want my help.

46
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,440
Then, I'll call 120
and that's none of your business too.

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,800
I am not your patient.

48
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,800
I don't need you

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,640
to make decisions and arrangements for me.

50
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,280
I'm sorry

51
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,760
about what I said.

52
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,519
If you really want to help me,

53
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,800
can you

54
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,440
send me somewhere?

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,190
This is something

56
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,870
very important to me.

57
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,510
Thank you.

58
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,790
Don't eat raw or cold food.

59
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,000
I know.

60
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,590
Thanks.

61
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,320
Ms. Lu.

62
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,830
This restaurant serves good food.

63
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,240
I'm glad that you like it.

64
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,480
Next time when you're here,

65
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,600
you can look for their manager.

66
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,800
Just mention my name.

67
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,720
Okay, thank you.

68
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,130
You're welcome.

69
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,440
Is the car here?

70
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,280
The driver and the car are waiting.

71
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,440
Ms. Lu.

72
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,720
I'm so sorry

73
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,600
that I wasn't of much help.

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,800
It's okay.

75
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,760
-See you.
-Bye.

76
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,240
Goodbye.

77
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,400
-Goodbye.
-Bye, Mr. Sun.

78
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,120
He really left.

79
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,120
It hurts so bad.

80
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,870

I'll get you something to eat.

114
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,840
Don't go.

115
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,670
Also...

116
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,440
Do you want to stay the night?

117
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Stay with me.

What's going on?

119
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,800
What's going on?

120
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,580
You drank alcohol on an empty stomach.

121
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,160
Take some medicine.

122
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,640
This will more or less

123
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,350
give some side effects.

124
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,200
You'll feel better after throwing up.

125
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,520
I'll get you something to eat.

126
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,470
I've given you all my money.

127
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,360
I don't want it.

128
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,390
No.

129
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,790
I'm not.

130
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,870
No.

131
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,230
Lu Fangning.

132
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,640
Are you okay?

133
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,350
Why are you still here?

134
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,830
I cooked some porridge.

135
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,800
You haven't eaten anything.

136
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,510
Do you want to eat something?

137
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,160
It's good for you.

138
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,790
Did you clean this?

139
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,590
I'm sorry.

140
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,990
I messed up your things.

141
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,860
But, it was...

142
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,560
Porridge.

143
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,910
Do I have a pot at home?

144
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,960
It's fresh. Try it.

145
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,000
Is there anything you can't do?

146
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,390
Delicious.

147
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,590
Why are you still here?

148
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,040
Do you think

149
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,230
I look cute when I eat

150
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,470
and want to sneak a few more glances?

151
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,080
Drink your porridge quietly.

152
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,790
I listened to you,

153
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,310
and didn't eat anything raw and cold.

154
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,510
So, you only drank alcohol.

155
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,270
Lu Fangning, what do you want?

156
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,270
What do you mean

157
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,160
by sending this to me?

158
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,840
What did I do to you?

159
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,030
Make it clear.

160
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,560
I'm telling you.

161
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,040
If you dare blackmail me...

162
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,020
I sent him the recording.

163
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,630
From now on,

164
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,390
you'll never get any vote

165
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,110
from the Yang Family anymore.

166
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,040
Did you blackmail him?

167
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,020
Without the vote

168
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,510
from the Yang Family,

169
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,870
your proposal will

170
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,110
never be approved.

171
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,670
Don't stare at me like that.

172
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,360
And, me...

173
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,390
Although I really want to

174
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,550
publish the brand,

175
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,590
but I won't cooperate

176
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,750
with someone like him.

177
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,840
Bastard.

178
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,820
As you see,

179
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,430
I'm doing something

180
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,600
that is

181
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,150
very, very,

182
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,390
very important to me.

183
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,040
It's not just about work.

184
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,510
This sounds ridiculous.

185
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,990
However,

186
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,430
if I can't get married right away,

187
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,150
all my efforts now

188
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,310
will be in vain.

189
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,190
I believe you.

190
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,540
You aren't someone who gives up easily.

191
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,250
But,

192
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,359
neither am I invincible.

193
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,869
Ling Rui,

194
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,150
you are an excellent doctor.

195
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,599
But, there must be

196
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,300
patients whom you want to save

197
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,990
but are incapable of saving.

198
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,300
There are things

199
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,510
you want to do,

200
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,680
but you can't.

201
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,780
Everyone has things they want to pursue.

202
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,430
Me too.

203
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,350
There are things

204
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,390
I want to pursue and protect.

205
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,950
So, I can sacrifice everything

206
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,470
and disregard what others think of me.

207
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,190
We know

208
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,590
what we're doing,

209
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,670
and that's enough.

210
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:49,970
I'm going to

211
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,870
attend a conference call.

212
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,950
Thanks for the porridge.

213
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,360
You're welcome.

214
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,300
You haven't changed.

215
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:47,710
Morning.

216
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,290
[Debtor, One-year Term]

217
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,990
One-year term.

218
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,510
Han, Meng.

219
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,510
You've gained weight.

220
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,190
Ling Rui.

221
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,470
Good morning, uncle.

222
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,590
You're playing chess.

223
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,070
Hi.

224
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,390
Why are you here?

225
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,350
Where did you go?

226
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,110
I bought breakfast.

227
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,950
What does the card mean?

228
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,430
Isn't that clear?

229
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,950
No, it's not clear enough.

230
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,710
Businessmen like us,

231
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,340
want a clear-cut agreement.

232
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,870
Your words are too vague.

233
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,830
I don't know

234
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,950
what you actually think.

235
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,430
Well.

236
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,840
You look into my eyes now.

237
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,830
Make it clear.

238
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,190
Tell me.

239
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,270
If you feel shy to look at me,

240
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,550
Then I won't stare at you.

241
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,070
Wait a minute.

242
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,230
Can I record a video?

243
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,270
So, I can take a look

244
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,940
at your expression later.

245
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,790
Ling, are you out shopping?

246
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,190
Good morning, grandma.

247
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,790
Good morning, grandma.

248
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,940
Say it.

249
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,550
There are so many people here.

250
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,670
-Say it.
-Good morning, Ling Rui.

251
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,510
Hi, Uncle Li.

252
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,870
Stop the greetings.

253
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,710
Just a few words.

254
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,110
Is it that difficult?

255
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:32,830
If you don't say it,

256
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,230
I won't know what you're thinking.

257
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,660
Say it.

258
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,270
Will you say it or not?

259
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,550
Do you want to

260
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,350
marry me?

261
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,390
Follow me.

262
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,150
Mom, aunties,

263
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,870
she is...

264
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,830
Please allow Ling Rui

265
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,910
to sign a contract with me.

266
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,590
-Contract?
-Contract?

267
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,630
What she meant is...

268
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,510
I want him to sign

269
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,390
a contract that allows us
to keep each other company.

270
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,350
Isn't that a marriage?

271
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,630
It is a marriage.

272
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,670
A marriage?

273
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,220
Yes.

274
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,950
Excuse us. We need to discuss something.

275
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,550
I knew it was going to work.

276
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,470
Calm down.

277
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:43,910
This...

278
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,060
Why haven't I heard of it before?

279
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,070
What do you mean?

280
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,670
I think this girl is pretty good.

281
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:57,660
Sit down.

282
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,750
Just get married, then.

283
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,350
Why did you have to

284
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,150
beat around the bush?

285
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,390
Yes. Just get married.

286
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,550
Ling Rui is a great man.

287
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,230
-All of a sudden...
-Yes.

288
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,340
Ling Rui is a great man.

289
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,310
Don't worry.

290
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,590
I will definitely support him.

291
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,870
I'll raise him into a well-fed,

292
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,830
and vigorous man.

293
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,310
Think about it.

294
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,350
Ling Rui is a great man.

295
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,870
There must be a lot of people who like him,

296
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,230
and desperate to bring him home.

297
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,670
Bring him home?

298
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,230
Go home with him.

299
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,670
The market is a dangerous place

300
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,470
for a man like him.

301
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,230
So, someone like me,

302
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,140
who only has money,

303
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,390
and has to depend on him fully,

304
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,590
is the best for him.

305
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,990
Why did you say so much?

306
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,710
Don't worry.

307
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,230
She's rich.

308
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,550
But, she's too thin,

309
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,950
just like me when I was young.

310
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,900
You don't have to worry.

311
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,140
Don't be so old-fashioned.

312
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:02,830
Alright.

313
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,660
Okay.

314
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,870
I'll ask again.

315
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,590
Stay cool.

316
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,070
According to you,

317
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,470
you think Ling Rui

318
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,070
is a great guy too.

319
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,790
Of course.

320
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,660
A rare gem.

321
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,340
Young lady,

322
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,220
how long have you known each other?

323
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,430
Do you know each other enough?

324
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,190
About five days.

325
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,670
Five days?

326
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,430
This is too fast.

327
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,150
Why did you have to tell them?

328
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,710
Calm down.

329
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,590
Why is she doing this?

330
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,470
Alright.

331
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:47,340
Alright.

332
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,180
I think

333
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,070
you have to ask this question.

334
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,860
Say it well.

335
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,110
-The time you've known each other...
-Hear me out.

336
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,790
That's true.

337
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,180
Five days

338
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,670
are already worth celebrating.

339
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,430
Lady, what's your name?

340
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,430
I forgot to ask.

341
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,270
Sorry.

342
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,090
I forgot to introduce myself.

343
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,710
My name is Lu Fangning.

344
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,830
Lu Fangning?

345
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,710
What are you doing?

346
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,870
How can you be Lu Fangning?

347
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,150
Yes, I am the one

348
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,950
who grew up with a silver spoon in my mouth.

349
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,220
Currently,

350
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,190
I serve as the general manager
of LM Deer Sing Group.

351
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,550
I'm in charge of the company as a whole.

352
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,990
Of course, in the near future,

353
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,530
the entire group will be mine.

354
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,590
Coincidentally, this cabinet

355
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,550
is a product of

356
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,910
our LM Deer Sing Group.

357
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,030
You can go have your discussion now.

358
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,590
We're not discussing anymore.

359
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,590
You are rich, right?

360
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,510
Then...

361
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,870
-Do you have four million?
-Of course.

362
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:11,970
Ling Rui,

363
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,950
come with me.

364
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,430
Okay.

365
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:26,990
Mom.

366
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,910
Mom.

367
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,270
Stop.

368
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,390
Don't talk to me first.

369
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,140
I'll search for it.

370
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,590
I'll read it to you.

371
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,190
Selling yourself off for money.

372
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,750
Let me read to you

373
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,020
what are the consequences.

374
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,670
Mom.

375
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,490
It's illegal to sell myself off.

376
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,030
You know you are breaking the law,

377
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,870
and you still go to her.

378
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,980
Mom.

379
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,030
I know what a marriage is.

380
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,570
Then, you're saying that

381
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,060
I don't know what a marriage is.

382
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,110
You've known each other only for a few days.

383
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,260
And, you're talking about getting married.

384
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,830
Is this a movie?

385
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,150
Mom.

386
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,550
Save it.

387
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,830
Don't speak nonsense.

388
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,990
Dare you say that

389
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,590
you love Ms. Lu?

390
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,350
Will you spend your time with her forever?

391
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,500
Tell me.

392
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,750
I...

393
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,150
I...

394
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,790
I'll immediately mortgage this house.

395
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,510
Mom.

396
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,310
Listen to me.

397
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,270
For you,

398
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,310
our marriage

399
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,710
might be a hasty decision.

400
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,710
But, for us,

401
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,410
this is the best time.

402
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,740
You only met a few days ago.

403
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,270
It's short,

404
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,590
but it doesn't mean our marriage
will not last.

405
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,430
Am I right?

406
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,670
Five days

407
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,430
are enough for me to know her.

408
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,170
In fact,

409
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,990
we have known each other for a long time.

410
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,430
A long time?

411
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,390
Yes, a long time.

412
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,570
Only, she doesn't know it.

413
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,310
If you really want to

414
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,630
consider how long we've met.

415
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:08,980
Mom.

416
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,230
Your grandson would've
gone to the elementary school already.

417
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,470
That's enough.

418
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,670
Are you kidding?

419
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,350
I'm not.

420
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,690
Listen.

421
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,300
Say it.

422
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,310
I'm no longer a kid.

423
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,990
I know

424
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,630
many things

425
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,510
can be traded with money.

426
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:36,990
But, I think

427
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,580
the feelings between two people

428
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,790
can never be traded.

429
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,750
For now,

430
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,790
she is almost a stranger to me.

431
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,750
But, I want to spend more time

432
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,830
learning about her.

433
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,060
You want to know more about her?

434
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,470
Silly boy,

435
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,820
isn't this love?

436
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,990
Why were you

437
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,540
too embarrassed to say it?

438
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,190
If you've said it earlier...

439
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:04,990
Mom...

440
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,150
Will mom disapprove of you?

441
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,710
Mom.

442
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,650
You're right.

443
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,950
I know you're reluctant to let me go.

444
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,210
But, please believe me.

445
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,270
I'm willing

446
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,370
to marry her.

447
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,260
It's by will?

448
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,710
I swear.

449
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,540
I want to marry her

450
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,630
by my own will.

451
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,630
-You even dare to swear?
-It hurts.

452
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,980
Do you want to

453
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,230
move into her house immediately,

454
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,830
and take her last name?

455
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,270
The next time I see you,

456
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,590
I'll call you Mr. Lu.

457
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,540
Is it? Is it?

458
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,910
-Heartless brat.
-Mom, it hurts.

459
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,630
You're heartless.

460
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,500
Mom.

461
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,350
Silly boy.

462
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,430
Did you eat well?

463
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,170
Yes.

464
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,020
I haven't felt this way for a long time.

465
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,980
Don't you usually eat breakfast?

466
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,220
I only have a cup of coffee.

467
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,110
You should eat breakfast
if your stomach is not good,

468
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,700
not just a cup of coffee.

469
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:17,980
Yes.

470
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,350
The agreement between us

471
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,230
is progressing smoothly.

472
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,270
I am very happy.

473
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,970
What about your family?

474
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,590
I will notify them.

475
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,940
Before we sign the agreement,

476
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,230
I still have something to do.

477
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,710
I will also notify you then.

478
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,710
Anyway, after today,

479
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,300
I've become confident

480
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,230
to meet others' parents.

481
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,540
How about this?

482
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,860
I'll drop you at the hospital.

483
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,430
You go and change now.

484
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,100
I'll wait for you here.

485
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,610
It's okay.

486
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,340
Your car is too conspicuous.

487
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,810
We can't drive this to the hospital.

488
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,990
I'll go back first.

489
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:55,950
Wait.

490
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,660
What are you doing?

491
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,470
We have to get used to

492
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,270
intimate acts like this.

493
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,580
Just stay for three seconds.

494
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,060
One.

495
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,220
Two.

496
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,580
Two!

497
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:20,470
Three.

498
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,260
Alright.

499
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,780
-I'll go now.
-Off you go.

500
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,590
-Good morning, boss.
-Morning.

501
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,140
If there's a douche with the last name Yang

502
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,910
come looking for me today,

503
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,590
regardless of age,

504
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,060
I'm neither meeting them,
nor picking up their calls.

505
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,030
Okay.

506
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:45,910
Also,

507
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,150
inform Lu Fangyu that

508
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,820
I'll get him a new credit card.

509
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,590
Thank you, boss.

510
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,310
Why did you thank me?

511
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,260
Yes,

512
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
why am I doing that?

513
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,910
I like the scent

514
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,620
of your hairspray today.

515
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,420
There's even a heart-shaped fringe.

516
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,350
Good job. Keep it up.

517
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,230
Thanks, boss.

518
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,150
Boss, what do you think

519
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:16,750
about my seasonal award?

520
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,460
Get lost.

521
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:18,940
Okay.

522
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,060
I'm looking for Fangning.

523
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,430
No, Mr. Yang.

524
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,060
Please wait.

525
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,870
-Fangning.
-Mr. Yang.

526
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,420
-Fangning.
-Mr. Yang.

527
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,290
Fangning.

528
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,420
Ms. Lu, he...

529
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,230
What's up?

530
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,150
Mr. Yang is here.

531
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,390
Why didn't you inform me in advance?

532
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,220
Huh?

533
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,310
Have you served him coffee?

534
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,220
Not yet, right?

535
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,590
Look at you.

536
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,380
I'll deduct your bonus for the month.

537
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,310
You can leave now.

538
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,930
Yes.

539
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,660
Have a seat.

540
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,580
I wonder

541
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,630
why Mr. Yang is here.

542
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,010
Let Yang Ming off.

543
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,030
During the next board meeting

544
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,820
I'll vote in favor of you.

545
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,900
Mr. Yang

546
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,670
really gives me no surprise.

547
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,260
Since Mr. Yang

548
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,500
is being so straightforward,

549
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,070
what about this?

550
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,260
Ask your son

551
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,020
to apologize to me in the newspaper,

552
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,450
and swear not to

553
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,380
do anything inappropriate

554
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,810
to any other lady.

555
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,990
Then, surrender himself to the police.

556
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,310
If you ruin him,

557
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,940
you'll ruin your own reputation too.

558
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,020
I did nothing wrong.

559
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,870
Why will my reputation be ruined?

560
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,980
Moreover,

561
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,050
he did something wrong,

562
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,390
so he has to bear the consequences.

563
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,150
Why? He is afraid to admit what he has done?

564
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,130
You're too young.

565
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,270
You don't understand

566
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,580
what this impact does to a girl.

567
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,190
Uncle Yang wants to

568
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,900
keep things low,

569
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,940
because I'm being considerate to you.

570
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,260
Where's your father?

571
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,170
I've known him for so long.

572
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,510
I'll talk to him.

573
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,830
Hi, Chairman Lu.

574
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,220
About Yang Ming...

575
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,570
We'll sue him. We have to.

576
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,180
Send him to prison.

577
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,450
Mr. Yang,

578
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,380
why are you here?

579
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,100
Lu,

580
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,230
it was just an accident.

581
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,070
A rare incident.

582
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,110
Can you save me some face

583
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,860
on this matter?

584
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,030
Forget it for just once.

585
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,980
I promise

586
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,020
I'll teach my son

587
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,500
a proper lesson.

588
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,030
You want to teach him a lesson?

589
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,510
I think that's not necessary.

590
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,150
Someone else will teach him a lesson.

591
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,740
Don't you know

592
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,610
what's wrong with Yang Ming?

593
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,990
He repeatedly harasses ladies.

594
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,670
He is not the first offender.

595
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,660
This time,

596
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,540
he even laid his hands on Fangning.

597
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,140
Is he tired of living?

598
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,590
He doesn't want to live anymore, right?

599
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,030
If you think Fangning is being merciless,

600
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,710
why haven't you broken his legs?

601
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,230
-Lu, you...
-I'm telling you.

602
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,230
This time,

603
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,430
you'll pay for the litigation fees
and attorney fees.

604
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,900
How dare he get upset?

605
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,830
Let me tell you.

606
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,650
He set a bad example for his son.

607
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,739
That's right.

608
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,219
I have a very good example to look up to.

609
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,860
Regarding this,

610
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,100
you have to

611
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,820
reflect too.

612
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,020
You are also responsible for this too.

613
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,310
I'm leaving if there's nothing else.

614
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,820
By the way, Chairman Lu.

615
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:21,940
Let me give you a heads up.

616
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,100
I'm getting married.

617
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:23,780
Do it.

618
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,460
Who is getting married?

619
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,570
Me.

620
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,940
You?

621
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,620
Me.

622
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:34,739
Getting married.

623
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,780
Why are you getting married?

624
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,460
Who told you to get married?

625
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,650
-You wanted me to get married.
-I...

626
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,940
No, but...

627
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,310
Okay. I won't ask much.

628
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,130
Just this one question.

629
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,469
Who's the guy?

630
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,139
What's his name? What does he do?

631
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:53,940
How's his academic background?

632
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,739
Where does he work?

633
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,340
Don't worry.

634
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,100
-He is very handsome.
-But, his parents...

635
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,700
What do his parents do?

636
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,190
He's tall.

637
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,100
-His family background.
-Most importantly,

638
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,380
he is a vigorous man.

639
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,020
Vigorous.

640
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,870
Why don't you

641
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,260
marry a weightlifter?

642
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,230
Vigorous.

644
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,300
Then,

645
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,420
invite him and his parents

646
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,780
to our place.

00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,620
talk to his parents.

How about that?

As soon as possible.

we still need to follow up
with his treatment.

656
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,500
Then, I'll make a plan
with the internal medicine,

657
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,540
and show it to you later.

00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:32,980
Off you go.

698
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,660
Why is this on the checklist?

699
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,020
This is a must in a premarital screening.

700
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,150
There are many items on the checklist

701
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,460
which are not necessary
for a premarital screening.

702
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,780
This is only

703
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,890
for our future happiness.

704
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,380
I am so busy with my job.

705
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,660
I don't have time to go through this.

706
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,810
Moreover,

707
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,060
you should be considerate of me.

708
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,780
I have OCD.

709
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,820
A severe relationship OCD.

710
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,830
Therefore, I need to make sure

711
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,700
the man who's going to

712
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,940
spend days and nights with me

713
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,530
is healthy and clean.

714
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,900
It's for the sake of both of us.

715
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,060
Besides, you're a doctor.

716
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,570
Why is a doctor afraid of a screening?

717
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,500
I'm not going to watch.

718
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,870
Did you stay up for the past two nights?

719
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,220
Let me tell you.

720
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,130
It's better not to stay up

721
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,620
three to five days before the screening.

722
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,990
It'll affect the results.

723
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,900
Madam.

724
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,710
My husband is in there.

725
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,620
Don't worry.

726
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,700
This screening is not that difficult

727
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,580
for the men.

728
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,020
You look quite professional.

729
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,580
I've seen a lot of people like them.

730
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,820
You are worried about your husband's

731
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,790
physical ability, right?

732
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,900
Does he usually stay up late?

733
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,820
Does he smoke and drink?

734
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,220
All of this will affect him.

735
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,060
What's the better way to do it?

736
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,060
Maintain good habits.

737
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,740
Exercise more.

738
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,510
Eat more food

739
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,820
containing vitamins.

740
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,030
Vitamins

741
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,070
are very important for men.

742
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,490
Thanks. Anything else?

743
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,870
Let's go to the next station.

744
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,620
Your husband looks healthy.

745
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,660
Don't worry, he will be fine.

746
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,540
Thanks.

747
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,380
If you are too busy,

748
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,250
you don't have to stay with me.

749
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,990
No. I'm not that busy.

750
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,340
That...

751
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:52,940
You're done?

752
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,220
Really?

753
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,580
So quick?

754
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,940
Are you sure you're done with the screening?

755
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,620
I'm also a doctor.

756
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,060
If you have any question

757
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,580
in the future,

758
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,740
you can ask me.

759
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,340
Is there anything I need to pay attention to

760
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,700
during tomorrow's meeting?

761
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,090
Nothing much.

762
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,700
Our marriage has nothing to do with them.

763
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,020
Is he nervous?

764
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,140
I assume

765
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,340
there will be three people there tomorrow.

766
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,330
You don't have to know anything
about Lu Wenbin.

767
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,370
Even if you know him well,

768
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,380
it won't help with the situation.

769
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,380
Whatever he says

770
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,460
will not sound good.

771
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,410
Yang Yi.

772
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,890
Lu Wenbin's wife.

773
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,260
The only thing on her mind

774
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,980
is how to get the inheritance from me.

775
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,180
It's been so many years.

776
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,580
She

777
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,420
still has not succeeded.

778
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,340
Lu Fangyu.

779
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,340
Yang Yi's son.

780
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,220
He fears me terribly.

781
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,260
I guess he'll only be eating tomorrow.

782
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,340
That's all.

783
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,020
My little aunt

784
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,100
has not told anyone

785
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,620
that you are our creditor.

786
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,370
Then, your brother...

787
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,700
He dares not.

788
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,380
Don't worry. I'm here.

789
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,740
Drive safe.
