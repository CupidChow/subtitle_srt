00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,600
My waist...

5
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,180
What is your next plan?

6
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,700
You look like you're about to die.

7
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,300
Old man, stop following me.

8
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,300
Go back and rest.

9
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,979
Who says I'm about to die?

10
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,800
You can't keep up with us youngsters' pace.

11
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:54,660
Cai Siyu.

12
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,460
I'll tell you again.

13
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,140
I am not old.

14
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,300
If you don't believe me, try me.

15
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,620
My next activity

16
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,580
is not for you.

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,540
What activity is not suitable for me?

18
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,940
Dad.

19
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,660
Love you!

20
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,760
Hey, Siyu.

21
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,860
Hey, Tang Ping.

22
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,780
Let's come out and eat.

23
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,390
Hello?

24
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,860
Ling Rui knows about Youyou's existence.

25
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,300
Ling Rui knows about Youyou's existence?

26
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,700
Ling Rui knows about Youyou's existence?

27
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,110
Ling Rui knows about Youyou's existence?

28
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,460
Who?

29
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,670
Youyou?

30
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,190
Why does it sound like a child's name?

31
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,100
Fangning.

32
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,270
Fangning...

33
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,950
Get out of the way.

34
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,500
Did you come back

35
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,420
together with Dr. Ling's son?

36
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,740
You kept this from him for six years?

37
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:21,910
Yeah...

38
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,820
You're like the ex-wife who's back with their kid to look for trouble.

39
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,260
Lu Fangning...

40
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,470
You're more dramatic than I thought.

41
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,310
Cai Siyu.

42
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,579
Hey, Fangning...

43
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,500
Who...

44
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,180
You go.

45
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,870
Go!

46
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,740
Fangning.

47
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,460
Step aside.

48
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,700
Are you okay?

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,380
You have to take good care of your back.

50
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,980
Did you have a baby with another man

51
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,620
while you were abroad?

52
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,340
You're awesome!

53
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,500
Is he mixed?

54
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,810
Mixed-race kids are so pretty!

55
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,180
Another man?

56
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,070
Yeah.

57
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,220
Or else, why did you

58
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,100
keep it from Dr. Ling?

59
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,110
Do you think I'm stupid?

60
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,520
It's not that I think that you're stupid,

61
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,430
Tang Pingping, you are stupid.

62
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,980
What did I do wrong?

63
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,990
Pingping.

64
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,670
Come here.

65
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,710
Move aside.

66
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,420
Fangning, I know

67
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,900
you have your reasons.

68
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,580
You had no choice but to run away, divorce,

69
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,190
and keep everything from Dr. Ling, am I right?

70
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,659
Thank you, Uncle Tang.

71
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,470
Fangning.

72
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,420
How are you doing? How's your health?

73
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,510
Do you want me to introduce you

74
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,700
to a better doctor?

75
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,550
It's alright.

76
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,790
This too shall pass.

77
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,420
How much does it cost to see a doctor? I'll pay for you.

78
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,740
I can at least help with

79
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,340
this kind of small matter.

80
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,880
Fangning, what's wrong with you?

81
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,060
To think that

82
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,030
your Uncle Lu

83
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,180
only has this one daughter...

84
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,220
And now, she's...

85
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,140
My heart really...

86
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,900
Lu Fangning...

87
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,910
Don't tell me you're terminally ill?

88
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,159
Are you dying?

89
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,860
-Dad, please save her!
-Shut up!

90
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,580
What terminal illness?

91
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,540
Stop talking nonsense!

92
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,180
Fangning.

93
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,350
I know that you're a stubborn person.

94
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,900
If it wasn't for this,

95
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,550
you wouldn't have disappeared just like that.

96
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,190
Yes.

97
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,260
Dad.

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,870
But she even gave birth to a baby.

99
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,320
Can her body take it?

100
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,870
You're terminally ill?

101
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,870
Why did you

102
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,460
keep such a huge matter from us?

103
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,030
That's it. That's enough!

104
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,510
Enough!

105
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,820
Be quiet!

106
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,580
Youyou is sleeping in the room.

107
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,270
What if the kid hears all of this?

108
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,070
Fangning, you're at the wrong this time around.

109
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,190
It's not fair to

110
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,360
Ling Rui and Youyou.

111
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,020
Exactly. Are you stupid?

112
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,940
No, you're not stupid, you're just looking for trouble.

113
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,580
Yup.

114
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,880
You disappeared right after going bankrupt

115
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,620
and what else did you do?

116
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,990
Sacrificing for love silently.

117
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,670
What kind of old cliche is this?

118
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,510
Did you want to

119
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,190
chase a good husband like Dr. Ling away that much?

120
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,180
Exactly.

121
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,470
I always thought you were smarter than me.

122
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,870
Who knew you'd be like this?

123
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,159
Dad.

124
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,070
You can stop comparing us anymore.

125
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,260
We're of different levels.

126
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,580
Indeed you are.

127
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,470
Yup.

128
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,830
Fangning.

129
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,310
This matter

130
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,510
was a big blow to

131
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,500
Dr. Ling.

132
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,909
It's hard to make up

133
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,220
for the lost affection.

134
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,960
You're right.

135
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,390
Dr. Ling is such a good person.

136
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,430
How could you...

137
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,470
Why is it you again?

138
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,750
If you guys want to start

139
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,230
another round of attack,

140
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,940
it should begin from Simon.

141
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,110
Can't I cut the line?

142
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,300
If I knew you would abandon Dr. Ling,

143
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,110
you should have just given him to me.

144
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,340
To you?

145
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,910
Who are you glaring at?

146
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,070
You did this to yourself.

147
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,980
Yeah. You totally asked for this.

148
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,990
Where can you find

149
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,190
such a good husband like Dr. Ling?

150
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,870
Where can you find one?

151
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,270
And you kept

152
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,260
such a huge secret from us.

153
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,860
You kept it from us.

154
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,390
Do you even

155
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,540
see us as your good friends?

156
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,020
Enough, you two...

157
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,140
Why are you scolding my mom?

158
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,060
This... This child...

159
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,350
Why are you scolding my mom?

160
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,500
Baby, we were chatting.

161
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,110
We were just a bit loud.

162
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,540
They scolded you.

163
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,340
I heard them.

164
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,720
This is you and Dr. Ling's son?

165
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,900
So cute!

166
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,510
What a little angel!

167
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,630
Me first.

168
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,030
Me too, little angel.

169
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,710
Will you give auntie a kiss?

170
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,470
Pingping.

171
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,350
You should let me have

172
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,390
a cute grandson like this too.

173
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,710
I want him. I want him.

174
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,150
Enough.

175
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,390

Is Miss Pingping beautiful?

351
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,069
Yes!

352
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,680
Good. Three, two, one.

353
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,790
One more!

354
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,280
Another pose.

355
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,920
One more!

356
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,070
Now, the finger heart!

357
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,030
Okay. Really pretty.

358
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,910
All done. Let's start then.

359
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,520
Come.

360
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,870
You're welcome.

361
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,880
Miss Pingping.

362
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,920
Can I take a photo

363
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,520
with you alone?

364
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,200
Come.

365
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,320
Three, two, one.

366
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,470
Okay.

367
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,000
Thank you, Miss Pingping.

368
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,150
-We will always support you.
-Yup.

369
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,870
Let's do our best. Thank you.

370
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,240
The president said

371
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,280
we must have breakfast with you

372
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,600
because breakfast is cheap.

373
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,400
Then, we can

374
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,720
help you save money.

375
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,240
Having breakfast is pretty good.

376
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,350
It's just that

377
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,130
it's a bit hard to wake up for it.

378
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,080
Exactly. I couldn't wake up too.

379
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,160
It's all the president's fault

380
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,070
for coming up with this bad idea.

381
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,080
It's okay.

382
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,760
It's my treat today.

383
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,800
You guys enjoy the meal.

384
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,190
Have whatever you want.

385
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,530
Thank you, Miss Pingping!

386
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,230
Let's have a toast.

387
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,880
Let's raise our glasses and make a toast

388
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,640
to Miss Pingping!

389
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,680
-Okay?
-Yes!

390
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,760
Thank you, Miss Pingping.

391
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,200
Cheers!

392
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,720
Alright.

393
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,680
Delicious!

394
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,870
Really good.

395
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,070
By the way,

396
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,240
is 120 not here today?

397
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,050
I didn't see him.
-Didn't see him.

398
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,830
He's not here again?

399
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,320
Think about it. This president is the one

400
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,270
who comes up with all the ideas all the time.

401
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,400
But he's also the one

402
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,480
who's always absent.

403
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,760
He's absent because he's busy

404
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,510
with work again today.

405
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,030
Have you met the president before?

406
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,440
Ever since I joined the fan club,

407
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,550
I've never once met the president.

408
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,280
I don't even know if the president is a male or female.

409
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,670
I've never met the president either.

410
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,400
Do you think that

411
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,590
this president

412
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,230
is hiding a secret?

413
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,750
Is it because he looks really...

414
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,080
Don't say things like that.

415
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,480
It's not good to talk behind someone's back.

416
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,870
Okay.

417
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,040
Whether he looks good or not,

418
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,790
he is still my first fan.

419
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,430
To me,

420
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,510
he's very precious.

421
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,480
So, even if he looks very ugly,

422
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,280
I won't mind it.

423
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,080
Alright.

424
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,840
Let's start eating.

425
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,550
-Okay.
-Okay.

426
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,390
Let's start.

427
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,240
This one...

428
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,750
This looks so pretty.

429
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,920
This is so...

430
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,040
Hello.

431
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,190
You came!

432
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,880
This is my friend.

433
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,840
He's Peng Bo.

434
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,560
He is my father's personal physician.

435
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,110
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

436
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,960
So, I specifically invited him over to have a meal

437
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,240
Do you guys mind?

438
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,920
We don't mind.

439
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,590
That's great.

440
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,360
Welcome.

441
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,240
[So this is how everyone looks like.]

442
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,120
Peng Bo.

443
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,320
[This person bashed me in the chat group before.]

444
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,110
[This one.]

445
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,550
[He replies the slowest whenever]

446
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,250
[we assign ranking tasks.]

447
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,600
[And you...]

448
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,600
Peng Bo.

449
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,960
Miss Pingping.

450
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,930
Why are you calling me that?

451
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,560
Only my fans

452
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,550
call me that.

453
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,120
You don't have to.

454
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,720
[I want to call you that too.]

455
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,430
Okay. You can go ahead.

456
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,560
Welcome!

457
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,520
Come. Have a seat.

458
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,670
Have a seat.

459
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,680
Miss Pingping, let's eat.

460
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,520
Let's eat.

461
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,390
Peng Bo, I'll leave you on your own.

462
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,160
You can eat yourself.

463
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,880
Try this.

464
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,950
You've worked hard.

465
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,790
Thank you!

466
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,430
It's nothing.

467
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,510
[I want it too.]

468
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,920
-Thank you.
-Hurry and eat.

469
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,470
I think this must be delicious.

470
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,310
Do you know why?

471
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,920
Why?

472
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,440
Because

473
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,360
Miss Pingping

474
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,360
gave this to me.

475
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,240
I'll taste it first.

476
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:49,920
How is it?

477
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,600
Delicious!

478
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,910
It's really good!

479
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,520
[The patient of Bed 21 vomited.]

480
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,920
[I'm on leave today.]

481
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,520
[Is it your first time seeing]

482
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,590
[patients vomiting after having anesthesia?]

483
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,760
[Look for a nurse at the nurse counter.]

484
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,280
[Mengmeng is on duty today.]

485
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,320
[She's ignoring me.]

486
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,480
[Dr. Peng, she's breaking up with me.]

487
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,400
[So, this is the main point?]

488
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,400
[Dr. Peng.]

489
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,280
[You finally got it right.]

490
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,840
[Help me.]

491
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,680
[I gave everyone]

492
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,880
[a piece of toast.]

493
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,240
[This piece is yours.]

494
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,830
[I don't know]

495
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,800
[what flavors you like,]

496
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,280
[so I took a bit of everything.]

497
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,400
[Hope to see you next time.]

498
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,560
[Why are you ignoring me?]

499
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,680
[Are you having constipation?]

500
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,910
[Even you're leaving me.]

501
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,850
[I'm such a poor thing.]

502
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,160
[Bed 21 is fine.]

503
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
[Don't be too worried.]

504
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,240
[Mengmeng is still ignoring me.]

505
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,640
[Okay?]

506
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,920
[I'll tell Ling Rui]

507
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,080
[that your brain is constipated.]

508
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,190
[Ling Rui?]

509
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,050
Goodbye.

510
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,040
Remember to take your phones.

511
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,730
Your phones.

512
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,040
Goodbye.

513
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,800
Okay.

514
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,120
Goodbye.

515
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,320
Goodbye, Miss Pingping.

516
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,730
Goodbye.

517
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:10,970
Goodbye.

Goodbye, Miss Pingping.

-Goodbye, Miss Pingping.

to see him every day.

698
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,890
You would eventually lose

699
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,690
your love for him.

700
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:37,490
How about

701
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,840
you two meet more often?

702
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:40,970
Meet each other more.

703
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,930
Meet each other a lot.

704
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,290
One week each month.

705
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,250
Half a month.

706
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,490
Meet three-quarters of a month.

707
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,760
How about that?

708
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,450
Don't you have to

709
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,570
go back abroad very soon?

710
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,450
I won't go back.

711
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,090
I'll take root in my motherland and serve my country.

712
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,850
We don't live together.

713
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,210
My mother

714
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,650
and aunts are also old now.

715
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,730
It's inconvenient for them to move around.

716
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:07,970
I...

717
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,730
I'll deliver him to your doorstep.

718
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,409
I'll deliver Lu Youyou to your doorstep.

719
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,090
I'll personally

720
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,489
pack and deliver Lu Youyou to your doorstep.

721
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,330
Ling Rui.

722
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,650
Think about it.

723
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,330
Think carefully about it.

724
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,210
We really can't bring this to court.

725
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,969
Parents going against each other in a lawsuit

726
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,449
will only bring a negative impact

727
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,520
to our child's growth

728
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,889
and also his future.

729
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,770
I'll wait for you at home.

730
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,420
If you have nothing important to say, you can leave.

731
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,330
Peng Bo, my friend.

732
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,650
Where's your phone?

733
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,170
Who is this romantic person?

734
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,050
Which century are you living in?

735
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,210
You're still using

736
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,610
such an ancient tool of communication.

737
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,850
Oh my goodness.

738
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:25,540
Have a look.

739
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,290
Open it.

740
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,490
Yang, let me tell you.

741
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,700
I've understood the confusion

742
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:29,970
that you told me about last time.

743
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:30,380
Okay.

744
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,570
So?

745
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,970
So I made an arrangement.

746
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,210
From today onwards,

747
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,770
you and Nurse Liu Mengmeng's shifts

748
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,980
are all separated.

749
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,370
In our department,

750
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,610
either you or she will be here at a time.

751
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,540
Never together.

752
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,010
Dr. Peng.

753
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:47,930
I give you three seconds

754
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,070
to get out of my sight.

755
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,010
If you don't leave,

756
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,010
-I'll tell her that -Understand!

757
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:51,810
Everything

758
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,210
was just a scheme that you begged me

759
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,410
to separate her from you.

760
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,790
[To, Peng Bo. Contains bombs.]

761
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,700
[Your phone is with me.]

762
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,890
[But I don't know the password.]

763
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,050
[But I can try.]

764
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,410
[My birthday.]

765
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,450
[The day I acted for the first time.]

766
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,130
[The number of views]

767
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:18,850
[of my first drama.]

768
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,210
[After trying them all out,]

769
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,660
[I'll go through all your contacts]

770
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,850
[and tell them]

771
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,180
[that you are my 120.]

772
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,290
[You know how to contact me.]

773
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,570
How am I supposed to contact you?

774
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,970
All the numbers are on my phone.

775
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,170
[Tell him that his dad is a bastard]

776
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,530
[and he must choose mommy.]

777
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,010
[No, I can't.]

778
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,890
[I can't bring this]

779
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,090
[to the child.]

780
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,950
[Or I can just]

781
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,090
[send Lu Youyou back abroad]

782
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,610
[and get the old man to hide him.]

783
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,740
[No, I can't.]

784
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,180
[I can't do this kind of thing anymore.]

785
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,010
[In that case, I can only...]

786
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,170
Mom, I'm so handsome.

787
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,450
Are you mesmerized by me?

788
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,230
Baby.

789
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,570
What happened?

790
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,010
I'll have to ask you

791
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,090
to bear a short while for mommy.

792
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,810
I need your help to show

793
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,750
how great mommy is.

794
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,250
Mom, what are you talking about?

795
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,090
Youyou.

796
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,090
Do you want to know

797
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,900
how to please the three grandmas?

798
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,530
Yes!

799
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,450
Then, let me tell you.

800
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,450
Just show them

801
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,530
what a true devil you are.

802
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,670
Cry and throw tantrums.

803
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,850
No matter what they ask you to do,

804
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,730
you have to say 'no, no, no.'

805
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,250
No one would like

806
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,650
such a child.

807
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,330
This is what you don't understand.

808
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:50,910
Let me tell you.

809
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,770
You haven't been back for too long.

810
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,690
It is the difference

811
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,020
between Chinese and Western culture.

812
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,290
You always liked watching the news, don't you?

813
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,490
The grandmas here

814
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,130
love kids who cry, throw tantrums,

815
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,740
who are lively and rebellious.

816
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,830
This can stimulate

817
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,210
their motherly love.

818
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:03,900
Look.

819
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,970
You met Auntie Tang Ping before, didn't you?

820
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,530
Wasn't she just stupid and loud?

821
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,140
Am I right?

822
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,490
But doesn't mom still

823
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,290
accept,

824
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,770
tolerate and love her?

825
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,410
We have to allow everyone

826
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,860
to have different preferences.

827
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,890
Okay?

828
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,530
Okay!

829
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,540
Not okay...

830
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,660
Okay...

831
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,250
Not okay...

832
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,860
Are you okay with it or not?

833
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,370
Are you fooling me around?

834
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,530
I guess it really isn't okay.

835
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,570
How about we both take a step back?

836
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,540
Let's compromise.

837
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,420
Just promise me

838
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,130
that you'll do three things.

839
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
Three things?

840
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,660
Seventy thousand.

841
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:45,890
Pass.

842
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,770
Pass?

843
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,100
Hurry, your turn.

844
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,490
Forty thousand.

845
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,730
I won!

846
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,370
-Be gentle.
-I...

847
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,140
Sorry. Sorry.

848
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,290
I was just excited.

849
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,050
Did you forget that I have pharyngitis?

850
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,650
-I can't eat chili.
-I don't care.

851
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,620
Why didn't you say anything

852
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,460
when you forced me to eat it just now?

853
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,690
I can't eat it.

854
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,340
I'm still coughing.

855
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,060
I don't care. You have to eat it.

856
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,210
Not too much.

857
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,010
Ling Rui!

858
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,490
Yes.

859
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,630
They're bullying me.

860
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,700
Go and pour me a glass of water.

861
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,010
They're getting me to eat chili.

862
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,050
-Okay.
-Pour me a glass of water.

863
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,930
So much chili!

864
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,300
I'm coming.

865
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:13,700
How am I supposed to eat them?

866
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,010
I'll be coughing mad eating these.

867
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,020
Hurry and eat them.

868
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,230
I want to witness

869
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,370
this historical moment.

870
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,890
Hurry and get me some water.

871
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,060
Water is coming.

872
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,860
Sister-in-law.

873
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,910
-I'm not eating them.
-Hurry up.

874
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,540
No can do.

875
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,010
I'm not eating.

876
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,090
I need to drink water.

877
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,130
If you keep acting like this,

878
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,780
then we'll...

879
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,260
We'll draw your face.

880
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,860
I'll draw for you.

881
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,380
You owe me one.

882
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,970
Can I owe it?

883
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,010
You two are so shameless.

884
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,090
Next time, let's not

885
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,330
do eat chili then.

886
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,650
Keep your voice down.

887
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,450
Who is it?

888
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:41,890
I'll get it.

889
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,740
Come.

890
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,380
One more round.

891
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,490
Dad!

892
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,310
-What's wrong with you two?
-Youyou.

893
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,630
Where's your mom?

894
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,740
Why didn't she come?

895
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,020
Didn't she say home delivery?

896
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,060
Mom sent me here.

897
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,670
There's a kid.

898
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,290
-Then, she left.
-Who is he?

899
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:01,690
Who came?

900
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,730
We already know each other so well.

901
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,300
We don't need her introduction.

902
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,530
Good boy.

903
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,410
Go in.

904
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,430
Who is this?

905
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,290
A little baby.

906
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,970
This is actually...

907
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,700
[First thing.]

908
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,170
Scream as soon as you enter the house.

909
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,140
What happened?

910
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,980
What's wrong？

911
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,490
Are you sick?

912
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,540
[Mom only asked me to scream.]

913
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,420
[She never set the reason as to why I scream.]

914
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,260
How beautiful!

915
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,850
Youyou saw this house

916
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,020
and the three grandmas.

917
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,770
I think you are all so beautiful!

918
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:47,990
So good with his words.

919
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,100
This kid.

920
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,340
Are you auntie?

921
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,820
You're so young.

922
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,010
I should call you Sis.

923
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,450
Sis!

924
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,020
Then, you two must be Grannies,

925
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,570
am I right?

926
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,110
Yes, we are.

927
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,420
You're so beautiful too!

928
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,170
Thank you.

929
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,050
I just

930
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,030
got my hair done two days ago.

931
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,510
Of course, I'm pretty.

932
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,070
This child sure has an eye for beauty.

933
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,220
It's really rare.

934
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,270
He's so cute.
-This is...

935
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,820
So cute.

936
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,860
So cute.

937
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,900
I want to keep him home.

938
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,610
Where did you get this baby?

939
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,020
-Big sister!
-How about you sit here?

940
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,220
So cute.

941
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,090
How come he looks kind of familiar?

942
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,470
Look at all the kids.

943
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,610
Aren't they all the same?

944
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,620
It's still very rare

945
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,870
to see such a cute child.

946
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,020
[Second thing.]

947
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,210
"Upside down".

948
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,300
After entering the house,

949
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,780
create a mess and turn the house upside down.

950
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,460
Okay?

951
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,340
It's not good

952
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,420
to touch other people's stuff

953
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,730
when you're in their house.

954
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,700
You're right.

955
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,020
Then, you can try to hold it in first.

956
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,980
Go into the house and

957
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,020
find a corner that you like.

958
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,290
Just turn that corner upside down.

959
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,030
Okay?

960
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,650
What did he find?

961
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,330
What is he doing?

962
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,660
What's going on?

963
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:12,900
It's normal for kids

964
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,740
to pull out all the things at home.

965
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:15,690
It's just curiosity.

966
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,180
This...

967
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,060
He's putting them back.

968
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,780
That's new.

969
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,020
It's the first time I see a kid

970
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,980
tidying up

971
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,170
after creating a mess.

972
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,060
What do you mean by 'first time'?

973
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:36,900
Well...

974
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,060
Ling Rui was like this when he was young.

975
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,150
He couldn't bear

976
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,220
even the slightest mess in his room.

977
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,970
Am I right?

978
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,100
Ling Rui.

979
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,740
Where did you pick up

980
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,580
such a treasure?

981
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,300
The two of them really do look kind of alike.

982
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:55,980
Yeah.

983
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,820
I don't count on you

984
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,860
to give me

985
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,500
such a precious grandson.

986
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,420
Youyou.

987
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,260
It's almost mealtime.

988
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,380
What do you want to eat?

989
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,570
[That was fast. We're at this time now?]

990
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,910
Third thing.

991
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,660
When grandmas ask you what you want to eat,

992
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,540
say you don't want to eat.

993
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,780
You don't want anything.

994
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,650
You only want pizza,

995
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:22,930
burger, fried chicken, and fries.

996
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,100
Pizza, burger, fried chicken and fries.

997
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,300
That's easy. I'll go and buy them.

998
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,020
-The soup is coming.
-Why did

999
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,740
she get all these

1000
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,660
junk foods for him?

1001
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,020
Soup is here. Soup is here.

1002
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,330
The soup is here.

1003
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,710
Here comes the soup.

1004
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,100
Kid, drink the soup first.

1005
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,940
Finish the soup

1006
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,340
and then, you can eat these junk foods.

1007
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,300
Did you hear me?

1008
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,540
I don't want to.

1009
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,150
Nevermind then.

1010
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,060
Youyou said

1011
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,300
he wants to eat these junk foods.

1012
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,620
Kids love these.

1013
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,780
Come.

1014
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,850
Have some vegetables

1015
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,060
so you can balance your diet.

1016
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,420
I don't want to.

1017
00:43:59,020 --> 00:43:59,750
You don't want to?

1018
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,380
Youyou.

1019
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,020
I made these dishes myself.

1020
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,090
Have a taste.

1021
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,630
No!

1022
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,820
One, two, three, chew.

1023
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,310
Good boy.

1024
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,100
-Chew, chew.
-He's eating vegetables now.

1025
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,610
Keep chewing.

1026
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,900
Another sip of the soup.

1027
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,020
-What a good boy.
-Good boy.

1028
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,820
Really good.

1029
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,260
Have some veggie after the soup.

1030
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,660
Very good.

1031
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:29,300
Kid.

1032
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,210
Let's not eat these junk foods

1033
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,050
anymore today.

1034
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,180
Okay?

1035
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:33,990
Okay?

1036
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:34,900
Give it to Grannie.

1037
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,310
Very good.

1038
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:37,540
If you can not eat them today,

1039
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,540
you can

1040
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,740
not eat them forever.

1041
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,550
Okay?

1042
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,740
I won't eat them anymore.

1043
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,870
Nothing tastes better

1044
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,380
than the dishes made by dad.

1045
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,460
Exactly!

1046
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,220
-Good boy.
-Dad?
