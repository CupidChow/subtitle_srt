Shouldn't he stop me by now?

Why doesn't he stop me?

This is really happening.

You're back.

I've thought about it,

23
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,829
and I think I need to

24
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,070
express my gratitude to you.

25

The issue with the material

has been resolved.

29
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,340
Qin Yujiang helped me with this.

30
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,829
And I also know that

31
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,180
you met her

32

at the factory.

33
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,270
Actually,

34
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,950
I didn't help much.

35
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,900
Ms. Qin figured it out on her own.

36
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,300
I figured it out too.

37
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,620
I criticized her

38
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,700
and said that she

39
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,620
lost her principles for love.

40
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,110
But it turned out that

41
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,390
I did the same.

Before this,

44
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,860
I've been so bossy and selfish.

45
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,020
You were right.

46
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,070
When a person lies too many times,

47
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,750
she will start to believe them herself.

48
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,670
That gave you

49
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,860
a lot of burdens, right?

50
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,590
I'm tired.

51

you won't think of me as

58
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,659
a terrible person.

59

we should share

00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,420
It's not like

349
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,300
I would love

350
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,609
anyone in a white coat.

351
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:22,780
Ms. Lu.

352
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,060
This is Bai Jing.

353
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,930
Handsome, right?

354
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,810
Hello, Ms. Lu.

355
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,500
Hello.

356
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,220
Why are you wearing a ring?

357
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,300
A doctor won't do something like this.

358
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,290
No offense.

359
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,810
It's just that I think surgeons

360
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,140
have a lot of surgeries,

361
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,820
so it's very inconvenient to wear a ring.

362
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,980
And it's not a hospital here,

363
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,490
why should you wear a white coat?

364
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,500
Afraid that anyone could not tell

365
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
that you're a doctor?

366
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,820
It feels a little intentional.

367
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,540
Pardon me.

368
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,260
I just saw your shooting.

369
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,700
You two still look

370
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,500
good as a couple.

371
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,220
I mean, it was so good that

372
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,540
I almost cried.

373
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,580
You bet, he's very good.

374
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,780
Thanks for the suggestions, Ms. Lu.

375
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,860
Ms. Lu seems to know surgeons

376
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,100
very well.

377
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,660
Or you have a certain image

378
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,700
of the character in that novel.

379
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,300
Do I?

380
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,850
I guess so.

381
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,290
But for surgeons,

382
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,020
their hands are important.

383
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,540
How about this?

384
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,580
Let me take a look at your hand.

385
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,660
Ms. Lu, well.

386
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,540
You haven't tried

387
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,650
our coffee here, right?

388
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,380
Let's go.

389
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,860
-I'll get you some coffee.
-Let's go.

390
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,370
Actually,

391
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,820
as a fan of that book,

392
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
I kind of didn't like it

393
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,900
when I heard that

394
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,410
you

395
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,980
were going to play this role.

396
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,770
But after watching you act,

397
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,140
Ms. Tang.

398
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,190
I think it's great.

399
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,620
The event will be held here tomorrow.

400
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,670
Let me give you a tour of the set

401
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,980
to see which angle

402
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,260
would be better for your live show.

403
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,300
All right.

404
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,290
The slap just now

405
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,820
was a real slap?

406
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,770
Does it hurt?

407
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,850
It's a real slap.

408
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,820
Well, not very painful.

409
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,020
Oh, you...

410
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,180
Lu Fangning?

411
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,370
What is she doing with the idol?

412
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,370
It's long?

413
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,300
Just cut a little bit.

414
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,060
You've finally revealed yourself.

415
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,700
Ms. Tang.

416
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,460
Shall we

417
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,140
go to see

418
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,050
the next location?

419
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,490
No, I want to watch this.

420
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,490
Ms. Tang.

421
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,100
The breach of the contract
would cost you 100,000 yuan.

422
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,690
All right.

423
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,770
No problem.

424
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,850
However,

425
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,180
why don't you go wait over there?

426
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,460
I'll be right there in a minute, okay?

427
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,810
Okay, sure.

428
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,340
I think he's really good.

429
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,780
Besides,

430
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,130
I think he's a good working partner.

431
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,180
He's so nice.

432
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:28,650
And he is

433
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,420
very humorous at the set,

434
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,740
always making us laugh.

435
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,050
So what are you going to shoot next?

436
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,660
The next scene...

437
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,820
I don't think it's okay for me to tell you.

438
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,660
I'll send it to Ling Rui.

439
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,410
Let him see what you are really like.

440
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,780
Is she coming back for dinner?

441
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,620
Should I buy some food?

442
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,100
What am I hesitating about?

443
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,970
I'm going to sort

444
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,060
everything out.

445
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,650
And I'm not going to let you

446
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,980
feel uncomfortable.

447
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,570
That's what she means about

448
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,890
sorting out everything

449
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,060
and not giving me any trouble?

450
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,020
[She looks happy.]

451
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,860
This is your script?

452
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,810
You're taking your job pretty seriously.

453
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,570
However,

454
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,540
the scene that you just did,

455
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,210
what does it mean?

456
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,050
The doctor's trying to piss off his CEO brother,

457
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,180
so he intentionally got close to

458
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,610
the woman that the CEO likes.

459
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,260
What does that mean? What the hell?

460
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,810
But the title of the show is

461
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,130
Doctor, CEO and Me.

462
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,090
The doctor and the CEO

463
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,980
are meant to be together.

464
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,090
What exactly have they

465
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,650
changed in the script?

466
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,690
Why does it feel so different

467
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,530
from the original novel?

468
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,170
You can't read that.

469
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,580
-No.
-Let me have a look.

470
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,850
Ms. Lu, you really can't.

471
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,010
I'm Lu Fangning.

472
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,050
I won't tell anyone.

473
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,010
No one can look at that.

474
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,530
Lu Fangning!

475
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,730
Just a glance, okay?

476
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,610
I'm just going to have a glance.

477
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,410
-Just a glance.
-No.

478
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,330
Lu Fangning.

479
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,730
What are you doing here?

480
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,940
What are you doing here?

481
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,290
I'm here to buy groceries.

482
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,500
Here?

483
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,020
The vegetables here are fresher.

484
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,410
This is...

485
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,700
He's just passing by.

486
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,580
You don't have to worry.

487
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,730
He'll be gone in a minute.

488
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:51,900
You can leave now.

489
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,500
I still have something important

490
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,050
to discuss with him.

491
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,330
Now that I'm here,

492
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,970
I'll just wait for you to go home together.

493
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,850
Why?

494
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,410
Did you know how much fuel

495
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,730
you can save by

496
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,130
driving one car instead of two?

497
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,730
And how much does energy conservation

498
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,420
could benefit the environment.

499
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,500
It's time for each and every one of us

500
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,290
to get involved

501
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,730
into this action

502
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,540
to curb global warming,

503
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,900
and to contribute to humanity.

504
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:18,980
This gentleman here

505
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,730
seems very environmentally conscious.

506
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,330
Please continue.

507
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,210
I won't disturb you.

508
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,730
How are we supposed to talk

509
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,770
with you sitting here?

510
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,020
What do you want to talk about

511
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,530
that I can't listen to?

512
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,540
No, no. No such things.

513
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,650
[Why is he here?]

514
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,810
[To keep an eye on me?]

515
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,100
[To control me?]

516
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,170
[At least you can't talk about]

517
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,610
[something inappropriate if I'm here.]

518
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,500
If you really

519
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,410
have nothing to do,

520
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,370
you can go to the hospital.

521
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,810
The patients need your help.

522
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,540
There're doctors on call.

523
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,660
You're a doctor?

524
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,740
I played a doctor.

525
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,220
I'm playing a surgeon.

526
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,050
Only the white coat makes

527
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,940
you like a surgeon.

528
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,380
If I could just act like you,

529
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,260
that would be nice.

530
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,850
That's impossible.

531
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,450
By the way,

532
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:19,850
there are some

533
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,740
technical terms here

534
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,420
that I haven't figured out.
Please have a look.

535
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,290
It's just saying that...

536
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:27,970
Hello, sir.

537
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,250
I'm the casting director for the show.

538
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,380
Are you interested in acting

539
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,090
or being a guest star

540
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:31,730
in our drama?

541
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,530
I can pay you

542
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,740
the maximum wage.

543
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,730
Please tell me

544
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,410
what this means first.

545
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,820
You guys, that's enough.

546
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,410
This is my husband,

547
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,170
not an actor.

548
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,370
What are you laughing at?

549
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,890
No, I can't be like this.

550
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,490
I need to maintain my cold image.

551
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,780
Calm down and ignore him.

552
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:00,690
Bai Jing.

553
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,540
Didn't you say

554
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,020
you wanted to play the doctor well?

555
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,380
Would you like to come to my house?

556
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,420
What?

557
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,380
Bai Jing.

558
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,370
This is a house

559
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,570
of a surgeon.

560
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,780
Take a look around.

561
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,090
Make yourself at home.

562
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,300
Slippers are on the floor.

563
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,050
Come here.

564
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,460
Bai Jing, take a look around.

565
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,050
What's up?

566
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,020
Why did you bring him home?

567
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,690
Why can't I bring him home?

568
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,370
I'm helping him to play a doctor.

569
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,930
What's wrong with helping people?

570
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,410
Does playing a doctor

571
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,770
have anything to do with you?

572
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,340
Because he might be...

573
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,020
No, he would definitely be

574
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,300
the face of

575
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,370
Infinity.

576
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,730
Him?

577
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,770
The face of your brand?

578
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,020
All right.

579
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,830
[Block 2, Unit 107]

580
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,570
Even if that's true,

581
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,020
you can see him in the office

582
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,370
or in the ads.

583
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,180
Why do you have to bring him home?

584
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,930
Because he's young and handsome.

585
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,250
Don't you think our house

586
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,940
looks much better

587
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,450
with him here?

588
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,170
This house looks glorious because of him.

589
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,130
Excuse me...

590
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,090
-Don't speak.
-Shut up.

591
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,340
I'm sorry.

592
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:26,650
Kid.

593
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,660
What do you want to eat? I'll cook.

594
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,290
No, no, don't bother.

595
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,330
Let him do it.

596
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,770
He loves to cook.

597
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,140
Go ahead.

598
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,730
Let me guess what you would cook.

599
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,140
Greens again, right?

600
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,820
Well, that's all you can cook.

601
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,010
Why didn't you buy more meat?

602
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,170
Don't just cook me and Bai Jing greens.

603
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,690
Ms. Lu.

604
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,420
Is it inconvenient

605
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,490
for me to be here?

606
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,410
Of course not.

607
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,770
What's wrong with me?

608
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,450
She just brought a business partner home.

609
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,610
What's the big deal?

610
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:18,810
Yeah.

611
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,780
Just a business partner.

612
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,620
Young?

613
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,570
Handsome?

614
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,530
Cheerful?

615
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,090
Is what I'm wearing today

616
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,530
a little too dark?

617
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,380
That's why I look more mature?

618
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,050
How about changing into white?

619
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,210
White

620
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,610
is my color.

621
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,690
So, is it tough when you are shooting?

622
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,770
No.

623
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,610
Not as tough as Dr. Ling's job, I assume.

624
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,810
By the way,

625
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,850
does he read

626
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,210
all the books in your house?

627
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,490
He likes to read all the time.

628
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,690
Oh,

629
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,410
it's a nice day today.

630
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:23,810
By the way,

631
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,530
can you tell me

632
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,570
what the ending is like?

633
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,220
I promise I won't tell anyone.

634
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:28,620
I swear.

635
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,370
I really can't.

636
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,650
A lot of people have asked me about this.

637
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,530
This flower hasn't been

638
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,050
watered recently.

639
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,850
Please tell me.

640
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,770
It's almost dead.

641
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,210
I'm Lu Fangning, after all.

642
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,050
Who am I going to tell?

643
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,250
Just a little bit.

644
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,650
Ms. Lu, I really can't.

645
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,970
We signed an NDA.

646
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:41,930
I really can't talk about it.

647
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,610
What was his reaction just now?

648
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,730
Jealousy?

649
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,410
No, no, no.

650
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,930
How could he be jealous?

651
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,410
Then...

652
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,610
If you can't

653
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,810
tell me any spoiler,

654
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,420
then why don't you tell me that

655
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,170
in the end,

656
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,370
who will you end up with?

657
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,170
This table is dirty.

658
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,050
You can certainly tell me that, right?

659
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:00,690
Let me wipe it.

660
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,250
Ms. Lu, you don't know.

661
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,890
No scriptwriter dares

662
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,770
to write a bad ending nowadays.

663
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,090
They have to give it a happy ending

664
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,170
even if it doesn't make sense.

665
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,380
Oh.

666
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,290
Something fell on the floor.

667
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,810
It's broken. What should I do?

668
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:14,970
Boring.

669
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,450
I am going to do the cooking.

670
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,250
Go ahead.

671
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,010
Let's go sit inside.

672
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,770
Give me two bottles of water.

673
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,460
There's no water.

674
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,090
It's right over there.

675
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,730
It's expired.

676
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,450
Childish.

677
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,370
Just ignore him.

678
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,210
Have some water, please.

679
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:38,890
Thank you.

680
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,740
Ms. Lu.

681
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,330
Maybe I shall leave.

682
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,090
No, sit here.

683
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,770
Dr. Ling is still wearing

684
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,970
white at home.

685
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,730
He looks sparkling.

686
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,050
It's hard to imitate that.

687
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,580
Of course it is.

688
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,010
You have an advantage.

689
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,650
What?

690
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,930
You got good taste.

691
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,890
By the way, Bai Jing,

692
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,970
how tall are you?

693
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,890
I'm 180.

694
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,970
180 cm?

695
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,050
I love boys who are 180 cm tall.

696
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,020
I think it's the perfect height.

697
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,890
A little higher

698
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,450
would make someone look a little clumsy.

699
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,970
You like 180 cm,

700
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,850
but not 186 cm?

701
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,530
Your uncle is even three centimeters

702
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,650
taller than me.

703
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,530
Why didn't you call him clumsy?

704
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,290
I just recalled that

705
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,410
I remember

706
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,930
I had a bag of chips once,

707
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,970
which was very good.

708
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,090
It's endorsed by you.

709
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:45,770
What is it called?

710
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,170
If you like it,

711
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,130
I'll ask my manager

712
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:49,890
to send you a box of it.

713
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,130
No need.

714
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,930
I'll buy two boxes.

715
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,130
I'll buy ten boxes, to support you.

716
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,060
No, that's not necessary.

717
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,050
So young, handsome

718
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,610
and you know how to make money.

719
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,610
You're really good.

720
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,210
I save lives.

721
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,980
My spirit is nobler.

722
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,970
I'm in a good mood today.

723
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,850
After the meal,

724
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,090
have a drink with me.

725
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:14,610
Drink wine?

726
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,730
Do you drink?

727
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:16,930
You don't know,

728
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,360
there's someone in this house

729
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,040
who really can't drink.

730
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,560
If he takes just a little sip,

731
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,210
he would pass out in no time.

732
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,450
That's so weak.

733
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,770
Who says I can't drink?

734
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,290
I am just trying to

735
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,090
keep a regular lifestyle.

736
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,210
I just go to bed early.

737
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,970
How about video games?

738
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,610
I'm actually really into video games.

739
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,530
But as you can see,

740
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,410
there are so many books in this house.

741
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,330
Someone just

742
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,930
reads books all the time.

743
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,490
And when he drinks,

744
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,530
he would recite

745
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,650
the terms of medical books.

746
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,330
I don't even know what that means. It's so boring.

747
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,770
And someone just

748
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,130
likes reading about parenting

749
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,410
secretly.

750
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,930
Well, why don't you give me

751
00:30:58,930 --> 00:30:59,730
a baby to practice?

752
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,450
Coward.

753
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,850
You're different, Bai Jing.

754
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,970
You look like

755
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:05,840
a real man.

756
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,010
You look very brave.

757
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:08,650
A real man.

758
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,450
Are you saying I'm not a man?

759
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,490
Come here, Bai Jing.

760
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,130
Let's compare.

761
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,290
Let's see who is the real man.

762
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:13,810
What are you doing?

763
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,240
-Let go.
-Come on.

764
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,690
Let go.

765
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,290
Don't bully the kid.

766
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,330
I...

767
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,610
I bully him?

768
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,490
You're bullying me.

769
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,850
You're not a kid.

770
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,730
Put the knife down.

771
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,090
I won't.

772
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,410
See?

773
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,530
That's human nature.

774
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,880
No matter how professional a surgeon is,

775
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,330
he would also get out of control.

776
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,010
I mean, look

777
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:34,730
how annoyed he is right now.

778
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,690
I am not out of control.

779
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,290
Did you see it?

780
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,450
Use it in the show.

781
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,250
Out of control, me?

782
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,010
I'm not out of control.

783
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,370
-You're not out of control?
-I'm going to go to the bathroom.

784
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,410
You're not out of control?

785
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,730
I'm not out of control.

786
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,850
Your face is flushed with anger!

787
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:50,770
I'm not!

788
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,570
You're getting agitated.

789
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,530
And you're flushing.

790
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,930
Your neck has even became shorter.

791
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,450
How the hell would my neck...

792
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,530
I got a swan neck.

793
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,770
You look like a little frog to me.

794
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,730
Quack, quack.

795
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,130
You're like a donkey.

796
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,050
Blah blah blah.

797
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,050
Then why did you marry

798
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,760
a donkey?

799
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,040
You're married to a little frog.

800
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,650
Come and get me, Ziwen!

801
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:07,770
What's up?

802
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,770
I've got work to do here.

803
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,450
No.

804
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,210
I need you to come to get me.

805
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,730
Just think of it as a way

806
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,170
to gain more life experience.

807
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,970
You can't offend your sponsor.

808
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,480
-Come on. I...
-I'm hanging up.

809
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:17,850
Goodbye.

810
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,160
Don't know who

811
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,730
just tried to

812
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:25,880
get under my covers.

813
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,290
I...

814
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,690
I was delirious.

815
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,690
So you're sane now?

816
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:30,720
A kid.

817
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,850
I'm just a kid.

818
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,010
I'm going to go home now.

819
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:33,530
Stop.

820
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,530
Get out of my way.

821
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,690
We haven't had a meal together yet.

822
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,730
Where are you going?

823
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,520
Thank you both.

824
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,890
I learned a valuable lesson.

825
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,530
Lesson?

826
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,330
What lesson?

827
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,170
What have you learned?

828
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,370
Love makes people crazy.

829
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,370
Bye.

830
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,010
You're leaving?

831
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,490
I've got to go now.

832
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,330
You are not staying for a meal?

833
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:55,920
No!

834
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,410
All right.

835
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,050
See you later.

836
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,650
Goodbye...

837
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,330
Are you jealous?

838
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,290
Why would I be jealous?

839
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,690
If you want some vinegar,
[*Eating vinegar, a metaphor of jealousy]

840
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,680
I can make you sour and sweet ribs,

841
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,290
sour fish, and sour cabbage.

842
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,330
Which one do you want?

843
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,730
I don't know how to make either of them.

844
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,890
All I can make is poached vegetables.

845
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,730
Take your time.

846
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,810
Have some more.

847
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,770
Get your knife.

848
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,240
No.

849
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,410
I'm just going to cook.

850
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,250
I didn't hear that.

851
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,840
By the way,

852
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,880
donkeys don't bark like that.

853
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,330
Exactly.

854
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,970
That's more like it.

855
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,450
Immature.

856
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,930
That really pissed me off.

857
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,120
A loving girlfriend like me

858
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,929
is the rarest thing in the world.

859
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,370
What's taking him so long?

860
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,690
Did he run into the bad guys again?

861
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,040
Siyu.

862
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:04,770
Sorry.

863
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,290
I'm getting a little too excited.

864
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,120
How's your bruise healing?

865
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,050
Are you all right?

866
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,250
I'm fine.

867
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,000
Sorry that I'm late.

868
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,240
It's all right.

869
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,520
I'm just glad you're safe.

870
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,640
Here.

871
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:20,970
This is for you.

872
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,810
For me?

873
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,810
I specifically looked into it.

874
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,170
This is Eustoma grandiflorum.

875
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,130
It represents "true and unchanging love."

876
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,520
It's a perfect souvenir for

877
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,490
our first official date.

878
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,130
Siyu.

879
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,090
You called me Siyu.

880
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,760
Give me your hand.

881
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,490
Your hand.

882
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,490
Let's go.

883
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,170
I'll introduce you

884
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,570
to my favorite food.

885
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,050
This tastes so good.

886
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,570
Would you like to try it?

887
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,040
Let me.

888
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,930
This dessert is called

889
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,850
"Let's date".

890
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,360
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.

891
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,280
Someone who was

892
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,720
so far away from me

893
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,130
is actually sitting across from me

894
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,770
and eating with me right now.

895
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,680
Are you thinking

896
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,960
too badly of yourself?

897
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,730
Director Lu, you have such good taste

898
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,840
and such high standards,

899
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,960
I can't degrade you.

900
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,440
You won't.

901
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,650
Don't think like that.

902
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,120
You're actually very cute.

903
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,640
So I'm just cute.

904
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,570
I know that

905
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,170
you invited me to dinner out of the blue

906
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,520
and accepted my confession,

907
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,960
that's something very rare,

908
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,490
and there must be a reason.

909
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,770
Besides,

910
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,400
I don't think

911
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,730
it's because of the reason I imagined.

912
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,800
Even though I love reading novels

913
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,610
and daydreaming,

914
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,810
I'm not stupid.

915
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,690
But that's okay.

916
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,280
I could have a moment

917
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,650
where dreams come true,

918
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,840
I'm happy enough.

919
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,970
And

920
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,290
I'm going to

921
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,800
try to make you

922
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,010
like me a little more

923
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,080
and love me a little more every day.

924
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,930
Even if I failed eventually,

925
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,010
I have been the main character

926
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,250
for a short time.

927
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,730
It's because, for me,

928
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,770
you're the male lead in my story.

929

[Shenzhen Huiren Hospital]

937
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,490
Let me take a peek at my "husband" before work.

938
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,810
Look at this picture of him

939
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,250
and his suit.

940
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,810
That's my man, Bai Jing.

941
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,650
Who do you think he looks like?

942
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,280
Does he look like that foreign actor...

943
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,000
Dr. Ling.

944
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,930
What are you doing here?

945
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,360
It's not even working hours yet.

946
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,880
Could it be that you're one of our idol's

947
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,610
fans?

948
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,120
How is this?

949
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,560
Are you amazed at how handsome he is?

950
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,970
What's so handsome about him?

951
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,010
What?

952
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,440
He is totally handsome, all right?

953
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,930
I think you're just jealous.

954
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:21,650
Bai Jing

955
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,130
has thousands of fans.

956
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:23,530
If a guy like him

957
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,840
could be my husband,

958
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,520
I can do anything.

959
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,930
No, you can't.

960
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,890
This guy looks like

961
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,250
someone who can't make a hit.

962
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,280
What did he just say?

963
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,090
He can't make it?

964
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,880
What did he mean?

965
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,610
I've got to

966
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,210
-reason with him.
-It's okay.

967
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,160
What does he mean?

968
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,400
-It's okay, Maomao.
-Our Bai Jing is already famous.

969
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:45,840
All right?

970
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,410
-All right.
-Relax.

971
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,280
Do you want some vinegar?

972
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,560
Vinegar?

973
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,800
I'm not jealous.

974
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,890
I'm asking if you want

975
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:05,890
some vinegar in the noodles.

976
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,680
No.

977
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,480
Thanks.

978
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,130
What report are you reading?

979
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,120
You didn't even get what I was asking.

980
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,130
Is he handsome?
