4
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Flu

5
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:47,120
is contagious.

6
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,240
The effect's so strong?

7
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,640
What is in that soup?

8
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,570
Whatever, come on.

9
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,630
-No.
-Why are you hesitating?

10
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,970
-What are you doing?
-Come down.

11
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,720
We have to

12
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,600
talk about it tonight.

13
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,210
Why did you tie me up again?

14
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't feel comfortable like this.

15
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,480
Ling Rui.

16
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,490
Ling Rui.

17
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,400
So,

18
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,970
you married me

19
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,230
just to legally get...

20
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,090
my...

21
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,280
Alright.

22
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
I completely understand

23
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,040
why you, Lu Fangning,

24
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,770
would do this.

25
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,800
It's just... Why me?

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,930
Why not you?

27
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,720
You're handsome and well-educated.

28
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
You have a good personality.

29
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,600
Of course, it's you.

30
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,750
Besides, you still owe me money.

31
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,200
You have to pay your debt.

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,930
It's perfectly fair.

33
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,680
Don't worry.

34
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,250
After I have a baby,

35
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,690
I'm not gonna bother you.

36
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,970
Our marriage

37
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,079
will automatically end in a year

38
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,730
as we agreed on the contract.

39
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,290
Of course,

40
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,720
the baby will be mine.

41
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,290
But, you're still the father.

42
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,130
You can see the kid whenever you want.

43
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,810
I would never stop you.

44
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,650
However,

45
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,130
if one day

46
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,610
you have a new relationship,

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,329
I'm not gonna let the baby

48
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,329
call that woman mother.

49
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,280
So,

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,079
you have never had any intention

51
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,690
to keep the father of the child?

52
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
I'm perfectly capable of handling

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,600
the risks and responsibilities

54
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,570
of raising a baby.

55
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,130
Besides,

56
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,550
I have a stable financial income

57
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,090
to give the kid the best possible life,

58
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,600
education,

59
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,360
and all my care and love.

60
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,850
I'll be with him as he grows up.

61
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,760
Why

62
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,050
does he need a father?

63
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,010
It's not a question of necessity.

64
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,279
Then what's the problem?

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,570
Ling Rui.

66
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,280
You've got to open your mind.

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
Think of it as

68
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,050
helping a lovely girl

69
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,960
who wants a baby,

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,610
but can't have one by herself.

71
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,330
I can't do this alone.

72
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,880
I can't do mitosis.

73
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,930
Of course, I need your help.

74
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,170
Ling Rui.

75
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,370
Look at me.

76
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,350
Look at me.

77
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,240
Being with a girl as attractive as me,

78
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,010
someone else would have been
attracted a long time ago.

79
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,490
Someone else?

80
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,880
So if it's not me,

81
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,800
you would've found someone else

82
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,880
to carry out your plan?

83
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,600
Can't I?

84
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
You can't!

85
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,520
Two mature adults

86
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,030
raising a child together

87
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,680
would meet a lot of problems,

88
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,850
let alone someone like you

89
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,210
who's childish and ridiculous.

90
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,960
Childish?

91
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,930
Childish?

92
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,810
I thought of your feelings

93
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,690
and your ego,

94
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,400
so I stayed there

95
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,200
for such a long time,

96
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,680
and you call that childish?

97
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:33,960
Immature?

98
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,040
How do you know I'm immature?

99
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:36,920
Have you ever seen me doing anything

100
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,000
before you said that?

101
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,200
Anyway, I'm not going to

102
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,970
have a baby with you.

103
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,960
A baby should be a gift

104
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
to two adults who are in love.

105
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,159
We're not.

106
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,770
How do you know we're not?

107
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,280
I love you.

108
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,480
I like you.

109
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,040
No.

110
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,360
It's not up to you.

111
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,120
You're just saying no to anything.

112
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,480
Why are you such a pain in the ass?

113
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,730
Anyway, I'm not gonna

114
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,880
have a baby with you.

115
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,330
And, you will never do it

116
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,210
with someone else too.

117
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,290
I'm going home for a few days.

118
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:19,600
Ling Rui.

119
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,760
-Don't look for me.
-Ling Rui.

120
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,400
Ling Rui!

121
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,040
One more.

122
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,880
How about I feed it into your mouth?

123
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,560
Have you ever stopped eating?

124
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,250
Ling Rui.

125
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,840
Why did you come back at such late hours?

126
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,570
I have something to do.

127
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,090
What is it?

128
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,210
Why are you home so late?

129
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,050
Where is your coat?

130
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,170
My coat...

131
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,050
I left it at the hospital today.

132
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,490
I had surgeries all day.

133
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,200
I'm too tired.

134
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

135
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,290
Did you

136
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,450
have a fight with Lu Fangning?

137
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,800
Fight?

138
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,040
How could I possibly fight with her?

139
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,450
It's nothing like that.

140
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,159
I'm going to bed. Good night.

141
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,600
Well, off you go.

142
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,730
Are you hungry?

143
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,610
No, I'm fine.

144
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,650
What happened to Ling Rui?

145
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,000
Came back to his mother's house
in the middle of the night.

146
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,520
What are you talking about?

147
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,720
How could you

148
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,730
say that?

149
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,280
He's a man.

150
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,810
Can't he just come home?

151
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,640
She's not wrong.

152
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,040
You're his mother.

153
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,330
Sister.

154
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,160
Why don't you go to sleep? It's late.

155
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,810
Alright, go to sleep then.

156
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,170
Don't you want to sleep?
You're still eating?

157
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,160
Go to sleep.

158
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,160
No.

159
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,640
You...

160
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,400
Wait a minute.

161
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,840
Hurry up.

162
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,640
Why are you in such a hurry?

163
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,680
I'm just using the toilet.

164
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,600
Keep your voice down.

165
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,930
Look.

166
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,480
Ling Rui has been

167
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,330
cleaning up since the morning,

168
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,410
from this side to that side

169
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,920
and back and forth

170
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,730
for a long time.

171
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,210
Isn't it normal

172
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,440
for him to clean the table?

173
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,240
Cut the crap.

174
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
Is that normal?

175
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,970
When was

176
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,250
the last time he was like this?

177
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,730
Last time?

178
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,090
When was the last time?

179
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,570
Nothing like this happened before.

180
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,250
No.

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,520
Yazhi, go ask him.

182
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,690
No.

183
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,530
-Go.
-Go.

184
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,520
Ling Rui.

185
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,090
Did you fight with Fangning?

186
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,680
Return me my money.

187
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,450
I'll leave you to it then.

188
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,330
See? I told you I can't.

189
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,320
Why did you send me?

190
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,440
Sister, why don't you go?

191
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,520
Me?

192
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,280
He has always listened to you
since he was a kid.

193
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,050
He'll do whatever you tell him to.

194
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,770
You're his mother. Let's go together.

195
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,930
-Let's go, Yazhi.
-Let's go.

196
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,000
Ling Rui.

197
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,360
Today is the weekend.

198
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,240
Why don't you stay with your wife at home,

199
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,920
but come here?

200
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,120
Son, will you stop doing that?

201
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,640
You have been doing this

202
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,480
from here to there

203
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,570
and the other way around.

204
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,090
You haven't taken any rest.

205
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,730
Good boy, come here. Take a break.

206
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,610
Take a break,

207
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,410
okay?

208
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,320
Be good.

209
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,480
Hi.

210
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,890
Mom and aunts,

211
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,600
here comes your daughter-in-law.

212
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,520
What are you doing here?

213
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,360
Here.

214
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,720
Help me get the stuff inside.

215
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,950
Fangning is here.

216
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,240
Hi.

217
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,090
What's going on here?

218
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,200
I'm going to visit

219
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
a friend of mine who lives nearby.

220
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,680
Her little baby

221
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,880
is one year old.

222
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,950
These are all the things

223
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,080
that I plan to give her.

224
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,690
You have friends

225
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,280
who live at places like this?

226
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,360
Of course.

227
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,120
Alright, you take a seat.

228
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,290
I go get you some fruits.

229
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,480
Mom, please sit.

230
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,010
Hold on, hold on.

231
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,120
Sit here.

232
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,960
What is this?

233
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,280
These are socks for

234
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,880
the little babies.

235
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,530
With their little feet inside,

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,010
it's so cute.

237
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,170
It's so soft and tender.

238
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,090
Mom, look.

239
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,840
What's this for?

240
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,320
This is to put under the heads

241
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,530
of the little babies.

242
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,850
Their little heads on top of it.

243
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,530
Such a pleasant view.

244
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,010
This one's so soft, too.

245
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,720
Feel it, mom.

246
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,160
You opened the things

247
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,200
that you're going to give others.

248
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,650
How are you supposed to give it away?

249
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,400
No problem.

250
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,730
I'll just put it in later.

251
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,560
I can imagine

252
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,770
the little babies' little arms,

253
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,610
little feet

254
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,560
that look like little lotus roots,

255
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,810
soft and tender.

256
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,890
Imagine them kicking their little legs

257
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,210
and stretching their arms,

258
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,290
it melts my heart.

259
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,520
Do you like kids?

260
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,080
Of course, mom.

261
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,360
In the future,

262
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,200
when you have your own

263
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,130
grandchildren,

264
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,920
I'm sure you'd love them too.

265
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,350
Take a look.

266
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,870
Ling Rui.

267
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,850
Mom.

268
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,360
Do you remember the friend
you play cards with?

269
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,330
Which one?

270
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,010
The one who rarely talks, but plays fast,

271
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,450
and always lets you win.

272
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,480
Ever since she got a grandson,

273
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,890
you haven't seen her anymore.

274
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,200
Didn't you tell me that

275
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,560
she cried when she told you,

276
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,200
after having a grandson,

277
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,450
she was surrounded
by diapers and milk bottles,

278
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,160
and had to take care of the baby
all night?

279
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,680
So,

280
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,210
you think it's going to be

281
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,640
troublesome for you to have a baby?

282
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,520
It's a real pain in the ass.

283
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,800
I don't think

284
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,960
I'm gonna take care of your kids.

285
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,080
Is that right, sister?

286
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,920
Yeah, we won't.

287
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,200
Mom, I haven't...

288
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,520
Didn't you just say that...

289
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:33,970
Mom, I...

290
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,890
You know what? Never mind.

291
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,210
Please ask Ling Rui about this.

292
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,250
What's going on?

293
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,800
What's going on?

294
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,800
What the hell is going on?

295
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,840
What's up with all that?

296
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,330
Fangning.

297
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,650
Sit over there.

298
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,930
Move over and let me sit down.

299
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,010
Fanning.

300
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,960
Try this tea.

301
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,880
Thank you, aunt.

302
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,720
When I went out

303
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,440
for inspiration last time,

304
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,800
I watched the old farmer cooked this.

305
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,080
Aunt.

306
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,440
I've been preparing myself for pregnancy,

307
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,410
so I can't drink tea.

308
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,040
Look.

309
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,880
A lot of people think that

310
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,160
career-minded women like us

311
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,880
don't have time

312
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,120
to take care of the kids.

313
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,840
But it was a misunderstanding.

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,930
Look at me.

315
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,880
I'm fully prepared

316
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,280
to welcome

317
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,640
the baby.

318
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,880
Because motherhood is strong.

319
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,800
Our children are our backbones.

320
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,680
Isn't that right?

321
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,400
Aunt.

322
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,490
I'll drink it.

323
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,370
I apologize on behalf of Fangning.

324
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,240
She definitely didn't mean that

325
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,520
a woman without children is weak,

326
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,840
and her life is imperfect.

327
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,130
That's not what I was saying.

328
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,930
I know.

329
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,920
I won't take it personally.

330
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,850
Actually,

331
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,520
it's nice to have a kid.

332
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,560
But people like me

333
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,240
who choose not to have children

334
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,290
and live on their own

335
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,480
are also living

336
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,520
a good life.

337
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,800
Yes, of course.

338
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,170
Oh, Fangning.

339
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,000
You're pretty bad

340
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,880
with your languages.

341
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,560
"Motherhood is strong."

342
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,560
That's not how it's supposed to be used.

343
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,080
Aunt Yazhi.

344
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,160
I'm here.

345
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,000
Come, sit.

346
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,210
Aunt,

347
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,120
haven't you been

348
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,080
trying to find a job

349
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,610
and sending out resumes online?

350
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,360
Resumes?

351
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,170
Go ahead. That matters more.

352
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,880
Au... Aunt?

353
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,400
I'll go send out resumes.

354
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,970
Oh, I forgot to tell you that

355
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,960
Aunt Yazhi divorced,

356
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,970
and her ex-husband got the baby.

357
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,320
Be careful

358
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,160
with your words.

359
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,520
It's tasty.

360
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,530
Mom.

361
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,560
Come on in, kid.

362
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,320
Come on in.

363
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,330
Close the door.

364
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,050
Come on, come on.

365
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,090
Let me ask you something.

366
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,730
Sit, sit.

367
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,320
Out there, you just said that

368
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,000
you want kids

369
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,120
and then you said you don't.

370
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,890
What exactly were you thinking?

371
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,970
I don't actually

372
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,690
want a child

373
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,840
very, very much.

374
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,610
Besides, mom, you don't

375
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,720
want it that bad either,

376
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,839
do you?

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,680
I didn't say that...

378
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,800
Of course, I do.

379
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,530
You just said that

380
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,800
you don't want to take care of the kid.

381
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,960
No.

382
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,319
I was sitting next to Ling Rui,

383
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,200
so I had to say that.

384
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,089
Otherwise, he would

385
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
feel embarrassed.

386
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,000
Mom.

387
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,609
You might not

388
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,400
gonna be able to have a grandson
so soon.

389
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,120
What do you mean by that?

390
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,800
Since Ling Rui and I got married...

391
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,360
Never mind, it's okay.

392
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,000
What's going on? What do you mean?

393
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,720
Since you are married, then what?

394
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,640
We don't act like a couple.

395
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,960
Not like a couple?

396
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,280
It's exactly like what you're thinking.

397
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
There's nothing wrong with my son.

398
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,960
Nothing wrong?

399
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,440
There's nothing wrong.

400
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,120
Who knows?

401
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,800
A little orange peel.

402
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,960
That's enough.

403
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,770
-Oatmeal.
-Oatmeal won't do.

404
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,240
Don't move, don't talk.

405
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,890
Wolfberry, black sesame,
and green beans.

406
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,800
What is

407
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,720
Ling Rui thinking?

408
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,640
How am I supposed to know
what he's thinking?

409
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,560
Perhaps, he doesn't love Fangning.

410
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,610
What are you talking about?

411
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,650
How could he not

412
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,360
love a girl like Fangning?

413
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,810
Alright, stop talking.

414
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,720
It's already a mess.

415
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,930
Just figure out a way to fix this.

416
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,080
Alright.

417
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,680
Why are you still here?

418
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,930
Why should I leave?

419
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,080
I'll be right where you are.

420
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,120
Where else would I go?

421
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,410
Listen to me,

422
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,360
whatever you're planning

423
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,930
is not gonna work.

424
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,680
What are you talking about?

425
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,570
What could I possibly have planned?

426
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,610
Of course, I should stay

427
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,960
with my husband.

428
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,690
Right?

429
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,200
Mom, Ling Rui doesn't want to drink it.

430
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,080
Come on, Ling Rui. Drink up.

431
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:08,960
Drink up.

432
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,090
Drink.

433
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,040
Okay.

434
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,160
Mom, Ling Rui still refuses to drink it.

435
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,960
What's wrong with you, Ling Rui?

436
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,760
Just drink it.

437
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,090
You don't listen to mom now?

438
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,410
You don't listen to your mom now?

439
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,880
Go wash the cup.

440
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,810
Okay.

441
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,840
He drank up.

442
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,210
Come here.

443
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,880
I'll take a shower first.

444
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,600
Okay.

445
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,680
Come here, come here.

446
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,650
Come here.

447
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,280
Later,

448
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
when he's in the shower,

449
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,760
you should just sneak in.

450
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,010
-Shall I do that?
-Don't let him hear you.

451
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,770
I'll lock the door.

452
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,170
No one can see you.

453
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,960
Keep your voice down. Don't talk.

454
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,400
Mom, no.

455
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,240
Stop talking.

456
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,680
Forget it, forget it.

457
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,920
Be good.

458
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,410
Just get in there.

459
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,510
Turn it off.

460
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:37,940
Turn it on.

461
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,530
She's shy, you know?

462
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,610
Excuse me.

463
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,490
Go, go, let's go.

464
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,280
I won't be back for a few days.

465
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,080
No way.

466
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,320
My family is going to be suspicious.

467
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
I've talked to dad...

468
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,650
I've explained to Uncle Lu that

469
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,440
I've got something to do at home.

470
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,570
I'll stay here for a few more days.

471
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,790
Alright.

472
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,960
No matter what,

473
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,280
I'll stay with you.

474
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,120
Okay.

475
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,680
You can stay here.

476
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,010
You'll sleep on the floor.

477
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,690
No.

478
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,920
Mom wants us to sleep together.

479
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,450
Also,

480
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,480
don't you forget that
according to the contract,

481
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,050
for the rest of the year,

482
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,230
you have to fulfill every requirement

483
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,930
as my husband.

484
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,210
Then, I suggest that

485
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,590
you should carefully read

486
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,600
the fifth clause in section six

487
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,930
of the contract.

488
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,730
What?

489
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,250
The contract clearly states that

490
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,800
if you, Party A,

491
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,840
coerce me, Party B,

492
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,890
to do anything unethical,

493
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,610
or illegal,

494
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,530
I would have the right
to break the contract

495
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,010
without any legal responsibility.

496
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,800
Oh, I need to add one more.

497
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,770
All the rights and duties

498
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,960
stated in the contract

499
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,440
have to be done

500
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,450
without violating the law.

501
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,600
I, Lu Fangning, am the general manager

502
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,370
of Deer Sing Group.

503
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,160
Why would I do anything illegal with you?

504
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,040
I'll add this anyway.

505
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,410
Very good.

506
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,520
Well, since you've made up your mind

507
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,800
to do this,

508
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,840
I'll find someone else

509
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,720
to work with me.

510
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,320
Bye.

511
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,370
Lu Fangning.

512
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,920
You'll be blamed

513
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,890
for marital infidelity.

514
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,250
Half of your money,

515
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,080
your house,

516
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,730
and your favorite Deer Sing

517
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,200
will be mine.

518
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,530
You sleep on the floor.

519
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,240
Comfortable.

520
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,540
[LM Deer Sing Group]

521
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,320
Leader,

522
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,530
do you think it's going to affect

523
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,440
Director Lu's brain waves

524
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,850
and let him adapt your plan

525
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,640
if you keep

526
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,680
staring at this?

527
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,040
I really don't want
to work overtime anymore.

528
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,770
I'm the one who's working overtime,
not you.

529
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,320
Look how well I did.

530
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,760
If he doesn't like this,

531
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,800
it certainly won't be

532
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,120
because of my ability.

533
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
It would be...

534
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,210
You know, the perfect couple

535
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,040
sometimes starts as enemies.

536
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,680
Siyu.

537
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,130
Again.

538
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,310
Siyu.

539
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,050
It's quite good, isn't it?

540
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,570
Left guard.

541
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,440
Assistant He, what can I do for you?

542
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,690
Director Lu demands

543
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,090
all of us in the Planning Department

544
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,810
to gather at the exhibition center
immediately.

545
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,360
Make sure you bring
all the proposals along.

546
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:02,960
In our plan,

547
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,240
we have three days to set up.

548
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,210
But right now,

549
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,490
something came up at the last minute.

550
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,730
There will be no construction
this weekend.

551
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,870
So we're gonna have to

552
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,920
get everything set up

553
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,200
by end of today.

554
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,720
But, we'll be off work soon.

555
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,450
I don't want to...

556
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,560
Do we need to work overtime again?

557
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,000
Overtime again?

558
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,800
If you don't want this to happen,

559
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,330
you should have included

560
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,610
a contingency plan

561
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,480
when you were making the proposals.

562
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,560
Do you want the company

563
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,310
to pay for the failure of the plan?

564
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,640
The layout of the exhibition
must be finished today.

565
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Is there any problem with this?

566
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,760
-No problem.
-No problem.

567
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:32,840
Louder

568
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,440
-No problem.
-No problem.

569
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,450
Once again.

570
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,800
No problem.

571
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,680
Alright.

572
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,440
Let's go to work.

573
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,640
The earlier you get this done,

574
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,270
the longer you get to sleep

575
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,450
after you go home.

576
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,200
And if you all slow down,

577
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,630
you may need to come
to work straight tomorrow.

578
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,960
Let's get started.

579
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,490
He's so determined
and does all the things first.

580
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,030
He's getting more attractive.

581
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,480
Staying here is better.

582
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,920
I dare not even breathe

583
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,090
with Director Lu around.

584
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Director Lu is handsome.

585
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,090
When he's wearing a suit,

586
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,920
he is extremely charming.

587
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,320
Working overtime with him

588
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,530
heals my eyes.

589
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,750
But, Lu Yiyao is too scary.

590
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,480
No one dares speak with him around.

591
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,320
What woman could stand him?

592
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,290
You can.

593
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:55,840
I think you can.

594
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
-You can.
-You.

595
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,920
I think you might be more efficient

596
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,290
if you just shut up.

597
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,400
Mi.

598
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,850
What's going on with

599
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,760
the labels on these bottles?

600
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,080
Anything wrong with that?

601
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,880
Can't you see?

602
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,560
The words are all blurry.

603
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,330
Look at this.

604
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,210
This is the previous batch of labels

605
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,360
that got rejected, right?

606
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,890
We're supposed to use the new one.

607
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,240
As long as the information is correct.

608
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,810
We'll put the new ones on later.

609
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,800
I mean, we're done with all these.

610
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,930
We can't just

611
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,650
do it all over again.

612
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,690
Besides,

613
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,880
it's too late.

614
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,070
No one will notice.

615
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,760
But if these...

616
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,120
My stomach hurts...

617
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,430
I'll bring her to the toilet.

618
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,050
-It hurts so much.
-What do you want to drink, Siyu?

619
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,200
I'll get you one.

620
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,130
You guys are going to the toilet

621
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,280
or to buy drinks?

622
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,810
Who is it?

623
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,760
Must be him.

624
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,410
At times like this,

625
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,490
the male lead will be here to help.

626
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,930
What are you doing all alone?

627
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,000
I...

628
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,550
This is the distribution of work.

629
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,970
You must strictly follow it.

630
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,910
Do not leave your position
without permission, understand?

631
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,280
Also?

632
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,450
Also,

633
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,240
don't forget the details

634
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,080
just because the time is running up.

635
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,520
Do everything perfectly.

636
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,290
Have you guys heard me?

637
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,410
Cai Siyu, why did you do that?

638
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,450
We didn't say we weren't gonna do it.

639
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,570
Exactly, what's the point of snitching?

640
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,080
I didn't.

641
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,850
Assistant He.

642
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,160
Whenever a job is done,
cross-check everything

643
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,490
like how you put the labels

644
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,390
on every product.

645
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,720
If you encounter a similar problem again,

646
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
keep me posted.

647
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,440
Okay.

648
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,480
What did you check?

649
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,520
Alright, go ahead.

650
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,290
What did I check?

651
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,410
Let's go.

652
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,120
He not only helped me,

653
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,760
but also got revenge on them,

654
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,730
and tried to keep me out of trouble.

655
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,730
What kind of perfect male lead is this?

656
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,080
I caused trouble
the first three times we met.

657
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,320
I am so sorry.

658
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,890
But without those three accidents,

659
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,040
how could we get to where we are today?

660
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,840
Come and get something to eat.

661
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,520
-Here.
-Hold this for a second.

662
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,560
Come on, come on.

663
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,720
The red ones are beef burgers

664
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,120
with beef patty and onions.

665
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,120
And this one is the chicken burger

666
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,890
-with fried chicken and tomatoes.
-I like fried chicken.

667
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,130
Siyu, which one do you want?

668
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,170
Can I have both?

669
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:21,880
I know I can't.

670
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,610
Then I'll have the chicken burger.

671
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,000
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

672
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:25,920
Director.

673
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,290
We have beef burgers and chicken burgers,

674
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,240
which one do you want?

675
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,120
Beef burger.

676
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,000
Alright.

677
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,720
Hi, this one, without the onions, thanks.

678
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,560
Okay.

679
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,840
What?

680
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,960
There's finally a chance for me?

681
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,240
That's enough.

682
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,330
Give them more.

683
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
I thought you didn't eat beef.

684
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,290
Here, chicken burger.

685
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,210
No?

686
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,920
Have a little more.

687
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,770
A little more.

688
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,810
Director Lu.

689
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,480
What's the matter?

690
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,210
Thank you.

691
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,929
For what?

692
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,250
You know, because of the labels,

693
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,600
you've reassigned our jobs.

I was trying to improve

695
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,880
the efficiency.

696

What's up?

697

You thought I did it for you?

Are we

700
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,520
turning into enemies again?

701
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,370
Such a cliche.

I didn't know

705
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,480
how you convinced Ms. Lu

706
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,000
to let you get into Deer Sing.

707
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,120
But I hope

708
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,250
that you're capable enough

709
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,360

See?

712
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,400
That's usually how it goes.

713
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,400
You won't be willing to let me go later.

714

Why do you call me here to check on

723
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,240
the exhibition at such a late hour?

724
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,010
Director Lu.

725
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,690
Fangning.

726
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,410
Look.

727
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,760
All the arrangements

728
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,600
are done already.

729
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,160
Two days later,
we can launch it on time.

730
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,880
Let's take a look over here.

731
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,360
Let's go. Mr. Li, come and have a look.

732
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,280
This couch was designed by

733
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,760
Infinity's designer, Gavin.

734
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,930
It's also the main product

735
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,240
of our exhibition then.

736
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,680
During the interview,

737
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:18,840
we'll have the designer up here

738
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,080
to receive the interview.

739
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,840
I think it's all good here.

740
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,080
Why don't we look somewhere else?

741
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,720
Wait a minute.

742
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,560
I think there's something wrong with

743
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,400
the couch's position.

744
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,610
What do you think, Simon?

745
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,010
Maybe it's the lighting.

746
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:34,960
I'll tell you what.

747
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,730
Mr. Li.

748
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,210
Why don't you go up there and give it try?

749
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,600
We can get your feedback directly.

750
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,650
It's all good.

Don't make a big deal out of it.

Making furniture

Besides, this couch really matches

755
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,720
a successful man like Mr. Li.

756

Give it a try.

00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,160
Please.

758
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,560
Mr. Li, don't be so nervous.

759
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,280
You've seen everything.

This couch really matches

Let's turn right.

Maybe it's the lighting.

Mr. Li's face is.

Mr. Li, sit down. We're not in a hurry.

Director Lu,

772
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,800
even though we don't have much time left,

773
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,760
but we still have to do our best

774
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,800
to make it perfect.

775
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,520
Yes. We have limited time.

we can do better than this.

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,650
The plan was made in advance.

00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,000
Why did the exhibition hall

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,010
suddenly change their mind?

our own staff.

797

I've checked on it.
