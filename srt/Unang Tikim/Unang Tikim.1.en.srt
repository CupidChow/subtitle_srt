00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:25,207
Is this how it's going to be?

3
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:27,547
It's always the same thing
over and over again!

4
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,414
Hey! Tell me the truth!

5
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,955
You like that guy?

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,730
You want to have sex with him?

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,327
It's so obvious that guy
was flirting with you!

8
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:37,211
We fight and make up.

9
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:39,069
- That's how our relationship is.
- Well, I get it.

10
00:00:39,093 --> 00:00:40,303
He's rich!

11
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:42,766
- Who hasn't gone through that?
- You're going too far!

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,476
- You're so paranoid!
- Especially with their first.

13
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:49,633
- You will feel all kinds of emotions.
- And what? Just because he's rich?

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,772
- Is that how low you think of me?
- The mess,

15
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:53,390
- Tell me! Just because he's rich?
- the pain,

16
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:54,733
- Unbelievable...
- the joys,

17
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:57,187
- My life's plagued with problems!
- the pleasures.

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,214
- I can't believe you'd think that way!
- But despite of everything,

19
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:01,578
- Let's break up.
- we love each other.

20
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:04,018
- Are you kidding me?
- Just because we fight

21
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:05,595
- Please! I'm sick of this!
- doesn't mean we stop loving.

22
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:09,039
Sometimes there are those
who only want to feel the love.

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,412
I'm sick of fighting!

24
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:12,719
It feels nice...

25
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:15,242
even though you don't
understand each other

26
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,435
in the end,

27
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:19,484
you will be back in
each other's arms.

28
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:22,195
Isn't that how it should be?

29
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,280
If you love someone,

30
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,399
you stay.

31
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:29,734
Yuna!

32
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:35,344
Shit! Damn this life!

We got it. Look.

36
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,959
- It's beautiful
- I love it.

37
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,725
Let's print it.

38
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:01,686
Oh, wait a sec.

39
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:03,587
Take your time, Babs.

40
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:05,656
I'm getting suspicious.

41
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:06,867
Wait, wait.

42
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:08,576
Is that really yours?

43
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:11,076
Before that,

44
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,251
check this out.

45
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:14,448
Hang on.

46
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:15,935
Close your eyes.

47
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:18,365
Come on!

48
00:03:18,602 --> 00:03:19,770
- Close your eyes!
- What is it?

49
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,436
Close your eyes. There we go.

50
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,678
Don't peek, okay?

51
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:25,686
Don't peek! Hey!

52
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:29,430
Okay, Babs.

53
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:30,531
Open your eyes.

54
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:36,022
Babs! How sweet!

55
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:37,731
It's so pretty.

56
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:41,100
There we go.

57
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:44,147
- There!
- Thank you!

58
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,102
Wait. You're not the only one.

59
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,147
- You got me something?
- Of course!

60
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:53,938
She won't be bested!

61
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:55,772
- You know me.
- I really do.

62
00:03:55,797 --> 00:03:57,548
What do you have there?

63
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:02,527
- Close your eyes.
- Okay, I'll close my eyes.

64
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:06,818
- Can I open my eyes now?
- Yes.

65
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:10,841
Whoa!

66
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:15,743
This was from when we first met.

67
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:17,428
My everyday rider.

68
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,414
Our first monthsary.

69
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,761
Wow, Babs.

70
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:26,378
Our first monthsary.

71
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:28,614
Also our first try to...

72
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,522
Self-love!

73
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,475
- Our first date.
- First date with first love.

74
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,647
Aww....

75
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:43,591
This one.

76
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:44,880
We went here...

77
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:46,811
It was the first time you kissed me.

78
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,612
First monthsary.

79
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:52,846
- Second.
- It's so cute, Babs.

80
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:54,623
I love it.

81
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:56,617
I love it so much.

82
00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:59,045
I want us to fill all the pages.

83
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:01,223
With our pictures.

84
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:03,106
We can keep the videos on our phones.

85
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,842
On our phones for now.

86
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,261
Don't you just love this place?

87
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:10,217
It's beautiful.

88
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:11,732
Like you.

89
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:14,717
Me?

90
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:20,599
This is my favorite place,
especially when I'm with you.

91
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:22,967
Oh please.

92
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:26,480
Aren't you tired of it yet?
We always go here.

93
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:27,912
And I'm always your view.

94
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:30,442
Never! You said 'yes' to me here.

95
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:32,990
So it's very special to me.

96
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:34,815
You're right.

97
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:37,991
This is where you first
stole a kiss from me.

98
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:40,269
Yes, fine.

99
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:42,145
That's what I did.

100
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,170
I did steal that kiss.

101
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,795
Come on. Let's go home.

102
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:49,995
Why?

103
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:51,362
We're gonna do something.

104
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,073
Yes, that's it.

105
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:00,943
There we go.

106
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:06,186
Are we done yet?

107
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:07,713
Almost.

108
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:09,412
I want them to look really good.

109
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:14,498
I need to submit an entry
to a photo contest in Berlin.

110
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,068
I wanna join.

111
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:18,942
Come on, pose.

112
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,709
Okay…

113
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,191
Alright. Last shot.
Last shot for tonight.

114
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:29,771
Give me a killer pose.

115
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,748
I got it.

116
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:35,299
- There...
- Let me see.

117
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:36,389
I'm satisfied.

118
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:42,810
Wow! It's beautiful!

119
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:44,892
- Right?
- The model is giving

120
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,744
France Bulletin, portfolio.

121
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:54,022
The photographer is giving
breezy from Caloocan?

122
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:55,075
Really now?

123
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,528
- Ouch!
- You meanie.

124
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:59,072
Ouch! Hey!

125
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:01,600
- Wait.
- Hey!

126
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,251
You'll be sorry.

127
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:06,326

Oh, good morning.

131
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:27,023
My Babs is so sweet.

132
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:28,704
You're spoiling me.

133
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:30,384
I won't let you leave.

134
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:41,471
Oh!

135
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:47,908
Hello, Ma.

136
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:50,390
Becca, what's keeping you?

137
00:08:50,415 --> 00:08:52,322
When are you gonna fix your VISA?

138
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,869
Let's not talk about that.

139
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:58,942
Becca, you just keep putting it off.

140
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:00,360
You were supposed to follow.

141
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:03,509
Is Yuna keeping you there?

142
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,822
I need to go.
I'll update you.

143
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,376
Okay? I'll call you later.

144
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,125
What's wrong?

145
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,959
Uh...

146
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:18,320
Mom's just nagging me.

147
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,523
About?

148
00:09:21,254 --> 00:09:23,132
My US Visa.

149
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,712
So you'll be going away soon.

150
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:44,052
You should see to that.
For your future, okay?

151
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,044
You want me to leave.

152
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:51,661
Hey, hey!

153
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,911
There she goes again.

154
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:57,582
And besides,

155
00:09:58,276 --> 00:10:00,997
just think about all the
opportunities that'll open up.

156
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,122
Then once you become
a famous photographer,

157
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:12,200
hire me as your model, okay?

158
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:14,227
So we'll both get rich.

159
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:29,489
You're just crazy about me, aren't you?

160
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:32,119
You're never gonna wanna leave.

161
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:36,113
I never wanted to
leave in the first place.

162
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,934
I don't want to leave you behind.

163
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:40,502
Why don't you come with me?

164
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:44,881
Geez. If I had a lot of money,

165
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:47,583
I'd go anywhere with you.

166
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,866
I'm not rich like you.

167
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:56,606
- Well, let's eat.
- Let's eat.

168
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:58,474
Ah!

169
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:02,774
So good!

170
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,558
- I love your cooking.
- Of course.

171
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,880
I prepared it for you.

172
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:06,404
Thank you.

173
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,596
You good?

174
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:16,393
Sir!

175
00:12:16,556 --> 00:12:17,933
Good afternoon.

176
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,459
Hey, Yuna.

177
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:20,549
Boss is here.

178
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:23,563
Sir, this is Yuna.

179
00:12:23,588 --> 00:12:24,814
She's our new hire.

180
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:26,319
Hi, sir.

181
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,658
Good afternoon.

182
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:30,532
Yuna, this is sir Nico.

183
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:32,864
He'll be in charge
starting tomorrow.

184
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:33,889
Okay?

185
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,759
How are our supplies?
Did they come in yet?

186
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:41,123
Yes, sir. They're complete.

187
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:44,441
Psst.

188
00:12:45,277 --> 00:12:46,653
He's handsome, right?

189
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:48,627
Right?

190
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,562
Becca's outside.

191
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:16,491
Fine, keep ganging up on me!

192
00:13:16,516 --> 00:13:17,642
Get out!

193
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:19,978
- I'm leaving this!
- Son of a bitch!

194
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:21,438
- Damn it!
- That's my money

195
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:22,439
you're spending on crack!

196
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:24,149
Asshole! Eat shit!

197
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:25,483
Get out of my house!

198
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:26,710
Get out!

199
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:27,777
What are you waiting for?

200
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:29,838
Get out! Get out of my house!

201
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:31,823
- You jerk! Traitor!
- Auntie, that's enough.

202
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:35,452
Son of a bitch!
You are hurting my daughter!

203
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:39,011
Get out of my house,
you bastard!

204
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,348
Bastard! Piece of shit!

205
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:43,835
- Damn you two, you're dirt poor!
- Screw you!

206
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:45,341
- Eat shit, asshole!
- Asshole!

207
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,147
- Damn you!
- Screw you too!

208
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:50,098
Get out, deadbeat
freeloading piece of shit!

209
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:55,622
What happened?

210
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:01,746
Dear.

211
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:07,917
Let's clean your wound.

212
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,903
I'm sorry, dear.

213
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:14,145
Don't worry,

214
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,857
that bastard's not
coming back here.

215
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,286
- Ouch.
- That piece of shit.

216
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:24,156
Does it hurt?

217
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:26,054
Auntie, want me to do it?

218
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,773
Okay.

219
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:32,297
- I'll go get something downstairs.
- Okay, auntie.

220
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:33,490
Thank you.

221
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,191
Son of a bitch! That's what I'm saying.

222
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:01,620
We got disconnected.

223
00:15:01,763 --> 00:15:03,765
Christ's sake. I knew it.

224
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,418
I gave him the money
for the electricity bill.

225
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:07,722
He blew it on drugs.

226
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:09,714
God's sake.

227
00:15:11,581 --> 00:15:13,208
It's okay, Auntie.

228
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:14,636
I'll take care of it.

229
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:16,675
I'll pay it tomorrow.

230
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:18,134
What?

231
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,019
Oh my...

232
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,822
I really appreciate it, Becca.

233
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:27,151
I'm really sorry.

234
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:28,339
It's nothing, Auntie.

235
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,675
What's this?

236
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:52,503
Here.

237
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:54,612
Use it.

238
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:58,269
I don't want to.

239
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,011
It's yours.
You saved that money.

240
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:02,626
Please take it.

241
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:04,097
You need it.

242
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:07,154
What good am I if I can't even
help you with your problems?

243
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:09,540
Thank you.

244
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:32,808
- Babs.
- Babs.

245
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:46,656
Babs, I think you need
to stop smoking.

246
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:54,284
Yes, ma'am. Sorry. I will try.

247
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,543
You're busy?

248
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:13,274
Not really.

249
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:20,610
Just applying to
universities in the US.

250
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:31,613
Maybe I can work there part-time.

251
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:35,095
Then when I've got
enough saved up,

252
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,794
I'll fly you there.

253
00:17:40,797 --> 00:17:43,825
Babs, what did I tell you?

254
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,153
Think about yourself
and your studies first.

255
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:49,931
As for me, I'll graduate

256
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:51,808
and put up a coffee shop.

257
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,312
As soon as I've done that,

258
00:17:56,337 --> 00:17:57,916
I'll follow you.

259
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:07,390
I hope all your dreams come true.

260
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,163
Dear?

261
00:19:14,874 --> 00:19:17,118
- Mom.
- Becca, you're here.

262
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:19,555
Hello, auntie.

263
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:21,814
Dear, do you have
extra 500 pesos?

264
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,298
Yes, mom.

265
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,289
Here.

266
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:27,962
Thanks.

267
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:30,556
I'll leave you to it.

268
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:31,829
I have a game.

269
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:34,310
- Okay, mom. Be safe.
- Take care, auntie.

270
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:52,226
Mom, what are you doing?

271
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:54,305
I bought some groceries.

272
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,282
For dinner later.

273
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:58,345
[groans]

274
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:04,165
Uh... Dear...

275
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:08,654
Mom, what happened?

276
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:13,196
Your tuition money...

277
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:16,829
Joey took it.

278
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:20,581
Mom, what the hell!

279
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:24,523
Why'd he have to take
my tuition money too?

280
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:26,953
Besides...

281
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:30,050
And I thought you said he
wasn't coming back anymore?

282
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:32,052
Uh...

283
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,554
Well, I'm sorry, dear.

284
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:36,889
I couldn't stop him.

285
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:38,182
He just barged in.

286
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,268
And went straight to
where I'm hiding it.

287
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:43,790
Why do you keep letting him in?

288
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:47,274
I didn’t know he would
touch that money, too!

289
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:48,907
He's an addict.

290
00:20:49,318 --> 00:20:51,738
An addict's an addict.

291
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:54,056
They're never gonna change.

292
00:20:57,037 --> 00:20:58,828
Nevermind, dear.

293
00:21:00,246 --> 00:21:02,623
I'll just sell off some
of our furniture, okay?

294
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:07,003
And I've got income
coming in a few days.

295
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,480
Mom, it's the same thing
over and over again!

296
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,352
Dear…

297
00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:20,009
I'm really sorry, dear.

298
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,375
Just write a promissory note.

299
00:21:30,676 --> 00:21:32,678
Do you have extra 500?

300
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:57,487
Is there a problem?

301
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:01,253
Hey…

302
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:07,105
My tuition money...

303
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:11,234
my mom's boyfriend stole it.

304
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,256
I don't get it, Babs.

305
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,227
Why is living so hard?

306
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:26,639
Did I do something wrong?

307
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:32,911
If my father was here...

308
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,841
None of this would be happening.

309
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:45,022
Don't cry.

310
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:48,222
I'm right here.

311
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:46,757
Bro, you don’t have a chance.

312
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,384
Why?

313
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:52,181
She's not into dudes.

314
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:54,290
She's dating Brenda's cousin.

315
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:55,713
Really?

316
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:57,837
Yeah, what a waste, huh?

317
00:23:57,862 --> 00:23:59,817
That's too bad. She's so hot.

318
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:02,517
You can try.

319
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,337
Might give in.

320
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:06,556
She's hot.

321
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:09,243
It's only her first relationship after all.

322
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:23,950
Hey! What happened to you?

323
00:24:24,786 --> 00:24:27,056
What are you even thinking about?

324
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,080
It's nothing.

325
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:30,290
Just lack of sleep.

326
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:34,310
Did my cousin wear you out?

327
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:37,129
You know her.

328
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:39,299
Not really into loud parties.

329
00:24:39,324 --> 00:24:42,047
She's always been a killjoy.

330
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:44,602
[background chatter]

331
00:24:44,627 --> 00:24:47,099
Oh, hey! Hi there!

332
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:49,141
- Hi, Nico!
- Hi, Brens.

333
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:52,243
- Happy birthday!
- Hey, thanks!

334
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:54,730
This is Yuna.

335
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:59,616
- Hi, Yuna!
- Hello, hello sir!

336
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:02,985
- You've met.
- Yeah.

337
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:06,313
That's great!

338
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:12,481
- Oh, yeah, she's our new crew.
- I'll go over there first.

339
00:25:15,052 --> 00:25:18,508
Yuna's got a girlfriend.

340
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:22,382
Yeah! And she doesn't like eggplants.

341
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:23,852
She likes peanuts.

342
00:25:23,877 --> 00:25:27,751
Let's find you someone else.

343
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:49,022
Yuna!

344
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:52,327
Yuna.

345
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:55,280
- Yuna.
- Oh!

346
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,061
- Let me drive you home.
- Hey, boss.

347
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,319
I was just leaving too.

348
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:05,259
Is this your car, boss?

349
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:08,132
- Oh... Yeah.
- Wow.

350
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,689
Nice.

351
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:13,498
Let's go.

352
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:15,724
I insist.

353
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:19,374
It's hard to find a ride this late.

354
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:20,969
Let's go?

355
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:24,881
Come on. Get in.

356
00:26:25,624 --> 00:26:26,624
Here.

357
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:00,303
Geez…

358
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,746
Who was that?

359
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:26,746
My boss.

360
00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:28,159
He just dropped me off.

361
00:27:33,497 --> 00:27:34,988
Mmm…

362
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,277
Your boss.

363
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:39,012
Yeah.

364
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:41,902
He was at Brenda's party.

365
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:44,254
Turns out they
know each other.

366
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,761
That's why you haven't
been answering my calls.

367
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,207
Oh, you called?

368
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:55,418
Sorry, Babs. I didn't notice.

369
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,777
You didn't notice?

370
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:00,583
Or you were busy
with someone else?

371
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:03,211
Looks like you had lots of fun.

372
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:07,173
What's your problem again?

373
00:28:08,465 --> 00:28:11,871
If you just went to
your cousin's birthday,

374
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:14,628
then you wouldn't be paranoid!

375
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:19,227
You're making a big deal
out of nothing.

376
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:24,088
It literally takes one
second to press a button.

377
00:28:25,816 --> 00:28:28,152
I didn't hear my phone ring.

378
00:28:28,177 --> 00:28:30,097
Is that my fault?

379
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:39,187
You know what, Babs?

380
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:40,858
Enough already.

381
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,305
Let's not fight.

382
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:46,635
I'm drunk, okay?

383
00:28:49,203 --> 00:28:54,187
And I don't want to
indulge your paranoia.

384
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:26,303
Visit Katworld.net

385
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:36,303
Hey. Go to her.

386
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:38,167
Let me do that.

387
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:54,145
Sorry.

388
00:29:54,408 --> 00:29:55,716
I cooked you something.

389
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,325
Okay.

390
00:30:00,504 --> 00:30:03,099
I should go. Busy day.

391
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,263
Okay.

392
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:09,013
Your shoelaces.

393
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:33,969
I'll go ahead.

394
00:30:35,262 --> 00:30:36,325
Bye.

395
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:04,575
Dear, I had to sell off our furniture.

396
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:05,833
Mom!

397
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,520
We're flat broke.

398
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,161
Well...

399
00:31:11,924 --> 00:31:13,591
Maybe we could

400
00:31:14,343 --> 00:31:17,317
ask Becca's mom for money?

401
00:31:17,654 --> 00:31:19,031
No way, mom!

402
00:31:19,056 --> 00:31:20,903
Aren't you ashamed?

403
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,369
But they're rich!

404
00:31:23,394 --> 00:31:25,755
They won't miss a few thousands!

405
00:31:26,024 --> 00:31:27,403
Mom, stop it.

406
00:31:27,606 --> 00:31:29,442
It's disgusting.

407
00:31:30,968 --> 00:31:32,497
I’m still your mother.

408
00:31:32,611 --> 00:31:34,677
Don't talk to me like that.

409
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,489
Huh?

410
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:50,419
Hello?

411
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:52,786
Hello, Babs.

412
00:31:53,082 --> 00:31:54,731
My visa got approved.

413
00:31:57,365 --> 00:31:58,365
Oh!

414
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:00,724
Congrats, Babs!

415
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:02,325
Thank you, Babs.

416
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:05,114
I love you, Babs.

417
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:06,345
Love you.

418
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:08,041
Bye.

419
00:32:14,606 --> 00:32:16,083
- Ah!
- Oh my god!

420
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,631
Stupid!

421
00:32:17,656 --> 00:32:20,669
- I'm sorry, sir! Sorry!
- What have you done?

422
00:32:20,694 --> 00:32:23,011
I still have somewhere to be!

423
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,013
- I'm sorry, sir!
- Sorry? I'm soaked!

424
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:26,682
Sir, sir. Sorry, sir!

425
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:28,392
What sorry?
My shirt is ruined!

426
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,477
I took a freaking shower!
I'm all wet!

427
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:32,099
I'm really sorry, sir.

428
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:34,559
We're sorry.

429
00:32:35,065 --> 00:32:37,503
We have a comfort room at the back.

430
00:32:37,528 --> 00:32:39,653
Please use it to clean up.

431
00:32:39,678 --> 00:32:41,346
Excuse me! You stupid idiot!

432
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:43,161
Imbecile!

433
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,285
Sorry, boss.

434
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:50,539
I'm really sorry.

435
00:32:50,564 --> 00:32:53,133
Take a break. I'll handle this.

436
00:33:01,235 --> 00:33:02,850
I'm very sorry, sir.

437
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:05,947
Don't worry about it.

438
00:33:06,513 --> 00:33:08,015
Just enjoy your food.

439
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,187
Mm, it's good.

440
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:14,674
Really good!

441
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:19,341
Next time, just rest
if you're tired.

442
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:21,695
I promise, boss.

443
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,747
It won't happen again.

444
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:25,115
I'll hold you to that.

445
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,245
Promise.

446
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,770
Here. Eat some fruit.

447
00:33:29,795 --> 00:33:32,349
You lack vitamins.

448
00:33:36,543 --> 00:33:37,586
You good, boss?

449
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:42,013
What I get for
acting cool. I choked.

450
00:33:54,086 --> 00:33:56,188
Shit, she's still not back.

451
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,145
They said you
came by the shop.

452
00:34:23,941 --> 00:34:26,130
You should have called me.

453
00:34:26,328 --> 00:34:28,121
You could have said hi.

454
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:32,583
Look at you.

455
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,599
Now you're drinking.

456
00:34:46,108 --> 00:34:48,596
I wanted us to have lunch together.

457
00:34:49,644 --> 00:34:53,878
But you were already
having lunch with your boss.

458
00:34:55,471 --> 00:34:56,791
You two were so sweet.

459
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:04,409
This again?

460
00:35:04,698 --> 00:35:05,698
Huh?

461
00:35:06,528 --> 00:35:08,505
It's always the same shit.

462
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,101
Tell me the truth.

463
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:20,147
Are you falling for that guy?

464
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:23,878
So what,

465
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:25,736
you're into guys now?

466
00:35:29,865 --> 00:35:32,451
It's so obvious he's trying
to get into your pants

467
00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:34,721
and you're just letting him!

468
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:36,791
No surprise there.

469
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,308
He's rich!

470
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:41,919
You're crossing a line.

471
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:46,381
You're making an issue
out of every thing!

472
00:35:49,301 --> 00:35:52,387
And what did you say?

473
00:35:52,412 --> 00:35:53,413
He's rich?

474
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:54,831
You think it's because he's rich?

475
00:35:54,856 --> 00:35:57,734
Do you think so little of me?

476
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,479
Because he's rich?

477
00:36:00,504 --> 00:36:01,938
Son of a bitch!

478
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:03,965
My life is full of problems,

479
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,467
even this relationship,

480
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:06,932
is also a problem?

481
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:12,700
If it's always going to be like this,

482
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:14,284
let's just break up!

483
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:15,996
Don't touch me!

484
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:18,705
- Yuna...
- Stop it.

485
00:36:19,706 --> 00:36:21,750
I'm so sick of this!

486
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,169
This is going nowhere!

487
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,667
- Yuna...
- All we do is fight!

488
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:27,964
I'm at work all day,

489
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:30,229
and this is what
I come home to?

490
00:36:30,406 --> 00:36:31,449
Yuna...

491
00:36:31,635 --> 00:36:33,423
Yuna, sorry!

492
00:36:33,448 --> 00:36:35,739
Yuna! Yuna! Sorry.

493
00:36:36,556 --> 00:36:38,266
Yuna! Yuna!

494
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:41,284
Yuna! Yuna! Sorry.

495
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:42,646
Yuna...

496
00:36:43,642 --> 00:36:44,806
Sorry.

497
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
I'm sorry.

498
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:48,057
Yuna...

499
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,198
Yuna!

500
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,439
Stop!

501
00:36:51,984 --> 00:36:54,745
Yuna! Yuna!

502
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,638
I actually want to marry you
right after I graduate!

503
00:37:16,663 --> 00:37:18,486
Really? You're gonna marry me?

504
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:20,464
Yeah! Don't you want to?

505
00:37:20,748 --> 00:37:22,625
It's us in the end.

506
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,785
I also think about
getting married.

507
00:37:25,647 --> 00:37:27,691
But you know people.

508
00:37:27,716 --> 00:37:29,800
They still expect us to marry men.

"Panaginip"
Performed by: EMN'98

510
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:05,257
Babs?

511
00:38:05,347 --> 00:38:07,109
Becca, do you have
everything ready?

512
00:38:07,397 --> 00:38:09,024
You're leaving in two weeks.

513
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:12,265
Don't bring unnecessary things.

514
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:16,257
A caretaker will look after
the house when you leave.

515
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:18,201
Okay, Mom.

516
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:20,430
I've packed my things.

517
00:38:20,836 --> 00:38:22,351
- I'll see you.
- Okay, Becca.

518
00:38:22,376 --> 00:38:25,101
- Bye, take care.
- Bye.

519
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:30,231
Girl, here's the tea.

520
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:32,631
The guy cheated.

521
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:34,709
And Ms. Girl

522
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,636
tried to unalive herself
because of it.

523
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:39,763
- Huh?
- Wild!

524
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:41,232
That's why LDR is a no for me.

525
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:42,508
- I can't stand it.
- It's awful, yeah?

526
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,893
- Your boyfriend's in Dubai, right?
- So you broke up. I get it.

527
00:38:44,918 --> 00:38:46,670
All you do is work.

528
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:48,506
Eat up! Here.

529
00:38:49,365 --> 00:38:50,770
There we go.

530
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,529
- Delicious, right?
- Hi, Yuna!

531
00:38:52,554 --> 00:38:53,597
Sir!

532
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,896
Brens. Guys, hi.

533
00:38:57,295 --> 00:38:59,263
I'll just go to the counter.

534
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:04,935
- Come here.
- Girl, Nico's into you.

535
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,123
Does he have a chance, though?

536
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:09,459
She's dating my cousin, silly.

537
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:13,296
- Think what you like.
- I gotta get back.

538
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:14,340
- Okay.
- This is mine now.

539
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:16,032
- I gotta get back.
- Thank you. Love you!

540
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:17,209
Bye! Love you!

541
00:39:41,317 --> 00:39:42,388
Yuna.

542
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:48,138
Yuna.

543
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:51,818
- Sir.
- Wow, seems like you're deep in thought.

544
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:53,357
Is there a problem?

545
00:39:57,754 --> 00:39:58,908
I have an idea.

546
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:00,389
Since it's Friday night,

547
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:03,006
we should go drinking.

548
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:05,154
My treat.

549
00:40:07,976 --> 00:40:11,209
They say when you're drinking,

550
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:13,091
you feel more at ease.

551
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:15,810
You can vent out to me.

552
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:17,568
I'm ready to listen.

553
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,201
Life is hard, huh?

554
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:28,997
Well, you probably can't relate.

555
00:40:29,022 --> 00:40:30,857
Because you're busy,

556
00:40:30,882 --> 00:40:33,116
you have a coffee shop.

557
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,045
You're running so many businesses.

558
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,321
Wish I was, too.

559
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:38,356
Whatever it is
you're going through,

560
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,425
go through it

561
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,219
but don't dwell on it.

562
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:44,804
One day, you'll understand

563
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:46,537
why it had to happen that way.

564
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,545
You're not all looks after all.

565
00:40:50,726 --> 00:40:52,061
I told you.

566
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:54,271
You underestimate me.

567
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,591
Full shot.

568
00:40:56,616 --> 00:40:59,619
Whoever loses, drinks again.

569
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:03,654
- Sure. Call.
- Hell yeah! G!

570
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:06,045
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

571
00:43:24,114 --> 00:43:27,575
Son of a bitch!

572
00:44:08,004 --> 00:44:10,226
You're leaving tomorrow.

573
00:44:12,793 --> 00:44:15,724
Sorry for everything that I said.

574
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:23,537
You didn't deserve any of that.

575
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:30,201
I dragged you in
my own problems.

576
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:36,685
I think...

577
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:40,514
it's better if

578
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,162
we go our separate ways.

579
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:51,786
Rather than keep
hurting each other.

580
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:38,180
Cheers!

581
00:47:38,212 --> 00:47:40,762
- I missed you girls!
- I missed you!

582
00:47:40,787 --> 00:47:42,830
Becca's studio
looks super fancy.

583
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,099
Maybe she married
a rich foreigner.

584
00:47:45,124 --> 00:47:46,559
How are you girls?

585
00:47:46,584 --> 00:47:49,045
We're planning to
have a baby now.

586
00:47:49,045 --> 00:47:50,088
- Congrats!
- Wow!

587
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:52,126
What about you, Yuna?

588
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:54,836
What's new, Yuna?

589
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:56,694
When are you and Nico getting married?

590
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,922
We've been too busy lately, but...

591
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:01,157
We're doing well.

592
00:48:01,182 --> 00:48:03,309
I'm handling the business
while he's away.

593
00:48:03,334 --> 00:48:04,923
Oh, that's why.

594
00:48:04,962 --> 00:48:07,538
- And let's drink to that!
- Cheers?

595
00:48:07,563 --> 00:48:11,087
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

596
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:36,884
Hi, guys!

597
00:48:38,986 --> 00:48:40,413
Yuna.

598
00:48:40,438 --> 00:48:41,814
Becca.

599
00:48:42,657 --> 00:48:44,283
It's been a while.

600
00:48:44,472 --> 00:48:46,030
It has.

601
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,716
Four years?

602
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:44,821
You vape now.

603
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:47,365
Only when I'm stressed.

604
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:52,316
Are you stressed right now?

605
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,044
What are you working on,
by the way?

606
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,139
I do freelance
photography for events.

607
00:51:04,164 --> 00:51:06,241
Uh... parties,

608
00:51:06,362 --> 00:51:07,696
weddings,

609
00:51:07,743 --> 00:51:09,233
concerts…

610
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,694
Things got busy in the U.S.

611
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:12,803
Lots of gigs.

612
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:16,377
Wow, Ms. Hotshot.

613
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:18,295
Nah.

614
00:51:19,395 --> 00:51:20,790
I'm still the old me.

615
00:51:22,137 --> 00:51:26,006
I'm happy with what
you've accomplished.

616
00:51:27,395 --> 00:51:29,647
Despite what we went through.

617
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:36,373
Life is what it is,
as they say.

618
00:51:36,696 --> 00:51:37,834
Things happen.

619
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:40,153
Besides, we were young.

620
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:43,248
Messed up,

621
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,209
immature,

622
00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:46,996
toxic.

623
00:52:09,742 --> 00:52:11,119
I'm gonna go ahead.

624
00:52:11,182 --> 00:52:12,767
Got somewhere else to be.

625
00:52:13,983 --> 00:52:16,402
- Okay, take care.
- Take care.

626
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,705
Take care.

627
00:52:18,898 --> 00:52:19,976
Alright.

628
00:52:39,435 --> 00:52:41,103
Friend, emergency.

629
00:52:41,174 --> 00:52:43,852
Becca's nude model stood us up.

630
00:52:43,881 --> 00:52:45,508
Know someone who could fill in?

631
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:47,501
Becca is stressed.

632
00:52:57,645 --> 00:53:07,822
I can do it.

633
00:53:20,045 --> 00:53:23,584
Really? Perfect!
I'll let her know.

634
00:53:47,242 --> 00:53:48,242
Ah...

635
00:53:48,487 --> 00:53:49,843
You're here.

636
00:53:50,225 --> 00:53:51,342
Come in.

637
00:54:04,622 --> 00:54:06,280
You have a cool studio.

638
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:13,444
Thanks for coming.

639
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:15,773
On such short notice.

640
00:54:17,433 --> 00:54:18,684
It's okay.

641
00:54:19,108 --> 00:54:23,757
I have time, and...
I kind of missed our pictorials.

642
00:54:30,237 --> 00:54:31,405
All right.

643
00:54:31,445 --> 00:54:33,375
This was your dream.
You made it.

644
00:54:34,881 --> 00:54:39,346
Would you like coffee, juice, food?

645
00:54:39,371 --> 00:54:40,539
Are you hungry?

646
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:42,216
Where's the bathroom?

647
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:46,420
Ah, it's the door to the right.

648
00:54:46,445 --> 00:54:47,571
Okay.

649
00:54:50,382 --> 00:54:52,968
So, are you ready?

650
00:54:53,351 --> 00:54:54,429
Ready.

651
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,429
Okay.

652
00:55:01,481 --> 00:55:02,593
Game.

653
00:55:05,266 --> 00:55:07,171
Okay, one more.

654
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:09,351
Okay.

655
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:12,374
Okay, just look here.

656
00:55:12,399 --> 00:55:13,734
Yes, that's good.

657
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:24,325
- Hello, babe?
- Where are you?

658
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:25,747
On my way home.

659
00:55:25,892 --> 00:55:27,481
Okay.

660
00:55:27,711 --> 00:55:29,169
I'll call you later.

661
00:55:29,194 --> 00:55:30,247
Take care.

662
00:55:32,093 --> 00:55:34,028
Your boyfriend's looking for you.

663
00:55:34,256 --> 00:55:36,286
He's fine.

664
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,788
So, are we done?

665
00:55:39,865 --> 00:55:41,534
Yeah.

666
00:55:41,668 --> 00:55:43,051
Thanks again.

667
00:55:43,545 --> 00:55:44,551
No worries.

668
00:55:47,362 --> 00:55:49,447
- I'll go get dressed.
- Yeah, okay.

669
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:50,630
Take care.

670
00:57:08,575 --> 00:57:13,871
[Yuna mumbling]

671
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:20,566
[Yuna mumbling]

672
00:57:23,913 --> 00:57:25,237
Uh, hello?

673
00:57:25,454 --> 00:57:27,238
We're closed.

674
00:57:43,807 --> 00:57:44,901
Hey.

675
00:57:45,385 --> 00:57:46,543
Becca.

676
00:57:51,188 --> 00:57:52,231
Hello.

677
00:57:52,256 --> 00:57:53,756
Sorry to bother you.

678
00:57:54,172 --> 00:57:57,379
Brenda said I'd find you here.

679
00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:01,793
Have a seat.

680
00:58:07,865 --> 00:58:09,239
Thanks.

681
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:16,684
Uh...

682
00:58:17,864 --> 00:58:19,450
Did you need something?

683
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:23,362
I was gonna ask if
you're available next week.

684
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:25,577
I need a model.

685
00:58:25,948 --> 00:58:27,616
But this time,

686
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:29,621
you'll be one of two subjects.

687
00:58:29,866 --> 00:58:32,786
So I wondered if
you want to do it again.

688
00:58:33,188 --> 00:58:34,574
Sure thing.

689
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:43,848
Want anything to drink?

690
00:58:44,366 --> 00:58:47,703
No, I don't want to trouble you.

691
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:50,622
Wait, stay there!

692
00:58:50,622 --> 00:58:52,683
I'll make you our best-seller.

693
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:54,793
Thanks.

694
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,090
Thank you.

695
00:59:42,925 --> 00:59:45,094
I remember the first time

696
00:59:45,094 --> 00:59:46,779
you made me coffee.

697
00:59:49,036 --> 00:59:51,053
You still remember that?

698
00:59:52,309 --> 00:59:53,530
Of course.

699
00:59:53,877 --> 00:59:56,584
First times are hard to forget.

700
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,717
Your dream of owning
a coffee shop finally happened.

701
01:00:05,775 --> 01:00:07,239
Still a long way to go.

702
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:09,372
As they say,

703
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,804
I've gone so far but
still a long way to go.

704
01:00:13,347 --> 01:00:14,556
Actually,

705
01:00:14,581 --> 01:00:17,983
my boyfriend owns
this coffee shop.

706
01:00:18,811 --> 01:00:21,063
He's managing it

707
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:22,840
but he's always on business trips.

708
01:00:22,865 --> 01:00:25,358
I'm just filling in for him.

709
01:00:28,704 --> 01:00:30,623
So you guys ended up together.

710
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:23,208
Alright, pose.

711
01:01:23,233 --> 01:01:24,610
Okay. One, two…

712
01:01:25,162 --> 01:01:26,578
Get this out of the way.

713
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:27,953
- Let's remove it.
- Okay.

714
01:01:30,157 --> 01:01:31,985
Let's fix your hair.

715
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:33,626
There.

716
01:01:35,753 --> 01:01:36,984
There.

717
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,766
One, two...

718
01:01:42,493 --> 01:01:43,499
Place it here.

719
01:01:44,188 --> 01:01:45,188
There.

720
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,773
This is good?

721
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:47,966
You fox.

722
01:01:51,762 --> 01:01:53,513
I love that.

723
01:01:53,688 --> 01:01:54,688
There.

724
01:01:54,865 --> 01:01:56,158
Just like that.

725
01:01:56,183 --> 01:01:57,852
Let's do close ups.

726
01:01:58,243 --> 01:02:01,188
One, two, three.

727
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:02,367
Okay?

728
01:02:04,578 --> 01:02:06,351
How much longer?

729
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:09,029
By the way, I forgot.

730
01:02:09,054 --> 01:02:12,883
Yuna, this is Tricia.
Tricia, this is Yuna.

731
01:02:13,909 --> 01:02:15,547
Uh, so...

732
01:02:15,661 --> 01:02:16,743
Hello.

733
01:02:17,095 --> 01:02:18,388
One more frame

734
01:02:18,413 --> 01:02:20,313
and then we're done for the day.

735
01:02:20,338 --> 01:02:23,016
- Sure.
- Retouch and let's change your hair.

736
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:24,712
Okay. Come here.

737
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:26,855
Wait, where's your shirt?

738
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,298
Wait, let me get this.

739
01:02:28,323 --> 01:02:29,424
Excuse me.

740
01:02:29,883 --> 01:02:31,133
Here.

741
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,750
Let's go.

742
01:02:35,768 --> 01:02:36,768
Come here.

743
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:39,907
Let me fix that.

744
01:02:40,649 --> 01:02:41,649
So that...

745
01:02:42,952 --> 01:02:45,141
- What do you want?
- This.

746
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:47,437
- This one?
- Can I have you instead?

747
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:51,008
Oh, please. Wait.

748
01:02:51,312 --> 01:02:53,200
Fine, here.

749
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,946
Um, I'll go ahead.

750
01:02:57,532 --> 01:02:59,326
I have another commitment.

751
01:02:59,388 --> 01:03:01,056
Aren't you gonna eat first?

752
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:02,258
I ordered for us.

753
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:04,133
- Let's eat.
- I'll pass.

754
01:03:05,294 --> 01:03:07,297
Honey, let her leave.

755
01:03:07,322 --> 01:03:08,725
We can eat each other.

756
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:11,191
- Stop.
- I meant we can eat together.

757
01:03:11,216 --> 01:03:12,301
Let's eat.

758
01:03:12,343 --> 01:03:13,610
I'll see you.

759
01:03:13,635 --> 01:03:14,719
Be safe.

760
01:03:15,387 --> 01:03:16,513
- Okay.
- Okay.

761
01:03:16,538 --> 01:03:18,055
- Bye.
- Take care.

762
01:03:18,282 --> 01:03:19,659
- Here, eat.
- Mhm!

763
01:03:19,683 --> 01:03:21,414
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

764
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,891
- What do we try next?
- You.

765
01:03:36,485 --> 01:03:38,531
Shit. My wallet.

766
01:03:43,235 --> 01:03:44,977
Ah, shit.

767
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,903
Who's this?

768
01:03:58,865 --> 01:04:00,576
I'm not joking.

769
01:04:03,761 --> 01:04:05,755
- I missed you, babe.
- Babe.

770
01:04:07,397 --> 01:04:09,592
Come with me, I cooked something for us.

771
01:04:09,617 --> 01:04:10,918
Come here.

772
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,128
- Take your seat.
- Wow.

773
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:14,321
There.

774
01:04:17,503 --> 01:04:19,005
I prepared all of it.

775
01:04:22,454 --> 01:04:23,872
Wow!

776
01:04:23,872 --> 01:04:26,693
Now you can finally
taste my specialty.

777
01:04:26,718 --> 01:04:28,162
How long have you been home?

778
01:04:28,352 --> 01:04:29,895
A few hours ago.

779
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,600
I had to cook all of this.

780
01:04:35,678 --> 01:04:37,857
Aren't you hungry?

781
01:04:38,987 --> 01:04:40,113
Ah.

782
01:04:40,138 --> 01:04:41,342
It's delicious.

783
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:44,389
This was my grandmother's recipe.

784
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:47,756
So I'm sure you'll love it.

785
01:04:54,903 --> 01:04:56,988
Fantastic!

786
01:04:56,988 --> 01:04:58,757
Now I miss my Grandmother.

787
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:00,759
But I miss you more.

788
01:05:06,832 --> 01:05:07,958
Let me take that.

789
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:10,155
- Okay.
- I'll bring it to the sink.

790
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,228
Thank you.

791
01:06:40,919 --> 01:06:41,957
Babe,

792
01:06:42,937 --> 01:06:44,571
I just wanted to say

793
01:06:45,466 --> 01:06:47,396
thank you.

794
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:50,302
Thank you for being

795
01:06:51,392 --> 01:06:53,771
faithful to me.

796
01:06:58,026 --> 01:06:59,201
Babe.

797
01:07:01,297 --> 01:07:03,201
I love you so much, babe.

798
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:11,585
Will you marry me?

799
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,350
Yes…

800
01:07:47,826 --> 01:07:48,908
Thank you, babe.

801
01:07:56,793 --> 01:07:57,853
What's wrong?

802
01:08:01,798 --> 01:08:02,910
Are you okay?

803
01:08:52,651 --> 01:08:53,651
Yuna!

804
01:09:01,775 --> 01:09:04,444
Yuna! Yuna, wait!

805
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:26,814
What are you doing here?

806
01:09:28,661 --> 01:09:31,643
I just came to bring the wallet
you forgot at the studio.

807
01:09:35,289 --> 01:09:36,650
Thank you.

808
01:09:39,497 --> 01:09:41,111
What you saw earlier,

809
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:43,783
that was nothing.

810
01:09:44,027 --> 01:09:46,336
You don't have to explain.

811
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:49,298
She's your girlfriend, right?

812
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,369
She's not my girlfriend.

813
01:09:53,635 --> 01:09:55,387
And what's it to you?

814
01:09:55,412 --> 01:09:58,264
That's right.
What's it to me?

815
01:09:58,289 --> 01:10:00,291
Why do you care what I think?

816
01:10:00,495 --> 01:10:02,411
Why, are you jealous?

817
01:10:03,061 --> 01:10:04,312
Do you care?

818
01:10:04,337 --> 01:10:05,422
Huh?

819
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:07,914
You haven't changed one bit!

820
01:10:07,939 --> 01:10:09,651
- Son of a bitch!
- You're like that even before.

821
01:10:09,676 --> 01:10:11,680
- You're in denial!
- Wow, why is it always my fault?

822
01:10:11,705 --> 01:10:13,805
- Can you stop?
- Son of a bitch!

823
01:10:13,805 --> 01:10:16,424
- Can you stop it?
- Son of a bitch, Becca!

824
01:10:16,635 --> 01:10:17,680
What's your problem?

825
01:10:17,705 --> 01:10:19,352
Why are you pulling
this bullshit right now?

826
01:10:19,377 --> 01:10:21,408
Why are you pulling this bullshit?

827
01:10:21,913 --> 01:10:23,289
Why are you being like that?

828
01:10:23,314 --> 01:10:24,947
And why are you also like that too?

829
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:26,876
What's this?

830
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:28,111
What are we?

831
01:10:28,136 --> 01:10:29,471
What are we?

832
01:10:30,881 --> 01:10:33,338
Can we stop?

833
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:35,682
And this?

834
01:10:37,262 --> 01:10:39,347
Damn this stupid ring!

835
01:10:39,372 --> 01:10:41,627
I don't know what this means!

836
01:10:41,864 --> 01:10:44,472
And then you come
waltzing in here?

837
01:10:44,519 --> 01:10:46,396
I just dropped by for your wallet...

838
01:10:46,421 --> 01:10:47,596
Why do you care?

839
01:10:47,787 --> 01:10:48,788
Huh?

840
01:10:48,857 --> 01:10:50,150
Do you care about me?

841
01:10:50,175 --> 01:10:51,676
- What the hell!
- Do you care about me?

842
01:10:51,701 --> 01:10:52,988
Stop it, Yuna!

843
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:54,404
Can you shut up?

844
01:10:54,429 --> 01:10:57,338
- This isn't going anywhere!
- So what?

845
01:10:57,907 --> 01:11:00,410
What's happening to you, Yuna?

846
01:11:00,435 --> 01:11:02,338
What's your problem?

847
01:11:03,145 --> 01:11:04,665
Shut up!

848
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:10,893
Why are you so mad?

849
01:11:13,033 --> 01:11:14,324
What's your problem?

850
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:15,886
I'm sorry!

851
01:11:15,925 --> 01:11:17,594
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Don't touch me!

852
01:11:17,619 --> 01:11:19,432
Yuna, stop it!

853
01:11:20,322 --> 01:11:22,368
- I'm sorry.
- No!

854
01:11:22,415 --> 01:11:23,808
No! I don't want this, Yuna!

855
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:25,226
- Leave me alone!
- I'm sorry.

856
01:11:25,251 --> 01:11:26,978
- I don't want this!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

857
01:11:27,003 --> 01:11:29,354
Leave me alone! Don't hug me!

858
01:11:32,066 --> 01:11:33,735
You're always like this.

859
01:11:33,806 --> 01:11:35,907
Even before!

860
01:11:39,937 --> 01:11:41,533
What's your problem?

861
01:11:41,721 --> 01:11:43,299
Shut up!

862
01:11:44,204 --> 01:11:45,497
Shut up!

863
01:11:45,522 --> 01:11:47,207
Stop it!

864
01:11:47,232 --> 01:11:49,314
Don't touch me!

865
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,610
Stop it!

866
01:11:50,635 --> 01:11:52,854
Damn it, Yuna!

867
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:54,598
Stop it!

868
01:12:11,429 --> 01:12:20,505
"Takipsilim"
Performed by: MICZ V

869
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,099
Babe...

870
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:54,919
You look really surprised.

871
01:14:01,099 --> 01:14:02,353
Becca, right?

872
01:14:04,936 --> 01:14:06,318
I'm Nico.

873
01:14:07,127 --> 01:14:08,640
Yuna's fiance.

874
01:14:10,593 --> 01:14:12,394
We finally meet.

875
01:14:15,135 --> 01:14:16,636
I should go, Yuna.

876
01:14:27,442 --> 01:14:29,666
Becca's back, huh, babe?

877
01:14:30,314 --> 01:14:32,233
You didn't mention it.

878
01:14:34,182 --> 01:14:35,233
Sorry.

879
01:14:35,258 --> 01:14:37,811
I got busy here
at the coffee shop

880
01:14:37,836 --> 01:14:41,987
so I must have
forgotten to mention it.

881
01:14:50,915 --> 01:14:52,291
So, are you okay?

882
01:14:55,336 --> 01:14:57,022
I mean, she's your first love.

883
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:00,629
Do you still feel something?

884
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,333
Babe, please.

885
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:05,603
I don't wanna fight.

886
01:15:08,242 --> 01:15:09,534
I was just asking.

887
01:15:17,019 --> 01:15:18,101
No.

888
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:21,366
What else am I
supposed to feel for her?

889
01:15:21,863 --> 01:15:23,679
That was years ago.

890
01:15:27,019 --> 01:15:28,030
Then okay.

891
01:15:29,171 --> 01:15:30,881
There's nothing
to worry about.

892
01:16:09,702 --> 01:16:11,370
You're here.

893
01:16:13,491 --> 01:16:20,563
Pour me your most
expensive whiskey.

894
01:16:20,612 --> 01:16:24,525
We're going to celebrate because
my friend here's getting married.

895
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:25,827
The most expensive, okay?

896
01:16:25,852 --> 01:16:28,696
Your most expensive whiskey.

897
01:16:29,148 --> 01:16:30,282
Becca.

898
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:32,701
You're drunk.

899
01:16:34,066 --> 01:16:35,109
No.

900
01:16:37,066 --> 01:16:38,993
Let's take you home.

901
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:40,751
No!

902
01:16:57,502 --> 01:16:58,587
Are you happy?

903
01:16:58,612 --> 01:17:00,063
Answer me!

904
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:04,632
Are you glad you're getting married?

905
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:08,031
And what happened
between us,

906
01:17:08,276 --> 01:17:09,360
what was that?

907
01:17:09,385 --> 01:17:12,513
Welcome back sex?

908
01:17:12,538 --> 01:17:13,700
Is that it?

909
01:17:14,816 --> 01:17:15,952
Huh?

910
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:18,997
Becca…

911
01:17:24,574 --> 01:17:28,048
I returned from the
States with a clean slate.

912
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:33,803
I had a quiet life.

913
01:17:37,118 --> 01:17:39,351
And now you're back.

914
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:44,572
Why did that happen to us?

915
01:17:47,427 --> 01:17:48,641
Just nothing?

916
01:17:51,371 --> 01:17:54,938
And then I find out
you're getting married.

917
01:17:55,568 --> 01:17:58,828
Are you playing with me?

918
01:17:59,376 --> 01:18:00,600
Are you?

919
01:18:01,614 --> 01:18:03,416
Are you just playing with me?

920
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:10,398
Damn you!

921
01:18:21,283 --> 01:18:22,367
Becca.

922
01:18:22,892 --> 01:18:24,039
Becca.

923
01:18:25,486 --> 01:18:27,000
I'm sorry.

924
01:18:29,136 --> 01:18:31,847
I can't just hurt and leave Nico.

925
01:18:31,872 --> 01:18:34,305
So, you're going to hurt me instead?

926
01:18:35,266 --> 01:18:37,171
That's not what I mean!

927
01:18:41,757 --> 01:18:43,524
I still love you.

928
01:18:44,569 --> 01:18:45,781
Bullshit!

929
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:50,255
You expect me to believe you?

930
01:18:51,389 --> 01:18:53,174
You're a liar.

931
01:18:55,243 --> 01:18:57,875
Until now, you're still a liar.

932
01:19:02,106 --> 01:19:03,851
About you and Nico at the bar.

933
01:19:06,087 --> 01:19:09,107
Somebody sent me
a video of you.

934
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:16,572
You told me I was
being paranoid.

935
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,217
But it turns out I was right.

936
01:19:21,602 --> 01:19:23,271
You couldn't even admit it to me

937
01:19:23,296 --> 01:19:25,088
when we were breaking up.

938
01:19:26,675 --> 01:19:29,289
I thought you'd own up to it.

939
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,649
I would have forgiven you.

940
01:19:33,781 --> 01:19:35,594
Because I love you.

941
01:19:35,619 --> 01:19:37,110
It's true.

942
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:40,531
It's true, something almost
happened between us.

943
01:19:41,123 --> 01:19:44,570
But believe it or not,

944
01:19:44,595 --> 01:19:47,328
it was just a kiss, Becca.

945
01:19:50,266 --> 01:19:51,983
Sure, I was drunk.

946
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:53,870
I was confused.

947
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:00,617
I couldn't tell you,

948
01:20:01,453 --> 01:20:03,061
but that's all it was.

949
01:20:06,349 --> 01:20:07,555
Just stop.

950
01:20:08,321 --> 01:20:09,781
Enough already!

951
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:13,250
That's the oldest excuse.

952
01:20:13,372 --> 01:20:15,141
Seriously?

953
01:20:16,662 --> 01:20:19,289
It's simple, Yuna.

954
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,758
If you really loved me,

955
01:20:24,223 --> 01:20:26,642
you wouldn't let anything
happen between you two.

956
01:20:26,667 --> 01:20:28,399
Not a single thing.

957
01:20:28,836 --> 01:20:30,755
Not a chance.

958
01:20:32,648 --> 01:20:34,734
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

959
01:20:34,759 --> 01:20:36,053
You get it?

960
01:20:36,133 --> 01:20:38,844
- You never changed.
- I'm sorry.

961
01:20:38,869 --> 01:20:41,140
You always hurt me.

962
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,633
Becca, I'm sorry.

963
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:46,038
- Let go!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

964
01:20:48,884 --> 01:20:50,094
Becca!

965
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:53,140
Becca!

966
01:21:01,907 --> 01:21:03,074
Hi, Becca.

967
01:21:04,725 --> 01:21:06,061
Nico.

968
01:21:09,456 --> 01:21:11,733
My cousin said you
wanted to talk to me.

969
01:21:12,095 --> 01:21:13,290
What do you want?

970
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:14,842
Yup.

971
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:20,818
I want you to be our wedding
prenup photographer.

972
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:24,224
If you're okay with that.

973
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:37,319
Why me?

974
01:21:38,425 --> 01:21:39,569
Why not?

975
01:21:41,095 --> 01:21:42,680
Brenda recommended you.

976
01:21:42,705 --> 01:21:43,780
And your friends

977
01:21:44,265 --> 01:21:46,209
with Yuna, aren't you?

978
01:21:48,061 --> 01:21:49,642
I'm sure she'll love the idea.

979
01:21:57,828 --> 01:22:01,077
By the way, babe.

980
01:22:01,391 --> 01:22:03,364
We have a prenup photoshoot.

981
01:22:04,288 --> 01:22:05,288
Mhm.

982
01:22:07,731 --> 01:22:10,014
I asked Becca to
be our photographer.

983
01:22:12,332 --> 01:22:14,047
We spoke yesterday.

984
01:22:16,683 --> 01:22:17,999
Why did you have to pick her?

985
01:22:18,692 --> 01:22:20,428
There's loads of others.

986
01:22:21,863 --> 01:22:24,010
You shouldn’t have asked her.

987
01:22:25,652 --> 01:22:27,362
Why not?

988
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:31,041
She's known internationally, right?

989
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:33,185
Besides, Brenda recommended her.

990
01:22:34,431 --> 01:22:35,700
I don't see the issue.

991
01:22:38,004 --> 01:22:39,589
Unless

992
01:22:39,614 --> 01:22:41,278
you still have feelings for her.

993
01:22:45,549 --> 01:22:46,693
Whatever.

994
01:22:47,854 --> 01:22:49,368
Do what you want.

995
01:23:00,816 --> 01:23:03,920
Could you move the reflector?
Place it over there.

996
01:23:04,116 --> 01:23:05,409
There.

997
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:08,342
Okay... Smile!

998
01:23:10,038 --> 01:23:11,999
Okay... Smile!

999
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,772
Last shot. Smile.

1000
01:23:18,797 --> 01:23:21,655
One, two, three.

1001
01:23:23,309 --> 01:23:24,612
We're all good.

1002
01:23:24,637 --> 01:23:25,678
All good?

1003
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:28,272
I knew I made the right decision.

1004
01:23:28,297 --> 01:23:29,826
You're very impressive, Becca!

1005
01:23:30,254 --> 01:23:31,319
Right, babe?

1006
01:23:32,453 --> 01:23:33,829
- Pack it up.
- Yes, of course.

1007
01:23:33,854 --> 01:23:35,428
Best wishes to you both.

1008
01:23:35,789 --> 01:23:37,483
Anyway, Yuna.

1009
01:23:37,508 --> 01:23:40,944
I hope you can drop by
my photo exhibit next week.

1010
01:23:49,974 --> 01:23:51,076
What exhibit?

1011
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:53,456
Ah,

1012
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,460
Becca asked me

1013
01:23:56,485 --> 01:23:58,834
to model for her for her exhibit.

1014
01:24:07,697 --> 01:24:08,697
Come on.

1015
01:24:12,022 --> 01:24:13,022
Let's go.

1016
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:17,709
Here, hold this.

1017
01:24:57,489 --> 01:24:59,272
Why didn't you
tell me about that?

1018
01:25:03,319 --> 01:25:04,903
Tell me the truth.

1019
01:25:06,412 --> 01:25:08,428
Do you still have
feelings for your ex?

1020
01:25:12,278 --> 01:25:13,779
Babe…

1021
01:25:16,613 --> 01:25:18,823
Can we talk?

1022
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:26,467
I...

1023
01:25:36,856 --> 01:25:37,941
What is it?

1024
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:38,967
Babe…

1025
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,100
I did something.

1026
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:50,866
What is it?

1027
01:25:53,551 --> 01:25:55,647
Because...

1028
01:25:55,787 --> 01:25:58,045
Promise you won't get mad?

1029
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:07,027
What?

1030
01:26:13,649 --> 01:26:16,725
Something happened
between me and Becca.

1031
01:26:25,442 --> 01:26:26,819
What?

1032
01:26:30,322 --> 01:26:32,092
I'm sorry…

1033
01:26:34,008 --> 01:26:35,545
What?

1034
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:38,275
Damn it...

1035
01:26:42,053 --> 01:26:43,769
Babe, I'm sorry!

1036
01:26:43,794 --> 01:26:45,170
Babe!

1037
01:26:50,254 --> 01:26:55,272
- Wow, this is nice.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

1038
01:26:55,453 --> 01:27:02,654
[people chattering]

1039
01:27:02,679 --> 01:27:05,514
Thank you for coming. Enjoy.

1040
01:27:05,539 --> 01:27:07,733
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1041
01:27:07,758 --> 01:27:09,186
Let me see.

1042
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,088
Nice.

1043
01:27:11,113 --> 01:27:12,311
That's pretty!

1044
01:27:12,749 --> 01:27:16,116
[chattering]

1045
01:27:16,218 --> 01:27:17,386
I'll go ahead.

1046
01:27:17,411 --> 01:27:19,928
- Sure, take care.
- Take care.

1047
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:24,193
Glad you could come.

1048
01:27:30,702 --> 01:27:32,870
Yuna's photos are beautiful.

1049
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:36,812
This is what won me my first prize.

1050
01:27:39,158 --> 01:27:40,868
I remember the first time

1051
01:27:40,893 --> 01:27:42,759
I saw Yuna at the coffee shop.

1052
01:27:45,626 --> 01:27:48,584
I thought to myself at that moment,

1053
01:27:50,492 --> 01:27:52,062
I want this girl.

1054
01:27:56,348 --> 01:27:58,798
And then one day,
I saw her looking sad.

1055
01:28:01,254 --> 01:28:03,558
I told myself

1056
01:28:05,069 --> 01:28:08,948
I'd do anything to keep
this woman from hurting.

1057
01:28:12,026 --> 01:28:14,818
So when I found out
that you broke up,

1058
01:28:17,405 --> 01:28:19,073
I pursued her.

1059
01:28:21,075 --> 01:28:24,212
Even if people keep
saying she's into women.

1060
01:28:28,176 --> 01:28:30,216
Even if…

1061
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:35,297
I know she still loves you.

1062
01:28:38,559 --> 01:28:40,427
All I want is...

1063
01:28:42,105 --> 01:28:43,665
for her to love me too.

1064
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:50,542
That's why I will
never surrender Yuna.

1065
01:28:54,074 --> 01:28:55,677
I love her.

1066
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,996
And I will do anything for her.

1067
01:29:08,117 --> 01:29:09,251
Nico,

1068
01:29:10,328 --> 01:29:12,462
Becca had nothing to do with it.

1069
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,126
I'm the one who went to her.

1070
01:29:18,949 --> 01:29:20,492
Please tell me

1071
01:29:20,517 --> 01:29:23,471
what I can do to earn
your forgiveness.

1072
01:29:35,115 --> 01:29:36,754
We will proceed
with the wedding.

1073
01:29:41,195 --> 01:29:42,251
What?

1074
01:29:45,929 --> 01:29:46,978
But...

1075
01:29:47,834 --> 01:29:50,361
What I did was unforgivable.

1076
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:53,360
I know.

1077
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:04,985
Even so.

1078
01:30:17,517 --> 01:30:19,896
But if you want me
to forgive you,

1079
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:23,798
you will marry me.

1080
01:30:45,954 --> 01:30:47,554
Yuna, I love you.

1081
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:57,016
I love you, Yuna.

1082
01:31:18,012 --> 01:31:19,671
Let's proceed with the wedding.

1083
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:54,830
I love you.

1084
01:31:58,806 --> 01:32:00,742
I love you so much, Yuna.

1085
01:33:05,213 --> 01:33:06,751
They say

1086
01:33:07,567 --> 01:33:09,462
that when you get married,

1087
01:33:10,295 --> 01:33:12,365
that's the end.

1088
01:33:13,702 --> 01:33:15,016
But what if

1089
01:33:15,831 --> 01:33:19,685
you're getting married to
someone you don't love?

1090
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:24,336
Does it also mean

1091
01:33:25,191 --> 01:33:28,824
the end for your chance of happiness?

1092
01:33:31,961 --> 01:33:35,890
Will it be enough to
atone for your sins?

1093
01:34:57,419 --> 01:34:58,599
Or...

1094
01:34:58,762 --> 01:35:01,746
Will you ignore
what everyone's telling you,

1095
01:35:02,763 --> 01:35:05,029
and choose to be happy

1096
01:35:05,614 --> 01:35:09,074
with the person you truly love?

"Panaginip"

1098
01:36:29,398 --> 01:36:32,635
I love you, Becca.

1099
01:36:33,911 --> 01:36:36,074
I love you too, Yuna.
