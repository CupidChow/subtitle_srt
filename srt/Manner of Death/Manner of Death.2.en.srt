I'll be right back.

00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,159
Look at these marks.

6
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:52,340
It looks like someone pulled her up
to the beam.

7
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,100
It wasn't a suicide.

8
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,279

Depression?

-Senior, did you only find empty bottles?
-Yes.

14
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,399
That's strange.

15
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,719
Mr. Tan, can you think of anything else?

16
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:28,199
Did Ms. Jane show any signs
of suicide before?

17
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:31,999
I'm not sure.

18

47
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:15,399
Please perform a urine test.

48
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,919
What did you find?

49
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:36,399

Just like which in Natty's case,
but this mark is lighter.

What do you think is the cause of death?

55
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,279
Subconjunctival hemorrhages, pale lips.

56
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:10,199
The cause of death is suffocation.

57
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,439
Correct, but not completely.

In most cases of hanging,

59
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:20,439
the cause of death
is compression on the neck aorta.

This is the mark that makes me think
it isn't a suicide case.

haven't given the order yet.

that there were only sleeping pills.

79

80
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,920
So what did you talk about?

81
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:43,199
We talked about
what happened at the party,

82
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,799
because I noticed a red mark
on Ms. Jane's face.

83
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,980
Then I saw her fighting with Mr. Tan.

84
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,380
I just wanted to know if she was alright.

85

What did she say?

86

She told me she was fine
and nothing happened.

87
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,759
But she only said that to reassure me.

88

Before hanging up the phone,

89
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,540
I invited her to a restaurant she liked
to have dim sum at.

In truth, if the medical examiner
knows the victim,

in the case?

about him.

107

The day Jane died, he seemed very calm.

108
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,639
So calm that he didn't look sad at all.

109
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,599
I'll look into him.

How about praying to Buddha?

Will that help?

120
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:01,479
At least, it will make you feel more
at ease.

121

to do for tomorrow.

125

You should head back.

126
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,839

Promise me you'll tell me
once you know more.

168
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,580
If there's anything you need,

169
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,079
you can tell me anytime.

170
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,999
Alright, Rung.

171
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,559
I'm heading back to work.

172
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,199
How can I help you, Inspector?

173
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:20,039
Can you tell me again
how you found Ms. Jane's body that day?

174
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:25,479
I went to pick her up as usual.

175
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:38,719
But it was already eight o'clock by then.

176
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,519
I called her but she didn't answer.

177
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,599
So I went into the house.

178
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,599
How did you get into that house?

179
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,759
Was the door unlocked?

180
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:54,420
Jane asked me to lock the door...

181
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,759
and told me to hide the key
under the flowerpot.

182
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:59,239
As soon as I went up, I found Jane's body.

183
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:03,220
After that, I called the police.

184
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,580
That's all.

185
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,519
If you ask me,
I think your story is very fishy.

186
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,399
Why didn't Jane lock the door herself?

187
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,519
Jane was probably tired.

188
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,839
That's why she asked me to lock the door.

189
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:15,599
That's it.

190
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,639
Is there anything else you want to ask me?

191
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:24,239
That's all for now.

192
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:28,679
If you think of anything else,
you can call me anytime.

193
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,759
Thank you.

194
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:40,919
It's wrong to eavesdrop.

195
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:52,959
What did you say just now?

196
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:55,559
I thought I had made it very clear.

197
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:02,839
But what I heard
isn't that much of a secret, is it?

198
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:05,439
I'm just worried.

199
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,079
I'm worried that if my conversation
with the inspector is leaked,

200
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,359
it will affect the case.

201
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:13,639
That's all.

202
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:20,540
If the things the inspector came
to ask you about were so important,

203
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,300
he would not have chosen
such a place to talk.

204
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,799
You said you didn't hear anything.

205
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,559
I haven't said anything yet.

206
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,439
The police officer who came to talk to me
is indeed the inspector.

207
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,879
If you were just passing by,
you wouldn't have known that.

208
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:39,919
Right?

209
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:50,719
You are new here.

210
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:54,079
Just a stranger who appeared
in Viangpha Mork.

211
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,959
You should be more careful than this.

212
00:15:58,619 --> 00:15:59,959
Are you threatening me?

213
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:04,599
This isn't a threat, but a reminder.

214
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,999
(Doctor Order Sheet)
(Janejira Sookyod)

215
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:24,199
(Shows symptoms of insomnia for a month)
(Dealing with guilt)

216
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,559
(Currently no severe suicidal tendency)

217
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:30,159
Fai?

218
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,439
What symptoms did Jane show later on?

219
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:39,479
Later, Miss Jane's condition improved,
so I reduced the dose.

220
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,639
But I couldn't say
that she had been cured, Bun.

221
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,559
If that's the case,

222
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,600
Jane wouldn't have committed suicide,
right?

223
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,500
Sometimes,
when one wishes to commit suicide,

224
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,420
there are no warning signs.

225
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,759
In that case,
about the blood-infected virus...

226
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:04,439
As for that, Miss Jane...

227
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:22,999
-Sorawit.
-Hello.

228
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,039
Please have a seat.

229
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:31,399
What happened?

230
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:32,679
The motorbike flipped over.

231
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,599
The motorbike flipped over? When was that?

232
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,239
Last night.

233
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:38,679
Your wound has already been taken care of.

234
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:40,660
What symptoms do you have?

235
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,639
I've been having difficulty breathing
since last night.

236
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:45,919
I can't really straighten my legs.

237
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,319
And my head feels dizzy, Doctor.

238
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,719
Can you take off your clothes, please?

239
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,439
Doctor, wait.

240
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,859
Are you serious?

241
00:17:58,939 --> 00:17:59,779
I...

242
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:01,639
I'm shy.

243
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:03,319
I've seen thousands of people.

244
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:04,399
Take it off.

245
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,599
Excuse me.

246
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,279
Try breathing.

247
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,319
How does it feel?

248
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:33,519
Much better.

249
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,159
OK.

250
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,759
Let me see.

251
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:44,719
Please hold still. Hold still.

252
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,759
You are amazing, Doctor.

253
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:58,540
There is no wound on your waist.
Don't bandage it.

254
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,060
It would be weird if you could breathe
with that kind of bandage.

255
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,340
Who helped you with it?

256
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,540
They wrapped you like a mummy.

257
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,599
Nam, my friend.

258
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,999
Did you do anything
that made her hate you?

259
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,799
Apologize to her.

260
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,359
I will, Doctor.

261
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,599
All done.

262
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,199
Don't forget to come
and treat the wound on time.

263
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,959
I will. Thank you, Doctor.

264
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:29,399
-Sorawit.
-Yes?

265
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:31,519
Aren't you forgetting your clothes?

266
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,199
Thank you, Doctor.

267
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,359
Get dressed first. Don't go out naked.

268
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:42,919
Thank you.

269
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,319
What the heck?

270
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,519
(Welcome to Viangpha Mork
District Police Station)

271
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,719
I can finally talk to you.

272
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:55,439
I really don't understand
why you acted so mysteriously.

273
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,199
I was just busy with work, Inspector.

274
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:00,340
Let's get straight to the topic then.

275
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,359
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

276
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:06,039
(Physical evidence)

277
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:10,119
Why did you call Miss Jane Jira that day?

278
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:15,279
I called her but she didn't answer.

279
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,399
So I kept calling. That's it.

280
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,959
But you two aren't close.

281
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,199
What did you call her for?

282
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:26,559
People don't have to be very close
to make a phone call, do they?

283
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,580
I'm not close to you either.

284
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,279
Am I not sitting here chatting with you?

285
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,500
What did you want to talk
to Miss Jane about?

286
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,260
Was it the same reason why you went
to the scene of the incident that morning?

287
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:39,879
There's nothing strange about it.

288
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,640
It wouldn't be strange...

289
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,020
if only the police
and the medical examiner...

290
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,020
received news of Miss Jane Jira's death.

291
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:56,199
As a journalist,
I must keep my eyes and ears open.

292
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:59,799
Listen, you guys shouldn't suspect me.

293
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:02,460
There are so many things
that people need you to investigate.

294
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,620
Do you want me to give you
a pointer or two?

295
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,719
Lest you continue to be kept in the dark.

296
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:08,999
If you know too much,

297
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:11,919
you should worry about your safety.

298
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,359
I know that very well, Inspector.

299
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,999
Time for your shot, child.

300
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:31,639
Trust me, don't be afraid.

301
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,879
Here, it'll be over real soon.

302
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,719
-It's like an ant biting you.
-No.

303
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,639
Do you see the plane over there?

304
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,119
-Where?
-A really big one.

305
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,959
-It's blue. Do you see it?
-Where? I can't see it.

306
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,319
I can't see it.

307
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:47,580
All done. Does it hurt?

308
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,860
No.

309
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,719
Sister Fan, you still use the same
old trick from when I was a child?

310
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,639
Are you saying my trick is outdated?

311
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,239
It's called a classic.

312
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,439
Quite enough, Dr. Bun.

313
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,119
-You can leave the chair now.
-Press it.

314
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:01,479
-Press it.
-The Doctor is telling you to press it.

315
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,559
It doesn't hurt at all.

316
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:05,199
This way.

317
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:19,119
(Declare Jane Jira's death as a suicide.
Do not interfere in this matter anymore.)

318
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:11,759
I don't think I called an ambulance.

319
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,439
I'm not here for tutoring either.

320
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:19,959
That's good.

321
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:24,359
If you came to get tutored,
I'd probably charge you a high fee.

322
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:26,519
I'm worried you couldn't afford it.

323
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,540
I want to learn more about Jane's matter.

324
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,919
How much extra cost would that be?

325
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,319
Please go on.

326
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,599
What do you want to know?

327
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:46,919
Do you think she committed suicide?

328
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,559
I can't tell.

329
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:53,279
I guess I have to wait
for the autopsy report.

330
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:56,519
Guess I have to change the question then.

331
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,719
She asked you to go downstairs
and lock the door that day.

332
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,679
Was it because she didn't want
to go downstairs...

333
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,839
or because she wasn't able to anymore?

334
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:10,159
You're suspecting me, aren't you?

335
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,399
Everyone is suspicious.

336
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:19,719
But you are more suspicious than others.

337
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:27,039
Oftentimes,
who finds the body is the murderer.

338
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,719
And you happened to be the last person
with Jane that day.

339
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:41,719
Did you decide I'm the murderer
only based on that?

340
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,759
If you didn't kill her,

341
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:50,039
why didn't you show up at her funeral?

342
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,519
Wasn't your relationship going great?

343
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:56,759
It seems that you wanted
to see me so much.

344
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,479
You're a suspect.

345
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:05,119
Do you think Jane's funeral
is only held for one night?

346
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,239
Be careful.

347
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,319
I will be watching you.

348
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:19,439
Bye.

349
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,199
Bye.

350
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,839
Long time no see, Inspector.

351
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:56,119
How have things been lately?

352
00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:58,199
Pretty good, Sir.

353
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,479
How can I help you?

354
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:04,740
We found some evidence
for Jane Jira's case.

355
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,580
That's why I need to consult Mr. Pued.

356
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:09,879
What does this have to do with my brother?

357
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,439
I'd be happy to help with anything
if I can.

358
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:19,300
Before and after Miss Jane Jira
passed away,

359
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,919
you called her.

360
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:24,279
I wonder what you talked about.

361
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:31,439
I just called her to apologize
for the mess that happened.

362
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,999
You mean, she answered your call, right?

363
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:37,999
Yes.

364
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:41,420
And the mess you mentioned,

365
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,239
do you mean your fight
with Mr. Tan that night?

366
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,760
Can you elaborate
on what happened that night?

367
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,839
What happened between the two of you?

368
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:56,039
Tan was unhappy about Jane
and I keeping in touch.

369
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:00,719
They happened to be quite close recently.

370
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:17,519
Dr. Bun.

371
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,559
Sister Fan.

372
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,199
What's the matter? You scared me.

373
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,200
Someone's looking for you.

374
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,839
Who?

375
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,719
-Hey.
-Sorawit.

376
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,359
Doctor, I bought you lunch.

377
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:38,039
You shouldn't have.

378
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,639
-Thank you.
-It's OK.

379
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,380
You're such an honest child.

380
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,060
I'm very curious
who beat you up like that.

381
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:50,080
I told you that my motorbike crashed.

382
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,820
Sorawit, if it was the case,
the bruises wouldn't look like that.

383
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,199
That did it.

384
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:00,599
-That?
-Yes.

385
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,060
But That isn't the scary one.

386
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,159
That is helping Brother Por's man, Dam.

387
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,159
I could have beaten him, Doctor.

388
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:14,719
But I was willing to be beaten up by them,

389
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,439
because it would be bad
if Dam hears of it.

390
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,999
Is Dam that scary?

391
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:24,359
Yes, I heard that Dam was like a ghost.

392
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,599
They said he loved to dress in black.

393
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:29,479
No one had seen his face before.

394
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:31,839
If anyone gets into trouble with him,

395
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,119
they will be killed
just for seeing his face.

396
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:35,679
Wait a minute, are you talking
about Dam or the X-Men?

397
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,879
I'm serious, Doctor.

398
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,159
Dam.

399
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,279
I need to go to work.

400
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,079
-OK. Bye.
-Bye.

401
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,759
Doctor, the lab report is out.

402
00:30:09,939 --> 00:30:13,359
They've found components of Diazepam
in the blood.

403
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,159
Abnormally high content.

404
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:19,140
But Miss Jane suffered from depression.

405
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,799
We also saw some sleeping pills
at the scene of the incident.

406
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,799
Is it possible that she hanged herself
after taking all of that medicine?

407
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,599
That's impossible, Inspector.

408
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:33,479
I did an abdomen autopsy.

409
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:36,919
If she took a lot of medicine,
there would be remnants in her stomach.

410
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:40,559
If that's the case,

411
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,959
why was that kind of medicine
in Jane's body?

412
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:48,559
There's only one possibility.

413
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,919
It was injected.

414
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:57,759
The lab results for her hair also showed
the presence of methamphetamine.

415
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:04,319
It's the same as with that child.

416
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,399
(Blood, Diazepam)
(Hair, methamphetamine闁?

417
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,200
In any case, please work quickly
on the report, Doctor,

418
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
so we can start the investigation ASAP.

419
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:16,199
I will have it done
as quickly as possible.

420
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,639
Don't worry, Inspector.

421
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:56,479
Hello.

422
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,039
A small portion, please.

423
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:00,679
-Twenty baht, Doctor.
-Thank you.

424
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:01,959
Wait a second.

425
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,879
Doctor, you dropped your wallet.

426
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,359
Thank you very much.

427
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:03,399
I told you not to interfere
in this matter!

428
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:04,879
Who are you?

429
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,839
This is your last warning!

430
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:31,039
Oat, did you hear
about what happened to Dr. Bun last night?

431
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,500
He is so unlucky.

432
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,519
How can you get robbed at home?

433
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,679
What are you looking at?

434
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,599
This.

435
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:42,759
Miss Jane's lab results.

436
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:44,359
Why?

437
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:51,079
Do you think we can hang ourselves...

438
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:53,039
if we overdose on Diazepam?

439
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:57,300
If a person is injected
with so much Diazepam,

440
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,660
they won't have the strength
to prepare the rope.

441
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,759
That makes the two of us.

442
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,159
(Get well soon, Tan)

443
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,119
Be careful.

444
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,839
What are you doing here?

445
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,879
I'm here to visit you.

446
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,679
Why?

447
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,399
Do you still suspect me?

448
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:41,039
I don't have any evidence
to prove your innocence yet.

449
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:44,719
I didn't kill Jane.

450
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:48,679
Ninety-five percent of murderers
deny their crimes.

451
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,679
Eighty percent of murderers
are the victims' lovers.

452
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:56,839
Are you saying
the one who wants to hurt you, loves you?

453
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:04,439
I'm being serious.

454
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:08,399
Did this happen to you because of Jane?

455
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:11,599
Why are you asking that?

456
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,999
Someone doesn't want me to disclose
the truth about this case.

457
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:23,519
Then why don't you stop?

458
00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:33,599
Because I'm Jane's friend.

459
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:40,399
Have you ever heard of the saying,
"The dead don't have a voice?"

460
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,199
A lot of people think that way.

461
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,279
Especially the murderers.

462
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:48,940
The reason why I chose
to become a medical examiner...

463
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,820
is that I want to prove
those superstitious ideas wrong.

464
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,919
I will never let those things happen
to Jane.

465
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:01,799
I will find Jane's murderer,
no matter what.

466
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:08,279
Let me help you.

467
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:11,439
How can I let you help me?

468
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:12,919
I hardly know you.

469
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,399
Let me introduce myself to you then.

470
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:23,559
My name is Tan, Wirapong Inkhamvieng.

471
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,919
Let me help you.

472
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:31,199
I want to know who killed Jane too.

473
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:41,359
I'm leaving.

474
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,039
Pued, do you know?

475
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,799
I was followed,

476
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:11,519
intimidated, stalked,

477
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,319
threatened,
and ended up injured in the hospital.

478
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:18,599
When did it start?

479
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:21,999
When I started Jane's case.

480
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,239
Will you continue?

481
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,439
Pued.

482
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:32,900
If you were me and knew how Jane died,

483
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,020
I believe you wouldn't stop either.

484
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,719
Do you know already?

485
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:40,919
Jane was injected
with an overdose of Diazepam.

486
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:47,600
When an ordinary person overdoses
on Diazepam,

487
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,360
their brain's reaction will slow down.

488
00:37:50,939 --> 00:37:53,839
After that,
their body organs stop functioning...

489
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,279
until it damages the entire system.

490
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:12,479
Do you know?

491
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,719
In the end, the perpetrator hanged Jane,
who had no strength to resist.

492
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:44,519
If that's the case, I order you...

493
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,319
not to interfere in this matter.

494
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,079
You know it's dangerous.
Do you still want to meddle in this?

495
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:56,839
You know I won't stop.

496
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,759
I will investigate this on my own.

497
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:06,499
I'm begging you.

498
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,959
Don't interfere in this matter anymore.

499
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:11,879
Let me handle it myself.

500
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,559
I promise you,
I will find out who hurt Jane.

501
00:39:17,259 --> 00:39:18,599
You understand me, right, Bun?

502
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,260
I won't promise you that, Pued.

503
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,180
Why are you so stubborn?

504
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:29,319
Sorry.

505
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,479
I'm worried about you, Bun.

506
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,579
Help! Help!

507
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:06,959
What are you going to do?

508
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:09,399
I'm tired of warning you.

509
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:12,999
If you don't stop,
just wait and see what will happen to you,

510
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,959
including those who are close to you.

512
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,639
The criminal police and inspectors
are working together...

513
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,199
to declare it a suicide case.

514
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:04,039
I can't keep you here any longer!

515
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:09,119
Do you believe me now?
I'm not a bad person.

516
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:18,199
If it's this serious,
would you like to stay somewhere else?

517
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,239
Stay at your place? Keep dreaming.
