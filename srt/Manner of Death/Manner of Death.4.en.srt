Tan!

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,670
Tan!

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,720
Stop shooting!

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Stop shooting!

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,880
Stop shooting!

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,675
Tan, let's go, please!

10
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,760
=Manner of Death=

11
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,875
Wow.

12
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,475
-Bun.
-Huh?

13
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,575
It's okay if we order takeout.

14
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,450
It's fine. My cooking tastes better.

15
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,575
Let me see if that's true.

16
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,115
It's delicious.

17
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:11,970
It's as good as yesterday's.

18
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,500
That's all the ingredients you've got
in your refrigerator.

19
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,620
Yes, I know.

20
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,550
Don't you even have a spoonful of sugar
or some chilies in your kitchen?

21
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,095
It's not like I can cook.

22
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:27,900
It would be a waste
if I had them just lie around.

23
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:32,825
I only have eggs for the instant noodles.

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,700
I believe you. You are in high society.

25
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,950
What do you mean "high society?"

26
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:45,521
High sodium intake
causes kidney disease.

27
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:46,840
(High society and high sodium
are homophones)

28
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,041
The "story page" is right,

29
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:01,160
but the page of "Justice for Janejira"
is another thing.

30
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,345
Is this a new website?

31
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:04,145
Yes, I haven't seen it before.

32
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,600
They're all sharing it.

33
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,595
What are you looking at?

34
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:08,895
Doctor Bun, come and look at this.

35
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:10,220
-Hi, Doctor Bun.
-Hi.

36
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,450
Did you see it?

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,170
Someone posted on this website
that Miss Janejira didn't commit suicide.

38
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,520
Everyone is sharing the post like crazy.
(Would love to interview who posted it)

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,450
Aren't you curious
who is demanding justice on that website?

40
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:28,120
Could it be Pat?

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,095
I don't think so.

42
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:32,625
I think whoever posted it knows something.

43
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,675
If not the police, a doctor, then.

44
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,125
It isn't you, Doctor Bun, is it?

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,970
Sister Fan, how is it possible?

46
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,050
It's not me.

47
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,100
-Really?
-Yeah.

48
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,820
Who cares who it is?

49
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,645
There's just one thing I want to know now.

50
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:50,650
What will the police do?

51
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,775
That's right.

52
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,900
I don't get it!

53
00:03:57,475 --> 00:03:59,420
How did things end up like this?

54
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,695
I'm sorry, Chief.

55
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,795
Is this how you do your job?

56
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,445
You know, don't you?

57
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:06,821
With this matter ending up like this,

58
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,926
I'm the one whose reputation is damaged!

59
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:11,095
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:12,950
Fix this!

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,895
It's just someone who hanged herself!

62
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:17,470
Settle this case immediately!

63
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,390
Go!

64
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,215
Yes, sir.

65
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:39,825
Doctor Bun.

66
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,120
Hey, Inspector M. Good day.

67
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,195
I haven't seen you much recently, Doctor.

68
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:48,560
I guess we both have been busy.

69
00:04:49,675 --> 00:04:52,700
By the way, how are things going
with that case you've been in charge of?

70
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:59,350
We're waiting for your autopsy report
on Miss Jane's case.

71
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:03,750
As for Prosecutor Pued,
we're still at a loss.

72
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:08,675
The police are collecting
all kinds of evidence, preparing...

73
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,150
You seem really busy lately.

74
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,250
Kind of.

75
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,175
No wonder you haven't delivered
the report to me yet.

76
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,320
Next time,
please tell me if you're that busy.

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
Then I can send the case
to another hospital for processing.

78
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,845
That works for me.

79
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:30,775
Next time,
I'll handle a case that isn't yours.

80
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,925
Well, in that case, I should get going.

81
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,070
-Bun.
-Huh?

82
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,725
Popcorn?

83
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,120
I'm so happy.

84
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,475
You can make something other
than instant noodles.

85
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,900
I can use the microwave
to heat up ready meals.

86
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,795
You should learn to cook.

87
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,270
If a man can cook,

88
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,075
his attractiveness level
will increase by 30 percent.

89
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,775
Am I not attractive enough?

90
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:00,665
No.

91
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,820
Not attractive enough?

92
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,575
I can't see your attractiveness at all.

93
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,525
No wonder you don't have a girlfriend.

94
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:12,125
I don't want a girlfriend.

95
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:16,450
Why?

96
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,750
I don't think that's necessary anymore.

97
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:24,525
I've got someone
who cooks for me every day,

98
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,000
who eats popcorn and watches TV with me,

99
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:30,450
who can talk with me about things,

100
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,950
and who also sleeps next to me
every night.

101
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,345
With you by my side, Doctor,

102
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:38,825
I don't need to have a girlfriend.

103
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,595
The popcorn is good.

104
00:07:58,675 --> 00:07:59,725
Of course, it is.

105
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,145
See for yourself
how many chilies I put in.

106
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:04,650
Are you trying to please me?

107
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:09,775
I'm not picky about food.

108
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,945
For me,

109
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,450
you just need to put in a lot of chilies
and I'll love it.

110
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,400
I don't know what you like to eat yet.

111
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,720
I like to eat...

112
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,970
stir-fried pork with basil leaves
plus sausage,

113
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,445
and sunny side up.

114
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:27,745
I'll tell you one more time.

115
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:30,720
Stir-fried pork with basil leaves
plus sausage, and sunny side up.

116
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,370
Don't fry it till it's fully done
or I won't eat it.

117
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,370
Didn't you say you are not picky?

118
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,000
How is that complicated?

119
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:41,100
And you? What do you like to eat?

120
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:43,970
Stuffed eggs.

121
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,695
Stuffed eggs?

122
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,325
That's too easy.

123
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:54,145
This was what my mother most often made
for me when I was young.

124
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:55,200
OK.

125
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,400
Go on.

126
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,675
There's nothing else, really.

127
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,400
My mother didn't know how to cook.

128
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,670
That's the only thing she could make.

129
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,701
So I used to eat that a lot
when I was a kid.

130
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,356
Maybe it’s because this
is a cheap dish, too.

131
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,000
But you know what?

132
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,725
My mother's stuffed eggs...

133
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:19,270
are different from other people's.

134
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,000
There were smiley faces on them.

135
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,240
Just like my mom...

136
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,225
She wanted to make me smile.

137
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:32,600
I have never seen you smile
like this before.

138
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,750
Is it weird?

139
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:38,350
No.

140
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,625
What about...your father?

141
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:58,200
My father...has more than one wife.

142
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:03,100
It just so happens
that I'm his mistress's child.

143
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,400
That's why my father's family...

144
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:08,250
including my dad,

145
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,425
and my half brother,

146
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:13,375
doesn't care about me.

147
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,850
At my mother's funeral,
they all enjoyed a "happy get-together."

148
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,600
But being alone like that,

149
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:40,675
don't you feel lonely?

150
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't.

151
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,645
Mr. Bannakit Songsakdina.

152
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:18,150
What did you buy?

153
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,100
I bought this for you.

154
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,500
Open it. See what's inside.

155
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:27,200
-For me?
-Yeah.

156
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,800
Bun, check for me if there's a pair
of scissors in that drawer.

157
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,725
Let me see.

158
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:45,075
Bun?

159
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,050
Is it not there?

160
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,375
Uh, found it. It's here.

161
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,590
Thank you.

162
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,975
What is it?

163
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,800
Is this a hot pepper tree?

164
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,125
As a return for the cactus you gave me.

165
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,045
Take good care of it.

166
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,750
You have to raise it well
so I can have chilies.

167
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,250
No problem.

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
You'll have so much
that your stomach hurts.

169
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,850
Go to hell!

170
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,640
That?

171
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,275
What's wrong?

172
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,770
Take me home.

173
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,020
That, are you crazy?
You've lost so much blood!

174
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,300
I'm fine. Just take me home!

175
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,175
I was just on my way to the hospital.
Come with me. Let's go.

176
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,945
Why are you going to the hospital?

177
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,525
To treat my injury.

178
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,320
How did you get hurt?

179
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,175
You pushed me off my bike
and you kicked me.

180
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,495
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,750
Huh? What did you say?

182
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:42,870
Nothing. Let's go.

183
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,250
Bro, I missed it.

184
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,920
I told you I didn't say anything.
Let's go.

185
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,320
I really couldn't hear you.
Just say what you wanted to say.

186
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,995
You didn't hear me, so stop asking.
Let's go!

187
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,200
Can you stand up?

188
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,950
How did this happen?

189
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,575
The wound on your shoulder is quite deep.

190
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,900
It's infected, too.

191
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,275
Doctor Fai,
please come to the consulting room.

192
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,895
Bun, you came just in time.

193
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,520
Can you take over from here?

194
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,995
This doctor will take care of you.

195
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:25,250
See you.

196
00:14:28,975 --> 00:14:30,760
This wound is several days old.

197
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:32,595
You didn't want to go
to a doctor for it, did you?

198
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:34,575
With the wound infected like this,
you'll need a shot.

199
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,825
Here.

200
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,175
Pull down your shirt a little.

201
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,045
It's OK, Doctor.

202
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,320
I don't want the shot.

203
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,120
It's infected with bacteria.
You need this shot.

204
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,700
Just let it stay infected, Doctor.
It's fine.

205
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,945
Why did you pull up your clothes?
Now I have to clean it again.

206
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:14,950
It'll be very quick.

207
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:23,025
Why are you laughing?

208
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,950
Don't touch it yet.

209
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:28,565
Press on it.

210
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,775
Oh, why didn't you say you're scared
of needles?

211
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:44,070
Mind your words. Who is scared?

212
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,745
Why did you scream if you weren't scared?

213
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,275
I didn't scream.

214
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,741
Can we go now?

215
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:51,101
If you aren't going,
I'll take the songthaew.

216
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:53,231
OK, let's go.

217
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,595
Ah, I'm gonna fall!

218
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:04,775
Drive carefully.

219
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,195
Doctor, you are truly amazing.

220
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,375
This website has just been created,
and there are hundreds of likes already.

221
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,645
I didn't create this website.

222
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,425
Don't lie to me, Doctor.

223
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,995
Not letting go of Janejira's case
and thus doing something like this?

224
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,175
That leaves no one but you.

225
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:44,700
Did you come here
just to play this detective game with me?

226
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:47,845
Like I said,

227
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,820
I want to interview this blogger.

228
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,595
But I'm not the blogger.

229
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:54,550
Even if I was,
I wouldn't accept an interview.

230
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,595
You know what?

231
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:20,020
I used to go hiking with Jane
and watch the stars.

232
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,100
I had no idea
that Jane liked to watch the stars.

233
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,120
She didn't just like it.

234
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,040
Jane...

235
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:30,430
She knew each constellation's position
and name.

236
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,400
Speak of which, I miss Jane so much.

237
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:39,225
You haven't told me yet...

238
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,800
how you became so close to Jane.

239
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:45,150
To be honest,
Jane and I weren't that close.

240
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,620
It's just that we both
liked teaching children.

241
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,681
After we met,
I didn't even know what we talked about.

242
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:57,150
We somehow ended up opening
a cram school and teaching together.

243
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:04,025
I still go to her desk every day
out of habit.

244
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:07,700
This feeling of loss...

245
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,725
is terrible, isn't it?

246
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:15,725
Don't...always do
these dangerous things, got it?

247
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,820
What are you talking about?

248
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,200
I didn't do anything.

249
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,825
Doctor, you really don't know?

250
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,075
This place is so small.

251
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,250
Whatever you do,

252
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,425
everyone would know.

253
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:33,360
The website you created to avenge Jane...

254
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,400
Do you really think people
won't know it's from you?

255
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,450
Pat came to see me today.

256
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:44,075
He said he wanted to interview me
about Jane's case.

257
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,950
What did you say?

258
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:48,300
I refused.

259
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:51,400
Why did you refuse him?

260
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,200
Because it's very risky.

261
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,995
The murderer is still at large.

262
00:18:58,075 --> 00:18:59,875
Pued is missing, too.

263
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:02,845
What if I leak some information?

264
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:04,725
Will the murderer strike again?

265
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,200
Will someone else go missing
like Pued did?

266
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,800
I don't know any of that.

267
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:15,775
I'm so glad...

268
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,800
seeing you make this decision.

269
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,300
Why?

270
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,125
You know why.

271
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:25,300
How would I know?

272
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,320
I have nothing to give you.

273
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,075
It's been several days, Doctor.

274
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,525
Just wait a few more days then, Inspector.

275
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,895
Why are you so slow on the report?

276
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:05,445
Is this called negligence of duty?

277
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:07,525
Someone who intends
to modify the report...

278
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,425
is committing negligence of duty,
don't you think?

279
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,570
I think a doctor
should remove their prejudice.

280
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,070
I'm only acting according to the evidence.

281
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,541
In addition, Miss Jane's funeral is over.

282
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:20,971
Her family members
have no objection to this either.

283
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,970
What are you waiting for?

284
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,401
I'm waiting for the police
to find more credible evidence.

285
00:20:25,481 --> 00:20:27,201
Then I'll take my time
and submit the report.

286
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:28,631
I also want to know...

287
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,840
What if the director...

288
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,581
finds out that you deliberately delay
your report submission?

289
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,511
What will he say?

290
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,741
You know, don't you?

291
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:43,271
You know what policemen like us can do.

292
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,700
Deliberately delaying the time
won't help at all.

293
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,725
I will come again the day after tomorrow.

294
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,375
I hope your report will be ready by then.

295
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,875
Did you change your mind, Doctor?

296
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:22,050
I will let you interview me.

297
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,741
You know, don't you?

298
00:21:23,821 --> 00:21:26,760
I need to film this interview.

299
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,360
Sure.

300
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,280
So I have a condition.

301
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:33,975
Condition?

302
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,050
You can't show my face.

303
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,725
It's because of professional ethics,
right?

304
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:45,600
Professional ethics is one reason.

305
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:49,600
But I don't want to get people around me
in trouble.

306
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:45,425
Where did you go?

307
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,575
I was a little busy today.

308
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,360
Remember to answer your phone next time.

309
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:54,650
Did you call me?

310
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,920
(5 missed calls from Bun)

311
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,675
I'm sorry. I guess I didn't hear it.

312
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,350
Are the students preparing for the exams?

313
00:23:08,975 --> 00:23:10,170
No.

314
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,125
I went to work at The Mist today.

315
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,800
The Mist?

316
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,200
The Mist...

317
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,550
The pub where we first met.

318
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,575
You caught me off guard and...

319
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,475
sneakily "attacked" me.

320
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,950
Stop talking. I know.

321
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,950
That day...
Why were you so eager to do that?

322
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,020
I was drunk that day.

323
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,425
That's why I kissed you.

324
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,845
But you weren't drunk.

325
00:23:57,925 --> 00:23:59,575
Why did you kiss me back?

326
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,000
I was just being polite.

327
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,650
You are indeed polite.

328
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:15,320
Do you want to know how truly polite I am?

329
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:20,725
Why did you go there?

330
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,720
I manage that place.

331
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,575
You teach during the day,

332
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:34,925
and manage the pub at night.

333
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,750
You have so many secrets.

334
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,600
We don't need to let everyone
know everything about us, do we?

335
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,850
Are there other things about you
that I don't know?

336
00:24:50,325 --> 00:24:51,520
Of course.

337
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,675
What are they?

338
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,680
I can't say yet.

339
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,780
It's a secret.

340
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,400
You smell so good.

341
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,300
You made my face dirty.

342
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,870
I can't drive you today.

343
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,161
I was about to tell you.

344
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:37,761
There's something I need
to do this afternoon.

345
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:39,041
I may drive there myself.

346
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,290
Something?

347
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,000
A new case?

348
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,445
Hey.

349
00:25:45,525 --> 00:25:48,000
-Can't there be one thing you don't know?
-No.

350
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,250
Well, I can tell you.

351
00:25:54,025 --> 00:25:56,200
I can tell you that this is a secret.

352
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,000
We don’t need to let everyone
know everything about us, do we?

353
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,840
See you later.

354
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:38,850
Where did you go with Pued that day?

355
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,475
I only talked to him about the pub.

356
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:44,725
We split up after that, Por.

357
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,475
Right after you had a big fight?

358
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,050
Work is work, Brother.

359
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,200
I don't believe you!

360
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,850
Because I'm untrustworthy?

361
00:27:01,975 --> 00:27:03,700
Or because you don't like me?

362
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,075
Both.

363
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,970
Let's cut to the chase.

364
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,570
You asked me to come here.

365
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,900
What do you want me to do?

366
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,975
Bring Pued back.

367
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,870
How do you want me to bring him back?

368
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,400
That's your business, Tan.

369
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,145
You just need to bring him back safely.

370
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:33,400
Understand?

371
00:27:36,675 --> 00:27:38,395
OK, Brother.

372
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:41,450
I hope you can do at least that.

373
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,175
Get lost!

374
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,725
Doctor, over here.

375
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,300
Please sit down, Doctor.

376
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:36,175
Are you ready?

377
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,700
May I ask you something before we begin?

378
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,775
What is it?

379
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,475
Is everything you do
just for the likes you get?

380
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,095
Do you really not know?

381
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:51,341
In this era,

382
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:54,196
likes are more profitable
than working hours.

383
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,075
But I don’t think it's that simple.

384
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,880
What you need to know...

385
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:06,121
is that I can get more things
which you wouldn't even think of.

386
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:08,770
More importantly,
I know more about things that you don't.

387
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,175
That is enough.

388
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,300
I really dislike you.

389
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:19,675
I have known that fact for a while.

390
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,445
What you need to do...

391
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:27,820
is answer my questions clearly
and without interruption.

392
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,621
I will use a program to change your voice.

393
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,850
So, you don't have
to worry about anything.

394
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,600
Don't slip up and call me Doctor.

395
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,475
I can't guarantee that.

396
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,820
Please tell me.

397
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,350
What do you know
about Miss Janejira's case?

398
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,361
Miss Janejira's case
is what the police are about to conceal.

399
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:56,200
All the evidence indicates
that this is a murder case.

400
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,745
Both the atypical scratch marks
on the rope...

401
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:03,400
and the scratch marks on her neck
indicate a struggle for life.

402
00:30:04,075 --> 00:30:07,920
But even with the evidence,
this case was ruled as suicide.

406
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:20,600
Inspector!

407
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:22,900
Take a look.

408
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,150
What are you doing?

409
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:34,641
Because of the carelessness of the police,
they wish to close the case quickly.

410
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:37,640
Because of some inside matter,
they aren't looking for the real evidence.

411
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,645
I think the truth of this case...

412
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:43,150
is being covered up.

413
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,925
What does he want?

414
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,040
(Chief)

415
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,525
Yes, Chief?

416
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,220
Because of the carelessness of the police,
they wish to close the case quickly.

417
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,920
Because of some inside matter,
they aren't looking for the real evidence.

418
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,970
Doctor Bun.

419
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,700
I think the truth of this case...

420
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,425
-is being covered up.
-Yes?

421
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,900
Didn't you say
you wouldn't accept the interview?

422
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:30,050
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance.

423
00:31:30,675 --> 00:31:32,095
But it was necessary.

424
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:34,995
Do you know how dangerous this is?

425
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:36,825
What do you want me to do?

426
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,170
Just let things go?

427
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,870
And let Jane die with such an injustice?

428
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,620
So you risk your own life
and die with her?

429
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,195
You know, don't you?

430
00:31:45,275 --> 00:31:47,720
How the police want to close
this case quickly?

431
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,320
If I don't do this
and put pressure on them,

432
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,695
no matter what my autopsy report states,

433
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:55,570
they will still say
that Jane committed suicide.

434
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,520
The injustice Jane suffers from
will never be undone!

435
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,775
I'm starting to wonder
if you really care about Jane or not.

436
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,925
How can I not care?

437
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,700
-You know too...
-If you do,

438
00:32:12,475 --> 00:32:14,400
you can do more than just stand by
and watch!

439
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,640
Tell me.

440
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,375
What have you done for Jane all this time?

441
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:23,400
Okay.

442
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,480
It's true that I haven't done anything
for Jane.

443
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,120
Goodbye.

444
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,175
Thank you, Miss Jane.

445
00:33:10,175 --> 00:33:11,650
How could you do that?

446
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:14,300
Wait a second, Miss Rungtiva.

447
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,920
How could you let your men...

448
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,425
conceal the truth of this case?

449
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,125
What are you talking about?

450
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,825
You haven't seen the video yet, have you?

451
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,390
Video?

452
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,665
What video?

453
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,120
Just see it for yourself.

454
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,970
Both the atypical scratch marks
on the rope...

455
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,620
and the scratch marks on her neck
indicate a struggle for life.

456
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,795
But even with this evidence,

457
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,581
this case was ruled as suicide
because the police...

458
00:33:52,661 --> 00:33:54,160
This is my sister's case.

459
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,640
How could you do this?

460
00:33:57,425 --> 00:34:00,495
What a pity!
We have known each other for so long.

461
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:02,550
Handle this case properly.

462
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,625
Don't disappoint me even more.

463
00:34:06,275 --> 00:34:08,345
Actually,

464
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:09,850
I have been doing my best.

465
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:13,480
I had my men focus on this case.

466
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,075
Isn't that right, Inspector?

467
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,375
Yes, Chief.

468
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,950
So, you don't need to worry
about this, Ms. Rungtiva.

469
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:26,645
The Viangpha Mork police...

470
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:30,300
will never allow your sister's case
to be concealed.

471
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,920
I hope what you say is true.

472
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,675
I will wait and see.

473
00:34:47,475 --> 00:34:49,370
Oat, why are you sitting here?

474
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,750
-Doctor, look at this.
-The content of that video is nonsense.

475
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:55,150
The Viangpha Mork police...

476
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:58,670
will never allow the truth
of Janejira's case...

477
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,220
to get distorted as stated in that video.

478
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,450
What are you going to do?

479
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,400
We will continue to investigate
until everything comes to light.

480
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,725
So this case is now considered
a murder case, is that right?

481
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:17,250
I'd like to say thank you
to all online media...

482
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,975
for helping Jane get justice.

483
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:29,525
My sister can rest in peace now.

484
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,721
As the representative of the people,

485
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,041
I won't let my fellow countrymen down.

486
00:35:37,121 --> 00:35:39,521
I'm willing to do anything...

487
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:43,240
to arrest the murderer in Ms. Jane's case.

488
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,000
Thank you.

489
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,670
Wait, Your Excellency!

490
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,050
Your Excellency,
what are the further plans?

491
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,100
Now, we can send them the autopsy report.

492
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:56,400
Watch it again.

493
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,725
What do we do now, Inspector?

494
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,040
(Cause of death: murder)

495
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,895
-Doctor.
-Hm?

496
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:28,550
No one's picking you up today?

497
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,250
Yeah.

498
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,020
I'll get going.

499
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Bye.

500
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,650
Hey.

501
00:37:03,825 --> 00:37:06,000
-I...
-I'm sorry.

502
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,545
I should be the one to apologize.

503
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't think it's time to fight over
who should apologize to whom.

504
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,270
You aren't mad at me anymore, are you?

505
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,920
How could I?

506
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,075
The things you said were true.

507
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,025
It's my fault.

508
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,225
I shouldn't have let you struggle
on your own.

509
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,670
If I was angry,

510
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,300
that would be
because you risked your life for it.

511
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,070
May I ask something of you, Bun?

512
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,950
When something happens, tell me.

513
00:37:38,975 --> 00:37:40,545
Let me participate.

514
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,875
Let me help you.

515
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:47,150
If you have any new progress,
you need to tell me as well.

516
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,075
I can trust you, right?

517
00:37:56,425 --> 00:37:58,000
I will do my best.

518
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,420
So about what happened to Pued,
did you find out anything new?

519
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,920
Not yet.

520
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,350
Anyway, help me look into this matter.

521
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,450
Sure.

522
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:11,525
Thank you.

523
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,040

(I've bought you your favorite food -Tan)

525
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,875
I saw you with That that evening.

526
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:30,650
I'm leaving, Sorn.

527
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,125
Hey, Nam!

528
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,625
Nam!

529
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,370
There are drugs in Viangpha Mork!

530
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,050
Don't you guys know?

531
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,400
You are going too far, Doctor.
