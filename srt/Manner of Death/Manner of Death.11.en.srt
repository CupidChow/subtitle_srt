1
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:24,020
(One year ago)

2
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,820
Jane and I got together, Rung.

3
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,740
You scared me.

4
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,220
I thought that something had gone wrong.

5
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,780
Because I never brought my boyfriend
to meet you.

6
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,500
I feel embarrassed.

7
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,821
You never brought home a boyfriend,

8
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:55,541
but now you bring Pued home?

9
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,420
That's because Pued is really nice.

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,460
But Pued is a playboy.

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,140
He falls in love easily
and gets bored quickly.

12
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,100
But that was me in the past.

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,720
So you won't get into trouble
by being a playboy?

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,040
Rung, I'm not a playboy anymore.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,760
I can guarantee that.

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,760
Jane, you can't guarantee that for him.

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,280
We can't even guarantee...

18
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,240
that we won't do something bad someday.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,000
You know it, right?

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,360
You two...

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,840
are the people I love the most.

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,560
If you want to stay together,

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,000
I hope that neither of you will get hurt.

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,960
I will never upset Jane.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,160
I won't, either.

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,320
Congratulations.

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,920
Thank you, Rung.

28
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,680
I love you, Sister.

29
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,400
I love you too, my dear sister.

30
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,880
=Manner of Death=

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,680
Commander, we didn't find him.

32
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,800
Commander, how is it going with the case?

33
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,080
In order to escape,
Tan took Dr. Bun hostage.

34
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,080
Seeing that the situation didn't' look good,
Tan shot Dr. Bun.

35
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,440
It was unexpected.

36
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,840
At last, Tan put up stubborn resistance.

37
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,040
It forced the police to shoot him dead.

38
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,840
In the end, both of them
fell off the cliff into the river.

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,960
Their bodies might have been
carried far away by the river.

40
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,521
So the police couldn't find the bodies.

41
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:11,081
The police confirmed that Mr. Tan
and Dr. Bun are dead, right?

42
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,400
We can't confirm it yet,
unless the bodies are found.

43
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,200
The police
and the underwater rescue team...

44
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,080
Dr. Bun.

45
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,480
He shouldn't have died young.

46
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:27,025
Oh, Bun.

47
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,160
I can't believe it.

48
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
He has really died.

49
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,960
It's hard for me to accept it, too.

50
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,680
I hope they won't find his body.

51
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,040
It means that he isn't dead.

52
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,440
But I don't want
to deceive myself, either.

53
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,400
Let's mourn...for Dr. Bun together.

54
00:06:06,477 --> 00:06:07,437
Okay.

55
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,240
-Sister Fai.
-Hm?

56
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,840
Did you hear that too?

57
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,360
I did.

58
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,240
It sounded like footsteps.

59
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,600
It can't be Dr. Bun, right?

60
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,440
Oat, there are no ghosts in the world!

61
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,920
I saw you guys talking,
so I came to have a look.

62
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,640
Sorawit!

63
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,080
Is Dr. Bun really dead?

64
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,640
Yeah.

65
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,240
Come on. Be careful.

66
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,960
I really wish...that it was Dr. Bun.

67
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,000
So you can do evening laps with him?

68
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,440
No.

69
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,480
I have a lot to tell Dr. Bun.

70
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,840
If Dr. Bun were here,

71
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,880
what would you tell him?

72
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,560
Dr. Oat, just say it.

73
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,280
Even if Dr. Bun can't hear it,
at least you will feel better.

74
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Dr. Bun.

75
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,880
You know?

76
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,920
You are so fierce.

77
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,080
I always walked on eggshells around you
when we worked together.

78
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,040
You were even fiercer than a dog...

79
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,320
But I can't forget...

80
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,400
the director's birthday wreath.

81
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,880
I wanted to ask you,
"How could you forget it?"

82
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,880
But you don't need to wake up
and give it to me.

83
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,121
I just want three things
that will help me with lottery tickets.

84
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,441
Or give me three numbers.

85
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,080
Or numbers for three weeks.

86
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,040
That's all.

87
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,800
Oat!

88
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,400
I had a feeling, but that's all gone now!

89
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,760
I'm being serious.

90
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:07,360
Oh, yes.

91
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,720
Sorry, Oat. I forgot about it.

92
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,240
Can I put it in an envelope for you later?

93
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,880
Aren't you afraid?

94
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,160
Fai, why are you screaming?

95
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,320
Sorawit!

96
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,294
Ghost!

97
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:31,665
What ghost?

98
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:33,960
It's me! It's me!

99
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,880
Dr. Bun!

100
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,480
Didn't you say that there were no ghosts?

101
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,600
You screamed like that.

102
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,080
He suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

103
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,160
It's good enough that I didn't faint.

104
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,320
Dr. Bun, are you really not dead yet?

105
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,360
Yeah. I'm not dead yet.

106
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,200
Where did you disappear into?

107
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,560
I've tricked everyone
into thinking that I'm dead.

108
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,360
Why?

109
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
Oat, this matter is very complicated.

110
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,880
Anyway, someone is trying to hunt me down.

111
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,160
If I hadn't done this,
I'd have been really dead.

112
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
I came back here because I need your help.

113
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,280
No.

114
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,560
I won't help you.

115
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,280
Tell us everything in detail first.

116
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,400
Where have you been all this time?

117
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,880
Commander Tung caught me.

118
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,000
He also captured Nam and That.

119
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,800
What should we do?

120
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,160
I'm going to kill you.

121
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,480
Commander Tung has everything planned out.

122
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,280
He wants to kill you
and then get rid of me.

123
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,880
In the end,

124
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,920
he will blame everything on us,
whether it's Jane's, Pat's,

125
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,480
or Pued's case.

126
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,360
What are you going to do?

127
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,280
I will hunt you down...

128
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,560
until we're at the cliff.

129
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,040
I will shoot you in front of them...

130
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,120
to create the illusion that you're dead.

131
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,000
Listen to me.

132
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,040
You need to shoot at this spot.

133
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,880
The deltoid muscle
where there are no bones.

134
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,640
This is the safest way.

135
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,880
Why are you laughing?

136
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,880
I have a better idea.

137
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,600
Inspector M!

138
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,440
You are in cahoots with him, aren't you?

139
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
I'm here to help you.

140
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,000
What do you mean? Help me?

141
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Let me go!

142
00:13:02,722 --> 00:13:05,682
You think you can run away from them,
and then what?

143
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,440
You want to go back to the safe house
and meet up with Dr. Bun.

144
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,880
Then you'll make a fake video announcing
that Dr. Bun is dead,

145
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,360
and send them the video.

146
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,800
Do you think they will believe it?

147
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,880
They installed a GPS device in your car.

148
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,680
They will track you down
and kill you both.

149
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,880
What do you want me to do?

150
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:54,360
After I shoot you,
I'll let the inspector shoot me.

151
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,640
We'll fall off the cliff together.

152
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:12,280
You don't have to be afraid.

153
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,560
I won't let you get shot on your own.

154
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:34,031
Tan!

155
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,080
Tan! Tan!

156
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,040
Wake up!

157
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Tan! Tan!

158
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
Are you all right, Tan?

159
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:52,720
Are you injured?

160
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,920
You are okay, right?

161
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
That's what I should be asking you!

162
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,600
Does it hurt?

163
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,840
Are you all right?

164
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,840
Can you walk?

165
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,560
Their bodies should lie nearby.

166
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,440
They might still be alive.

167
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,560
They couldn't have survived a fall
from a cliff this high.

168
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,400
Inspector, you haven't explained to me
why you are here.

169
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,600
Actually...

170
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,960
While I was on patrol, I happened
to see Mr. Tan's car, so I followed him.

171
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,880
But I lost him for a while.

172
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,200
I followed him all the way here.

173
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,440
Then I saw Mr. Tan
who was about to shoot Dr. Bun.

174
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,600
If I had arrived earlier,

175
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,960
Dr. Bun wouldn't have died.

176
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,840
You have already done a good job,
Inspector.

177
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,901
Doctor, please check
if there's something missing.

178
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,101
Thank you.

179
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,321
Looks like we need to stay here
for a while.

180
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:06,720
I warned you already, didn't I?
I told you not to go out.

181
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,680
Inspector, we only went out
to look for some wild fruits to eat.

182
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,800
But we didn't find anything.

183
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,800
Bun, does your wound still hurt?

184
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,760
Yeah, but it's okay.
My ribs aren't broken.

185
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,680
Let me see.

186
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,040
Hold the shirt.

187
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,240
I'll apply some medicine to it.

188
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,920
Tan, I was shot, not bitten by ants.

189
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,600
Applying medicine must have some effect.

190
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,800
You should worry about yourself.

191
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,600
Your injury is worse than mine.

192
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,600
Looks like I really
don't have to worry about you two.

193
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,160
Why did you stop?

194
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,640
It's all right.

195
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,480
Inspector, be honest.

196
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,480
Did you come up with this plan
to get us shot...

197
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,320
because you wanted
to take revenge on Dr. Bun?

198
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,320
Yes.

199
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,320
If you wanted to take revenge on Dr. Bun,
why did you shoot me?

200
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,680
Because I knew that if you get hurt,

201
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,440
it will be more painful for Dr. Bun.

202
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,600
You are too much.

203
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,400
Are you hungry?

204
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,040
I'll cook for you, if you are.

205
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,040
No, thank you.

206
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,000
I have important things
to discuss with you.

207
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,840
What are you going to do next?

208
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,560
Brother.

209
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,200
I heard from the people outside...

210
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,480
that Mr. Tan and Dr. Bun are dead.

211
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,400
That's impossible.

212
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
But I heard that they were shot
and fell off the cliff.

213
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,280
What are you doing?

214
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,400
Are you still struggling?

215
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,320
Get up!

216
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,920
Move!

217
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,680
Go faster!

218
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,920
-Go faster!
-Where are you taking me?

219
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,520
Brother?

220
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,360
Go!

221
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,480
For you.

222
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
Thank you, Oat.

223
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,160
Did you find it?

224
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,720
Nothing.

225
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,960
These online data
have been saved for only a few years.

226
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,440
There is no information
about Prosecutor Pued's treatment yet.

227
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,160
What about the other files?

228
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,040
I've checked all the files
over the past five years...

229
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:52,440
and found nothing.

230
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,000
I think I need to go
to the file storage room tomorrow.

231
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,800
Where is this?

232
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,920
My home.

233
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,920
That!

234
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,280
Are you okay?

235
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,320
I'm fine.

236
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,320
But you!

237
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,320
Who did this to you?

238
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,520
Hurry and tell me!

239
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,520
These injuries aren't enough to kill me.

240
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,600
When I looked like that previously,

241
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,960
you were also like this.

242
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,960
Really?

243
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,160
I don't remember.

244
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,781
By the way, That.

245
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:35,581
Sorawit prepared the bedding
for you over there.

246
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
Where are you going to sleep?

247
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,480
I can sleep on the sofa later.

248
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,240
Aren't you going to invite me
to sleep with you?

249
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,600
Just sleep on the sofa.

250
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,080
It's much more comfortable.

251
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
No. You deserve it.

252
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,680
You should sleep there.

253
00:26:03,465 --> 00:26:04,768
Deserve it?

254
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,680
If we had met 10 years ago,

255
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,880
would we have been like them?

256
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,280
If I had had the courage
to say hello to you then,

257
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,360
it might have been possible.

258
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,120
-There you go.
-Thank you.

259
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,800
Let's forget about the past.
It's better to live in the present.

260
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,040
I mean, are you hiding a secret from me?

261
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,960
Not a secret.

262
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,120
I just haven't told you yet.

263
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,760
(Viangpha Mork Hospital)

264
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,520
Did you find it, Oat?

265
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
No.

266
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,840
I'm even looking through the documents
from 10 years ago.

267
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,520
It seems that there is no record...

268
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,360
of Prosecutor Pued's medical history.

269
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,520
Hey!

270
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,120
What are you doing?

271
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,960
-Prosecutor Pued's medical record?
-Yes.

272
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,680
I know. I was his attending physician.

273
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,120
Hello, Big Brother.

274
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,240
You guys are amazing.

275
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,480
Do you want to tell me, Dr. Bun?

276
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,760
About how you escaped.

277
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,640
I'll tell you everything later.

278
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,680
But right now,
I want to ask you something.

279
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,520
What is it?

280
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,181
I just got the news from the hospital.

281
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:30,061
It's about Pued's heart disease.

282
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,200
Prosecutor Pued first had symptoms
of heart disease 10 years ago.

283
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,440
I still remember that day clearly.

284
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,560
Cardiac arrest.

285
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,240
Prepare for CPR.

286
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,600
One, two, three, four, five, six...

287
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,360
How is my boyfriend's condition?

288
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,121
The patient's condition has stabilized.

289
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:21,081
But he may still need surgery.

290
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,160
Thank you so much, Doctor.

291
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:38,368
That's right.

292
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:42,640
Rungtiva and Pued once got together.

293
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,400
Ten years ago.

294
00:30:48,877 --> 00:30:50,160
But not for long.

295
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,440
Because Pued was a playboy.

296
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,120
Inspector.

297
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,161
It means that apart from Por and Tan,

298
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:01,841
Rung also knows
about Pued's heart disease.

299
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,480
Big Brother, could it be...

300
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,560
that Rung killed Pued?

301
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,280
Why didn't I think of that?

302
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:22,614
Everything makes sense now.

303
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,800
What do you mean?

304
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,400
Before she opened the spa,

305
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,160
Rungtiva studied pharmacy.

306
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,440
I found tire marks
of another car on the scene.

307
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,520
If we compare them with Rungtiva's car,

308
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,560
we should get the answer.

309
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,440
The police inspected
the scene of the crime...

310
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,440
and found tire marks.

311
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,480
We suspect that they belong to the car
used by the murderer of the prosecutor.

312
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,974
I've checked the tire type.

313
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:22,761
I noticed that the tire marks
found on the scene...

314
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:26,401
belong to the same type of tires
as the one on Ms. Rungtiva's car.

315
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,960
Based on this piece of evidence alone,

316
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,080
we still can't prove that Ms. Rungtiva
is Pued's murderer, right?

317
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Yes.

318
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,880
But upon investigation, we found...

319
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,480
that apart from Mr. Por and Mr. Tan,
Rungtiva is the only one...

320
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,440
who has known
about Prosecutor Pued's heart disease.

321
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,120
And she could kill him
by injecting him with cardiac stimulants.

322
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,240
The important thing is...

323
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,760
that Ms. Rungtiva had a relationship
with Prosecutor Pued.

324
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,680
There was tension between the two of them.

325
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,880
I really don't want to believe it.

326
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,880
If that is the case,

327
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,200
the warrant for arresting Rungtiva...

328
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,100
I will handle it.

329
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,680
Thank you.

00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,200
Hello, Rung.

334
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,560
The police told me that you two were dead.

335
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,360
That's right.

336
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,880
It's what the police here want to see.

337
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,600
But these two guys escaped from it.

338
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,200
Inspector M.

339
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,680
Ms. Rungtiva.

340
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,920
I hereby arrest you and charge you
with the murder of the prosecutor.

341
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,760
=Manner of Death=

342
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,360
What do you think?

343
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,000
Sit down.

344
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,200
It's really hard to believe.

345
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,520
We actually escaped
from all of that yesterday.

346
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,800
Are you talking about "bungee jumping"?

347
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,800
It was much more
than "bungee jumping", okay?

348
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,960
There was no rope,
and we were shot at close range.

349
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,000
It was pretty exciting.

350
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,400
How is your wound?

351
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,200
It still hurts, doesn't it?

352
00:37:30,477 --> 00:37:31,317
Well...

353
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,120
A little.

354
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
In that case...

355
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,400
I can't hug you.

356
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,080
Who wants to hug you?

357
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,600
Come here.

358
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,021
Then the plan...

359
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,661
What do we have to prepare for tonight?

360
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,080
Maybe we'll need to find something to do
to pass the time.

361
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,000
What else can we do here?

362
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,240
Where is this place?

363
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Who are you?

364
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,880
Are you sure you don't need a lawyer?

365
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Yes.

366
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,000
Don't think this is the end of it,
Rungtiva.

367
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,760
I really can't imagine
how crazy things would be...

368
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,880
if you weren't here right now.

369
00:39:28,294 --> 00:39:29,642
What are you doing, Tan?
