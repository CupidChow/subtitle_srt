1
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,696
You're eating ice cream again.

2
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,056
Then you won't get rid
of your sore throat.

3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,096
Oh, Rung.
(Ten years ago)

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,901
Just one or two cups are fine.
(Ten years ago)

5
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,985
Look at you.
You disagree with everything I say.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,820
You nag me like mother.

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,980
If I stop nagging you one day,
you'll feel lonely. Just wait and see.

8
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,580
Rung.

9
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,140
Thank you for always taking care of me.

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,376
I only allowed you to eat some ice cream.
Do you need to be so grateful?

11
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,300
I'm so touched.

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,136
I will never leave you.

13
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,336
I will always stay by your side
and nag you like a mother.

14
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,456
And I'll keep taking care
of you like this, okay?

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,576
Okay.

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,976
But, Rung, I promise you.

17
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,340
After I graduate,
it'll be my turn to take care of you.

18
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,540
I will wait for that day to come.

19
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,380
Rung, I love you.

20
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,376
I love you too.

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,896
Jane, remember.

22
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,540
I'm willing to give you anything,
even my life.

23
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,860
I would give you my life, too.

24
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,940
Silly girl.

25
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,400
Can you buy me more ice cream?

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,656
Don't push it.

27
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,340
No, Rung.

28
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,800
=Manner of Death=

29
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,020
How did you think of hiding here?

30
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,936
Haven't you heard?

31
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,380
The most dangerous place
is the safest place.

32
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,520
We've put ourselves
in danger several times.

33
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,720
When will...

34
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,824
it end?

35
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,260
Maybe until we become ghosts like Pued.

36
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,500
Don't worry.

37
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,660
I will protect you.

38
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,560
I swear by my life.

39
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,780
By your life?

40
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,580
Is that not good?

41
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,060
Are you going to abandon me again?

42
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,696
Don't worry.

43
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,140
Even if I become a ghost,

44
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,700
I will stay by your side.

45
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,020
I won't go anywhere.

46
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,380
If you become a ghost,
you should stay away.

47
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,260
You...

48
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,580
Isn't it a bit dark here?

49
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,940
Go and turn on the lights.

50
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,936
The latest report.

51
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,016
An atrocious murder has occurred
in Viangpha Mork.

52
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,336
A famous teacher is suspected of killing
a female teacher and a prosecutor.

53
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,641
While fleeing with a doctor,
he shot the inspector.

54
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:15,721
What is it?

55
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,681
The inspector's survival
remains uncertain.

56
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:20,641
The police are still pursuing the suspect.

57
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:24,161
If you have any information,
please call the number below.

58
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:25,285
Inspector M.

59
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,860
How did it turn out like this?

60
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,540
Dr. Bun and Mr. Tan managed to escape.

61
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,060
Inspector M isn't dead either.

62
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,540
Commander, how could you make
such a big mistake?

63
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,976
If you're capable, handle it yourself.

64
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,460
Nonsense.

65
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,336
What did you say?

66
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,500
Enough.

67
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,020
If you go on arguing,
they'll run off to some distant place.

68
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,220
I've already issued an arrest warrant.

69
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,940
All that's left is to find them.

70
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,260
I have ordered my men
to conduct a 24-hour thorough search.

71
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,660
They should be able to find them soon.

72
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,580
What about those kids?

73
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,096
Are you sure the money
is hidden here, Nam?

74
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,660
It should be right here.

75
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,976
Why didn't you deposit
the money in the bank?

76
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,696
They warned me...

77
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,096
not to let others get suspicious
of how I got the money.

78
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,340
So I couldn't deposit it in the bank.

79
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,740
Inspector, you are a good police officer.

80
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,580
I admire you as a police officer.

81
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,460
But unfortunately,
you are not smart enough.

82
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,940
If you had been a bit smarter
and followed the right people,

83
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,700
your life wouldn't have ended like this.

84
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,960
Let's say you gave me the evidence.

85
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,940
Hey, run!

86
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,860
Back to where you were standing!

87
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,656
Don't worry about me. Hurry and go.

88
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,016
Sit down!

89
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,300
How can I leave you alone?

90
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,060
Rest in peace.

91
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,340
Sorn!

92
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,500
What are you doing?

93
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,140
What should we do next?

94
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,520
I think we can't be fugitives...

95
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,740
waiting for the police to arrest us.

96
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,020
There's also Jane's case.

97
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,776
If it wasn't Pued,

98
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,400
who would be the murderer?

99
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,980
I know.

100
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,560
You are suspecting someone.

101
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,520
But you are afraid to say the name, right?

102
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,240
Are you thinking the same?

103
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,300
Big Brother.

104
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,340
I got this phone at the police station
when Rungtiva was arrested.

105
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,860
I also wondered previously what this phone
could have been used for.

106
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,660
I checked it, but found nothing unusual.

107
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,260
If I can figure out that you
and Tan are here,

108
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,660
it won't be long...

109
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,260
before they find this out.

110
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,380
Doctor, what are you going to do?

111
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,700
We were just discussing this.

112
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,740
Are you going to run away?

113
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,900
We can't, Brother.

114
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,660
If we run away,

115
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,580
we will be admitting...

116
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,860
that we did those things.

117
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,696
Right now,

118
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,120
you are fugitives wanted by the police.

119
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,540
What are you going to do? Tell me.

120
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,056
You've been here for a few days.

121
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,576
Why didn’t you call me?

122
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,016
You turned off your phone.

123
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,800
Oh, right. Sorry.

124
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,940
Gift often called me and harassed me,
so I changed my phone.

125
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,320
-Wait a second.
-Okay.

126
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,460
Hello.

127
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,340
Pued had more than one cell phone.

128
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,560
Yes.

129
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,064
Pued had a black cell phone, too.

130
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,940
Tan.

131
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,760
Think carefully.

132
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:46,464
If you were Pued,

133
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,540
where would you hide your cell phone?

134
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,060
Is this lamp broken, Brother?

135
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
No. I took it apart.

136
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,980
Why did you take it apart?

137
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,620
-You want to know?
-Yes.

138
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,340
Here.

139
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,060
Take them. I have many of them.

140
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,260
Why did you hide them?

141
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,456
You are so stupid.

142
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,016
Think about it.

143
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,860
If I put them outside,

144
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,080
how many women left would I have?

145
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:50,160
I'll be screwed.

146
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,660
Take as many as you want.

147
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,940
What's wrong?

148
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,540
Tan, what are you doing?

149
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,240
(March 2020)

150
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,236
If you hadn't helped me with this case,

151
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,276
I'd have been in a terrible situation.

152
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,276
I'm happy to help you, Ms. Rungtiva.

153
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,236
Judge Suradej, I really don't know
how to repay you now.

154
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,560
That's not necessary.

155
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,520
Are you interested in my sister?

156
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,520
Pued is your subordinate.

157
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,076
He knows very well...

158
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,000
what a good subordinate...

159
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,524
needs to do.

160
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,240
It's over, Pued!

161
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,160
Jane. Jane!

162
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,400
Jane, I don't want you
to do those things, either.

163
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,120
But I have no choice.

164
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,480
Those high officials really want you,
Jane.

165
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,320
Do I really have to do it, Rung?

166
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,640
I love you.

167
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,120
Ms. Jane...

168
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,520
Pretty girl, come to this room.

169
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,880
I can't stand it, Rung.
I won't do it anymore.

170
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,320
Didn't we talk about it before?

171
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,120
We didn’t talk about these things, Rung.

172
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,880
Things are getting serious now.

173
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,520
Not just orgies.
There are even underage students.

174
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,120
Rung, what are you doing, actually?

175
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,160
I do this so the two of us won't starve!

176
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,800
But this isn't what I want.

177
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,280
I think you are quite happy like this.

178
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,640
I was never happy.

179
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,876
When you're lying on the bed,

180
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,640
you look so happy.

181
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,520
Are you sure you don't want
to do it anymore?

182
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,080
Rung.

183
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,400
Go home and think about it.

184
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:21,520
(Ms. Janejira)

185
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,520
You go in first, Jane. I'll come later.

186
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,080
Okay.

187
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,200
(Pued)

188
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,480
Rung.

189
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,360
Jane.

190
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,320
I'm sorry.

191
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,600
Ms. Janejira, please come in.

192
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,400
What are you doing, Jane?

193
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,520
I think you should stop thinking about it.

194
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,836
Why?

195
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,240
It's too dangerous, Jane.

196
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,280
I will do it, no matter what.

197
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,840
But if you do this,

198
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,800
Rung will go to jail.

199
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,320
And you will be in trouble, too.

200
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,201
Also, those high officials...

201
00:26:41,285 --> 00:26:43,285
Do you think
they will do nothing about it?

202
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,560
I think you are just afraid
of ruining your future.

203
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,640
I'm really bad.

204
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,720
She was my own student.

205
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,120
But I couldn't help her at all.

206
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,240
You still haven't changed.

207
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,141
-What do you mean?
-You still take all the responsibility.

208
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,305
Even when you did nothing wrong.

209
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,320
I made a mistake, Bun.

210
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,760
I made such an awful mistake.

211
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,120
While knowing the truth,

212
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,920
I still let Natty die.

213
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,960
This one is not good.
This one has a more prominent figure.

214
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,440
This one...

215
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,920
This one doesn't seem to be as daring
as Ms. Jane.

216
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,360
Yes.

217
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,240
I dare to do anything.

218
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,720
Do you want to know how daring I am?

219
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,641
I dare to expose every one of you!

220
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,441
I'll expose all your crimes!

221
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:08,761
-Jane!-
Wait for it!

222
00:28:08,845 --> 00:28:11,841
You will see
if I really dare to do everything!

223
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:13,061
Jane! Enough!

224
00:28:13,145 --> 00:28:14,585
-Wait for it!
-Jane!

225
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,880
You are so useless that you can't survive
without the support of others!

226
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,800
Tan!

227
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,200
You should take care of this.

228
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,400
You will know the truth soon.

229
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Jane.

230
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,800
Jane.

231
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,760
(Jane)

232
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,636
(Pued)

233
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,000
Hello, Jane.

234
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,396
Jane, hello?

235
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,040
(Pued)

236
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,720
I understand your feelings.

237
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,600
Really?

238
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,320
You are just confused.

239
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,680
No, Rung.

240
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,320
I'm not confused.

241
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,116
(Jane)

242
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,360
I just feel stupid.

243
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,836
For letting you deceive me
and use me for so long.

244
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,516
I didn't deceive or use you.

245
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,240
You did everything willingly.

246
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,341
I was willing to do it...

247
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:21,240
because of you.

248
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,200
For your career.

249
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,440
But you've gone too far, Rung.

250
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,916
Are you still human?

251
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,876
Jane, enough.

252
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,480
You were my everything.

253
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,720
My mother.

254
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,000
My sister.

255
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,360
And my friend.

256
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,440
But I don't recognize you now.

257
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,360
Then, what are you planning to do?

258
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
I have evidence.

259
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,160
I will expose them.

260
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,520
I'll make all of them suffer.

261
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,840
Don't.

262
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Rung!

263
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,396
No. No.

264
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,276
Rung! No. No.

265
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,800
Rung, don't do this.

266
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,800
Are you angry with me?

267
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,080
You know?

268
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,160
Before I became like this,

269
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
I had done the same kind of work.

270
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,720
I was a plaything of the high officials.

271
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,800
I sold my own body...

272
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,360
in exchange for everything.

273
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,160
Rung.

274
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,880
I really need you right now.

275
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,640
Will you really not help me?

276
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,760
I don't want you to do this.

277
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,760
But I have no choice.

278
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,640
Do I really have to do this, Rung?

279
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,120
I love you.

280
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,760
(Bun)

281
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,560
Hello?

282
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,160
Bun.

283
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,200
Hello, Rung.

284
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,200
Open it and take a look.

285
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,040
I think there's something
we need to talk about.

286
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,701
Even if we expose the video
and Rungtiva gets arrested,

287
00:40:39,785 --> 00:40:41,625
we'll still be criminals on the run.

288
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,320
That video...

289
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,040
Hand it over in exchange of Por's life.

290
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,836
If we don’t expose the video,

291
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,921
Jane and Pued would have died in vain!

292
00:40:55,005 --> 00:40:56,685
But I can’t let my brother die!

293
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,560
Even God can't save you now.
