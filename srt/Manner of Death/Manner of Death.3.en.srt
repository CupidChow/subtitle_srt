00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,460
Fortunately, it's just hypnotics.
(Midazolam: hypnotics)

4
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,100
I'm lucky they only wanted to warn me.

5
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,300
Or else, I would be dead already.

6
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,540
What's the matter, Doctor?

7
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,660
Who came into my room last night?

8
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,240
Last night?

9
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,180
No one, Doctor.

(Police station)

11
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,620
Was it really murder, Inspector?

12
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,460
I checked the victim's Facebook history.

13
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,441
They are all strange comments.
(I've made up my mind)

14
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:01,240
(Forcing myself...
to accept the separation)

15
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,060
Sir, please pause right here.

16
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,780
(Physical evidence)

17
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,460
-You're getting discharged today.
-Oh, yes.

18
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,420
But I want to take one more day off.

19
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,660
Sister Fan, you can stop here.

20
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,860
Will you be all right?

21
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,060
If I can't even do this,

22
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,260
I can probably forget
about driving home by myself.

23
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,540
But you called someone
to pick you up, didn't you?

24
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
What are you doing here?

25
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,901
Didn't the nurse tell you?

26
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:57,701
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

27
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,820
Thanks, but I can go home by myself.

28
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,820
I said I could go home by myself.

29
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,620
I'm just seeing you off.

30
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,620
How will you get home then?

31
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,900
I'll probably call a taxi.

32
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,180
You didn't come here by car?

33
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,020
I told you.

34
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,140
I'll be your driver.

35
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,780
Drive carefully.

36
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,580
(Get well soon. -Tan)

37
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,620
Why did you come to pick me up?

38
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,540
Why? Don't you want me to pick you up?

39
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,500
I won't pay you for this.

40
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,620
I just wanted to make sure
that you are safe.

41
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,540
You are so weird.

42
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,700
How am I weird?

43
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,140
I'm just a stranger to you.

44
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,460
Don't we already know each other?

45
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,800
My name is Tan, Wirapong Inkhamvieng.

46
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,940
My name is Bun, Bannakit Songsakdina.

47
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,940
Nice to meet you, Doctor Bun.

48
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,420
How will you get home?

49
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,420
Don't worry about me.

50
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,100
Here is your car key.

51
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,180
Er... Thank you.

52
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,100
(Viangpha Mork Hospital)

53
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,740
Inspector.

54
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,540
I'm here for the autopsy report.

55
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,540
Oh, it's not done yet.

56
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,140
It will take another day or two.

57
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,220
Please hurry up.

58
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,940
This case is about to be closed.

59
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,820
We're only waiting for your report.
Then we can close the case.

60
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,700
What's the conclusion?

61
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,540
Suicide.

62
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,060
But the evidence I showed you before...

63
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,400
According
to the police investigation results...

64
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:01,340
and authoritative evidence,

65
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,100
this case has been declared a suicide.

66
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,660
Are you crazy?

67
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,300
Jane couldn't have committed suicide!

68
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,140
You clearly know her blood
contained psychotropic drugs!

69
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,860
Which is consistent with the fact
that Ms. Jane suffered from depression.

70
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,100
If Jane really wanted to commit suicide,

71
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,700
the drug level in her blood
was fatal enough already.

72
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,340
She didn't need to waste the time
hanging herself!

73
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,220
She was worried
that the medicine wouldn't be enough.

74
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,100
How do you explain the scratches
on the rope then?

75
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,620
There were no scratches on the rope.

76
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,400
The physical evidence department
got it wrong.

77
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,560
(Physical evidence)

78
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,260
I don't think they did, Inspector.

79
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,860
Doctor, the evidence is clear.

80
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,140
Of that, I am sure.

81
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,500
Instead of wasting your time
doubting the police's ability,

82
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,740
why not hurry up and complete the report?

83
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,580
I'll be leaving.

84
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,540
Bye.

85
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,700
Nam, you didn't drive your scooter here?

86
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,620
-No.
-Do you want me to give you a ride?

87
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,020
It's okay, someone's going to pick me up.

88
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,500
Who?

89
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,740
They're here.

90
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,860
I'm off, bye.

91
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,340
Our duty is to submit the report.

92
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,900
It's their responsibility
to close the case as they see fit.

93
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,860
Sir, you know this too, don't you?

94
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,140
After injecting such a large dose
of Diazepam,

95
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,341
one doesn't have the strength
to hang oneself.

96
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,581
Well, what can we do about it?

97
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,780
Are you really going to watch this case
get dismissed like that?

98
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,740
We just do what the police needs us to do.

99
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,940
I hope you'll understand.

100
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,314
This picture is good.
All three look so good.

101
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,900
I don't think you can see them all.

102
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:39,380
Believe me, this one is good.

103
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,860
But I think it's too green.

104
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,500
It'll be purple otherwise.

105
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,028
Bun, help me choose one.

106
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,260
Which photo should I upload?

107
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
The right one.

108
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,180
Did you hear? He said so too.
The photo on the right is better.

109
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,300
Look.

110
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,620
The photo on the left
will get over a hundred likes for sure.

111
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,340
I think I'll trust Doctor Bun on this one.
This one it is.

112
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,060
OK.

Maybe it was someone who believed
that justice is above the police.

123
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,600
I need to go to work.

124
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,640
Didn't I tell you
not to intervene in this matter anymore?

125
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,080
If you know what the police are doing,
you wouldn't say that.

126
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,720
I told you I would handle it myself.

127
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,720
If the police close this case,
you won't even get to handle it.

128
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,680
Just let me do something for Jane.

129
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,520
But if something happens to you again,
I can't take it.

130
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,040
When I say it ends here, it ends here.

131

so they won't make this matter disappear.

I'll leave the rest to you.

133
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,000
OK.

134
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,600
But everything after this,
you will leave it to me, got it?

135
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Thank you.

136
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,350
I'll have four sticky rice cakes
with taro filling.

137
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,574
Sticky rice cakes only, child?

I didn't get enough sleep.

143
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,040
Were you up all night reading?

144
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,440
Me?

145
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,760
Are you going to the hospital again?

146
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,960
Yeah. There are sticky rice cakes
with taro filling today.

147
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,600
I'm buying some for Bun.

How much is it, Ma'am?

149
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:53,120
Forty baht, child.

150
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,160
Wait a second, Auntie.
I'll come back and pay later, OK?

151
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,440
Sure, sure, child. It's okay.

152
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,480
Little girl, I don't have enough change
for 1000 baht.

153
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,760
Take them and pay me later.

154
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,960
I've got no change for you.

155
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
Where did you get so much money?

156
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,440
You are in a hurry, aren't you?

157
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,585
I'll pay you later.

158
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:25,800
OK.

159
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,680
You don't have to buy things
for me so often, Sorawit.

160
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,560
They've got new fillings today, Doctor.

161
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,480
It's taro. It's really delicious.

162

Thank you.

Ms. Jane loved
the taro filling too, you know?

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,840
Oh, Doctor, did you love Ms. Jane?

166
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,320
Ms. Jane and I were friends.

167
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,040
It's not about love.

168
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,280
Ms. Jane was really nice.

169
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,600
Everyone liked her.

170
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:24,200
I guess Ms. Jane's boyfriend
must be crying at home right now.

171
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,880
Jane's boyfriend?

172
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,280
Are you referring to Mr. Tan?

173
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,840
No.

174
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,080
How can Mr. Tan be Ms. Jane's boyfriend?

175
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,800
Ms. Jane's boyfriend is the prosecutor.

176
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,120
He's so handsome, Doctor.

177
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,280
All my female classmates scream
every time they see him.

178
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,760
Do you know who he is?

179
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,120
He's called...

180
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,520
I don't remember, Doctor.

181
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,160
There's something I need to take care of.
I have to go.

182
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,560
Okay, bye.

183
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,320
(Pued)

184
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,120
How is it going, Bun?

185
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,000
Long time no see.

186
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
I'm great, Brother.

187
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,240
Your home is still as beautiful as before.

188
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,800
How is it, moving to Viangpha Mork
and being a medical examiner?

189
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,600
Have you gotten used
to the peaceful life here?

190
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,360
It's pretty quiet here.

191
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,061
But it's not peaceful.
I've got some trouble too.

192
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:54,981
I just arrived and I'm already dealing
with several cases.

193
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,640
Are you here for anything specific?

194
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,840
I can't reach your brother.

195
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Pued must be with some girl again.

196
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,320
I need to contact him, it's important.

197
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,000
Go ask Tan.

198
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,440
I saw them leave together.

199
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,360
Tan?

200
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,240
Do you mean Tan, the teacher?

201
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,520
Yes, that's him.

202
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,120
Rung, do you know about Jane
and Pued's relationship?

203
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,360
I do.

204
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,120
Pued often stayed here overnight.

205
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,480
What's wrong?

206
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,120
Did you find more clues about Jane's case?

207
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,760
It's not a clue, Rung.

208
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,680
I'm just surprised.

209
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,320
Why didn't Pued tell me?

210
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,760
Maybe it's because they broke up.

211
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,960
Could you tell me more about this?

212
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,120
Well...

213
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,080
They loved each other very much.

214
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,680
They were so sweet. I envied them.

215
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,440
They dated for a few months.

216
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,960
I thought that Pued would become
my brother-in-law for sure.

217
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,480
They had quarrels too.

218
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,254
But I don't know what they were about.

219
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:43,080
And then they broke up.
Jane was really sad.

220
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,240
She cried every day
and didn't want to leave her room,

221
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,880
until we took her to the doctor
for her depression.

222
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,160
They suddenly broke up?

223
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,360
Tan! Stop! Tan!

224
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,280
Tan!

225
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,800
Why don't you ask Pued yourself?

226
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,757
Well, I called him but he didn't pick up.

227
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,080
Maybe he was just busy with work.

228
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,720
(Inspector M)

229
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,800
What is it, Inspector?

230
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,734
Do you know what happened
to Prosecutor Pued?

231
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,680
Pued?

232
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,320
Based on preliminary inspection,

233
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,522
we didn't find any blood
or fingerprints of other people.

234
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,160
Do you know if Prosecutor Songsak
has a grudge with anyone...

235
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,960
or maybe if he was handling
a very risky case?

236
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,600
No, Inspector.

237
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,480
Prosecutor Songsak is honest
and has integrity.

238
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,000
He has never had any personal vendettas.

239
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
As for the cases he handles,

240
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,160
Prosecutor Songsak
doesn't have any currently.

241
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,400
I think he has been busy dealing
with the murder of Ms. Jane.

242
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,254
Ms. Jane's case?

243
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,440
(Pued)

244
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,120
Pued.

245
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,400
Where are you?

246
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,021
Prosecutor Pued is with me of course.

247
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:11,280
You...

248
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,600
Who are you?

249
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,520
You can't figure it out, can you?

250
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,920
I've warned you, right?

251
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,360
Don't interfere in this matter.

252
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,520
It's you!

253
00:22:20,562 --> 00:22:22,121
You should've realized by now...

254
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:25,561
what the consequences will be
if you don't do as I say.

255
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,760
You...

256
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,560
Where did you take my friend?

257
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,800
Wait a second.

258
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,240
W-What's going on?

259
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,080
Stop pretending
that you don't know anything!

260
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,940
I know you took Pued!

261
00:22:57,614 --> 00:22:58,840
Where did you take him?

262
00:22:59,968 --> 00:23:01,840
I said, calm down.

263
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,120
Last time, it was Janejira!

264
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,025
And now Pued?

265
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,640
If anything happens to my friend,
I will never let you get away with it!

266
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,711
But I didn't do anything.

267
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,160
Then how
do you explain Pued's disappearance?

268
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,160
You are the last one who was with him.

269
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,000
The same as what happened to Janejira!

270
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,237
I did talk to Pued about Jane.

271
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,240
I don't want to hear any more
of your lies.

272
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:28,780
I'm not lying.

273
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,280
Remember what I'm telling you.

274
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
No matter where you took Pued,

275
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,280
I will find him.

276
00:23:42,277 --> 00:23:43,117
Hey!

277
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,640
Hey!

278
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,800
(Get well soon.)

279
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,160
Seems like I can't let you live!

280
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,360
Are you injured?

281
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,120
Hey!

282
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,520
Let me see.

283
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,240
If it hurts, just scream.

284
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,360
Such a small injury doesn't hurt.

285
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,200
Hold it.

286
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,680
First, stop the bleeding.

287
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,080
Prevent swelling.

288
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,168
Relax the muscles on your cheek.

289
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,960
Open your mouth.

290
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,880
Ah.

291
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,760
Ah.

292
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,360
OK.

293
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,920
Your teeth look fine,
nothing missing or broken.

294
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,120
The wound may be caused by a bite
during the fight.

295
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,848
Your hands smell good.

296
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,477
Don't you think you should thank me?

297
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,800
If you ask me,
I think you should thank me instead.

298
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,280
Thank you.

299
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,911
Now you should believe me.

300
00:26:58,391 --> 00:26:59,700
I'm not a bad guy.

301
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,105
It's too early to know yet.

302
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,357
Isn't it too much of a coincidence...

303
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,120
that you appeared so timely?

304
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,520
Maybe you hired that person.

305
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,520
It's because I followed you here.

306
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,985
Why did you follow me?

307
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,260
Hey! Hey!

308
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,960
You forgot this.

309
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,220
I didn't.

310
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,242
I wanted to give it back to you.

311
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,560
I won't take it back.

312
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,640
Your wounds have been treated
and I've tried returning this.

313
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,800
It's time for you to go home.

314
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,962
Aren't you afraid that he might come back?

315
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,560
I'll sleep here tonight.

316
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,440
OK.

317
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,080
Thank you.

318
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
How was it? Did you sleep well?

319
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,600
Quite well.

320
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,240
How about you?

321
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,240
Er...

322
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,360
I slept well.

323
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,760
I'll see you off.

324
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,360
It's fine.

325
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,400
Are you looking for this?

326
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,120
Let me see you off.

327
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,400
OK?

328
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,160
Go and take a shower.

329
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,960
Didn't you sleep last night?

330
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,421
Right.

331
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,821
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

332
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,120
Let me prescribe you some sleeping pills.

333
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,320
It's fine. It's just these few days.

334
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
OK.

335
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,360
By the way,
what about the autopsy report?

336
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,920
What should I do?

337
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,560
Inspector M keeps calling to rush me.

338
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,520
Let him call you.

339
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,760
Don't send it to him yet.

340
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,320
-Do you really want to do it that way?
-Yeah.

341
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,680
I mean, if we send it to him,
he'll close the case and dismiss it.

342
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,000
We'd better not send it to him.

343
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,560
OK. If anyone asks,
I'll just tell him what you said.

344
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,680
-OK? Sure?
-Yeah.

345
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,880
OK, see you.

346
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,440
Nam.

347
00:31:04,802 --> 00:31:06,360
Why are you sitting here by yourself?

348
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,400
I'm waiting for someone to pick me up.

349
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,760
Anything wrong?

350
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,000
You look like you haven't slept for days.

351
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,840
It's nothing.

352
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,760
Just go.

353
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,360
I want to stay by myself.

354
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,680
Don't do that.

355
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,094
If you stay by yourself...
What if something happens?

356
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,160
What's wrong with your arm, Nam?

357
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,031
It's nothing.

358
00:31:50,105 --> 00:31:53,065
Melatonin, a new brand.

359
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,128
It may be useful.

360
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,040
But I've got something for you.

361
00:31:57,202 --> 00:31:59,760
I bought this for you. Only this way
will you be able to sleep well.

362
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,720
Oat, you...

363
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,608
-Thank you.
-Sure.

364
00:32:04,688 --> 00:32:05,640
How are you getting home?

365
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,200
Let me give you a ride.

366
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,520
Oh, well...

367
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,520
Mr. Tan.

368
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,120
See you.

369
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,920
Do you feel better?

370
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,720
Much better.

371
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,520
-Do you want me to carry them for you?
-It's OK.

372
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,120
Since when have they gotten so close?

373
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,160
I told you not to pick me up.

374
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,680
Doctor.

375
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,440
Aren't you afraid that the gangster
will come back and hurt you again?

376
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,040
He wouldn't shoot me in the hospital.

377
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,880
I was the one who took you here.

378
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,600
So let me pick you up too.

379
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
What happened?

380
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,560
I don't know. I heard something!

381
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,080
It's a cat.

382
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,040
I heard it last night too. Calm down.

383
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,760
What if it isn't a cat?

384
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,600
Shall we go and take a look?

385
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,880
It's nothing.

386
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,240
Trust me.

387
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,360
You couldn't sleep last night, right?

388
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,720
Who would sleep like this?

389
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,760
I think...

390
00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:33,271
if it's this serious,

391
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:34,760
would you like to sleep somewhere else?

392
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,440
Where do you want me to sleep?

393
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,120
At your house?

394
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,800
Keep dreaming!

395
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,840
But are you willing to continue
to suffer from insomnia?

396
00:34:58,105 --> 00:34:59,760
If you come to my house,

397
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,760
the bad guys can't find you.

398
00:35:03,282 --> 00:35:04,520
You wouldn't need to worry then.

399
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,520
Come on.

400
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,680
Yeah.

401
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,720
No!

402
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,920
Let's go.

403
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,760
Please make yourself at home.

404
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,040
It's here.

405
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,440
This is the food
for welcoming your guests?

406
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,720
That's the only thing I know how to make.

407
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,880
Want to have a try?

408
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,520
OK. I'm not eating this.

409
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,120
Why?

410
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,480
I'll just order a pizza later.

411
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,120
It's OK. I'll make something myself.

412
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,080
The kitchen is here, right?

413
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,600
Yes.

414
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,720
I'm very sorry.

415
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,960
Never mind.

416
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,040
What are you waiting for? Try it.

417
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,000
OK.

418
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,280
What do you think?

419
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,640
It's alright.

420
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,000
If it's just alright,
you can go back to your instant noodles.

421
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,680
It's delicious.

422
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,760
I'm starting to think I've made
the right choice of inviting you.

423
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,240
Why?

424
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,920
Do you want me to cook every meal for you?

425
00:38:45,385 --> 00:38:46,520
Do you want me to cook?

426
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,400
No, thanks, I'll do it myself.

427
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,240
Alright.

428
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,840
See it as the rent.

429
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,400
Is it too late to go back now?

430
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,320
This way.

431
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,320
Make yourself at home.

432
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,160
Is this your guest room?

433
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,640
No.

434
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,840
This is my room.

435
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,640
Why did you take me here?

436
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,960
Well,
all the other rooms aren't furnished yet.

437
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,280
This is the only room left.

438
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,920
Sleep in this room for now.

439
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,960
W-What about you?

440
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,480
I can sleep on the sofa downstairs.
It's OK.

441
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,120
I...

442
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,800
Still scared?

443
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,960
I'll bring a quilt and sleep here.

444
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,920
We can both sleep on the bed.

445
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,680
What?

446
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,560
We can both sleep on the bed.

447
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,400
=Manner of Death=

448
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,680
How can you let your people
close the case like that?

449
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,480
What are you talking about?

450
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,960
I will post this on the website.
(Janejira did not commit suicide)

451
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,640
I'll say I want to interview
the creator of this website.

452
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,280
She's just someone who hung herself!

453
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,160
Close it immediately, Inspector!

454
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,080
Do you know what we, the police, can do?

455
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,400
Where did you and Pued go that day?

456
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,568
I'm not so sure anymore.

457
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:45,720
Are you concerned about Janejira's matter?
