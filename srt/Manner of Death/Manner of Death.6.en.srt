(Special Examination Room 1)
(Special Examination Room 2)

(Examination Room 3)
(Parking Lot, Payment/Collection)

3
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:36,641
You are Janejira, right?

4
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:38,267
Please wait here for a moment.

5
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,800
=Manner of Death=

6
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,350
I think it's broken.

7
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:30,975
-Tan.
-Huh?

8
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,350
Do you think Pued will end up like Pat?

9
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,550
Is it my fault that these things happen
to the people around me?

10
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,675
Don't think that way.

11
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:49,720
Maybe Pat's death
has nothing to do with this.

12
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:52,025
Calm down first.

13
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:56,725
What is in this thing?

14
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,275
If Pat was the only one
who knew what's in it,

15
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:10,325
why don't we go to Pat's house
and check it out?

16
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:46,385
Wait.

17
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,075
We'll be discovered.

18
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,775
What's that sound?

19
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,846
Be careful.

20
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:49,733
It's here!

21
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:51,875
-Come on. Let's go!
-Go!

22
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:56,683
Are you okay?

23
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:02,852
Walk slowly.

24
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:07,568
Walk slowly.

25
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:10,758
-Can you make it?
-I can.

26
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:21,843
What are you doing here?

27
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:24,968
That's what I'm supposed to ask.
What are you doing here?

28
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,043
I think I know
what you guys are doing here.

29
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,138
Stealing things from others...

30
00:06:44,218 --> 00:06:46,443
seems to be less the job of a policeman
than that of a robber, Inspector.

31
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,241
Then what does breaking into the house
of the deceased...

32
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:53,018
and taking away his laptop look like?

33
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:58,968
Hindering police investigation...

34
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,183
is illegal.

35
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,440
Thank you for your cooperation.

36
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:11,083
Go ahead.

37
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:39,258
I'll be gentle.

38
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:51,243
Bun, I think this is too dangerous.

39
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:53,893
We should stop here, okay?

40
00:07:55,668 --> 00:07:56,993
How can we stop here?

41
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:58,943
Didn't you see it as well?

42
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:01,293
Those policemen are bastards!

43
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,943
Since it's so dangerous,

44
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:11,138
from now on,

45
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:12,593
you should let me do it on my own.

46
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:16,018
Are you crazy?

47
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:17,918
That's impossible.

48
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:19,843
I choose to risk myself.

49
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,043
I don't want anyone else to be in danger.

50
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:27,243
Trust me.

51
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:30,268
From now on,
you don't have to protect me anymore.

52
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:36,120
Doctor Bun, listen to me carefully.

53
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,043
Whether you want it or not,

54
00:08:43,118 --> 00:08:45,518
I won't let you face these things
by yourself.

55
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:49,618
I told you, right?

56
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:51,843
I will protect you.

57
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,793
No matter how dangerous it is,

58
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,218
I will protect you.

59
00:09:14,493 --> 00:09:15,443
Ae!

60
00:09:16,993 --> 00:09:18,218
Tan!

61
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:20,613
Why didn't you call me beforehand?

62
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,280
What if I was watching porn?

63
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:25,368
I need your help with something.

64
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:31,113
Oh, is the SD card broken?

65
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:32,961
You deleted its content accidentally?
A virus?

66
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,240
What happened to it?

67
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:36,718
It seems that the card is broken.

68
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:40,843
Oh, it's indeed broken.

69
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:43,018
Can it be fixed?

70
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,043
Repairing cards is not my specialty.

71
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:50,968
But the data within might be recovered.

72
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,093
Please help.

73
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:57,413
I may not be able to recover all the data.

74
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:59,513
It's fine. Just do your best.

75
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:01,993
I need a day or two.
I'll call you when it's done.

76
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:03,918
-Thank you so much.
-No problem.

77
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:07,168
Let's go.

78
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:24,438
Doctor Bun, I found a new store.

79
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:27,443
It's so delicious! Try it.

80
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,838
Sister Fan, I think I'll pass.
I'm not that hungry.

81
00:10:31,243 --> 00:10:33,968
Sweets can alleviate your anxiety.

82
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:37,738
Trust me. I am the strongest evidence.

83
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:41,468
Sister, wait a minute.
Is my anxiety so obvious?

84
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,593
It's clearer than my 4K TV.

85
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,443
It's delicious.

86
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:54,238
I will give you a whole bag, then.

87
00:10:54,318 --> 00:10:57,238
I haven't finished
what you bought me last time yet.

88
00:10:57,318 --> 00:10:59,663
If you often buy me things,
I'll feel embarrassed.

89
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,463
I can see that you're constantly stressed,

90
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:03,600
so I of course have
to buy you food more often.

91
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:06,543
-Thank you.
-Finish it.

92
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:10,238
Doctor, Room 103's patient has woken up.

93
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:12,368
Room 103... Is that Nam?

94
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:14,526
Let's go.

95
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:31,268
My name is Doctor Bun.

96
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:34,393
I'm your attending physician.

97
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,268
You should know...

98
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:44,443
why you are here, right?

99
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:48,818
I know.

100
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:52,068
Then could you tell me...

101
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,388
where you got those drugs from?

102
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,993
From my friends.

103
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:04,138
What about these bite marks and bruises?

104
00:12:07,218 --> 00:12:09,668
My boyfriend likes to use violence.

105
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:17,513
These bite marks and bruises
are very similar to the cases I had.

106
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:20,368
Including the cases of Natty and Ms. Jane.

107
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:28,918
The things you know
are very important to me.

108
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,040
Well...

109
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,988
I...

110
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:49,938
You may tell me next time.

111
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:51,218
I will come to see you again.

112
00:12:51,793 --> 00:12:52,633
Okay.

113
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:08,643
I'm here to follow up on this case.

114
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:12,618
Can you tell me where you got the drugs?

115
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,963
Well, from a friend.

116
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:17,168
Who is this friend?

117
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:23,643
It's a friend of a friend I met
in a motorcycle racing gang.

118
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:27,318
Impossible.

119
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:30,963
At most, those people could only
be exposed to cannabis or hallucinogens.

120
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,843
They couldn't have something
like methamphetamine.

121
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:53,863
Sister Fan, where did the patient
in this ward go?

122
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:55,363
Do you mean Nam?

123
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,038
She just got discharged, Doctor.

124
00:13:58,118 --> 00:13:59,988
What? Are you serious?

125
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:03,993
Yes.
It happened not long before you came in.

126
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,263
-How are you? Feeling a lot better?
-Yes.

127
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:23,393
Nam!

128
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:26,268
Nam! Nam!

129
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,368
Nam!

130
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,240
(Songchai, congressman)

131
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:06,168
I think we need to begin with things
that happened before Jane died.

132
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,393
(Jane's death)

133
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:31,640
(Jane breaks up with Pued)

134
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:33,413
(Treatment for Jane's sepsis
and depression)

135
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:36,393
Jane had broken up with Pued three months
before she died.

136
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:38,578
Two months later,

137
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:40,918
Jane underwent treatment
for sepsis and depression.

138
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,993
(Pat's death)

139
00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:59,118
(SD card)

140
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:02,988
You seem to understand everything.

141
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,743
Now the only clue left is the SD card.

142
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:13,493
Why did Pat swallow it?

143
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:16,693
Perhaps because it contains...

144
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:20,918
an important evidence
that he didn't want to be discovered.

145
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:33,238
(Swallowed intentionally?)

146
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:37,343
Or Pat specifically wanted to send me
this evidence.

147
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,218
Because the day before his death,

148
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,138
he made many calls to me.

149
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:47,313
But I still can't figure out
what important information...

150
00:16:47,393 --> 00:16:49,063
he wanted me to know.

151
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:50,318
Unless it's about Jane.

152
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:55,593
If it's really related to Jane's case,

153
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,693
I think this is very dangerous.

154
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,738
(Forces behind the scenes)

155
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,943
I think this case
must be related to someone powerful.

156
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:15,493
Otherwise, the police wouldn't be
in such a hurry to close the case.

157
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:31,038
(Forces behind the scenes)

158
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:56,193
Hey, you.

159
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,368
Why are you out here alone?
Enjoying the cold wind?

160
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:05,138
It's cool and refreshing.

161
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,993
Bangkok rarely has this kind of weather.

162
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:12,743
Is that why you came here?

163
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:19,518
Actually, I came here
to look for happiness.

164
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:22,821
But having gone through many things,

165
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,501
I don't know why I'm feeling so tired.

166
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:29,168
Do you want to go back?

167
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:32,168
I don't want to go back.

168
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:34,968
I would rather suffer here.

169
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:37,393
Why?

170
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,218
Because at least in this place,
I don't have to compete with anyone.

171
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:50,143
You know?

172
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:55,068
You told me that your family
was cold-blooded.

173
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:57,718
My family...

174
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,168
is very warm.

175
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:02,593
So warm that it becomes scorching.

176
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:05,280
My brother and I have been competing
with each other...

177
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:06,723
ever since I could remember.

178
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:09,318
It's like growing up at a racecourse.

179
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:15,118
I'm not surprised that you've developed
such a determined personality.

180
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:19,838
My life in Bangkok...

181
00:19:19,918 --> 00:19:22,643
is like a time loop, a race.

182
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:24,813
I go home to sleep,

183
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:26,246
then I wake up.

184
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:27,640
And it repeats itself over and over.

185
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,268
My home is long gone.

186
00:19:34,868 --> 00:19:37,893
You said you had come here
to look for happiness.

187
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:39,893
Did you find it?

188
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:45,318
Not yet.

189
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:49,168
If your happiness...

190
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:51,743
was visible,

191
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,143
what kind of scenes would it be?

192
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:56,443
My happiness...

193
00:19:57,293 --> 00:20:00,743
should be in some sort of a green scene.

194
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:03,993
For example,
being in the middle of green plants...

195
00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:06,068
makes me feel peaceful.

196
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,021
It's probably something like that.
The kind of happiness I'm looking for.

197
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:13,776
Is it not green enough here?

198
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:15,868
I think it's too green.

199
00:20:16,468 --> 00:20:19,238
You are really hard to please, you know?

200
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,193
The green here
is like the green of the jungle.

201
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:25,738
You need flowers to brighten up the green.

202
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:27,118
Don't you think so?

203
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:30,543
How about you?

204
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:34,043
What's the kind of happiness
you're seeking look like?

205
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:38,243
-My happiness?
-Yeah.

206
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:43,643
It should be a bit mischievous,

207
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:46,318
and very stubborn,

208
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:50,043
always likes to go into danger,

209
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,568
but has a sense of justice.

210
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:55,693
That's probably
what my happiness looks like.

211
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:00,338
What are you talking about?

212
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:12,193
Smile.

213
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:16,293
You're so pretty. Why do you look so sad?

214
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,643
Smile.

215
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:25,143
Are you not happy here?

216
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:33,043
Did you tell the doctor
and the police anything?

217
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:37,868
I didn't say anything.

218
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,988
I won't cause you any trouble.

219
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:42,395
Very good.

220
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,418
It seems to be the time
to give you a reward.

221
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:46,288
What would you like?

222
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:49,593
I want to go home.

223
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:57,518
Do you want to go?

224
00:21:58,343 --> 00:21:59,183
Yes.

225
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:05,743
But I'm afraid I can't let you go yet.

226
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:09,263
Because if I let you go
and you encounter the police,

227
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:11,518
they might ask you more questions,

228
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:13,893
and you will be in a difficult position.

229
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:17,621
How long do I have to stay here?

230
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:20,001
Until I agree to let you go home.

I think so, Inspector.

238
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:04,118

How are you?
You seem to be in high spirits.

242

I haven't seen you carry sticky rice
for a long time.

No new fillings recently, right?

244
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:21,163
It's been the same recently, Doctor.

245
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:22,898
She doesn't make new fillings anymore.

246
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:25,638
By the way, I brought you this.

247
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:27,206
-Is this for me?
-Yeah.

248

Nam?

252
00:23:35,943 --> 00:23:38,888
Nam has been discharged from the hospital.
Didn't she call you?

253
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:42,268
No. I called her but she didn't answer.

254
00:23:42,692 --> 00:23:44,938
Nam woke up already?

255

Why was she discharged so early, Doctor?

256

Can you give me her number
and address, Sorawit?

Sure, Doctor.

She isn't there.

277
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:24,468
But the doctor said that Nam
has been discharged from the hospital.

278
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:27,713
Maybe she went out.

279

That's impossible.
Her motorcycle is still here.

280

Later, they found out that Jane
was pregnant.

00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:22,720
In August, Jane had sepsis.

336
00:32:26,418 --> 00:32:28,018
It might have been caused by abortion.

337
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:35,643
Finally, Jane got depression.

338
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:37,893
She became Doctor Fai's patient.

339
00:32:44,818 --> 00:32:45,658
Tan!

340
00:32:51,143 --> 00:32:52,143
What is going on, Brother?

341
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:57,693
I'm not waiting anymore!

342
00:32:59,968 --> 00:33:01,618
Explain it to me right now.

343
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,638
If you don't explain it right now,

344
00:33:07,138 --> 00:33:08,818
I'll come to you
and get the answer myself.

345
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:13,418
You know what I mean, don't you?

346
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,720
I'm hanging up.

347
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:24,318
Can't sleep?

348
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:26,788
I suddenly woke up.

349
00:33:28,318 --> 00:33:29,568
Who were you chatting with?

350
00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:31,968
A client.

351
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:35,888
Some urgent business in the workplace.
It's nothing.

352
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:38,660
Why are you so angry?

353
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:42,443
He deceived me.

354
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:49,293
It's late, let's sleep.

355
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:27,818
There you go.

356
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:30,068
I couldn't recover everything.

357
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,588
Did you take a look at what's in it?

358
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:36,118
I didn't have time to check.

359
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:37,763
See for yourself.

360
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:39,058
I could only recover a few files.

361
00:34:39,138 --> 00:34:40,588
My work is piling up.

362
00:34:41,193 --> 00:34:43,793
If you still can't open the files,
then come back.

363
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:51,821
Okay, I'll let you get back to work.

364
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:52,901
I'm happy to help anytime.

365
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,360
I'm starting to hesitate to know
what's in it.

366
00:35:14,193 --> 00:35:15,143
Let's open it.

367
00:35:17,893 --> 00:35:19,043
In the end, we...

368
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,793
still need to accept the truth, right?

369
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,688
Look at Prosecutor Pued.

370
00:36:10,143 --> 00:36:11,018
He needed money.

371
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,988
He needed power.

372
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:15,268
That's why he gave his woman
to the big shot.
