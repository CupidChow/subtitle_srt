(The five manners of death are natural, accident,
suicide, homicide, and undetermined)

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,290
(They are the cornerstone
of any death investigation.)

3
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,380
(Determination of manner of death
relies on a lot of information,)

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,200
(such as the crime scene
and the body itself.)

5

(The most important thing
is to listen to what the body tells you)

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,160
Doctor, this way.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,880
Who is the victim?

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,760
The victim is 31 years old.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,840
A middle school teacher.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,760
This isn't a suicide case.

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,400
=Manner of Death=

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,760
(5 days ago)

13
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,000
This is just an ordinary town.

14
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,520
Nothing special.

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,840
My name is Bahnjit.

16
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm a forensic expert
who has just been transferred here.

17
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,880
(Viangpha Mork)

18
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,800
Yet, it's this ordinariness...
(Viangpha Mork)

19
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,400
that makes me fall in love with it.

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,040
In the 15 years
when I was away from this place,

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,000
I've missed it every day.

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,240
The smiling town, Viangpha Mork.

23
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,120
(Wholesale market)
(Election campaign)

24
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,580
Here.

25
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,800
OK, I'm ready.

26
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,720
Scalpel.

27
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,200
Oat.

28
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,120
Hey, Oat!

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,040
I'm here.

30
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,000
Stop daydreaming.

31
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,320
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,600
-What do I need to do next?
-Look.

33
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,120
This is Oat.

34
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,000
He is my intern.

35
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,680
What are the victim's symptoms?

36
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,640
There was a lot of blood lost
from the victim's uterus.

37
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,160
No injuries are found in other organs.

38
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,120
Discoloration of the skin is due to hypostasis.
(Hypostasis: postmortem sedimentation of blood)

39
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,320
Cause of death,
excessive blood loss in the uterus.

40
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,160
We need to examine the uterus.

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,440
But the strange thing is that there
are multiple bruises all over her body.

42
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,680
Arms, body,

43
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,520
and legs.

44
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,560
And there's another strange thing.

45
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,720
Bite marks.

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,880
(Bite mark)

47
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,640
A lot of them.

48
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
What else?

49
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,360
That's it.

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,240
And what's this?

51
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,440
Multiple needlestick injuries
and bruises on the arm.

52
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,120
These types of symptoms
are mostly seen in sexual abuse.

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,760
Check the urine for addictive substances.

54
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,680
Send a blood sample to the lab
for examination.

55
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,360
-OK.
-Here, take the tray.

56
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,040
Please clean it up.

57
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,000
Pour it there.

58
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,600
Yes, what is it?

59
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,480
An emergency? Let's go, Ghing.

60
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,240
We'll be right there.

61
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,200
-Hello Dr. Bun.
-Hello, why are you in a hurry?

62
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,280
-There is an emergency, Doctor.
-Hello.

63
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,960
There is food.

64
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,920
Yeah, Sister Fan always forgets
her snacks.

65
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,640
Do you want some water?

66
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,760
Let's have a drink.

67
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,680
Bro.

68
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,840
I'm curious.

69
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,640
Thank you.

70
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,640
Why are there pinholes and bite marks?

71
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,560
Bite marks and bruises.

72
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,280
She most likely suffered
from sexual abuse.

73
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,760
The pinholes, however,
point toward drug use.

74
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,960
Once we have the lab results
and the medical evidence, we'll find out.

75
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,680
Are you Dr. Bahnjit?

76
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,800
Yes.

77
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,021
My name is Pat.

78
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:01,541
I'm a reporter of the news website
"Stories of the Viangpha Mork People".

79
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,440
I heard that you are a new doctor here.

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,640
Is it okay if I interview you
for five minutes?

81
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
OK.

82
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,520
About the case of Natty
who died at the market...

83
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,240
What did you find in the autopsy?

84
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,880
That's confidential. I can't tell you.

85
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,141
Oh, please, Doctor.
Just give me something.

86
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:27,341
You will tell the police anyway, right?

87
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
But you are not a policeman.

88
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,440
Please, Doctor.

89
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,320
I will pay you.

90
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,240
This is confidential.

91
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,640
I can't tell you.

92
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,640
Do you understand?

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,680
Well...

94
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,680
If you change your mind, contact me.

95
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,560
(Pat Kittimaklunon)
(Stories of the Viangpha Mork People)

96
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,960
Do you like to come here too, Doctor?

97
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,421
Oh, Inspector M, Captain Gun.

98
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,621
-Hello.
-Hello.

99
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,600
Please sit down.

100
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,800
-Let's have a chat.
-Thank you.

101
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,680
You must be very busy lately.

102
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,000
I heard you found injection marks
from drug use in your recent case?

103
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,600
I did.

104
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,720
I'm waiting
for the medical examination results.

105
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,681
If any addictive substance is found,

106
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:48,041
you will have to take over this case.

107
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,800
I'll be so busy then.

108
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,520
Do you come here often, Doctor?

109
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,441
I come here almost every day
since I moved here.

110
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:57,000
I like quiet places.

111
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,160
It is indeed quieter than elsewhere.

112
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,920
Actually, it used to be even quieter.

113
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,741
Used to?

114
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:06,701
I went to middle school
and high school here.

115
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,640
In this case, you are a Viangpha Morker.

116
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,320
But a lot has changed.

117
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,360
It's bustling now,
not as boring as before.

118
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,320
Did you take a look around Viangpha Mork
after you came back?

119
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,680
I went to a few markets.

120
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,600
Markets don't count.

121
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,960
You need to go to more exciting places.

122
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,920
Do you think the autopsy room
isn't exciting enough, Sir?

123
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,120
That means you haven't seen
any real excitement yet.

124
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,280
Let's go, Doctor.

125
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:36,120
Let me take you to some places
with real excitement.

126
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,061
All right.

127
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:41,941
But I have an appointment already.

128
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,200
So we'll meet tomorrow?

129
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,440
OK.

130
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,760
Jane!

131
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,240
Bun!

132
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,120
Come quickly!

133
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,800
-Jane!
-Oh, I missed you so much!

134
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,840
Long time no see.
You look more and more beautiful.

135
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,200
Of course.

136
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,640
This restaurant is a lot bigger.

137
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,040
It was just a small cafe before.

138
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,040
You bet. It's been so many years, Bun.

139
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,920
Everything has changed.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,920
It's so great that we can eat here.

141
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,080
By the way, what happened to Natty?

142
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,840
Natty.

143
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
We finished the autopsy.

144
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,680
We haven't found any abnormalities yet.

145
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,960
I really suck, don't I?

146
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,560
She was my student.

147
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:45,640
Yet, I can't help even for a bit.

148
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,280
Jane, you really haven't changed at all.

149
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,320
What do you mean?

150
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,901
You always take all the responsibility
on your shoulders.

151
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:56,181
What's more, sometimes,
you do nothing wrong.

152
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,960
I'm giving this back to you.
(Little Mermaid)

153
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,280
Jane.

154
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,680
This is...

155
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,200
It's been 15 years, right?

156
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,520
-Fifteen years.
-Jane.

157
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,160
Like you said, I'm a responsible person.

158
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,141
Oh, I can't believe
you are giving it back.

159
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:26,480
But isn't the ending too tragic?

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,520
I did warn you.

161
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:32,520
This isn't Disney's mermaid story.

162
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,080
Oh, can't there be a better ending?

163
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,720
If I remember correctly,
the mermaid died in the end, right?

164
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,421
Yes, she died.

165
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,101
She died for love.

166
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,680
Oh, that's sad.

167
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,520
Oat, believe me.

168
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,581
If you have never tried it,
you wouldn't understand.

169
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:59,381
-It's the right size.
-What are you doing?

170
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,840
-What's wrong?
-Doctor, help me.

171
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,720
They want me to try on the dress
for the Director's birthday party.

172
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,560
-It's super cute.
-It's okay, actually.

173
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,200
Right?
So will you perform at the birthday party?

174
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,640
Fai, Fai, no, no.

175
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:15,240
But I will be your cheerleader, OK?

176
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,160
-OK. Five, six, seven, eight...
-Sister Fan, wait.

177
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,560
-You're doing it now, really?
-Go! Come on.

178
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,120
-Have a rehearsal.
-Come on, Oat.

179
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,720
Right, right, left, right, right.

180
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,880
Do the move first.

181
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
-Not yet.
-Oat.

182
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,200
What are you doing?

183
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,920
I'm...loosening up my body.

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
My neck is a bit sore.

185
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,720
-Doctor Bun!
-Yes?

186
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,120
Come to my office later.
I need to talk to you.

187
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,920
Mr. Pat, the founder of that website,

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,480
came to talk to you yesterday, right?

189
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,400
Yes.

190
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,800
(New doctor in town refused the interview
about Natty's death at the market)

191
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,880
(Is he hiding anything about the case?)

192
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,280
How can he put it this way?

193
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
This guy exaggerates things he reports on.

194
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,880
But the citizens here believe him,
do you understand?

195
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,850
Be careful next time
when you deal with him.

196
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,120
I will, Director.

197
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,920
Jump into the water.

198
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,320
Your graceful posture
will never disappear.

199
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,240
You float towards the clouds
and turn into a young fairy.

200
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,360
You shed your mortal life,
into the sky you fly.

201
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,800
There will be an exam next week.

202
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,141
Don't be grumpy about it.
You'll take the exam no matter what.

203
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:55,061
Lesson's over.

204
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,040
Thank you, Ms. Jane.

205
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,120
Don't forget your homework.

206
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,240
I'm here to take some pictures
of Natty's desk.

207
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
What news are you going to write
with these now?

208
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,080
It's just Natty's case.

209
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,760
There aren't any secrets, are there?

210
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,840
As the class teacher,
I do not allow any pictures to be taken.

211
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,720
It's okay. I have already taken some.

212
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,880
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,120
What do you think?

214
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:55,061
This is great enough already,
right, Doctor?

215
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,261
I was just about to call you.

216
00:14:57,341 --> 00:14:58,901
It's pretty awesome.

217
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,201
Looks like it's going
to be late tonight, isn't it?

218
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:04,581
Oh, Doctor. Just a little while.
This isn't my style.

219
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:06,221
Wait 'till I show you the real deal.

220
00:15:06,301 --> 00:15:08,341
Let's put it this way.
We'll definitely have fun tonight.

221
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,901
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

222
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,200
-Hello, hello. This way, please.
-Hello.

223
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,981
How are you today?

224
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:17,581
Same as usual.

225
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,040
This table.

226
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
OK.

227
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,800
What would you like today?

228
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,120
Two whiskeys on the rocks, please.

229
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,360
Right away.

230
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,200
Order anything you want.

231
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,600
I'm more familiar with this place,
so it's my treat.

232
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
You are just looking
for a drinking partner, aren't you?

233
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,261
-What drinking partner?
-Excuse me.

234
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:36,521
I have more than enough friends.

235
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,481
I just want to help you see more
of the world.

236
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,240
Fine.

237
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,800
Your whiskeys.

238
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,360
Wow. That's enough. That's enough.

239
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,360
-Excuse me.
-Will you be OK tomorrow?

240
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,480
Tomorrow is yet to come.

241
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,480
Let's have fun today.

242
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,120
Since you've taken this so well,
let's get you something strong.

243
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,320
Bas, give me a Viangpha Mork.

244
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,200
Bas!

245
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,400
Viangpha Mork?

246
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,120
What's that?

247
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,621
-Right away.
-Make it quick next time.

248
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:12,301
Oh, Inspector, how many people
are going to drink these?

249
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:13,781
Come on.

250
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,160
What is this?

251
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,160
White wine?

252
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,000
Stop talking, go on.

253
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,480
Hey, Inspector, what a surprise!

254
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,080
-Nut.
-Do you want to come over to my table?

255
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:31,360
Gai is here too.

256
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,501
-Gai is here too?
-Yes.

257
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:35,161
OK, I'll be there in a second.

258
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:37,501
I'll talk to a friend for a second.

259
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,061
Wait here for me, don't go away.

260
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:42,661
-I won't. I have no money.
-I'll be right back.

261
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,080
Doctor.

262
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,720
Doctor.

263
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,120
(You got really drunk.)

264
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,721
(Don't forget to drink the extremely
delicious porridge I made for you)

265
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,261
You got really drunk.

266
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:07,941
Don't forget to drink the extremely
delicious porridge I made for you.

267
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,400
What's wrong? You got hammered last night.

268
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,760
I thought I couldn't get up this morning.

269
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,040
Inspector M told me...

270
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,440
you drank the Viangpha Mork cocktail.

271
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,960
That's not a cocktail.
It was pure alcohol!

272
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,680
When did you meet M?

273
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,000
Look.

274
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,000
Look what I filmed.

275
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,920
Go, go, go. Go home.

276
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,920
Is this...?

277
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,320
Bangkok? I don't want to go back.

278
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,560
Oat!

279
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,880
Amazing.

280
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,440
Inspector M called me there
to help last night.

281
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,840
Come on, delete it. It's embarrassing!

282
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,520
No, I need to work.

283
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,680
By the way, bro.

284
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,000
The results of Natty Wasinee's drug test
is available.

285
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,760
Have you read it?

286
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,680
Yeah.

287
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,920
As you said, there was methamphetamine.

288
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,280
(Methamphetamine: stimulates the CNS)
I knew it.

289
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,440
-Where were we?
-Gastro area.

290
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,440
OK.

291
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,760
And here.

292
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,480
Oat.

293
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,320
I'm sorry.

294
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,080
Oat!

295
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,680
Wipe it with something.

296
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,680
Come here! Come on.

297
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,040
Do you think it's Songkran?

298
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,000
It stinks!

299
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
I'll go take a shower.

300
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,200
Where are you going? Wash it first.

301
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,120
I'm taking a shower.

302
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,160
There's indeed only one left.

303
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,680
I can buy you a new one.

304
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,800
It doesn't matter. It's nothing.

305
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,040
-Doctor!
-What's wrong?

306
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,600
My sister asked me to ask you
for your phone number.

307
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,280
Your sister? Who is she?

308
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,720
That one.

309
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,640
OK.

310
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,240
-Thank you.
-OK.

311
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,320
Let's go.

312
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,280
Your charm never rests.

313
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,400
My clothes are so amazing. Not bad.

314
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,920
-Let's go.-
Where to?

315
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
To buy some new clothes. Come on.

316
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,920
Really?

317
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Your change.

318
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,320
Thank you.

319
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,360
Pued?

320
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Bun!

321
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,080
How's it going?

322
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,000
You've been here a few days.
Why didn't you come and see me?

323
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,160
You're one to talk.
You turned off your phone.

324
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,461
Oh, sorry.

325
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,800
Gift always calls and harasses me,
so I changed my phone number.

326
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,120
You never change, do you?

327
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,280
Whatever makes you happy.

328
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,920
What are you looking at?

329
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,840
Nothing. It looks familiar.
I may have seen it somewhere before.

330
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,440
Impossible! This is a limited edition.

331
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,280
I wouldn't dare wear this watch
if my dad didn't buy it for me.

332
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,280
Really?

333
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,360
Yeah, did you see Jane?

334
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,021
Just met her yesterday.

335
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:11,080
-You did?
-She's gotten so much prettier.

336
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,680
Didn't you say you wanted to chase her?

337
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,000
You don't want to anymore?
She's so pretty now, for real.

338
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,360
I need to take care of something.
See you next time.

339
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,040
-OK. Remember to answer my call next time.
-Yeah, bye.

340
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,400
It's up to you. Yeah, here too.

341
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,120
I don't feel so confident.

342
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,600
It's itchy.

343
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,400
Bun.

344
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,120
Hi, Rung!

345
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,561
When did you come back?

346
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:38,560
Actually, I've been back for a while.

347
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,880
Jane didn't tell me.
Looks like I need to scold her.

348
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,360
We haven't seen each other
in 10 years, right?

349
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,360
-It's been so long.
-You've grown up.

350
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:50,160
You've become so handsome,
I almost didn't recognize you.

351
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,120
You flatter me.

352
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
You are even more beautiful too.
More and more beautiful.

353
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm just getting old.

354
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,320
Let's go. Go.

355
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,861
I mean it. You are so handsome now!

356
00:25:58,941 --> 00:26:00,501
Rung, now I'm embarrassed.

357
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,680
Here, cheers.

358
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,080
Please enjoy.

359
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,520
The one I was chatting with is Rung,
Rungtiva.

360
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,061
She's the owner of Viang Maya Spa.

361
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,621
Jane's sister.

362
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,040
Viangpha Mork is a small town.

363
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,981
On the director's birthday,
all important guests are here.

364
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:30,021
Police chiefs, members of the parliament,

365
00:26:30,101 --> 00:26:31,541
judges...

366
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,680
You can say they are all present.

367
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Including my friend Pued.

368
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,000
Lastly...

369
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,680
Bun!

370
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,421
-Jane.
-Have you been here for a long time?

371
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:05,621
Have you eaten yet?

372
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,920
Yeah.

373
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,880
He is a shareholder of the school
I teach at.

374
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,840
My name is Tan.

375
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,960
He is Bun, my friend.

376
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Hi.

377
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,160
Hi.

378
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,920
Nice to meet you.

379
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,510
Tan, look, the director.

380
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,520
Excuse me.
I should say hello to the director.

381
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,160
(Happy birthday, Director Kongkiat)
(Viangpha Mork Hospital)

382
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,980
Go.

383
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,760
Would you like something to drink, Doctor?

384
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,000
I don't like it when I'm drunk.

385
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,560
Do you think we can remember what we do...

386
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,920
when we're drunk?

387
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,600
We may remember some scattered fragments.

388
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,080
It depends on how drunk we are.

389
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,760
Why are you asking this?

390
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,280
I just want to drink a bit more.

391
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,760
But I'm worried
that I may act out of line when I'm drunk.

392
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,360
I may not remember it later.

393
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,680
It was in your hair.

394
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,880
Have you ever been that drunk before?

395
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,440
No.

396
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
And you?

397
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,200
Have you ever been that drunk?

398
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,960
No.

399
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,520
Because even if I am...

400
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,080
I still remember everything.

401
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,440
You can remember everything?

402
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,600
That's nice.

403
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,680
And you?

404
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,880
Do you remember?

405
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,880
Of course.

406
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,080
I remember everything.

407
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,720
Pued, let go!

408
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,440
Jane, come here.

409
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,560
Pued!

410
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,480
Come on!

411
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,800
Come here.

412
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,960
Tan!

413
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,160
Tan! Don't!

414
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,120
Tan!

415
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,440
I said stop! Don't take pictures! Don't!

416
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,840
Stop it!

417
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,400
Tan, let's go!

418
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,040
What happened?

419
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,680
This has nothing to do with you.

420
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,720
How could it have nothing to do with me?

421
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,560
Jane.

422
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,720
Is it very serious?

423
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,160
Do you need me to get you some medicine?

424
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,080
It's nothing.

425
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,840
When I helped you fight over a woman,
it was much worse than this.

426
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,720
Wait.

427
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,920
I've never fought with someone
over a woman.

428
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,440
What were you fighting for?

429
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,840
A woman's matter. It's nothing.

430
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,200
Don't mind it.

431
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,520
Is Pued that important to you...

432
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,400
so you have to keep a secret like this?

433
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,240
Tan, please bear with me.

434
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,920
You will know the truth soon.

435
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Jane.

436
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,020

438
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,760
I was just about to call you.

439
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,400
We know each other so well.

440
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,520
I didn't want you to worry about me.

441
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Are you OK?

442
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,520
I'm good.

443
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,920
I'm fine.

444
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,800
Bun, I...

445
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,840
I have the sense of responsibility
that I told you before.

446
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,400
What do you mean?

447
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,280
It's nothing.

448
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,240
Are you free tomorrow?

449
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,520
-I am.
-Great.

450
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,680
Then let's go eat dim sum
at that restaurant you like.

451
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,720
It's my turn to invite you.

452
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,160
OK. I'll empty your wallet.

453
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,840
OK, see you tomorrow.

454
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,040
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

455
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,960
OK.

Hello, Inspector.

Who is the victim?

The victim is 31 years old.

Doctor.

467
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,040
Doctor.

468
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,160
Yes?

469

-OK.

472
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
Give me the gloves.

OK.

I'm OK.

489
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,480
Oat, next, check the ligature mark.

(Ligature mark)

491
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,280
If it's hanging,
there will only be one mark.

494

it's nylon.

(Petechial hemorrhage)

498
00:40:25,581 --> 00:40:27,581
The person who found the victim
is Wirapong Inkhamvieng.

499
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,000
The victim's boyfriend.

500
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,360
At 8:12 in the morning,

501
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,760
the person who found the victim said...

502
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,080
he saw that she had hung herself.

503
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,960
Oat.

504
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,080
What's wrong?

505
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,440
There seem to be pinhole marks.

506
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,240
Inspector.

507
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,080
What's the matter, Doctor?

508
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,480
This...doesn't look like a suicide case.

509
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,800
According to statistics,

510
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,400
80 percent of murders are committed
by people close to the victims.

511
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,680
Lovers, especially.

512
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,600
=Manner of Death=

513
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,320
You forgot me.

514
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,760
Oh, yeah.

515
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,360
Where did you go?

516
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,520
You indeed forgot me, didn't you?

517
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,640
I'm angry now.

518
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,960
Oat, Oat, look.

519
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,581
Today is the director's birthday party,
right?

520
00:42:48,661 --> 00:42:51,760
When you dance onstage,
I'll be the shill.

521
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,680
I'll offer gifts to you, OK?

522
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,000
I'll only take the 1000-baht notes.

523
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,021
They're all yours.

524
00:42:57,101 --> 00:42:58,640
-Deal.
-Deal.

525
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,560
Who? What happened?

526
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,080
-Jane! Jane!
-Rung, please stay calm.

527
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,001
Look at these marks.

528
00:43:08,081 --> 00:43:09,600
Looks like she was pulled up...

529
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,400
rather than committing suicide.

530
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,960
Can you tell me that again?

531
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,000
How did you find Jane's body that day?

532
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,280
I went to pick her up as usual.

533
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,240
How did you get into her house?

534
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,520
They happened to be quite close recently.

535
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,040
I told you, don't meddle in this!

536
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,800
Be careful.

537
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,200
I will be watching you.
