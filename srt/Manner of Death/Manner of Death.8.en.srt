1
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,061
To be honest,

2
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:31,176
I still can't believe that Jane is dead.

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,420
Do you know who killed Jane?

4
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:42,685
I can't answer you.

5
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:43,700
Why?

6
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,060
Did Jane do something,
or did she get in somebody's way?

7
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,820
Tan, this is more serious than you think.

8
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,020
Especially when Bun
has brought this issue to light now.

9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,540
I'm so scared! I'm scared
that he will be the next victim.

10
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,180
What are you going to do?

11
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,260
I need to disappear for a while.

12
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:08,980
I don't understand.

13
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,020
Because right now,

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,300
whatever I say, he won't listen to me.

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,420
That's why I need to disappear
for a while.

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,161
I'll hide in the safe house for a while
to make him think that I was kidnapped,

17
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,361
all because he got involved
in this matter.

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,580
It may be the only way he'll stop.

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,600
Brother,

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,900
do you think this will really work?

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,460
I don't know. I have to try first.

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,060
In any event, you need...

23
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,940
to take care of him during my absence.

24
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,340
Promise me.

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,980
All right, Brother.

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,940
I will look after Bun.

27
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,360
=Manner of Death=

28
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,380
Brother, I'm here.

29
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,720
Come in.

30
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,620
Oh, what about Dr. Bun?

31
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,780
Didn't you tell me
not to look for you here?

32
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:57,740
When I tell you to come in, come in.

33
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
Go in.

34
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,540
Sit next to Tan.

35
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,740
Did you kill Pued?

36
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,860
-I didn't kill him.
-You're lying!

37
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:47,460
I'm not lying.

38
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,780
Pued is still safe.

39
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,740
Tan,
I won't believe anything you say again.

40
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,180
-Please own up to it.
-There's nothing I need to own up to.

41
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,340
Well, then,
why are you wearing Pued's watch?

42
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,580
That's right.

43
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,540
This watch looks the same as Pued's.

44
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,260
But this one is mine.

45
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,660
It's your watch?

46
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,940
My dad bought one for Pued and one for me.

47
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,880
Also, it's the only thing my dad
has ever bought me.

48
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,140
What do you mean?

49
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,340
Pued and I are brothers.

50
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,740
I don't believe it.

51
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,520
It's true.

52
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:48,300
Actually,
Pued owns half of the pub's shares.

53
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,660
It's just that Tan
is the one who shows up in person.

54
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,820
(Big Brother)

55
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,140
Let me prove it to you.

56
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,300
I'm really not lying to you.

57
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,660
How is Bun doing?

58
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,540
I saw his matter come up
on the Internet again.

59
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,140
Was that him?

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,840
Pued?

61
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,320
Bun?

62
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,320
My brother didn't want you
to get involved in Jane's case.

63
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,880
Because this case
involves influential people,

64
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,120
he didn't want you to get into trouble.

65
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,800
That's why he told me
to arrange for That to threaten you.

66
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,440
But in the end,

67
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,760
you didn't give up.

68
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,880
So he decided to disappear,

69
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,120
hoping that it would make you panic.

70
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:40,160
Prosecutor Pued is in my hands.

71
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:43,080
Who are you?

72
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,240
You still can't figure it out?

73
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,280
Yes.

74
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,840
I lied to you.

75
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,520
Hello, Doctor.

76
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm here for Pued's case.

77
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,080
Prosecutor Pued's case?

78
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,000
What happened?

79
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,720
I just want to know about the progress...

80
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,440
on Prosecutor Pued's case.

81
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,200
There are still no further news.

82
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,120
What about Pat's case?

83
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,317
There are many victims in Pat's case.

84
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,600
The police are investigating them
one by one.

85
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,440
You mean, it's going to be a long wait?

86
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,880
But there is progress in that case.

87
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,680
What progress?

88
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,800
Someone broke into my car
and stole Pat's laptop.

89
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I think I know who did it.

90
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
Well, I hope you can catch that guy soon.

91
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Doctor,

92
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,001
the blood test results
in this case, I think,

93
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:46,361
show high levels
of alanine aminotransferase.

94
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
Doctor...?

95
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,640
Doctor?

96
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,480
Oat, you don't need to ask me everything!

97
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,640
I only asked once.

98
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,480
Let me see.

99
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,280
Where?

100
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,360
Dr. Bun...

101
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,560
Let's check it again.

102
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,080
But isn't Dr. Fai responsible
for this case?

103
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,360
I'm leaving.

104
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,960
Bun, wait.

105
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,280
Bun.

106
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,160
(Por)

107
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,280
Hello?

108
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,760
How is it going in Pued's matter?

109
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,800
There will be clues soon, Boss.

110
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,680
Clues?

111
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,640
Let him answer my call!

112
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,560
I know he is doing fine!

113
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
He's hiding
in his dad's old vacation home.

114
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,520
And you bring him food and water.

115
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,600
I don't know what you two are planning.

116
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,320
I don't know either, Boss.

117
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,600
Pued planned all of this.

118
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,120
Is it about Ms. Jane's case?

119
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:32,000
The more he hides, the fishier it seems,

120
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,960
and the more dubious he becomes.

121
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,840
In the end,
he'll become a lamb to the slaughter.

122
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,480
Go and tell him.

123
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,080
Tell him to explain it to me.

124
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,960
Or else, I will go to get him myself.

125
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:46,400
Boss, don't worry.

126
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,160
You don't need to do anything.

127
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,600
Because this time,

128
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,720
I will bring him here.

129
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,760
Here.

130
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,480
I found this for you.

131
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,720
This van passes by your school every day.

132
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,400
Where does it go?

133
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,221
I don't know either.

134
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,160
What?

135
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,280
I didn't continue to track it down.

136
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,185
Do you think I've got nothing else
to do all day?

137
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:24,120
It seems to me
that you've got nothing to do every day.

138
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,760
Do you want to see me beating people up?

139
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,920
Is there someone you have to beat up?

140
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,031
You are here, aren't you?

141
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:34,560
Calm down,
you've already beaten me up before.

142
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:37,280
What are we going to do about the van?

143
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,120
I will follow it tomorrow.

144
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,560
Really? Let me come with you.

145
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,800
No way!

146
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,240
Oh... Why?

147
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,400
The owner of that van is a bigwig.

148
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,480
Big what?

149
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,800
Get your mind out of the gutter.

150
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,960
I didn't think that!
What are you talking about?

151
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,680
A very powerful person, understand?

152
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,760
That's why I don't want you
to come with me.

153
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,320
Come on, please.

154
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,920
I have to go, no matter what.

155
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,600
I told you no.

156
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,585
Even if you don't let me go with you,
I will go there by bike.

157
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,320
What do you want?

158
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,160
If you're like this, I won't do
any more investigations for you.

159
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,520
Nam is my friend.

160
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Seeing you secretly follow the vehicle...
It's so dangerous!

161
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,541
I have to be responsible for you.

162
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:30,480
That's why I can't let you take
the risk alone.

163
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,240
You are really...

164
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,080
Let me go with you.

165
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,185
All right, you can.

166
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,120
But under one condition.

167
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,360
If you go with me,
you need to do whatever I tell you to.

168
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,280
You must not defy a single word of mine,
understand?

169
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,448
All right, Boss.

170
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,481
No matter where you tell me to go,
come hell or high water,

171
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:56,563
I will listen to you.

172
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,040
Thank you.

173
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,880
What are you doing?

174
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,040
Brother.

175
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,080
Brother?

176
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,040
Brother?

177
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,680
Do you want to kill me?

178
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,840
You deserve it, don't you?

179
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
What's the matter with you?

180
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,200
I should be asking you that!

181
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,480
What about Bun? How is he doing?

182
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,720
What did you do to make him find it out?

183
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,280
Brother, don't change the subject!

184
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,720
Explain it to me.

185
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,960
What is actually going on?

186
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,840
What do you want to know?

187
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,320
Let's start with the first thing.

188
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,880
Did you give Jane to Congressman Songchai
and Commander Tung...

189
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:53,880
for their entertainment?

190
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,680
Doctor!

191
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,920
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

192
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,880
I bought this for you.

193
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,362
I discovered a restaurant.

194
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,680
It's really good, it tastes very good.

195
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,840
Let's eat it together?

196
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,920
I'm sorry. I'm busy today.

197
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,280
Thank you for your invitation.

198
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,760
As for this...

199
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,960
You should eat it, I'm not really hungry.

200
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,040
You don't want it?

201
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,640
(Viangpha Mork Hospital)

202
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,280
Why do you look like this
every time I come to see you?

203
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,640
You are stubborn, you know?

204
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,120
So stubborn that I don't want you
to leave my sight.

205
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
So stubborn that I don't want
to let you go anywhere.

206
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
I'm really sorry...

207
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,480
for not being by your side.

208
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,560
It's my fault.

209
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,680
I'm not so stubborn as you.

210
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,400
Had I been more stubborn
and followed you...

211
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,640
If I had shared half of your stubbornness,

212
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,120
you wouldn't have been hurt like this.

213
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,880
Please give me one more chance.

214
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,280
Please let me protect you.

215
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,680
Come back and be my stubborn baby.

Stop!

226
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,900
Who are you?

227
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,734
I asked you who you are!

228
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:13,597
Reporting an incident
at Viangpha Mork No. 277.

229
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,665
Someone broke into my house.

230
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,040
Yes.

231
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,840
Okay.

232
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:23,865
Okay.

233
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,620
You!

234
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:34,865
Stop right there!

235
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,288
Stop!

236
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:38,871
Stop!

237
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,640
Stop!

238
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,320
Stop!

239
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,000
You!

240
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,120
How are you, Doctor?

241
00:24:06,374 --> 00:24:09,071
I'm fine, I'm heading home.

242
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,720
You were so lucky, Doctor.

243
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:14,700
After hitting the tree like that,
you still managed to survive.

244
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,600
Probably thanks to the seat belt.

245
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,160
By the way,

246
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,800
I have something to give you.

247
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,960
The brake lines.
(Physical evidence)

248
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,321
I asked the technical team
to check your car.

249
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:37,560
This was not an accident.

250
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,981
I think so too.

251
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:45,281
You just came to Viangpha Mork,

252
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:47,221
and you've already been "treated"
like this time and again.

253
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:49,575
Perhaps the people here
can't accept the truth.

254
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,880
You'd better stop
what you are doing right now.

255
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,480
Because from now on,

256
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,360
things may get more serious
than small accidents like this.

257
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:22,802
Hello, Commander.

258
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,920
Has everything been taken care of?

259
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,680
Not yet.

260
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,720
What is the problem?

261
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,840
It's just a simple task.
You can't even do that?

262
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,920
I'm so sorry.

263
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,880
I will solve this as soon as possible.

264
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,680
You'd better do what you say.

265
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,240
The sooner, the better.

266
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,960
Yes, Commander.

267
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,040
The commander called you.

268
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
What's the matter?

269
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,920
Nothing.

270
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,400
Let's go.

271
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,440
Don't go in yet.

272
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,840
The perpetrator may still be in the house.

273
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,680
He escaped.

274
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,120
Then let go of my hand!

275
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,280
And you can leave now!

276
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,840
I won't leave you alone.

277
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,840
Do you want me to call the police
to drag you out?

278
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,200
Aren't you calling the police?

279
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,280
I think it would be useless.

280
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,520
The police may even be nice to you.

281
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,000
Dam is not above the laws, Bun.

282
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,280
But you guys have always been
above the law.

283
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,880
Especially those two brothers of yours.

284
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,840
Por, indeed.

285
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,560
But Pued...

286
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,800
isn't that bad, Bun.

287
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,160
I might never believe
in what only my eyes can see again.

288
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,880
You said your house was searched?

289
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,560
What do you think they were looking for?

290
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,480
Perhaps the laptop, or the SD card.

291
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,960
Luckily, I've already put them
somewhere else.

292
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,881
But unfortunately, you suffered injuries.

293
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:58,481
No, this wound...

294
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,840
is because I fought with Pued.

295
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,240
What?

296
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,480
Pued asked me to take you to him.

297
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,440
Why?

298
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,520
He said he needed to tell you something
very important.

299
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,680
When do we go?

300
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,480
So you do believe me?

301
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,600
Not yet.

302
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,840
What do I have to do
so that you will believe me?

303
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,040
Give me your phone.

304
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,720
Now our mobile phones are connected.

305
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,720
I can find out what you are doing
and where you are.

306
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,501
From now on,

307
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:09,701
it might be a bit difficult for you
to lie to me.

308
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,560
That's great.

309
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,720
What's great?

310
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,600
It seems that the two of us...

311
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
have joined together into unity.

312
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,440
Will he really come?

313
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Trust me.

314
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,160
Sorn!

315
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,640
There!

316
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,400
Where is he leading us?

317
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,080
How could I know? I came here with you.

318
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,480
It turns out,
there is a house in this area.

319
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,040
Do you think Nam is here?

320
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,920
Wait.

321
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,320
Did you find anything?

322
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,040
Hurry, run!

323
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,880
Bastard! Hurry up!

324
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,480
Get up!

325
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,240
Run! Run!

326
00:32:22,077 --> 00:32:22,917
Hurry up!

327
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,200
Did we get away?

328
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
You run first. I'll lead him away.

329
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,560
Don't be like this!

330
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,280
Do you want me to abandon you?

331
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,400
You promised me, Sorn.

332
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,600
-But...
-Go!

333
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,480
I'll find someone to help you!

334
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:03,385
Hey!

335
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,560
That?

336
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,120
It is the old vacation home my father used
to store things.

337
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,480
That should be illegal stuff, right?

338
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,080
What do you think?

339
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,680
What exactly does your family do?

340
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,320
Some business in a legal gray area,
but not to the extent that it's dark.

341
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,720
Yes?

342
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,640
Doctor, you're needed
for emergency surgery.

343
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,481
Tan, turn around
and drive back to the hospital.

344
00:34:31,561 --> 00:34:32,481
Okay.

345
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,280
I'm on my way.

346
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,200
Sorawit!

347
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,280
What is it, Brother?

348
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,042
Tan, come pick me up.
I can't hold on anymore.

349
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,520
I'll look for Bun myself later.

350
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,640
I'll be there right away.

351
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,120
-Goodbye, Doctor.
-Bye.

352
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,880
(Tan: Something is up.)

353
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:04,400
(Need to go to my brother,
he doesn't want to wait any longer.)

354
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:07,880
Room number 124? Coughing...

355
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,880
Oat, let me borrow your car.

356
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,680
-What do you need it for?
-Hurry up.

357
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,781
Here. Don't get into an accident.

358
00:36:15,861 --> 00:36:16,901
I won't.

359
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,280
Gas number 95, 500 baht!

360
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,720
Okay, I'll refuel it for you later!

361
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,440
Brother.

362
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,440
Brother.

363
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,280
Brother?

364
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Why are you sleeping here?

365
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,200
Brother!

366
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,680
Hello?

367
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:49,680
My brother's heart has stopped beating.
Yes. Yes.

368
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,160
Aod's vacation home.

369
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Hurry!

370
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,360
Brother! Wake up, Brother!

371
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,840
Wake up!

372
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,240
God!

373
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,680
Brother! You are strong, aren't you?

374
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,600
Brother!

375
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,280
Please wake up.

376
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,040
Wake up and help me.

377
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,200
Brother...

378
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,320
Brother Pued!

379
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:41,197
Hey!

380
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,840
=Manner of Death=

381
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,600
Hello, Doctor.

382
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,240
What are you doing here?

383
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,720
Brother asked me to protect you.

384
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,200
I've followed you for several days before.

385
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,040
So I know that you like coming here.

386
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,440
It's quite scary knowing that.

387
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,840
I didn't want to do that either.

388
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,760
But this was an order.

389
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,480
I have to apologize to you again.

390
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,680
Don't do this to anyone again.

391
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,200
Okay. Thank you.

392
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,080
There are traces of a fight
on yours and Pued's body.

393
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,560
Did you have an argument with Pued?

394
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,320
We did have an issue.

395
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,520
What was it?

396
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,680
You don't need to know about it.

397
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,400
But you should be careful.

398
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,560
Because we don't know what Mr. Tan knows.

399
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,880
The police may need to deny bail
in this case, Doctor.

400
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,800
Why?

401
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,840
Don't tell the police anything for now.
Just say that you were hit by a car.

402
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,640
We can't trust anyone right now.
