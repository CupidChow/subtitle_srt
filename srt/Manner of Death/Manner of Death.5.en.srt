00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:23,075
(1 hour before Janejira's death)

00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,420
=Manner of Death=

3
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,970
Tan, how was your day at school?

4
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,050
Pretty good.

5
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,145
Have you eaten yet?

6
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:19,701
I have.

7
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:21,421
And you? Have you eaten yet?

8
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,376
I have.

9
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,475
What's wrong?

10
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,800
Oh, nothing.

11
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,550
I'll leave for a sec.

12
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,750
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

13
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,400
What are you doing?

14
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, I saw some lint on your clothes.

15
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:50,525
I wanted to brush it off.

16
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,720
I thought you were taking advantage of me.

17
00:02:57,225 --> 00:03:00,225
It's so hot today. I'll go take a shower.

18
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,050
Boiled water.

19
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:55,915
Thank you.

20
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,495
(Medical Evaluation Report)

21
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,750
What are you typing?

22
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,325
A report.

23
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,075
The autopsy report?

24
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:14,925
I've never seen one before. Let me see.

25
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:19,600
You are such a curious one.

26
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,600
Didn't I tell you?

27
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,150
Let me help you.

28
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,345
But this is an autopsy report.

29
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:31,095
It's the deceased's privacy.

30
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:32,150
I can't show you.

31
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,920
Just ask me what you want to know.

32
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,225
Will you answer me?

33
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:39,700
No.

34
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:41,600
I already told you,
it's the deceased's privacy.

35
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:49,225
I just saw you typing
about the discovery of drugs.

36
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,080
I told you, it's a secret.

37
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,550
So I'll keep this secret.

38
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:01,825
But now that I've already known,
you can tell me.

39
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,200
We found bruises on Jane's arms.

40
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,250
So we checked her hair.

41
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,550
We found components of Ice.

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,900
Do you understand?

43
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:32,400
There is a murderer, there's Ice.

44
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:35,800
Looks like there is much behind this case.

45
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,811
That's why...

46
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:41,200
I was threatened.

47
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:43,701
Someone doesn't want me
to continue the investigation.

48
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:44,944
But still, you are so stubborn.

49
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,025
Tell me.

50
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,945
Aren't you afraid that the other party
will hurt you again?

51
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:51,000
Of course I am.

52
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:53,070
But what can I do?

53
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:55,620
You know it, too.

54
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,750
I can't distort the facts
and make a false report as they want.

55
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:02,700
And this is one of the reasons...

56
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,025
why I moved in here.

57
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,641
When I was in Bangkok,

58
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:15,181
I always believed that as long as there
is a forensic doctor,

59
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:17,386
the deceased will be treated fairly.

60
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,000
Until one day,

61
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,620
the autopsy report I submitted...

62
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,995
was used by the police
to distort the real cause of death.

63
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:29,275
The criminal ended up escaping the law.

64
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:37,350
Since that day,
I've never trusted the police again.

65
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,900
I couldn't stand...

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,870
that the report I sent in got switched.

67
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,170
That's why I moved back here.

68
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,754
I thought I could run away
from the bad police.

69
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
But see,

70
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,200
in the end, it's the same everywhere.

71
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:03,850
You're so stubborn.

72
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,320
But from now on,
you don't have to be afraid anymore.

73
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,525
No one can hurt you.

74
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,725
Do what you think is right.

75
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:27,900
I will protect you.

76
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:35,100
Who do you think you are?

77
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:37,175
Superman?

78
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,825
I'm serious. How can you joke about it?

79
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,450
Super Tan.

80
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,690
Bun.

81
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,750
This little brother
will drown if you use so much water.

82
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,375
Little brother?

83
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,695
Well, the new pepper tree is so small.

84
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:43,050
Of course it's the little brother.

85
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,825
In that case,
my cactus is the elder brother.

86
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:52,275
Little Brother Chili,
Elder Brother Cactus.

87
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:53,800
What a match!

88
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,745
Alright, that's enough.

89
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:01,025
Little Brother is so small.

90
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,900
He must be lonely
being here all by himself.

91
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,375
You know what?

92
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:18,721
When I just moved in here,

93
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:21,901
I once thought
about making a vegetable garden...

94
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:24,931
or planting some colorful flowers.

95
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,895
Why didn't you do it?

96
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:29,270
Look at my life.

97
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,975
Where would I get so much time?

98
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,857
I come home late at night.

99
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,234
I have tried it once.

100
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,000
But they all died.

101
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,700
But I'd love it,
a house with many trees and plants.

102
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:51,975
Bun, aren't you going to be late?

103
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,125
I made this for you.

104
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:58,120
Eat it at school.

105
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,850
Rice with stuffed eggs. Your favorite.

106
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:07,420
Thank you.

107
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,250
I'll get going.

108
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:13,228
OK.

109
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:33,370
Nam!

110
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,075
I'm hungry,
let's get something to eat in the market.

111
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,800
Nam!

112
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,645
What?

113
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,945
Are you OK?

114
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:46,800
I asked you if you wanted
to have something at the market.

115
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,475
No, I'm a bit busy.

116
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,800
Do you have nowhere else to go?

117
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:05,650
Yes. I'm not in a hurry.

118
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,000
Tell me what's wrong.

119
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,075
You seem so weird.

120
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,325
I'm leaving, Sorn.

121
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:07,250
Are you satisfied?

122
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:09,165
What about you?

123
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:11,760
Satisfied too?
So are you willing to give me the report?

124
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,800
I had to confirm
that no errors are in the test results.

125
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,500
Thank you.

126
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,545
The report is complete,
use it for your case file.

127
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,600
Will do.

128
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:26,900
I'll be leaving then.

129
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,050
I think Doctor Bun is suspicious of me.

130
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:47,470
You should be careful.

131
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,862
Also, what about that thing I asked you
to investigate?

132
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,145
There are no clues, Big Brother.
It's really hard to find anything.

133
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:57,470
No one in this area takes drugs
because no one sells them.

134
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,075
Even if someone is selling,
no one is buying.

135
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,425
Perhaps Jane bought them
from somewhere else?

136
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,850
I don't think Jane
was that kind of person.

137
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,715
Thank you.

138
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:40,920
I saw you with that guy
called That this evening.

139
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,250
How did you see us?

140
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,650
Were you following me?

141
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,490
Yes.

142
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,625
I went to your school to look for you.

143
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,775
But I saw you with That, so I left.

144
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,100
He is my junior.

145
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:01,950
Is there a problem?

146
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,425
You should stay away from him.

147
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:10,750
-Why?
-Do you know? That works for Dam.

148
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:15,154
And I suspect that he is the one
who broke into my room and attacked me.

149
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,650
I don't think that's possible.

150
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,675
That?

151
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,250
All those guys do all day is go racing.

152
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:27,920
With some people, you may know them...

153
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,575
a long time
without understanding their true nature.

154
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:32,175
I'm worried about you.

155
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,725
Thank you.

156
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:40,325
The thing is...

157
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:43,370
I have contact with him...

158
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,695
because I asked him
to help me investigate...

159
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:47,370
the methamphetamine you found
in Jane's body.

160
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,225
We'll probably never see each other again.

161
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,300
You don't need to worry.

162
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,175
I shouldn't have let you know
about the report that day.

163
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,575
I said you don't have to worry.

164
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:12,175
Let me take this risk for you.

165
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:19,875
Be careful.

166
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,017
I don't want anyone to disappear
like Pued.

167
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:27,050
I won't.

168
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:29,125
I promise you that.

169
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,700
(Viangpha Mork)

170
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,775
Nam always comes here!

171
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,895
I don't think she is here.

172
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:52,450
Where would she have gone?

173
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,840
I don't know.

174
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,425
Nam!

175
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,695
Nam! Nam!

176
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,895
-Nam!
-What's wrong with her?

177
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:11,382
-Nam!
-Nam!

178
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:12,302
Nam!

179
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,425
Pulse, 30. Blood Pressure, 75 over 40.

180
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,570
Oxygen, 60 percent.

181
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,350
Little girl...

182
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,620
The patient had sudden cardiac arrest!

183
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,795
(Cardiac Arrest)

184
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,280
Excuse me.
(Cardiac Arrest)

185
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,201
Give me the defibrillator
(Defibrillator)

186
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:53,506
OK.
(Defibrillator)

187
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:59,400
I can't believe the police here
are covering up the truth so blatantly!

188
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:02,820
-What do you mean by that, Doctor?
-Drugs are spreading in Viangpha Mork!

189
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,300
Don't you guys know?

190
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,451
There are barely any drug cases here.

191
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:09,874
Just two cases so far.
It's not really spreading, is it?

192
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:12,320
Especially cases of methamphetamine
have never appeared here before.

193
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,645
Do you want to start investigating
till it's all over the town?

194
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,525
What a waste of the taxpayers' money!

195
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,548
You are going too far, Doctor.

196
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:22,320
Please calm down, Inspector.

197
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:27,345
Doctor, please calm down.

198
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:29,420
We are doing our best to handle this case.

199
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,445
We need to wait for this patient
to wake up...

200
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,570
before we can obtain
more relevant information.

201
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,508
Doctor.

202
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,650
We found bite marks.

203
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:31,520
Come on. Let's go.

204
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:43,075
Doctor.

205
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,068
Good day, Principal.

206
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:49,195
Good day.

207
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:50,777
You came so early.

208
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,570
I need to leave soon.

209
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,061
How is Nam, Doctor?

210
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:57,366
The patient overdosed.

211
00:19:57,794 --> 00:20:00,261
Fortunately,
she was sent to the hospital in time.

212
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:04,387
However, I don't know
when she will wake up yet.

213
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:12,220
Since you are here now,
I should be heading back.

214
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,810
-Thank you.
-OK.

215
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,691
Hello, Principal.

216
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:30,921
-You came to visit Nam, Sorawit?
-Yes, sir.

217
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:33,061
I'm relieved to see you here.

218
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:34,621
Sir, don't worry.

219
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:37,621
I will sing her songs. She won't be alone.

220
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,181
Don't sing too loudly.

221
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:40,436
I won't, sir.

222
00:20:54,175 --> 00:20:57,275
Do you see these marks, Doctor?

223
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,275
It's the same amount.

224
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,200
And the pinholes and bruises.

225
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,525
Are there any in other places?

226
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,125
Her shoulders.

227
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,850
Looks like it's from not long ago.

228
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,770
Drugs.

229
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,750
Bite marks.

230
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,200
Just like Jane and Natty?

231
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,925
This kid should know
what happened to Jane.

232
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:48,700
I can't imagine...

233
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,821
what could have happened to Jane.

234
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:53,351
What do you think?

235
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,285
Sex, maybe.

236
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:04,145
But someone like Jane?

237
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:08,825
I don't think there would be many things
related to Ice and the bite marks.

238
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,141
I'm afraid we need to wait for this kid
to wake up...

239
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:19,880
before we can figure out
what really happened.

240
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:47,600
I didn't come here to give you trouble.

241
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,600
So you just came here
without prior notice?

242
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:54,150
Today is my birthday.

243
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:58,170
So I thought I should come
and celebrate it somehow.

244
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,650
There's a surge in views
from the video I did with you last time.

245
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,425
We haven't celebrated it yet.

246
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,950
How did you know that I'm here?

247
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,650
Because I'm a journalist, Doctor.

248
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,325
You seem like a guy who's got no friends.

249
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,025
Indeed. I don't have any.

250
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,840
Come on!

251
00:23:34,354 --> 00:23:35,280
I think...

252
00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:37,850
Come on. Celebrate with me.

253
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:41,950
Let's toast to it.

254
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,190
Come on.

255
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:46,400
Here, wish me a happy birthday.

256
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:49,315
Cheers.

257
00:24:00,325 --> 00:24:04,750
Do you know
why I created that crazy web page?

258
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,275
The same reason as yours, Doc.
To pursue justice.

259
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:10,750
What happened to you?

260
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,550
My mom got tricked.

261
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,525
My sister was raped.

262
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,500
My dad was killed.

263
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:24,020
And, Doctor, do you know...

264
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,750
what the most ridiculous thing of all is?

265
00:24:29,075 --> 00:24:30,920
Everyone knows who the murderers are,

266
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,775
but none of them went to jail.

267
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,300
All my life,
I've encountered so many things like that.

268
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,820
So you built this page
to call for justice?

269
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,325
I did it for money.

270
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,125
I know...

271
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,261
that people need to be rich to have power,

272
00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:58,650
to have value
and make people be interested in you.

273
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,125
If I didn't do it for money,
what else would I do it for?

274
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,525
Look at Prosecutor Pued.

275
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,425
What does Pued have to do with this?

276
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:13,250
He needed money.

277
00:25:13,782 --> 00:25:14,800
He needed power.

278
00:25:16,217 --> 00:25:17,970
That's why he gave his woman
to the big shot.

279
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,575
What do you mean by that?

280
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,975
Ms. Jane was so pitiful.

281
00:25:29,222 --> 00:25:30,845
I think you are drunk.

282
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,625
I'm not.

283
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:37,150
I think you should go home.

284
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,971
If you don't believe it,
do whatever you want.

285
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,475
Whatever you want.

286
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,895
(Viangpha Mork Hospital)

287
00:25:57,975 --> 00:26:01,820
Bro, I can't believe it.

288
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,850
Nam almost ended up like Natty.

289
00:26:04,308 --> 00:26:05,750
Luckily, just "almost."

290
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,975
Bro, do you know where Nam got the drugs?

291
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,875
Why do you want to know?

292
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:18,550
So that I can go to the police
and have those people arrested.

293
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:22,820
If they could catch them,
they would've done that long ago.

294
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,625
We wouldn't have to wait for you
to call the police, Sorn.

295
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,061
The way you put it...

296
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,713
Do you know something?

297
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,150
I don't know anything.

298
00:26:35,142 --> 00:26:38,570
That, if you know anything, tell me.

299
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:41,520
If calling the police is useless,

300
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,820
at least I can upload it
to the website "Viangpha Mork Incidents."

301
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,050
I told you, I don't know anything.

302
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,501
Could it be that Dam did this?

303
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:54,725
Are you not telling me
because you are his brother?

304
00:26:55,175 --> 00:26:56,420
Enough.

305
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,000
Don't talk nonsense.

306
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,900
It's because you aren't telling me.

307
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:04,920
Yeah.

308
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,970
Don't you need to watch over your friend?

309
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,100
Oh, right.

310
00:27:09,325 --> 00:27:10,650
I'll go there soon.

311
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:17,400
Aren't you afraid of ghosts?

312
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,800
This area is scary.

313
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:26,775
Now that you say it,
would you like to come with me?

314
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,691
No.

315
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,388
I'm afraid of ghosts.

316
00:27:34,274 --> 00:27:38,770
Why did you say that
if you are going to abandon me?

317
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:40,775
Good luck.

318
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,550
Bun... Bun?

319
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,000
Do you want to sleep upstairs?

320
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,025
I'm not drunk.

321
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,977
Don't talk back.

322
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,150
I know how you are when you are drunk.

323
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,150
I also know how I am when I'm not drunk.

324
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,600
Look at you.

325
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,200
You look like this
every time you are drunk.

326
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,011
What's "like this?"

327
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,765
You're being so seductive.

328
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,125
I never seduced you.

329
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,200
Didn't you say you remember everything?

330
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,450
I do remember.

331
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,650
I never seduced you.

332
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,875
How could people like me...

333
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:11,794
seduce other people?

334
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,500
Then...

335
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,875
what are you doing right now?

336
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,160
Are you drunk again?

337
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:48,375
This time, I'm not.

338
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,145
Are you done yet? We're running late!

339
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:11,350
Coming!

340
00:32:18,175 --> 00:32:19,082
I'm done.

341
00:32:19,162 --> 00:32:20,075
(Missed call-Pat)

342
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:28,695
What happened?

343
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:30,100
Are you too drunk to go home?

344
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:44,050
Did Jane tell you anything about Pued?

345
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:48,175
In my memory,
I only know about Pued being a playboy.

346
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,175
But he is a prosecutor.

347
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,220
He wouldn't do that.

348
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,950
Don't give a drunk guy a hard time.

349
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,175
(Inspector M)

350
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,150
Hello, Inspector.

351
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,621
Cause of death,

352
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:13,751
gunshot wounds caused by bullets.

353
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,925
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

354
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,725
Come on. Are you ready?

355
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:20,541
There are three gunshot wounds.

356
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:24,121
One in the center of the back.

357
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,225
The other two bullets
were left inside his body.

358
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,820
The victim died about seven hours ago.

359
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,750
We found a bruise on the left shoulder.

360
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:03,034
Doctor, are you OK?

361
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,520
I'm fine.

362
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:09,655
I just feel...

363
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,800
shocked.

364
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,475
Shocked?

365
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,675
Pat was drinking with me...

366
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,154
just a few minutes
before he was shot to death.

367
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Do you think this case...

368
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:24,670
is related to Ms. Jane's case?

369
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,400
Not necessarily.

370
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,500
Oat, the stomach.

371
00:34:40,102 --> 00:34:41,325
Pass me a knife, please.

372
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,540
(Manner of Death)

373
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:28,150
This isn't yours.

374
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,000
This isn't yours.

375
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,900
Thank you.

376
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,900
Brother,
I didn't see you in the hospital.

377
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,850
Because I didn't go there.

378
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,670
What about your injury?

379
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,125
It will be fine after a while.

380
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,461
It will fester!

381
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,841
I'll be right back.

382
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,125
Move over.

383
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,840
Move.

384
00:36:02,468 --> 00:36:03,590
Hey!

385
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,742
-Don't move around.
-Don't!

386
00:36:04,822 --> 00:36:05,920
Hey!

387
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,275
Take it easy.

388
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:24,470
Go to the doctor in the morning.
It'll stop hurting.

389
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:26,600
You are the big boss.

390
00:36:27,425 --> 00:36:29,175
Why are you so weak?

391
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,381
Don't talk like that if you don't want
to go to the hospital again.

392
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:34,240
Calm down.

393
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,795
I don't want to go.

394
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,320
But I'm telling the truth.

395
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,045
You're scared of needles.

396
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,020
You cry over a little bit of pain.

397
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,175
Why did Dam let you work for him?

398
00:36:44,742 --> 00:36:45,845
Don't let me recover,

399
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:49,245
or I'll beat you up
and you will cry for it too, Sorn.

400
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:51,670
Those are completely two different things.

401
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,995
Everyone will cry
under those circumstances.

402
00:36:54,075 --> 00:36:56,245
Do you want to try getting beaten up
like me?

403
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:57,275
You...

404
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,390
Stay still.

405
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:09,625
Done.

406
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:11,625
Take this home with you.

407
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:13,600
You need to apply it every day, got it?

408
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:15,875
-Why?
-What?

409
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,697
You need to use it every day.

410
00:37:18,777 --> 00:37:20,145
I'll leave it to you for now.

411
00:37:20,225 --> 00:37:22,300
If I want to use it, I'll come and get it.

412
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,685
Can you give me your number then?

413
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:25,950
So I can find you.

414
00:37:26,825 --> 00:37:29,000
If the wound festers,
you'll need to have your arm amputated.

415
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,045
Do you provide
on-site wound treatment service?

416
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:46,965
I do.

417
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,100
But it'll cost you a fortune.

418
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:53,625
I won't wait any longer!
(Next episode)

419
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:58,750
Explain it to me now.

420
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:02,200
Are you OK?

421
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:05,045
What are you doing here?

422
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,545
That's what I should be asking you.

423
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,700
What are you doing?

424
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,825
Nam!

425
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,950
(Jane's death)
