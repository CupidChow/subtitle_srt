1
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,219
Didn't I tell you
to bring Phong's dead body back?
(Four years ago)

2
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,961
How could you let him go?
(Four years ago)

3
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,041
Do you know how
much money your guy took from me?
(Four years ago)

4
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:30,329
We almost got him at the border.

5
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,560
But still, he got away.

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,100
I've seen many liars.

7
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:41,040
You are the worst liar ever.

8
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:48,720
Someone like you...

9
00:00:49,723 --> 00:00:51,360
doesn't have the guts to kill anyone.

10
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:56,091
If they deserve it,
of course I can kill them.

11
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:57,132
Deserve it?

12
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:04,440
That brought Phong to us.

13
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:07,697
Then he deserves it, doesn't he?

14
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:09,089
Brother!

15
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:10,857
Prove it to me.

16
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,498
Just kill him.

17
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:18,253
Brother.

18
00:01:19,193 --> 00:01:20,073
Shoot him!

19
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,154
If you don't shoot him,

20
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:25,155
I'll do it.

21
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:26,531
Brother!

22
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:41,891
Tan, it's because you're like this...

23
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:45,240
that I can't trust you!

24
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:49,792
Brother! What are you doing?

25
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,136
He is your little brother!

26
00:01:54,803 --> 00:01:55,883
Stay out of this.

27
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:00,355
He is your little brother, not mine!

28
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:04,378
Then you are not allowed to kill
my little brother!

29
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:10,378
If you want to kill him,

30
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,401
kill me first!

31
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,331
Pued.

32
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,872
Tan, remember this!

33
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:34,640
Pued saved you this time!

34
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,140
=Manner of Death=

35
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,340
=Episode 10=

36
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:48,600
Take a seat.

37
00:03:49,873 --> 00:03:50,728
Okay.

38
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:26,132
Thank you.

39
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:37,363
Tan, where is this place?

40
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:40,683
A cottage I bought.

41
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,040
What did you buy it for?

42
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:47,648
At first,

43
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:51,984
I planned to move here with
my mother after my graduation.

44
00:04:55,803 --> 00:04:57,080
But in the end,

45
00:04:57,783 --> 00:04:59,483
my mother couldn't see this house herself.

46
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:07,659
You planned to live in the woods
with your mother?

47
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:10,899
My mother was similar to you.

48
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:12,411
She liked nature.

49
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:16,471
She liked quietness
and places away from the crowd.

50
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,810
What's wrong?

51
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:33,618
Are you scared?

52
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,280
I like this place.

53
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,120
I'm a medical examiner.

54
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:44,563
How can I be scared of this?

55
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,899
You said you liked it.
What do you like about it?

56
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:55,125
It's...

57
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,400
It's like a candy house.

58
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,840
Wait, a candy house?

59
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:03,960
Yeah.

60
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:06,921
"Hansel and Gretel"
in Grimm's Fairy Tales.

61
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:11,003
The two siblings are put in a candy house
in the woods by their stepmother.

62
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:14,200
Isn't it similar?

63
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:20,115
Why are you laughing?

64
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:22,705
I finally believe...

65
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:25,104
that you and Jane
were close to each other.

66
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:26,707
You know?

67
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,460
Jane used to tell me these stories.

68
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,480
Mine was the original copy.

69
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:38,619
Jane borrowed
several fairy tale books from me.

70
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:40,003
Hold on.

71
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,159
Don't tell me,

72
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,640
that old
"Andersen's Fairy Tales" was yours?

73
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:48,603
Yes.

74
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:50,480
Wow.

75
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:56,200
Would you mind if I asked you
to read bedtime stories to me?

76
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:58,474
I want to know you better.

77
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:03,602
Of course.

78
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:13,518
So, which one of us is Hansel,
and which one is Gretel?

79
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,978
Stop it.

80
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,280
They are brother and sister.

81
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:24,651
Okay.

82
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,459
It seems that a thorough
clean-up is needed here.

83
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:32,787
Let me help you.

84
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:03,981
Hey, why are you here?

85
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,409
To take a shower.

86
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,209
Why didn't you wait for me to finish?

87
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,691
I want to take a shower with you together.

88
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:15,120
Come here.

89
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:16,281
I'll help you rub your back.

90
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:36,491
Sorry.

91
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:40,226
Why do you apologize?

92
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:44,802
I'm sorry that I've caused you trouble.

93
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:51,320
I should be the one to apologize.

94
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:54,627
This thing started with me.

95
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:01,741
It kept getting worse because of me.

96
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:06,040
It's good that you know it.

97
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:15,609
But Pued's death...

98
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,440
was because you had hidden things from me.

99
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,362
I won't let anyone else die.

100
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:36,002
How was the meal today? Was it good?

101
00:10:38,714 --> 00:10:40,329
As long as I'm with you,

102
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,560
I won't starve.

103
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,267
I'll cook for you again tomorrow.

104
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,371
We have to tidy up the house today.

105
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:55,633
You are such an all-rounder.

106
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:02,080
You're a doctor,

107
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,999
a chef,

108
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,083
and a housekeeper.

109
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:09,274
But unfortunately...

110
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,793
there's another role you don't have yet.

111
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:17,090
My boyfriend.

112
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:23,635
Let's clean up the house.

113
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,275
Mr Tan is gone.

114
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:53,000
What does that have to do with me?

115
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:56,371
I think you are involved in this matter.

116
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,930
The police received a call at 01:35.

117
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:09,884
It reported that gunshots were heard...

118
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:11,040
coming from your brother's,
Mr Tan's, house.

119
00:12:12,194 --> 00:12:13,368
When the police arrived at the scene,

120
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:16,074
they found bullet holes
and signs of trespass.

121
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:20,504
The police also saw in the CCTV footage...

122
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:24,169
that Mr Tan's car was chased by your
subordinate's car at the intersection.

123
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:34,531
My subordinate might have
a dispute with Tan previously.

124
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,970
How could I know about these things?

125
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:40,202
I'd like to take his statement.

126
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:43,100
I've sent him away to
handle some business.

127
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,560
He may come back a month later.

128
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:00,299
Let me dry your hair.

129
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:04,040
Oh. Thank you.

130
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:12,859
What are you thinking about?

131
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:20,281
I'm thinking that the murderer of Pued
injected him with the same drug...

132
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:22,200
that Jane had been injected with.

133
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:25,840
Perhaps both murders were committed
by the same person.

134
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:28,840
Probably.

135
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:31,560
But no matter what,

136
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,900
I have to explain this to Por first.

137
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:38,560
Will he listen to you?

138
00:13:40,675 --> 00:13:41,955
I don't know.

139
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:45,160
But we can't keep hiding like this.

140
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:47,360
I'll go with you.

141
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,160
Listen to me.

142
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:55,194
But,

143
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:56,355
I meant it.

144
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,335
I worry about you as much
as you worry about me.

145
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,544
But you don't know...

146
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:06,840
how much I worry about you.

147
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:26,920
Let's go upstairs.

148
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm sorry.

149
00:14:58,618 --> 00:14:59,458
Tan!

150
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:02,458
Tan!

151
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:07,418
Tan!

152
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,200
Let me go! Tan!

153
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:14,680
I'm sorry, but I have to face this alone.

154
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:16,601
I won't let you get into danger with me.

155
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:17,868
Tan!

156
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,680
Are you going to
leave me just like this?

157
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:22,672
I will be back soon.

158
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,000
I promise you.

159
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,176
Tan. Tan! Tan!

160
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:27,675
Let me go!

161
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,243
Tan!

162
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,000
Come back!

163
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,338
Open the rear door.

164
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,105
Open the door.

165
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:25,931
Brother.

166
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,322
Don't you know, Tan?

167
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:29,883
Once you come inside,

168
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:32,881
you won't be able to leave.

169
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,000
But you don't have to worry, Tan!

170
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,760
I won't let you die so easily!

171
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:52,160
I really didn't kill Pued, Brother!

172
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:56,754
I won't believe you!

173
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:10,227
Why would I kill Pued?

174
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:15,488
If I wanted to kill someone in revenge,

175
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,199
please remember, Brother, it would be you.

176
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,123
Then why didn't you kill me?

177
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:22,840
I would have killed you long ago
if I could, Brother!

178
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,040
But no matter how much I want to kill you,

179
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,560
I can't do it.

180
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:35,200
Even though Phong betrayed me,

181
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:38,028
I couldn't really kill him, Brother!

182
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:42,799
Besides, you two are my family members.

183
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,435
The only two family
members left in my life.

184
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:51,834
I'd never do that, Brother.

185
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:55,443
How am I supposed to believe you?

186
00:18:58,394 --> 00:18:59,694
You don't need to believe me right now.

187
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,760
But please listen to me.

188
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:09,338
Alright.

189
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:12,680
What do you know?

190
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:15,335
Tell me everything, from beginning to end.

191
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,250
(Police Station)

192
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:24,171
Inspector.

193
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:30,545
A member of the local Drug squad reported,

194
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:33,312
that they had found a large truck
transporting foreigners, Inspector.

195
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:37,434
Preliminarily, it's supposed
that this is related to human trafficking.

196
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:43,263
So they're asking us if we've got relevant
information about cases of this kind.

197
00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:47,247
Also, the Anti-Human Trafficking
Department hopes...

198
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:50,360
that we'll help resettle the foreigners.

199
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,375
The case at hand is already troublesome.

200
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,672
And this kind of thing happened?

201
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:52,114
The police are grateful to you,
Miss Rungtiva,

202
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:54,800
for accommodating
the group of foreign workers we arrested.

203
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:57,795
I'm glad that I can help.

204
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:02,577
Take these girls to their
rooms so they can rest.

205
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:04,898
If they need anything, supply it to them.

206
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:06,587
Yes, Miss Rung.

207
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:09,017
Officer, please let them follow me.

208
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:12,960
What happened to Bun and Tan?

209
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:16,369
I heard from the villagers...

210
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,400
that Por sent someone
to their house to kill them.

211
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:22,193
Is this true?

212
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,600
Yes.

213
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:26,600
Mr Tan and Dr Bun are missing.

214
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,660
The gunman also escaped.

215
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:34,880
Mr Tan killed Prosecutor Pued,

216
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:38,763
and Por tried to kill Mr Tan.

217
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,434
Didn't expect...

218
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:46,635
that those brothers would try
to take each other's life one day.

219
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,864
(Call from Tan)

220
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:23,000
Tan.

221
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:26,320
Tan, where are you?

222
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,233
I'm coming back now.

223
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,472
Are you alright?

224
00:22:29,553 --> 00:22:30,432
I'm fine.

225
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm really worried about you.

226
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:33,720
I will be back soon.

227
00:22:35,294 --> 00:22:36,600
-Bun?
-Tan!

228
00:22:56,283 --> 00:22:57,123
Let me go!

229
00:22:58,563 --> 00:22:59,523
Let me go!

230
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:00,738
Let me go!

231
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:06,569
How did you manage
the transportation of the girls...

232
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:08,923
into the country this time?

233
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:14,080
The INCB, they just bothered with setting
up checkpoints to monitor narcotics.

234
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,260
They didn't coordinate with me.

235
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:18,520
So it was intercepted
during the customs check.

236
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:24,399
In that case,

237
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,400
we should change the route.

238
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:28,200
But there will be no more problems, right?

239
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,250
There shouldn't be any
more mistakes this time.

240
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:32,760
I've already made the arrangements.

241
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:34,107
Very good.

242
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,800
There are only the nosy doctor
and the nosy teacher now.

243
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:39,880
How is it going in that matter?

244
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:43,640
I don't know what happened.

245
00:23:43,876 --> 00:23:46,581
How could Por let them get away?

246
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:49,541
But don't worry.

247
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,040
I have another plan.

248
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,200
Deal with them quietly.

249
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:57,672
Once they are dealt with,

250
00:23:57,762 --> 00:23:59,560
everything will be back to normal.

251
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,081
Yeah.

252
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:49,307
Go in!

253
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:07,763
Nam?

254
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:10,339
Nam?

255
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:13,983
Nam.

256
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:17,480
-Are you okay?
-What?

257
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:19,407
What are you doing?

258
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:23,160
They made you do the things
you had mentioned again, right?

259
00:25:25,331 --> 00:25:27,480
Yeah, but I don't remember.

260
00:25:29,906 --> 00:25:31,680
Can't you reject them?

261
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:34,920
Brother, look at the marks on my face.

262
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,410
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

263
00:25:45,954 --> 00:25:47,314
Are you crazy? How can we leave?

264
00:25:54,995 --> 00:25:55,875
Trust me.

265
00:25:57,587 --> 00:26:00,240
But you need to help
me untie this rope first.

266
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,370
Hurry.

267
00:26:20,483 --> 00:26:22,403
It's so tight. So annoying.

268
00:26:59,187 --> 00:27:01,360
-What?
-Get up.

269
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,005
Hurry.

270
00:27:06,594 --> 00:27:07,754
Wait here.

271
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:33,634
How did you do it?

272
00:27:56,227 --> 00:27:57,067
Commander Tung.

273
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,040
Why did you bring me here?

274
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:12,786
This is where Miss Jane liked to come.

275
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,960
Stop!

276
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,280
Go back.

277
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:30,040
Go back!

278
00:28:31,138 --> 00:28:31,978
Back off!

279
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:35,843
Calm down, Mr Tan.

280
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:37,754
Aren't you suspicious at all?

281
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:39,660
Why I brought you here?

282
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:44,193
You have to do something for me.

283
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,067
I won't help you with anything.

284
00:28:46,148 --> 00:28:48,056
Don't refuse so quickly.

285
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,370
That? Nam?

286
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:58,698
Do you still refuse?

287
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:06,699
What mission?

288
00:29:08,228 --> 00:29:09,348
Kill Dr Bun.

289
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,800
There will be many important people
coming here today.

290
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:22,351
Take good care of them.

291
00:29:22,432 --> 00:29:23,760
Alright.

292
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:29,680
Inspector.

293
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:31,480
Officer Yord.

294
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:37,315
We're here to pick up the female workers
we brought here yesterday.

295
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,160
Didn't the inspector say yesterday...

296
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,220
that the girls would
stay here for a while?

297
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,160
We got new orders.

298
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,808
The Anti-Human Trafficking Department
contacted us.

299
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:49,840
They said they would
take care of all the workers.

300
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:54,160
Did the police draw a conclusion?

301
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:56,360
Is it a human trafficking case,

302
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:58,680
or transportation of
undocumented immigrants?

303
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:00,532
Not yet.

304
00:30:01,323 --> 00:30:03,321
But we are doing our best to investigate.

305
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:04,320
Doing your best?

306
00:30:05,691 --> 00:30:07,400
Doing your best as
you did for Jane's case?

307
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:09,476
No progress at all.

308
00:30:12,692 --> 00:30:14,892
We do our best for every case, Miss Rung.

309
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:18,684
I will try to believe that.

310
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:21,908
So...

311
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,120
I'll tell the staff to bring
them out in a while.

312
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:28,004
Thank you.

313
00:30:48,395 --> 00:30:49,975
You help me to kill Dr Bun.

314
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:53,160
Then I'll release them.

315
00:30:57,797 --> 00:31:01,184
But if Dr Bun is not
dead within 12 hours,

316
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:04,600
you know what will happen.

317
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:04,756
Tan!

318
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:09,444
Tan! Tan!

319
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:15,520
I thought I would never see you again.

320
00:32:18,044 --> 00:32:19,124
You see me now.

321
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:22,868
I'm here.

322
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:27,996
Didn't you say you would be back soon?

323
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:32,077
Everything's alright.

324
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,080
I'm in pain.

325
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,040
Don't cry.

326
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:53,600
Are you injured?

327
00:32:54,787 --> 00:32:55,979
I'm here.

328
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:58,400
I'm fine.

329
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,840
What did Por say?

330
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,275
He didn't believe me.

331
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,520
He told me to find evidence.

332
00:33:15,988 --> 00:33:17,523
Where have you been all this time?

333
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:20,805
Commander Tung caught me.

334
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,400
He also captured Nam and That.

335
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,640
He said he would kill Nam and That.

336
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:39,240
What should we do?

337
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,960
The only way to help Nam and That...

338
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:47,760
is...

339
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,480
I kill you.

340
00:35:15,356 --> 00:35:16,196
Tan!

341
00:35:19,027 --> 00:35:20,120
I love you, Dr Bun.

342
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,600
I love you too!

343
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,820

(Next episode preview)

345
00:38:05,144 --> 00:38:06,824
Commander, what's the situation?

346
00:38:09,335 --> 00:38:11,760
Tan escaped.

347
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:13,269
Then he took Dr Bun hostage.

348
00:38:14,482 --> 00:38:15,880
We need to put him on the wanted list.

349
00:38:16,566 --> 00:38:20,148
The police and the water rescue team are
sparing no effort to conduct the search.

350
00:38:20,228 --> 00:38:21,800
We hope they will find the body soon.

351
00:38:29,794 --> 00:38:31,111
I didn't expect...

352
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:34,080
Dr Bun would really die.

353
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,480
With a fall like that,

354
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,688
it's impossible to survive.
