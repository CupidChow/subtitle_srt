1
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,260
Why did you do that?

2
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,840
It's not like you don't know how powerful they are!

3
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,910
Of course I know!

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,610
They are so powerful
that they made you sell me to them!

5
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,140
Jane, we've talked about this.

6
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,340
Yes.

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,310
And I don’t want to mention it again.

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,260
Go back and apologize to them!

9
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,760
And stop having these stupid ideas!

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,740
I won't stop!

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,860
I've made my decision! I will do the right thing!

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,140
Trust me.

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,540
You don't want to do that.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,310
I do.

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,910
Because I'm not afraid of them like you are.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,510
I'm worried about you.

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,660
You should worry about yourself.

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,840
Because from now on,

19
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,260
you will never have their support again.

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,810
You must be very scared.

21
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,790
Because you

22
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,690
are just a nobody.

23
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,560
Jane!

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,560
You are so useless that you can't survive
without the support of others!

25
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:08,060
=Manner of Death=

26
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,500
=Episode 7=

27
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,540
Bun.

28
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,410
Congressman Songchai

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,910
and Commander Tung.

30
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,040
Pued actually sacrificed Jane
for their entertainment!

31
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,090
It looks like an orgy even.

32
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,890
An orgy involving methamphetamine!

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,490
As well as sexual abuse!

34
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,360
Perhaps Jane wasn't carrying Pued's child,

35
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,110
but...

36
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,210
I can't even imagine

37
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,360
what shocking secrets that SD card would reveal

38
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,690
if all the files and data were recovered.

39
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,140
If we had managed to get our hands
on Pat’s laptop that day,

40
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,560
we might have been able to get more information.

41
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,510
(Welcome to Viangpha Mork Police Station)

42
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,640
Officer, my friend Nam is missing!

43
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,710
Aren't you going to look for her?

44
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,860
Sorn, calm down.

45
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:12,910
Buddy,

46
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,340
I often can't reach my friends either.

47
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,560
If I start an investigation at your request,

48
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,360
would I need to start an investigation

49
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,390
every time a person reports
that he can't contact someone else?

50
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,060
But I'm telling you the truth, sir!

51
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,090
My friend was kidnapped!

52
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,860
I hadn't been able to reach her for days!

53
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,390
What's going on?

54
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,690
-These two...
-This police officer won't handle my report!

55
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,210
Nam has been missing for several days.

56
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,010
Maybe your friend just went out to have fun.

57
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,440
If she had just gone out to have fun,

58
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,860
I wouldn't have come here.

59
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,740
You got to believe me, sir.

60
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,460
Sorawit, without instructions from above,

61
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,210
the police here won't get down to business.

62
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,390
It looks like you really hate the police.

63
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,690
I'd never hate the police who help the people.

64
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,940
So...

65
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,960
Pat's autopsy report.

66
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,275
Please hand it to the police who help the people.

67
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,090
What are you doing here?

68
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,440
I brought Sorawit here.

69
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,290
He asked me to accompany him.

70
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,740
Is that the only reason you came here?

71
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,910
Of course!

72
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,390
What other reasons could there be?

73
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,710
Sorawit, you still can't reach Nam?

74
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,740
I haven't been able to contact her

75
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,390
since that day I saw her in the hospital.

76
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,310
Doctor, do you know whose car she got in that day?

77
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,260
I'm not sure, either.

78
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,360
But I saw a black van.

79
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,090
A black van?

80
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,940
Was the license plate number nine?

81
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,640
I am not sure.

82
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,010
I guess that must be it.

83
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,440
A black van.

84
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,840
What should we do next?

85
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,890
About Nam?

86
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,010
Yeah.

87
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,190
You don't need to worry.

88
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,490
I'll check that license plate for you.

89
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,360
Alright?

90
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,240
Do you mean it?

91
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,990
Of course I do, when did I ever lie to you?

92
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,940
Thank you!

93
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,010
You are amazing!

94
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,240
You truly are Dam's guy.

95
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,390
If you ask your men to help with the search,

96
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,310
I'm sure she'll soon be found!

97
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,740
You get excited so easily.

98
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,460
I'm serious!

99
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,190
Wow, it looks great.

100
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,140
You really want to dig in, don't you?

101
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,910
Where did you learn to cook this?

102
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,990
I saw it on YouTube.

103
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,440
Are the survivors friends
with the ones in the trash can?

104
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,790
Jeez.

105
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,910
It's only human to make some small mistakes.

106
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,010
I'll leave you to it. I'm waiting to eat.

107
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,590
It'll be done soon. Just wait a little longer.

108
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,360
Done. Try it.

109
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,840
Chicken can't be eaten raw.

110
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,760
I think I've fried them long enough.

111
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,190
Put it back and fry it longer.

112
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,440
Or do you want to eat them raw?

113
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,360
It's still red.

114
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,510
What are you thinking about?

115
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,760
You could tell?

116
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,190
It'd be weird if I couldn't tell.

117
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,210
You were in quite a daze.

118
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,340
It's about Nam.

119
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,210
I'm worried she will end up like Pat.

120
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,060
It's useless to think about it too much right now.

121
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,890
I know but I just can't help it.

122
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,590
I don't know if the police
who didn't want us to know about this are behind it.

123
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,360
Or if the people who had killed Jane

124
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,540
caught Nam.

125
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,510
I should've insisted on
getting to the bottom of it today.

126
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,960
I almost got close to the truth.

127
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,310
Anyway, now we have important clues.

128
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,640
Pat's laptop,

129
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,240
we know where it is.

130
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,490
So what?

131
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,560
Do you intend to break into the police station?

132
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,060
I have an idea.

133
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,790
(Big Brother)

134
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,340
Do you know what you want to eat yet?

135
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,790
I'm okay with anything.

136
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,690
I just wanted to get out for a change of scenery.

137
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,960
I'll choose then.

138
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,840
(The Mist)

139
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,410
Let's start. It's my treat.

140
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,240
You are such a good business partner.

141
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,610
The business partner also has to pay.

142
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,910
Why did you order so many things?

143
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,090
Because the taste of the food

144
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,490
is quite important to the partner of this pub.

145
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,660
So every dish is delicious.

146
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,410
I didn't know what to order,

147
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,690
so I ordered a bit more.

148
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,360
I don't see any stuffed eggs.

149
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,890
I'll wait

150
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,160
for you to make that for me.

151
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,940
You're getting addicted, aren't you?

152
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,560
Was the one

153
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,010
who called you in the car your brother?

154
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,210
My half brother.

155
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,910
Why didn't you answer the call?

156
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,810
It would only be something troublesome.

157
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
You should understand that.

158
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,310
Of course I understand.

159
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,860
Here, let's order some beer.

160
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,640
To those unimportant family members.

161
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,890
To the hapless big brother.

162
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,475
Hey, beauty.

163
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,275
What a coincidence. How have you been?

164
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:53,650
Let's have a toast.

165
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:58,420
Hey! What are you doing?

166
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,070
Hey! Hey!

167
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,050
What are you doing?

168
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,990
Is he causing trouble everywhere all day?

169
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,360
That is working.

170
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,760
Working?

171
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,140
Yes.

172
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,360
Whenever someone gets drunk and causes trouble,

173
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,390
That will come and resolve it.

174
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,290
So That is working for you?

175
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,860
No.

176
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,540
He is working for Por.

177
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,540
I forgot all about that.

178
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,260
If you work for Por,

179
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,590
that means you also know Dam.

180
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,210
I've heard that name before.

181
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,760
In that case,

182
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,960
can you check it for me?

183
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,910
Perhaps,

184
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,660
Dam is probably the murderer behind all this.

185
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,740
Viangpha Mork is a small town.

186
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,540
How many people with power could there be?

187
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,040
Sure.

188
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,840
I will help you collect information later.

189
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,560
Thank you.

190
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,310
We'll be late, Tan.

191
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,440
Just a minute. I'm almost ready.

192
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,790
Have you eaten anything?

193
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,910
Not yet. I'm waiting for you, ain't I?

194
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,660
This watch...

195
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,490
What's wrong?

196
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,090
It looks familiar.

197
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,140
Like I've seen it somewhere before.

198
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,240
How could you?

199
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,710
This is a limited edition.

200
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,360
I wouldn't dare to wear this watch

201
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,810
if my dad didn't buy it for me.

202
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,890
It looks really nice.

203
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,360
Of course. It’s a limited edition.

204
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,640
Let's go.

205
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:37,337
Do you want to go?

206
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,040
I'm not going.

207
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,740
See you tomorrow.

208
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,790
Okay, bye bye.

209
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,240
Bye bye.

210
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,110
Doctor!

211
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,890
By the way... I wanted to ask you something.

212
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,540
I saw that you and That get along really well.

213
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,610
Er...

214
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,360
Not that well, actually.

215
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,240
Do you know anything about That?

216
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,960
Know anything about him? What do you mean, Doctor?

217
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,710
For example... where his home is?

218
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,940
What he usually does in his spare time?

219
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,810
Oh.

220
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,390
As far as I know,

221
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,960
he works for Por and Dam.

222
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,810
He lives behind the Viangpha Mork Market.

223
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,010
He usually works at The Mist at night.

224
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,490
He gets up very late during the day,
at about two in the afternoon.

225
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,010
And you say you don't know him that well?

226
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,540
Well... I know him a little.

227
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,390
You said before

228
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,740
that Dam was a very dangerous person.

229
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,090
And That works for him.

230
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,290
So why did you want to befriend him?

231
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,460
It might be a misunderstanding on my part.

232
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,890
I don't know anything about Dam.

233
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,660
But That is not a bad guy.

234
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,660
Doctor, is there something wrong?

235
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,790
Oh.

236
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,110
I just...

237
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,840
have some doubts about That.

238
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,610
Doubts like what?

239
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,390
Do you need me to ask him something?

240
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,960
It's okay.

241
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,960
But you should be careful, Sorawit.

242
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,140
Be careful?

243
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,190
I think he might not be that good of a person.

244
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,790
Doctor, are you sure?

245
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,840
You should stay away from him.

246
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,240
Are there any other findings, Gun?

247
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,840
I've checked everything, Inspector.

248
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,660
I only saw some general news and manuscripts.

249
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,990
What about the call log of Pat's phone, Inspector?

250
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,260
No abnormality has been found so far.

(Incoming)(Outgoing)

252
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,440
I think I found the abnormality.

(License Plate: SS 9 Chiang Mai)

255
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,090
What did you find out?

256
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,260
I found the car you had told me to follow.

257
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,690
Okay, okay, I'll be there immediately.

258
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,090
Hey, buddy!

259
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,860
You've been following me for a while now.

260
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,990
What's the matter?

261
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,740
What are you talking about?

262
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,660
I didn't follow you.

263
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,160
You don't have to lie to me.

264
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,660
I'm being honest. You just don't believe me.

265
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,910
What do you want?

266
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,790
Watch your manners!

267
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,310
Hey, calm down.

268
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,540
Don't cause the kid trouble.

269
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,110
Yes, Your Excellency.

270
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,910
Congressman Songchai.

271
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,210
Yes, it's me.

272
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,860
Thank you for helping me out.

273
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,110
That big brother
would have really taught me a lesson.

274
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,860
So why did you follow the car for so long?

275
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,990
I didn't follow your car.

276
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,990
It's like this... I just came here to spend some money.

277
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,640
Perhaps we just happened to go on the same way.

278
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:08,960
Let's go in together then.

279
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,390
I checked out Pat's bank account.

280
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,760
I noticed that before he died,

281
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,890
a hundred thousand baht were transferred
from your account to his account.

282
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,160
Yes, I sent him that money.

283
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,990
What was it for?

284
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Pat told me

285
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,540
that he had important evidence about Jane's case.

286
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,890
If I gave money to him,
he would send me the evidence.

287
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,290
What evidence?

288
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,617
I don't know either.

289
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,040
He didn't send it to me.

290
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,210
It's like

291
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,660
the murderer knew

292
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,110
that Pat was going to send me the evidence,

293
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,790
so they killed him.

294
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,690
Do you think Pat's death

295
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,610
is related to the murder of Ms. Jane?

296
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,310
I think so.

297
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,060
I don't understand

298
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,910
why Jane's case

299
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:32,960
would end up involving so many things.

300
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,260
One way or another,

301
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,360
please follow up on the investigation.

302
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,660
I will.

303
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,110
If I find out that Pat had any evidence
on Jane's case,

304
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,410
I will notify you immediately.

305
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,060
Thank you.

306
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,210
Please tell me if you need any help from me.

307
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,510
I will.

308

(Viangpha Mork Police Station)

309
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,490
How is it going, Inspector?

310
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,990
Any progress?

311
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,210
Yes.

312
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,940
This matter is related to the case of Ms. Jane.

313
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,660
Ms. Jane's case?

314
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,140
Is there anything on the laptop
that is related to Ms. Jane?

315
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,540
Didn't find anything.

316
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Nothing at all?

317
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,190
Give it to me.

318
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,240
Yes, Chief.

319
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,140
Do you have Pat's laptop?

320
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,890
Yes.

321
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,240
Bring it to me.

322
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,260
Tonight?

323
00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:01,810
Tonight would be inconvenient.

324
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,890
Bring it to my house tomorrow morning.

325
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,810
I think I won't be at the police station.

326
00:22:07,874 --> 00:22:08,377
Yes, sir.

327
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,410
You stopped looking?

328
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,390
Yeah.

329
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,260
Will this really work, Tan?

330
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,910
Trust me.

331
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,010
Come on.

332
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,120
Okay, okay, the laptop is here.

333
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,810
What are you doing?
Why didn't you turn off your phone?

334
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,410
Sorry.

335
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,490
What are you doing?

336
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,510
Bun, come here!

337
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,940
Got it! Go!

338
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,010

Hey, stop right there!

340
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,410
Oh you!

341
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,160
We almost got caught!

342
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,010
When you smashed the window,

343
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,590
I almost thought we couldn't get away.

344
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,690
Yeah, you looked so flustered.

345
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,490
Do you want to start it?

346
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,090
Let's do it.

347
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,090
Your hand is so warm.

348
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,840
Maybe it's because I'm too nervous.

349
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
You... You smell so good.

350
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,740
Still haven't had enough?

351
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,790
It's not morning yet.

352
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,910
I'll be right back.

353
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,260
Why do you like peeking
at other people's screens so much?

354
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,310
Any new findings?

355
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,240
Was it a waste of energy again?

356
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,260
It wasn't.

357
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,760
Bro!

358
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,160
What is it?

359
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,940
Pat isn't dead yet, bro!

360
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,860
(You'll never shut me up. Hurry up
and disclose the new evidence of Ms. Jane's murder)

361
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,710
Stupid! How could you let him take the laptop!

362
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
I'm sorry.

363
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,190
You idiot!

364
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,560
Hurry up and get it back!

365
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,210
Yes, sir.

366
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,540
I will handle it as quickly as possible.

367
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,490
Rung, is there a particular reason

368
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,990
why you asked me to come here?

369
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,060
I just wanted to invite you to have a meal with me.

370
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,440
I think it's more than that.

371
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,460
You know it well.

372
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,690
Well...

373
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,840
I have something to ask you.

374
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,210
Did you do this?

375
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,410
Why do you think it's me?

376
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,090
Because only Pued and you

377
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,860
are Jane's friends.

378
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,940
If it wasn't Pued,

379
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,760
only you

380
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,810
could have done this.

381
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,990
Answer me, Bun.

382
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,740
Actually, I didn't want to ask you about this.

383
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,260
I wanted to ask you about Pat.

384
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,960
About Pat?

385
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,760
Before Pat died,

386
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,390
Pat told me

387
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,790
that he had important evidence on Jane's case.

388
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,760
Is it the same evidence as what you've posted?

389
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,590
How did you get it?

390
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,390
I can't tell you, Rung.

391
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,090
You know that Pat is dead.

392
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,060
If I really knew something

393
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,090
and told you about it,

394
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,740
you'd be in danger, too.

395
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,690
But if it's related to Jane,

396
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,490
I'm willing to take the risk, Bun.

397
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,390
Please wait a bit longer, Rung.

398
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,510
Bun.

399
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,640
If I can help you with anything,

400
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,040
you may tell me.

401
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,940
If it's for Jane,

402
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,310
I'm willing to do anything.

403
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,960
Do you understand?

404
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,440
Okay, Rung.

405
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,990
What happened?

406
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,210
I will be back a bit later tonight.

407
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,710
There's something at the pub I need to handle.

408
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,340
Bun? Bun?

409
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,160
Oh, okay. I heard you.

410
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,290
Don't forget to eat.

411
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:19,790
Okay.

412
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,890
And come back as soon as you're done.

413
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,840
So you care about me?

414
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,110
Not at all.

415
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,955
But I care about you.

416
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,990
I will be home soon.

417
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,590
See you later.

418
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,360
What did you do?

419
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,310
What did you do to my brother?

420
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:12,860
Bun?

421
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,360
Bun? Bun?

422
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,840
So it's you, Dam.

423
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,580
=Manner of Death=

424
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:58,840
Bro.

425
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,610
Where have you been all day?

426
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,140
I couldn't reach you by phone.

427
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,310
I went to find evidence about the van.

428
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,510
You did?

429
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,660
I thought you got taken away by that van.

430
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,540
Nonsense.

431
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,060
I'd like to pay, how much is it?

432
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,260
Sixty baht.

433
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:21,810
I'll pay it.

434
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,228
-Here. Sixty.
-Thank you.

435
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
What are you doing?

436
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,310
Why do you smell so good today?

437
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,660
It might be the smell of the massage oil.

438
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,590
Where did you go for a massage?

439
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,190
In Viang Maya.

440
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,210
What are you looking at?

441
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,514
You seem so tired today.

442
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,610
I'm quite tired.

443
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,290
Why?

444
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,440
The massage therapist must be really good, right?

445
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,940
Nonsense. I really did get a massage.

446
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,790
It's not just a message

447
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,510
you get at that place, is it?

448
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,210
You got the wrong idea.

449
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,660
Bro, you are such a bad guy.

450
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,340
You're a bad guy just as the doctor said.

451
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,460
I really went to look for clues.

452
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,210
The van went there.

453
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,510
So you had to use the service too

454
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,990
to follow them closely? Is that it?

455
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:20,940
Only that way is authentic enough.

456
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,160
Oh, oh. I believe you. I believe you.

457
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,960
You don't believe me, do you?

458
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,160
I already told you, I believe you.

459
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,790
You don't. I can tell.

460
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,210
What's the matter, are you jealous of me?

461
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,260
Who would be jealous of you?

462
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,990
Nonsense!

463
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,490
You are jealous of me.

464
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,910
What are you doing?

465
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,910
(Next episode preview)

466
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,690
The doctor got treated like this

467
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,560
when he just returned to Viangpha Mork?

468
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,560
Maybe it's because someone here
can't accept the facts.

469
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,390
I think I know who did it.

470
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,340
Then I hope you can catch him soon.

471
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,360
-Sorn?
-Huh?

472
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,410
There!

473
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,810
Big Brother, you don't have to worry.

474
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,940
This time,

475
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,950
I will track down Pued myself.
