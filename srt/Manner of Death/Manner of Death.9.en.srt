1
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,980
(Eight years ago)

2
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,900
What's wrong, Bro?

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,060
Did you get dumped?
Is that why you remembered to call me?

4
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,540
Would I ever be dumped?

5
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,980
I'm the one who dumps others.

6
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,260
So why did you call me?

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,940
I'm back in Viangpha Mork.

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,540
Oh, so the sight of the town
made you miss me?

9
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,660
That sentence makes me cringe.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,660
I miss it too.

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,020
But it's Viangpha Mork that I miss,
not you.

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,580
I know.

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,180
If you have time,
come back and have a look.

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,140
Jane wants to see you too.

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,980
I probably won't be able
to go back for a long time.

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,780
Why don't you come and visit me?

17
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,140
Yeah, I'll definitely do that.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,380
Did I tell you that my little brother
is attending the same university as you?

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,380
You have a little brother?

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,540
Yeah. But he is my relative's son.

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,660
We're close like brothers.

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,900
Which department is he in?

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,060
I'm not sure.

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,100
I need to hang up. Amm is calling me.

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,220
Pued?

26
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,580
Oh, damn.

27
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,580
I'm late, I'm late.

28
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,920
=Manner of Death=

29
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,041
(Something is up.
Need to go to my brother.)

30
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:47,583
(He doesn't want to wait any longer.)

31
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,380
Brother? Brother?

32
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,580
Wake up!

33
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:24,140
Officer Yord, take him outside.

34
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,380
Pued?

35
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,460
I'm sorry for your loss.

36
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,860
Give me a pair of gloves.

37
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,980
A bruised face.

38
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,380
The deceased died less than an hour ago.

39
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,940
A syringe was found next to the body.

40
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,820
Please give me a hand.

41
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,020
There's an injection site
on the back of his shoulder.

42
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,780
-Dr. Oat, you'll be taking pictures.
-Okay.

43
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,060
The deceased died of heart failure.

44
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,500
There are several bruises on the body.

45
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,460
The bruises have started to change color.

46
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,860
They probably formed
during the last one or two days.

47
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,660
Fractures on the third and fourth rib.

48
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,860
Probably caused by cardiac compression.

49
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,140
An injection site was found
on the right shoulder.

50
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,020
Doctor, is this method
of injecting drugs...

51
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,260
consistent with the way
how Ms. Jane's murderer treated her?

52
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,440
No.

53
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,780
We found a bottle
of adrenaline on the scene.

54
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,480
(Adrenaline:
a hormone secreted due to tension,)

55
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,200
(Etc.; used as medication
to treat cardiac arrest)

56
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,740
Doctor.

57
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,060
What is it?

58
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,980
The patient in Room 105 has woken up.

59
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,540
He is clamoring to see you.

60
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,340
-Sorawit!
-Doctor.

61
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,380
Take it easy.

62
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,280
I...

63
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,940
I was being chased
by someone with a gun.

64
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,620
You were shot?

65
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,680
Yes.

66
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:53,040
That and I followed
the black van that day.

67
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,180
Was it the one that picked up Nam?

68
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,300
Yes.

69
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,820
The van led us off the main road
and into the woods.

70
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,680
And then we saw a house.

71
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,460
A house?

72
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,180
It was a big house.

73
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,060
It was hidden in the woods.

74
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,920
Then suddenly, someone came out with a gun
and chased after us.

75
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,980
What did you say?

76
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,180
He chased after us.

77
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,040
That told me to run away
in another direction.

78
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,180
Then...

79
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,580
Where is That?

80
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,660
How is he?

81
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,260
There is no admission record yet.
He is probably fine.

82
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,760
You have to call the police, Doctor.

83
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,780
Is the patient awake?

84
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,020
Yes.

85
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,420
Don't tell the police anything for now.
Just say that you were hit by a car.

86
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Why?

87
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,260
Trust me. We can't trust anyone right now.

88
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,340
How are you feeling?

89
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,380
Can you tell me what happened?

90
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,260
There are traces of a fight on yours
and Pued's body.

91
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,980
Did you engage in a physical conflict
with Prosecutor Pued?

92
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,540
Yes.

93
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,420
We had a little argument yesterday.

94
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,780
What argument?

95
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,540
You don't need to know about it.

96
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,040
Because my brother and I...

97
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,940
have had quarrels since we were young.

98
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,100
We made up quickly
after the fight yesterday.

99
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,220
In other words, after you had left,

100
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,340
Prosecutor Pued's situation
was still normal?

101
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,081
If you don't count the bruise on his mouth
that I gave him,

102
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:51,521
everything was normal.

103
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,900
He called me...

104
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,260
and asked me to bring Dr. Bun to him.

105
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,800
But Dr. Bun had a patient.

106
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,740
So he asked me to pick him up
and take him to Dr. Bun.

107
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,560
If you don't believe me,
you can check it out.

108
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,340
Check if he did call me.

109
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,380
When I arrived,

110
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,860
he was already dead.

111
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,460
I called an ambulance.

112
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,140
I tried to resuscitate him.

113
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,140
But it didn't work.

114
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,580
The police found his body
in your territory.

115
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,980
Mr. Tan was on the scene.

116
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,260
There were traces of a fight
on both him and the deceased.

117
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,900
But the real cause of death...

118
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,220
should be the injection
of cardiac stimulants.

119
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,500
When the police arrived at the scene,

120
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,980
Mr. Tan was holding a syringe.

121
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,180
Where was the syringe?

122
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,300
I saw it on the floor,
so I picked it up to have a closer look.

123
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,180
Brother.

124
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,260
Why did you kill Pued?

125
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,060
I didn't kill him.

126
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,460
If it's not you,
who else could have done it?

127
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,580
The police deny bail in this case, Doctor.

128
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,700
Why?

129
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,180
A lot of evidence indicates
that it was murder.

130
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,460
If we don't keep the suspect
under surveillance,

131
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,420
the suspect will likely flee.

132
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,260
But in my opinion,
there is no clear evidence.

133
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,560
Of course there is.

134
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:53,860
The injection site
and symptoms of heart failure.

135
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,860
The evidence is sufficient to prove...

136
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,700
that the deceased died from an injection
of cardiac stimulants.

137
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,020
Do you know who knows
that the deceased had a heart disease?

138
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,580
Only you and I
know about his heart disease!

139
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,020
Officer Gun, take the suspect away!

140
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,860
Calm down, Por!

141
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,860
This makes it even clearer
that Mr. Tan may be the murderer.

142
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,660
I surmise that after Mr. Tan
had killed Ms. Jane,

143
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,700
he captured Prosecutor Pued
and cruelly locked him up.

144
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,460
Finally, he killed Pued.

145
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,940
He murdered them mainly out of jealousy.

146
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,060
Jealous of whom?

147
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,580
Ms. Jane.

148
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,480
After you two had the fight,

149
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,540
you were irritated
and was full of hatred all night.

150
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,860
So you decided to kill him
by injecting drugs into.

151
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,980
Also, your practice of injecting drugs...

152
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,860
is completely consistent
with Ms. Jane's murder.

153
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,780
Perhaps...

154
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,260
you are Ms. Jane's murderer.

155
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,980
But I don't think so.

156
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,700
Mr. Tan and Ms. Jane were just friends.

157
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,620
As for Prosecutor Pued,
he decided to stay there himself.

158
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,840
He did it to prevent me
from pursuing this case.

159
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,180
This is just Mr. Tan's one-sided account.

160
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,980
There's something else
that I find suspicious.

161
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,460
Who called the police?

162
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,900
Why did the police come
to the scene so quickly?

163
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,260
We got a report...

164
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,260
that someone heard a loud noise
coming from that house.

165
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,380
Can anyone hear the sound
coming from a house in the woods?

166
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,340
Pued's mobile phone also went missing.

167
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,780
Mr. Tan hid it away.

168
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,060
If he wanted to hide something,

169
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,100
wouldn't he have hidden the needle
and the syringe, too?

170
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,500
If you ask me, Doctor,

171
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,340
you'd better save this for
the court hearing when you bail him out.

(Viangpha Mork Police Station)

173
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,220
Brother.

174
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,960
Brother!

175
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,580
The police closed the case
and said you were the murderer!

176
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,180
Just like how they closed Jane's case
by saying she had committed suicide?

177
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,700
Don't get smart with me!

178
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,180
If not you, who else could have done it?

179
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,060
I don't know why you did it.

180
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,660
But if you get out of prison,
I won't let you get away with it!

181
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,060
Let me go!

182
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,060
I'm not going!

183
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:48,565
This...

184
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
What happened?

185
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,780
Let me go!

186
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:01,102
Hey!

187
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,580
Let me go!

188
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,420
Nam?

189
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,980
That.

190
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,620
Why are you here?

191
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,140
That's what I'm supposed to ask.
Why are you here?

192
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,300
Where have you been?

193
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,380
What happened to you?

194
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,300
Tell me about it.

195
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,300
It's a long story.

196
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,620
About that girl, Nam...

197
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,740
How do you plan to resolve it?

198
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,780
The same as always.

199
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,860
After things have been settled,

200
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,460
I'll send her away on a ship.

201
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,020
Yeah.

202
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,020
As for the dude,

203
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,340
he seems to be working for Por.

204
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,820
Does Por already know everything?

205
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,100
What about Prosecutor Pued's case?

206
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,740
How's it going?

207
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,780
They're closing the case.

208
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,520
It'll be sent to the prosecution tomorrow.

209
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,660
After that,
the case will be perfectly closed.

210
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,260
I've prepared for a conference
on the case.

211
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,580
But you'd better be careful.

212
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,060
Because we don't know what Mr. Tan knows.

213
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,780
If he has disclosed something,

214
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,400
it'll be difficult for us
to stop the spread of information.

215
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,380
I don't think he knows anything.

216
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,861
If he had known something,

217
00:18:51,941 --> 00:18:53,821
he would have said it
before he was arrested.

218
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,780
But you don't have to worry.

219
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,740
Even if he knows something,
he won't be alive for long.

220
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,180
It seems as if Pued is just asleep.

221
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,380
This guy, Pued.

222
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,860
He never had conflicts with anyone.

223
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,780
No matter who caused him trouble,

224
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,940
he always backed down first.

225
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,420
I never thought...

226
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,580
that Pued would die like this.

227
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,860
I'm sorry for your loss.

228
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,620
How did the autopsy go?

229
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,101
The autopsy results are obvious.

230
00:20:57,181 --> 00:21:00,101
Pued died from an injection
of cardiac stimulants.

231
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,080
In other words,

232
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,460
the murderer intentionally caused Pued
to die from heart failure?

233
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
Yes.

234
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,420
The brute treated Pued like this.

235
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,580
He must have hated Pued so much!

236
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
Right.

237
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,260
The murderer must have really hated Pued.

238
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,140
I don't understand it.

239
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,500
Why would Tan hate Pued so much?

240
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,400
Because the person he hates...

241
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,060
should be me.

242
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,500
So Tan might not be the murderer.

243
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,660
But all the evidence...

244
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,940
points to Tan, Doctor.

245
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,860
Hear me out.

246
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,540
There is still a lot of evidence
that proves Tan is not the murderer.

247
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,580
(Welcome to Viangpha Mork Police Station)

248
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,700
Tan!

249
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,260
Who did this to you?

250
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,980
There happened to be some little conflict.

251
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,860
Did no one stop it?

252
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,620
What about the police?

253
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,700
Perhaps the police sent them in.

254
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,520
I...

255
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,260
I can't imagine...

256
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,200
what would happen to you if you were sent
to a real prison.

257
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
It would be worse, I guess.

258
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,140
But you don't have to worry about me.

259
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
No matter what,

260
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,060
I'm the invincible Dam.

261
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,260
That's not funny at all.

262
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,540
How are you still in the mood to
joke around when you are hurt like this?

263
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,940
I will save you.

264
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,340
I promise.

265
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,500
Did you find it?

266
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,260
We have looked all around several times,
Inspector.

267
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,161
If we can't find it, it means
that the murderer must be trying...

268
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:30,101
to hide certain information on that phone.

269
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,500
If we can't find the phone, it means...

270
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,300
that Mr. Tan may not be the murderer.

271
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,220
What do you mean by that?

272
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,180
After we arrived here,

273
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:47,485
we arrested Mr. Tan immediately.

274
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,900
If Mr. Tan really was the murderer,

275
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,140
how did he have time to hide the phone?

276
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,860
It should be at least somewhere
around here.

277
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,380
Or perhaps there are...

278
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,220
more than one murderer.

279
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,740
If that's the case, why did Mr. Tan
cooperate when we arrested him?

280
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,260
He cooperated to make it easier
for the other person to escape.

281
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,420
(Viang Maya Spa)

282
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,140
Tan? He killed Pued?

283
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,820
I don't think that's possible.

284
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,900
Prosecutor Pued's case...

285
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,660
may be quite big in scope.

286
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,540
His mobile phone disappeared
from the scene.

287
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,740
It seems the murderer intended
to cover up some information.

288
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,300
Just like Pat's case.

289
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,021
What's even more suspicious,

290
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:57,501
why did the police arrive
at the scene so quickly?

291
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,061
And more importantly,

292
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:03,480
if it was really murder to silence him,

293
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,180
this case may be related to Jane's case.

294
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,540
It's related to Jane's case?

295
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,500
It's very likely.

296
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,580
Pued might know the truth
behind Jane's case.

297
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,940
That's why he was killed,
just as Pat was killed.

298
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,100
I feel like things
are getting more serious.

299
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,060
What are you going to do next?

300
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,500
I am at a loss myself.

301
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,380
That's why I came to you.

302
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,140
What do you want me to do to help you?

303
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,060
I want you to help me get Tan out of jail.

304
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,260
In that case...

305
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,180
I think I can help.

306

(Judge Suradaet Supannayot)

307
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,180
I didn't expect to see
my subordinate's murder case.

308
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,660
Are you sure Mr. Tan
isn't the real murderer?

309
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,580
Yes, I'm sure.

310
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,860
I'll help you, then.

311
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
Thank you.

312
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,260
This is my duty, Ms. Rungtiva.

313
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,620
I will never let anyone
become a scapegoat.

314
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,340
So the only thing left now
is to pay Tan's bail.

315
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,260
Thank you very much.

316
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,660
I'm so sorry.

317
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,780
You were unsuccessful in denying bail.

318
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,300
Didn't you say you don't like to rely
on connections?

319
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,460
I never said that.

320
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,940
I just don't like injustice.

321
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,220
I'll take my leave then.

322
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,500
Alright, let's go.

323
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,980
Thank you so much.

324
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,900
It's fine.

-Brother.
-Tan!

327
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,140
How did you get out?

328
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,500
I bailed him out.

329
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,380
This has nothing to do with you!

330
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,940
Pued and Tan are like my brothers!

331
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,680
When they're in trouble, I'll help them!

332
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,300
Did you say Pued is like your brother?

333
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,260
You know it's impossible for Tan
to kill Pued!

334
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,780
Brothers wouldn't do that.

335
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,300
You are his brother too.
Try to think that way.

336
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,420
But I've never thought of him
as my brother.

337
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,340
Whatever you please.

338
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,540
But Tan is like my brother.

339
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,340
I'd never let him get stuck in trouble.

340
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,580
I'd never let him become a scapegoat
for something he didn't do!

341
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,860
You can't run away forever, Tan.

342
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,260
What are you going to do to Tan?

343
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,900
You have no right to stop me!

344
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,561
I have no right to stop you,

345
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,521
but you can't stop the law, either!

346
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:27,300
I'm sure that someone
will stand by me and do the right thing.

347
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,900
Are you threatening me?

348
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,660
I'm just a woman.

349
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,100
I'm not as influential as you.

350
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,260
Rungtiva.

351
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,660
You and I are no different.

352
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,580
If there is nothing else, I'll be leaving.

353
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,900
Let's go.

354
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,260
Didn't you say you would protect me?

355
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,620
This time, I'll let you be the one
to protect me.

356
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,580
But only this time.

357
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:42,228
Ouch!

358
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
Be gentle.

359
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,400
I hope what you said is true.

360
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,900
Try to explain it to me.

361
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,460
What happened in Pued's house?

362
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,980
He called me.

363
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,220
He said he couldn't wait any longer.

364
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,520
He told me to pick him up
and then come to see you.

365
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,820
So I drove there quickly.

366
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,540
But when I arrived,

367
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:32,001
I saw him lying motionless on the floor.

368
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:34,441
I performed CPR on him.

369
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,100
But I only did it for a little while.

370
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,300
Then the police came in and arrested me.

371
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,140
Shortly afterwards, you got there too.

372
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,540
I think the person who called the police
might be the murderer.

373
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,020
Didn't you say you can handle it?

374
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,220
I am handling it.

375
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,220
You mean you're allowing him
to get released on bail?

376
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,300
Trust me.

377
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,900
For that young man,

378
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,740
staying in jail is safer than being free.

379
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,940
We don't even have
to do anything ourselves.

380
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,220
It's done.

381
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,820
Bun, it smells so good.

382
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,340
It's still hot.

383
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,860
Be careful.

384
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,180
Is that naem?

385
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,460
I used everything I found in the fridge.

386
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,660
-Bun.
-Hm?

387
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,340
It'd be even better...

388
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,580
if there were any sauces.

389
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,720
You upper-class people
eat very salty food.

390
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,260
I'll get the sauce.

391
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,900
-Get it yourself.
-Okay.

392
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,460
-Wait for me, Bun.
-Okay.

393
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,420
Tan?

394
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,540
Is something wrong, Tan?

395
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,700
Someone's here.

396
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,220
Get down!

397
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,060
What's going on, Tan?

398
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,940
Hide somewhere! Go! Hurry!

399
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,700
What did you do?

400
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,780
I hid the gun! Wait!

401
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,180
Tan! Catch it!

402
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,900
Go!

403
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,940
Go!

404
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,940
Go! Hurry!

405
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,180
You!

406
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,860
Tan!

407
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,860
Tan...

408
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,660
Go! Go! Hurry!

409
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,860
They're hot on our heels!

410
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,980
Watch the road, Bun.

411
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,100
They caught up with us!

412
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,220
Hurry, Bun!

413
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,540
-There is a red light ahead!
-Keep driving!

414
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,740
Hold on tight!

415
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,140
What's the matter with you?

416
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,660
I told you to bring him back!

417
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,980
Go and find him!

418
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,540
Who are they, Tan?

419
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,180
Por's men.

420
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,620
Why did they shoot at you?

421
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,940
Aren't you his little brother?

422
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,241
He has never thought of me
as a younger brother.

423
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:45,121
You know that our family is very "warm."

424
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,300
As warm as fire.

425
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,060
I think we got away.

426
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,980
Where do we go?

427
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,300
Let me drive.

428
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,180
Where is this place?

429
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,340
A house I bought.

430
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,420
Let me help you.

431
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,100
Thank you.

432
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,460
Are you thinking about something?

433
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,740
Don't you know?

434
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,940
I worry about you
just as much as you worry about me.

435
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,400
But you don't know
how much I worry about you.

436
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,060
Let's go upstairs.

437
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,620
I'm sorry.

438
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,620
Tan! Tan! What are you doing?

439
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:55,754
Hey!

440
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,060
Come back!

441
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,160
=Manner of Death=

442
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,180
When the police arrived at the scene,

443
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,060
all they found were bullets
and traces of a fight.

444
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,340
I want to take your men's statements.

445
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:38,525
Don't you know, Tan?

446
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:40,022
Once you come inside,

447
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,500
you won't be able to leave.

448
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,581
Deal with them. Keep them quiet.

449
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:46,981
I will.
