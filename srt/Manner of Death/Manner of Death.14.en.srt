1
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,381
You told me that if I hid here,
I'd be safe!

2
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,701
How am I safe?

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,280
That reporter died!

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,320
Because he wanted to report you, right?

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,200
And there is Bun's matter!

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,200
You said you only wanted to scare him off!

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,701
But what was that?
You clearly tried to kill him!

8
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:45,821
As for your plot against Bun,
stop it immediately!

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,920
Stop?

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,520
I think it's already gone out of control.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,880
And Jane, why did you kill her?

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,040
Things have got worse and worse
since the day Jane died, don't you know?

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,240
No!

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,400
You are the culprit, Pued.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,880
Since you abandoned me 10 years ago,
there has been no way back!

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,320
Rung...

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,880
Do you know?

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,280
Do you know how I felt...

19
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,320
when I saw you and Jane get together?

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
I'm with Jane now, Rung.

21
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:25,520
If my heart hurts this much,
I will make you feel even more painful!

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,520
You bitch!

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,920
You know it!

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,840
If you hadn't given Jane to those people,
nothing would have happened!

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,240
I'm a jerk! It's all my fault!

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,040
But if it's my fault,
you should get revenge on me!

27
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:39,520
Why did you go after Jane?

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,720
If Jane were still alive,

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,600
you wouldn't need to stand here
arguing with me.

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,200
You would be in prison long ago!

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,920
You can't just blame me.

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,600
It's because you wouldn't stop!
You're still doing that dirty business!

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,080
The business that has helped your career?

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,080
I don't want it anymore!

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,840
I will finish what Jane didn't finish.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,000
What are you planning to do?

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,600
I have a video of you killing Jane.

38
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,200
If you don't stop,

39
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,120
I will make it public.

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,000
-Do you dare?
-I have nothing to lose.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,440
All right!

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,200
Let's go down together then!

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,160
You are a monster.

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,200
If I'm a monster, what are you?

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,920
We are both the same!

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,120
Rung, you know Jane loved you
very much, didn't you?

47
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,960
=Manner of Death=

48
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,922
I'm here to interrogate you.

49
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:06,560
You are suspected of killing a policeman.

50
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,760
It's inconvenient to talk here.

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
You need to go with me.

52
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,781
I can't go with you.

53
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:16,400
I need to contact my lawyer first.

54
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,200
There's no need.

55
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,800
Do you think this will work?

56
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,800
This is our only option.

57
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,880
If we do this,

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,720
there will be no other options left.

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Even if we make the video public,
and Rungtiva gets arrested,

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,840
we'll still be criminals on the run.

61
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,240
It's like we're Hansel and Gretel
trying to fight the witch Rungtiva.

62
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,840
Not really.

63
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,520
Because I don't want to be your brother.

64
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,080
Who do you want to be then?

65
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,880
(Rung)

66
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
Are you ready to negotiate?

67
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,720
I'm ready.

68
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,200
Once we're cleared of suspicion,
we will delete the video immediately.

69
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,840
But there is no guarantee
that you will really delete it.

70
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,560
You may have a copy. Who knows?

71
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,680
We can't be sure...

72
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,480
that you won't cause us trouble anymore,
either.

73
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Let's change the terms.

74
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,880
Change it to what?

75
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,840
Hand that video over...

76
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,280
in exchange for Por's life.

77
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,960
Release the video! Don't worry about me!

78
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,880
Brother!

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,840
You guys decide it yourselves.

80
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,680
Let's upload the video.

81
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,160
We can't.

82
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,461
Do you want me to make a copy...

83
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,720
and give them the cell phone
in exchange for your brother?

84
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,320
If we do that,

85
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,381
we won't have a chance to come back
and upload the video.

86
00:06:56,461 --> 00:06:57,941
They are deliberately luring us there
to kill us.

87
00:06:58,021 --> 00:06:58,981
So you also know that?

88
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,800
We have only two options left.

89
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,920
If we don't expose the video now,
we won't get another chance to do it.

90
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,920
What about my brother's life?

91
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,840
I won't let him die.

92
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,240
What are you going to do?

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,160
I'm going to save him.

94
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,840
Didn't you just tell me...

95
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,520
that they were luring us there to kill us?

96
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,520
If we don't make the video public now,

97
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,981
Jane and Pued would have died in vain!

98
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:54,701
But I can't let my brother die!

99
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,800
I won't let you go.

100
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,320
But I will.

101
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,400
Can't I stop you once in my life?

102
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,920
Didn't you tell me...

103
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,760
not to do endanger myself?

104
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,400
How can you go there by yourself now?

105
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,360
If I want you to trust me one more time,

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,240
will you?

107
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,360
What if I say no?

108
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,600
Then I'll go there by myself.

109
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,720
-I'm sorry...
-What are you doing?

110
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,334
Someone will hear you.

111
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,880
-Brother, Brother.
-Huh?

112
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,800
Put it here?

113
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,600
Yes.

114
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,320
Hide.

115
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,360
Brother.

116
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,880
What's that smoke?

117
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,240
Go and check!

118
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,280
Don't move.

119
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,520
You have the video now.

120
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,720
I hope that I can leave with my brother.

121
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,840
Mr. Tan, please put down your gun.

122
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,960
On your knees!

123
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,840
I warned you.

124
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,600
I'm sorry.

125
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,631
Even God can't save you now.

126
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,080
Kill me first.

127
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,680
I'm telling you to kill me first!

128
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,040
I have a backup plan! Go!

129
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,680
After them!

130
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,328
Go!

131
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,560
Did you plan all this?

132
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,080
I won't let you die.

133
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,360
Who did you call to come and save us?

134
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,060
Inspector?

135
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,040
You...

136
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,280
How were you able to survive?

137
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,720
Because of your poor marksmanship.

138
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
In a while,

139
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:30,720
tell them I'm badly hurt.

140
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,040
Unfortunately,

141
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,120
we tried our best.

142
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,800
Inspector.

143
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,800
But even if he wakes up,
he'll just be paralyzed.

144
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,200
You deceived me!

145
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,600
What a pity.

146
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,920
If you had been a bit smarter
and chosen the right side,

147
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,520
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

148
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:53,360
Hey!

149
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,760
Raise your hands slowly.

150
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,760
Are you all right?

151
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,680
Are you no longer paralyzed, Inspector?

152
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,120
No.

153
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,480
Didn't you say you wouldn't keep
any secrets from me?

154
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,040
Don't you like the surprise?

155
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,840
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

156
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
What are you doing?

157
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,160
Someone is coming.

158
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,040
What should we do?

159
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,880
It's me.

160
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,120
What were you two doing?

161
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,160
(Viangpha Mork Spa)

162
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,520
(Deleting...)

163
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,320
(Upload Completed)

164
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,840
What do you think of my plan
of planting a virus into that phone?

165
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,840
Once the video gets deleted,
it will be uploaded automatically.

166
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,120
Be honest.
Have you ever hacked my computer?

167
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,800
Is there something embarrassing
on your computer?

168
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,560

If Ms. Janejira
really wanted to expose them,

207

there should be more evidence
than what's inside the SD card.

00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,800
I told you to open it!

337
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,981
(I don't remember when it started)

338
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:18,760
"I don't remember when it started."

339
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,240
"When did the little fawn
start bumping around in my chest?"

340
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,480
Let me formally introduce myself.

341
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,640
I'm Tan Wirapong Inkhamvieng.

342
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm Bannakit Songsakdina.

343
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,080
Nice to meet you, Dr. Bun.

344
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,880
(When did I start to smile
before going to bed?)

345
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,440
"When did I start to smile
before going to bed?"

346
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,600
We can sleep together, too.

347
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,520
What did you say?

348
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,240
We can sleep together, too.

349
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,000
(When can't I help
but think about the future?)

350
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,760
"When can't I help
but think about the future?"

351
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,720
Since I have you,
I don't need a partner anymore.

352
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,480
(When did my life start
to be better than it should?)

353
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,640
"When did my life start
to be better than it should?"

354
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,040
(I really can't remember
when this all started)

355
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,600
"I really can't remember
when this all started."

356
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,120
"But I remember whom this started with."

357
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,000
Whether you like it or not,

358
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,720
I can't let you face this alone.

359
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:08,431
I told you, didn't I?

360
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,360
I will protect you.

361
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,520
Why did you take a picture?

362
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:25,620
You never laughed like this.

363
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,600
You usually pretend to be cool.

364
00:34:29,162 --> 00:34:31,880
Next time you take a picture,
I'm going to charge you.

365
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:35,160
Oh, one is enough. It takes up storage.

366
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,560
Will you marry me?

367
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,520
Yes, I will.

368
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,120
I just noticed...

369
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,360
how beautiful the scenery up here can be.

370
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,360
It's strange.

371
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,200
You've been here many times before.

372
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,000
I usually felt sad when I came here.

373
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,240
But the reason
why I think it's so beautiful...

374
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,160
is that you are here with me.

375
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,720
I'm not used to it.

376
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,720
You are being so romantic.

377
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,040
Embarrassed, aren't you?

378
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,240
Yeah.

379
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,760
You should get used to it.

380
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:14,368
All right.

381
00:37:24,168 --> 00:37:25,008
Thank you...

382
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,840
for coming to Viangpha Mork.

383
00:37:31,528 --> 00:37:32,442
Thank you...

384
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:34,920
for being with me.

385
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,265
Take me here often in the future.

386
00:37:52,682 --> 00:37:53,757
Sure.

387
00:37:56,214 --> 00:37:57,320
Forever.
