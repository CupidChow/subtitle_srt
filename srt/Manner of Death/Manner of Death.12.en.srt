1
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:23,499
You have something to show me?

2
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,691
Try some of this.

3
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,580
Introduce this girl to me
when you are free.

4
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,460
No problem.

5
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,820
This is the type you like.

6
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:41,588
You're right.

7
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,290
I'll refill it for you.

8
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,020
Jane, what's the matter?
What's wrong with your expression?

9
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,300
Nothing.

10
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,980
I'm just thinking about something.

11
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,860
This person?

12
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,460
But I think...

13
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,580
she wouldn't be so daring as Ms. Jane.

14
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,300
Am I right? Ms. Jane.

15
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,500
Yes, I dare to do anything.

16
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,764
Do you want to know how daring I am?

17
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:50,506
I not only dare to do one thing,

18
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:53,175
but I also dare
to expose every one of you!

19
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,187
I'll expose all your crimes!

20
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:56,443
Jane!

21
00:01:57,891 --> 00:01:59,015
Wait for it!

22
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:02,300
You will see
if I really dare to do everything!

23
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:03,501
Jane! Enough!

24
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:04,582
Wait for it!

25
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,340
Jane!

26
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:51,924
=Manner of Death=

27
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,220
Are you sure that you don't need a lawyer?

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,391
I don't need it.

29
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:07,420
I'm sure about what I'm doing.

30
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:11,754
Do you mean
that you'll confess everything?

31
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:14,284
Yes.

32
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,540
The night when Jane died...

33
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,100
Everyone knows that Jane had a quarrel
with Pued, right?

34
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,602
I understand your feeling.

35
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:27,322
Understand?

36
00:04:27,794 --> 00:04:29,234
You're just lost.

37
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:31,242
I'm not lost.

38
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:35,418
I just feel that I'm very stupid.

39
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:38,211
You've taken advantage of me for so long.

40
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,570
But I didn't take advantage of you.

41
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:47,546
You did it willingly.

42
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:49,620
Yes.

43
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:52,635
I was willing to do it because of you.

44
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:55,396
It was all for your future development.

45
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,660
But you've gone too far.

46
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,776
Can you call yourself a man?

47
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,820
Jane, enough.

48
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:06,204
You were my everything.

49
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:11,378
You were my friend and lover.

50
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:16,135
But I don't recognize you now.

51
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,580
Then, what are you planning to do?

52
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,860
I have evidence.

53
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,300
I will expose them.

54
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,100
I'll make them pay for their crimes.

55
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,380
Pued.

56
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,380
I love you.

57
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,820
Pued.

58
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,620
Pued.

59
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,980
Pued.

60
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,420
No...

61
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,940
But you attended the party
at Judge Suradej's home that day...

62
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,900
until the morning.

63
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,460
How do you know all these?

64
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,020
Because Pued,

65
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,980
confessed to me...

66
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,900
before he died.

67
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,500
Did you suspect Pued at the beginning?

68
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,540
Yes, I suspected him.

69
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,740
When he ran away,

70
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,020
I was certain about it.

71
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,100
Why are you hiding here?

72
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,260
Are you the one who murdered Jane?

73
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,140
Do you think that everything
will be settled...

74
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,460
if you stay here?

75
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,900
Where is Dr. Bun?

76
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,500
Are you the one who threatened him?

77
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,580
You faked an accident,

78
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,580
but he didn't give up,

79
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,740
so your brother's men went to murder him.

80
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,580
And that reporter.

81
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,660
He knew that you had killed Jane,

82
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,780
so he blackmailed you, right?

83
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,860
Stop it, Pued.

84
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,420
I can't stop.

85
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,020
I have no choice now.

86
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,580
I shouldn't have killed Jane.

87
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,300
I shouldn't have!

88
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,460
All my sin started from that!

89
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,100
No!

90
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,460
Your sin...

91
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,940
started when you gave Jane
to the senior officials...

92
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,660
for your own promotion.

93
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,820
Jane wanted to do it!

94
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,980
But, she wanted to quit suddenly!

95
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,900
Bastard!

96
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,940
Why did you kill Jane?

97
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,140
If I hadn't killed her,

98
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,860
the senior officials
and I would have been in prison now!

99
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,540
And my future would be ruined.

100
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,540
Pued.

101
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,940
You shouldn't move on. Stop it.

102
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,980
What if I don't?

103
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,380
Pued, Jane really loved you.

104
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,660
She loved you very much.

105
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,340
It's all my fault.

106
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,300
I caused everything.

107
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,700
But, I still don't understand.

108
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,460
Why did you take Prosecutor Pued's phone?

109
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,980
I had doubts about the quarrel...

110
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,580
between Pued and Jane.

111
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,500
I thought that there must be
something behind it.

112
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,100
So I thought that there would be
some information...

113
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,620
on Pued's phone.

114
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,260
But, in the end,

115
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,980
I found nothing.

116
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,380
Do you mean that...

117
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,140
you didn't murder Prosecutor Pued...

118
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,220
out of anger?

119
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,700
You planned for it, right?

120
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,420
Yes.

121
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,660
I did everything...

122
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,900
to avenge my sister.

123
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,780
Are you sure that you don't need a lawyer?

124
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,020
Yes. I don't need one.

125
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,420
I'm sorry.

126
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,980
Even though you've apologized,

127
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,740
my brother can't revive.

128
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,100
My sister can't revive either.

129
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,460
Don't think that this would end so easily,
Rungtiva.

130
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,380
You avenged your sister.

131
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,980
I can avenge my brother too.

132
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,260
You think that I don't know...

133
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,100
about the dirty business
you've done secretly in your spa?

134
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,380
There must be many dirty secrets.

135
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,260
I have nothing else to say.

136
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,100
Let's go, Gun.

137
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,420
Yes.

138
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,420
Wow.

139
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,660
Thank you.

140
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,340
I really can't believe...

141
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,020
Brother Pued would kill Jane.

142
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,260
I can't believe it too.

143
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,340
But these are all we can do now.

144
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,940
Why are you laughing?

145
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,780
You look like a child sometimes.

146
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
I really can't imagine...

147
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,820
what if you're not by my side now.

148
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,500
I'll be crazy.

149
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,180
Why are you thinking about that?

150
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,500
Am I not with you now?

151
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,740
Moreover, we are in such a deep forest.

152
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,660
Do you want to go home?

153
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,860
To be honest,

154
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,780
I'm okay with staying anywhere.

155
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,060
As long as...

156
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,340
Go ahead.

157
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,060
As long as no one's killing me.

158
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,740
What are you planning to do, Tan?

159
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,340
To me,

160
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,140
no matter where I am,

161
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,220
I only need you.

162
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,380
Doctor! Doctor!

163
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,060
Doctor! Doctor!

164
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,340
Look.

165
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,580
That and I caught a fish, Doctor!

166
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,820
Mr. Tan, why are you lying on the floor?

167
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,380
Nothing.

168
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,340
Didn't I tell you not to come in?

169
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,900
Sorawit, why do you bring that up?

170
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,300
Don't bring it here.
Put it in the kitchen.

171
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,660
-Alright.
-Go. Put it in the kitchen.

172
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,300
Please remove the scales and wash it.

173
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,060
I'm still injured, Bun.

174
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,060
Softer.

175
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,980
It hurts.

176
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,580
Stop it.

177
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,860
Are you sure that this photo
has something to do,

178
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,300
with Ms. Jane's murder case?

179
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,620
Yes, Mr. Suradej.

180
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,700
These two forced Prosecutor Pued
to hand over Ms. Jane.

181
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,940
So, they might have forced Pued
to kill Jane.

182
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,460
This is only your assumption.

183
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,380
I don't see any reasons
for them to kill Ms. Jane.

184
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,940
What if Jane wanted
to expose their crimes?

185
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,220
I heard about it...

186
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,500
at Director's birthday party.

187
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,020
I not only dare to do one thing,

188
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,620
I dare to expose every one of you!

189
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,700
I will expose all your crimes!

190
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,060
Wait for it!

191
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,140
You will see if I really dare
to do everything!

192
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,220
Jane! Enough!

193
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,180
Wait for it!

194
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,100
Jane!

195
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,940
I heard that Ms. Jane
wanted to expose these two men.

196
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,380
Where did you get these photos?

197
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,300
From Reporter Pat's Micro SD card.

198
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,540
Call Inspector M.

199
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,940
Then, prepare the evidence.

200
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,820
I'll issue you an arrest warrant later.

201
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,900
Thank you very much.

202
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,620
Thank you very much.

203
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Inspector M is here...

204
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,420
with the police from
the Anti-Human Trafficking Department.

205
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,620
You should leave first.

206
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,580
Let's go.

207
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,740
Beta, this is Alpha.

208
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,460
-How are you feeling?
-It hurts here.

209
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,260
Nam! Nam!

210
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,820
Nam!

211
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,900
You still can't go in.

212
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
But, she's my friend.

213
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,180
-You might distract the doctor.
-Nam!

214
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,020
-Please wait outside first.
-Nam!

215
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,980
Sorn, let's go out first.
Let's wait outside.

216
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,900
(Viangpha Mork Hospital)

217
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,260
(Emergency Room)

218
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,060
How's my friend, Nam?

219
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,220
Except for the bruises from the assault,

220
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,340
nothing serious.

221
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,540
She fainted because she was weak.

222
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,900
She may wake up tomorrow.

223
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,180
I told you that it's alright.

224
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,420
Thank you, Inspector.

225
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,500
You're welcome.

226
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,220
I'll leave first.

227
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,380
Alright.

228
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,820
Tan.

229
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,380
Thank you very much.

230
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,300
You're welcome.

231
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Is this the book?

232
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,580
The one you've mentioned.

233
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,740
Yes, this is the one.

234
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,100
Did you read it?

235
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,580
Not yet.

236
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,220
I want to read it with you.

237
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,020
I've been curious from the beginning.

238
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,020
Why did you bring the cactus here?

239
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,460
This?

240
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,820
Why did you bring it here?

241
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,780
Don't we need evidence...

242
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,340
to arrest Commander Tung
and Congressman Songchai?

243
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,740
It's all on you, Inspector.

244
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,740
Okay.

245
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,820
Have a look at it.

246
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,700
Jane liked this book very much.

247
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,660
Apple thinks that it's exceptional.

248
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,900
We're reading
a fairy tale together in this forest.

249
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,420
It's really weird.

250
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,540
I think it's quite romantic.

251
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,340
Did you like any fairy tales
when you were young?

252
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,460
I liked...

253
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,300
"The Ugly Duckling".

254
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,700
Because in the end,

255
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,940
I'm that duckling.

256
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,500
I'm the ugliest in my family.

257
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,940
Unlike the swan in that fairy tale.

258
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,740
Yes.

259
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,260
You look alike.

260
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,940
After having a look,

261
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,220
I think you look like neither a duckling
nor a swan.

262
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,700
What do I look like?

263
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,220
Hmm... Neither a duckling...

264
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,100
nor a swan.

265
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,620
Why don't you be a flamingo?

266
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,820
I'll be your flamingo then.

267
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,020
Tan.

268
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,420
What are you going to do?

269
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,980
Today,

270
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,420
That and Sorawit are not here.

271
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,580
What's wrong?

272
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,020
It's already like this.
Why are you laughing?

273
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,380
I'm sorry.

274
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,780
I just happened to see this.

275
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,100
Look at Jane.

276
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,620
She didn't change at all.

277
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,580
Still so forgetful.

278
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,780
She wrote her ATM password
everywhere back then.

279
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,300
I wonder what password
was written in this book.

280
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,420
Look.

281
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,060
Nam!

282
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,980
Are you awake?

283
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,780
Hello, Doctor.

284
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
Nam is awake.

285
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,460
Nam!

286
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,900
What's wrong?

287
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,180
Where am I?

288
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,180
Hospital, my friend.

289
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,180
Hospital?

290
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,580
Yes, hospital.

291
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,820
Who are you?

292
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,860
Nam, do you still remember your president?

293
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,060
Who are you?

294
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,940
I'm just kidding.

295
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,500
President, I'm sorry.

296
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,700
Nam, you're mad!

297
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,860
Damn it.

298
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,060
You just woke up, yet you were fooling us.

299
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,740
-Nam.
-Dr. Bun.

300
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,980
Mr. Tan.

301
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,020
It's okay.

302
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,860
I'm glad that you're okay.

303
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,700
It's okay now.

304
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,620
I almost couldn't make my way back
to see you.

305
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,460
But you're here.

306
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,380
Nam, I found out everything.

307
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,420
Congressman Songchai
and Commander Tung...

308
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,940
are in charge of human trafficking.

309
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,580
They harmed you, right?

310
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,900
Yes.

311
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,940
But you and Mr. Tan still don't know
the whole truth.

312
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,300
Inspector.

313
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,940
Aren't you going to the court today?

314
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,780
The judge asked me to see him
at his home today.

315
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,340
That's weird.

316
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,300
He might have something urgent.

317
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,740
Inspector, in the SD card...

318
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,500
Is there any information?

319
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,300
I haven't told you about the SD card.

320
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,140
How did you know about it?

321
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,780
Doesn't everyone
save important documents...

322
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,020
in an SD card?

323
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,540
Inspector.

324
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,620
(Viangpha Mork Hospital)

325
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,700
I've heard about this for a while.

326
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,300
There's a VIP group that does sex trade
in Viangpha Mork.

327
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,500
At first, I thought it was just a rumor.

328
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,100
It isn't a rumor.

329
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,820
It's related to Rung, right?

330
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,460
There's a huge house hidden in the forest.

331
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,540
A group of VIPs are regular customers.

332
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,820
They have sex parties,

333
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,500
ecstasy,

334
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,060
drugs,

335
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,260
and SM there.

336
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,420
Who is it?

337
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,540
Congressman Songchai...

338
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,100
or Commander Tung?

339
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,780
Not them.

340
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,180
The one who is violent...

341
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,980
and likes to bite...

342
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,620
is Judge Suradej.

343
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,940
Hello.

344
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,380
Is everything settled?

345
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,700
Inspector M found out about it.

346
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,540
But I've handled it.

347
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,860
But not at the meeting place.

348
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,820
What about the body?

349
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,100
I haven't dealt with it.

350
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,380
There were many people,

351
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,740
so I left his body there.

352
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,940
Deal with the SD card.

353
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,740
Okay.

354
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,260
(Viangpha Mork Police Station)

355
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,620
Dr. Bun.

356
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,780
Dr. Bun.

357
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,660
There are police in front of the hospital.

358
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,620
The police said they came
to arrest Dr. Bun.

359
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,260
What to do, Tan?

360
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,700
Doctor, what to do?

361
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,620
They are here to arrest you.

362
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
I have an idea.

363
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,700
Don't move too much, Bun.

364
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,100
Commander, we couldn't find him.

365
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,900
Are you sure that your plan
is only to flee?

366
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,420
Then, what do you think it is for?

367
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,260
Don't you know what time it is?

368
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,220
This room.

369
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,780
I can't find him.

370
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,420
Where did the patient
and Dr. Bun in this room go?

371
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,700
The patient was discharged.

372
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,220
As for Dr. Bun, I don't know.

373
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,860
If you don't want to get into trouble,

374
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,180
tell me, Doctor.

375
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,860
Be careful.

376
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,620
Alright, Brother.

377
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,500
I really don't know.

378
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,340
Hurry up, Sorawit.

379
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,980
-It's here, Brother.
-Thank you.

380
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,420
If you still refuse to tell me,

381
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,260
I'll really accuse you.

382
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,020
-It's okay?
-It's okay.

383
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,020
I don't know. I really don't know.

384
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,500
I don't know where they went.

385
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,180
Teacher and Doctor, you go first.

386
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,780
I'll go and grab something
from the school.

387
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,900
-Ok.
-Be careful.

388
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,380
-Alright, Teacher.
-It's all on you.

389
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,900
Bye, Brother.

390
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,220
Come. Hurry up.

391
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,140
Get into the car.

392
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,740
Doctor.

393
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,660
Yes.

394
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,300
Inspector M was shot by someone.

395
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,220
He might need an operation right away.

396
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,340
Is Dr. Banjong here?

397
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,260
He's here.

398
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,740
I'll leave first.

399
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,940
Let's go!

400
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,220
I'm sorry.

401
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,380
We've tried our best.

402
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,500
Doctor, what do you mean?

403
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,020
Inspector M was shot in a few places.

404
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,540
His internal organs were hit
by some of the bullets.

405
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,660
We've removed the bullets,

406
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,260
but...

407
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,380
But what? Doctor.

408
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,660
Inspector is in severe condition.

409
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,340
He's still unconscious.

410
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,900
No matter...

411
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,980
how hard we try to save Inspector,

412
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,820
he'll still be paralyzed.

413
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,820
Because a bullet hit his spine.

414
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,740
Why did this happen
to such a good policeman...

415
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,100
like him?

416
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,380
Anyway, thank you, Doctor.

417
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,380
At least Inspector M is still alive.

418
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,860
Yes.

419
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,740
=Manner of Death=

420
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,980
How did you think of hiding here?

421
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,180
Haven't you heard of a phrase?

422
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,540
The most dangerous place
is the safest place.

423
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,220
You're a very good policeman, Inspector.

424
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,980
It's a pity.

425
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,740
You're not smart enough.

426
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,500
Rest in peace.

427
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,460
I've issued a warrant to arrest them.

428
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,540
We just need to find them.

429
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,300
I think...

430
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,220
it's bad to let the police chase
after us...

431
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,700
like criminals on the run.

432
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,020
Don't worry.

433
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,700
I'll protect you.

434
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,660
What about the kids?

435
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,700
Dr. Bun.
