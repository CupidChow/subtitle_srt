1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,759
Could it be that you sent me the photos?

2
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,640
Or are you the girl in the photos?

3
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,480
What on earth are you on about?

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,880
You're nuts!

5
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,040
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,600
What were you doing in the guest bedroom?

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,720
Honey, wait!

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,600
Ava.

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,360
I saw someone messing with the chandelier.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,280
Stop wasting time suspecting me

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,560
because what happened today

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,760
was no accident.

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,920
Someone's trying to hurt you.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,240
Try not to work out too hard.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,280
You could get injured.

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,520
If you'll excuse me,

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,160
I gotta keep running.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
If you're working out
to forget about last night,

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid it's in vain

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,160
because now you're a hot topic
for everyone to gossip about.

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,440
FANCY HOUSE PARTY WAS A WRECK

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,960
No need to guess who spilled the news.

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,520
It must be Dao.

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360
I have something else to show you.

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
Here.

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,640
Last month, Ava flew to London.

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,280
She posted just two photos
without a caption,

28
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,040
no mention of who went with her.

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,160
So I did a little research for fun.

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,200
In case you suspect something,

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,040
you could find out the answer faster.
But keep running if you want,

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I gotta run too.

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,400
May I have it back?

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,960
Or could it be

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,840
that the girl in the photo is Ava?

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,920
You can have it back.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,240
People keep asking me
if I borrowed it from you.

38
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,680
I don't want to lie.

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,320
Whoever bought it
meant to give it to you, not to me.

40
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,680
If you want to show it off, just go ahead.

41
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,080
He said it's your reward
for being a good girl.

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,280
Really?

43
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,640
Then I should call him myself,

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
tell him I'll stay good

45
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,440
so he can be proud.

46
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,760
Today, all contestants

47
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,880
will join a challenge
with the theme Tropical Day.

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,800
For our challenge today,

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,120
all contestants will be posing

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,440
next to a swimming pool.

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,760
If you win,

52
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,720
you'll be one of the three finalists

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,680
and you may also get to work
with Nile Real Estate.

54
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,560
More importantly, today we're joined by

55
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,360
a special committee member.

56
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Rath.

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,880
STAR SEA CHANNEL AUDITION

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,040
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

59
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,920
Jarinya.

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,120
Isn't this a little too much?

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
The show invited another businessman

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,320
and no one informed me.

63
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,200
Please calm down, Mr. Tham.

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,320
The higher-ups at the station

65
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,960
just informed me yesterday.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,880
I came here as the hotel's sponsor,

67
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,640
not representing your rival company.

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,880
Perhaps you didn't know,

69
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,520
but I just started
investing in this hotel.

70
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
I learned that
the show would be filmed here,

71
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,000
so I wanted to sponsor the show

72
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,680
since my wife is on the committee.

73
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,960
And also,

74
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,400
I wanted to work closely with my wife

75
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,480
so that if someone flirted with her,

76
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,040
he'd think twice.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,240
How sweet.

78
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,960
Now I'm jealous of you, Pat.

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,600
But she looks more shocked

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,680
than glad, Jarinya.

81
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,280
Pat, smile a little, honey.

82
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,200
Everyone's watching.

83
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,320
Guys, I think you should go get ready

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,200
because our team has prepared

85
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,040
a script and an outfit for each of you,

86
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,400
so go ahead.

87
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,720
This way please.

88
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,680
This way please.

89
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,720
What did you do?

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,680
Are you sure you want to know

91
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,320
what I did?

92
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,440
Don't say a word.

93
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,560
And

94
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,680
will these marks affect my scores?

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,840
I want to work at Mr. Tham's company.

96
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,920
You have to remind her again.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,960
Please, Aunt Dao.

98
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
Hide it well.

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,480
Cover it with the cloth.

100
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,480
I'll take care of it for you.

101
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,400
Now, each of you must improvise.

102
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,600
Act without a script.

103
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,080
Remember that the audience

104
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,440
wants to see actors with charisma,

105
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,120
who can fascinate them

106
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,560
no matter what role you play.

107
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,520
Give it your all guys.

108
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,000
Good luck.

109
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,120
Stop filming!

110
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,040
Come here, Pu.

111
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,360
Ava, let go of her.

112
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,320
Tuck, could you delete
that footage from just now?

113
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,560
Why did you do that?

114
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,280
I didn't mean to.

115
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,720
My hand just happened to get caught.

116
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,320
I think you tied it loosely on purpose

117
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,960
so it would come off.

118
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,559
Trying to get attention
even before debuting?

119
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,360
I don't need to do such a thing.

120
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,480
I doubt it.

121
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,960
Being you,

122
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,039
even if you add
the title Star Sea to your name,

123
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,600
you still won't get far in the industry.

124
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,760
I bet you know that well.

125
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,000
That's why you did something so shameless.

126
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,480
You said it yourself,

127
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
it looks shameless.

128
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,560
So why would she do it?

129
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,440
Perhaps she's not as cunning as you.

130
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,560
You covered up what you did so well

131
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,960
that no one knew.

132
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,840
Dao!

133
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,440
Regardless,

134
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,880
we need to deduct Chompunuch's points.

135
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,280
She did such a shameless thing,

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,360
wasting everyone's time.

137
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,640
Then, Ava's points should be deducted too.

138
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,240
In fact, she should be disqualified.

139
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,160
Someone is helping her cheat.

140
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,360
What are you on about?

141
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,880
I overheard Ms. Ingdao
on the phone with a committee member.

142
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,760
She asked them to give Ava
more points than the others.

143
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,440
No matter what,

144
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,880
she needs to get
the most points this round.

145
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,880
You already promised Ava.

146
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,640
Thank you.

147
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,560
I didn't phone anyone.

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,280
You're probably trying
to frame me and Ava.

149
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,080
Or maybe you misheard

150
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
and it's all in your head.

151
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,800
Right, you probably misheard.

152
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,400
No. You definitely did.

153
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,720
You just wanted a shortcut to fame.

154
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,400
And now that we're onto you,

155
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,920
you're creating a diversion.

156
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,320
You're wasting everyone's time,

157
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,960
and ruining the contest.

158
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,000
Then let me do a retake.

159
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
Ava.

160
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,480
Let's go film next to the pool again.

161
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,440
Let's go.

162
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,360
Those marks!

163
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,120
Those marks…

164
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,240
Hickies?

165
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,240
No wonder you're using a scarf.

166
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,200
I saw them long ago,
I just didn't say anything.

167
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,120
You!

168
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,800
Stop it, Ava!

169
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,680
Stop it!

170
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,440
I demand an investigation, Jarinya.

171
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,120
If Dao really lobbied
the committee to give Ava points,

172
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,760
I won't stand for it.

173
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,440
I saw it.
They were really sabotaging Chompunuch.

174
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,960
You should've told someone.

175
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,720
At least you should have told Mrs. Pat.

176
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,280
It's not my job.

177
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
And I didn't come here to help anyone.

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,360
I already lost once.

179
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,840
I won't lose to that couple again.

180
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,280
If this has to do with Fah,

181
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,600
maybe Mrs. Pat doesn't know about--

182
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,800
Why do you look so upset?

183
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,960
Are you still mad at me

184
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,640
for sponsoring today's event?

185
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,720
I thought I was being generous

186
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,520
for letting you come to my party.

187
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,000
But you,

188
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,040
you're being so petty with me.

189
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,280
Or could it be

190
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,760
you're upset
because I took away your chance

191
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,480
to get close to my wife?

192
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,960
Your wife?

193
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,440
Which one?

194
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,680
Hey!

195
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,600
What are you trying to say?

196
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,920
So angry over just a few words.

197
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,760
Or was there some truth in it?

198
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Are you mad because you feel guilty?

199
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,120
Hey--

200
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't think it's a good idea
to have a fight here.

201
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,920
Rath.

202
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,160
Someone called you before the contest.

203
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,880
Was it Dao?

204
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,400
Dao asked you to help with Ava's points

205
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,600
and you said you'd help, right?

206
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,920
That's not true.

207
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,440
Why would I do that?

208
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,520
Dao, Ava and I

209
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,000
are not that close.

210
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,440
Plus, you're on the committee
for this event.

211
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,560
If I helped someone, I'd just look bad.

212
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,000
Why do you think it's me?

213
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,120
Who else could it be?

214
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,080
There are so many judges.

215
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,840
It could be that Mr. Tham guy.

216
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,520
Judging by his looks,
he's not only sucking up to you.

217
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,760
I'm sorry!

218
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,480
Watch it! Are you blind?!

219
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,280
I didn't mean to.
Did I dirty your clothes?

220
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,400
Get lost!

221
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,760
Okay.

222
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,240
Ingdao.

223
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,040
Are you okay?

224
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,400
Just a little accident.

225
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,560
I should go change.

226
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,440
You don't look so well.

227
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,400
I've got a little headache too.

228
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,480
I'll go change now.

229
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,560
Are you okay?

230
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,440
Then,

231
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,400
should I come with you?

232
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,840
Are you feeling any better?

233
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,560
I'm not sure.

234
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,200
I don't really feel okay.

235
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,680
You still feel warm.

236
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,200
I'm probably sick for real.

237
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,480
It's all because of Pat.

238
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,360
Mrs. Pat?

239
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Well, Patchanin.

240
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,920
She keeps giving me and Ava trouble.

241
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,360
With today's contest,

242
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,520
Pat's probably giving her kid
all her points.

243
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,480
That kid's got nothing on Ava.

244
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,520
Don't you think so?

245
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,520
If I were to compare,

246
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,920
Ava is superior to Chompunuch
in every way.

247
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,720
That's right.

248
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,880
The only thing she's lacking

249
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,800
is a strong supporter.

250
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,000
If you help,

251
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,120
I'll give you whatever you want.

252
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,120
With this kind of stuff,

253
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,440
I'll need a deposit.

254
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,680
Sorry to interrupt.

255
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,240
If you'll excuse me.

256
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,400
Why are you giving me that look?

257
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,120
I just didn't think

258
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,400
someone would fail to control
their sexual impulse

259
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,440
so that they had to let it out in here.

260
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,240
Why can't I do that?

261
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,600
I'm single, and so is Ms. Ingdao.
Nothing wrong with that,

262
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,440
it's not like I'm having fun
with someone else's lover.

263
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,240
That look on your face…

264
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,440
Could it be that

265
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,160
you've done it before?

266
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Or does your husband do it?

267
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Hey!

268
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,839
What you do is your business,

269
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,640
not mine.

270
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,359
I only came here

271
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,680
to warn you.

272
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,280
If you're helping Dao rig the scores,

273
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,080
I won't stand for it.

274
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,960
Coffee.

275
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,360
Thanks.

276
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,840
Good luck.

277
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,880
You're here to serve coffee.

278
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,680
Then where's mine?

279
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,960
One moment please.

280
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,240
I'm so thirsty.

281
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,360
Done with the shoot? How was it?

282
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,240
Easy-peasy.

283
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,120
You didn't find any evidence,
did you, Pat?

284
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,760
No.

285
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,120
Then I probably can't help you

286
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,320
because that kid's word
is the only evidence.

287
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,320
Let's not make it a big deal.

288
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,400
We should be all done
with the challenge today,

289
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,760
with both the boys and the girls.

290
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,080
We didn't have to waste time
on such nonsense.

291
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,480
Let's forget about what happened

292
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,280
and total the scores.

293
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,520
Hey, everyone.

294
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,320
The results are in.

295
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,200
The ones with the highest scores are…

296
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,400
Ava,

297
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,400
Captain,

298
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,920
and,

299
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,280
Chompunuch!

300
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,760
Three people with the highest scores.

301
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,320
So what now?

302
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,320
The committee will decide

303
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,640
who among these three

304
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,840
will be the winner of today's challenge.

305
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,960
Pu.

306
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,640
What's the matter?

307
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,560
What I'm afraid of is about to happen.

308
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,360
-Ava.
-Chompunuch.

309
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,880
Ava.

310
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,440
Chompunuch.

311
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Ava.

312
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,240
Chompunuch.

313
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,680
Then, the final score

314
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,360
will have to be decided by Mr. Tham.

315
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,760
Being our last vote,

316
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,080
are you delaying it to seem important,
or have you not made up your mind?

317
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,520
Actually, I had decided from the start.

318
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,600
Chompunuch.

319
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,920
Mr. Tham.

320
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,880
You said yourself that Ava

321
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,280
is superior to Chompunuch in every way.

322
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,440
You think
I'm a three-year-old or something?

323
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,920
Was I wrong?

324
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,880
Ava's external factors
are all superior to Chompunuch's,

325
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,880
with her wealth

326
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,920
and her family support.

327
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,120
But you still chose that kid?

328
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,760
I might've missed a few words.

329
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,640
Ava has it better than her,

330
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,560
but what Chompunuch has more of

331
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,440
is capability

332
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,600
and determination.

333
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,680
As a committee member,

334
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,960
I'd choose someone with those traits.

335
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,520
But remember
what happened in the changing room?

336
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,680
The deposit you mentioned?

337
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
We didn't close the deal.

338
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,520
There's no agreement yet.

339
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,120
I can change my mind at any time.

340
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,480
Looks like the medicine is working.

341
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,880
You're not warm anymore.

342
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,680
Or maybe you never had a fever.

343
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,400
You just wanted me in that room with you,

344
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,800
just us alone.

345
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,080
Tham.

346
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,480
Uncle.

347
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,920
Great job, Pu.

348
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,960
Thank you.

349
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,560
I can assure you,

350
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,560
we decided based on
the contestants' capability.

351
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,240
You won thanks to yourself.

352
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,320
Word sure spreads fast.

353
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,760
I didn't expect
you'd have someone spying on me.

354
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,640
It started when you got stubborn

355
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,680
and insisted our company
sponsor this show.

356
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,360
Frankly, I disagree with you

357
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,480
always doing whatever you want.

358
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,480
How could you mix up
business with personal matters?

359
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,440
Don't worry.

360
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,920
I'd never let our company
fall like before.

361
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,760
I've restored it this far.

362
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,600
I won't let it decline again.

363
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,520
With the way you're acting,

364
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,920
are you expecting gratitude?

365
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
Do you think our company

366
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,080
cannot survive

367
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
without you?

368
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,400
I'd never think that.

369
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,760
You're the company's senior advisor,
after all,

370
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,520
who guided us through the crisis.

371
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,040
But you keep doing whatever you please.

372
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,080
I keep warning you again and again,
but you never listen,

373
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,600
just like this time!

374
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,320
Whatever decision I make,

375
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,000
it surely won't harm our company.

376
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,200
We'll see.

377
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,120
You're the CEO of this company

378
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,640
because I appointed you,

379
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,400
so I can always remove you.
Don't forget that.

380
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,920
I didn't think

381
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,680
you were one to eavesdrop.

382
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,400
I wanted to talk to you.

383
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,960
I didn't know you had a guest.

384
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,440
Go ahead then.

385
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
About Pu,

386
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,280
I thought you'd help Dao.

387
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm not here to help anyone.

388
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
I picked the one
with the best performance.

389
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,080
I just want some justice in this world.

390
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,040
Those who trample on others

391
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,760
and steal their opportunities,

392
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,960
I hate them the most.

393
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
If you're talking about me,

394
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,520
can you tell me what I ever did to you

395
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,480
that you're viewing me so negatively?

396
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,880
It's fine if you don't remember.

397
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,040
Sometimes people forget
the bad things they've done.

398
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,160
Sometimes they don't even realize
why it was terrible.

399
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,480
Dao looked really upset

400
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,680
that Ava didn't win today.

401
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,880
And are you worried about Ava's feelings

402
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,560
or Dao's?

403
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,040
I'm not worried about Dao.

404
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,600
I'm more worried about you,

405
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,640
seeing Dao troubling you like that.

406
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,600
The good thing about Dao
is that she really loves Ava.

407
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,920
But the bad thing is…

408
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,920
No matter how much she troubles me,
I can handle it all,

409
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,360
except for one thing.

410
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,840
What's that?

411
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,200
As women,

412
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,680
we may manage the outside world well,

413
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,400
only to fall apart

414
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,280
because of our own husbands.

415
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,480
But my wife

416
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,920
is good at everything.

417
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,320
That's why people envy me.

418
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,680
But with certain things,

419
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,120
I might not be as adept
as a young girl like Ava.

420
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,840
I don't know much
about girls of this generation,

421
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,680
and I don't care either.

422
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,240
I only care about

423
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,120
the prettiest girl

424
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,360
right in front of me.

425
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,840
Before we head home,
let's go to your favorite restaurant.

426
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,360
Sure.

427
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,040
Let's go.

428
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,840
Fah! Fah!

429
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,000
Fah?

430
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,640
Fah!

431
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,040
Fah, Fah!

432
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,520
Fah!

433
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,200
PATCHANIN AND TAWEERATH MARRY
IN ROMANTIC WEDDING

434
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,440
Uncle.

435
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,680
Thank you, Tham,

436
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,640
for taking care of the funeral for me.

437
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,800
With Fah gone,

438
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,480
I really can't do anything.

439
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,320
Anything I can do,

440
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,200
I'm happy to help.

441
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,640
After my parents died,

442
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,920
you and Fah were the only ones

443
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,560
who took care of me and provided for me.

444
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,720
You're like my real dad,

445
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,320
and she was like my real sister.

446
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,040
But with Fah gone,

447
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,600
you're all I have left.

448
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,680
And my company might have to close down.

449
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,440
What happened?

450
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,280
It's because Fah

451
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,880
invested everything for that scumbag,

452
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,720
supporting his business in every way.

453
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,120
But he still left Fah for that celebrity

454
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,080
and tricked her into signing a form

455
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,720
to deliver illicit goods,

456
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,240
which got my company under investigation.

457
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,520
If word gets out,
it will be bad for my company.

458
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Poor Fah. You shouldn't have fallen
for a scumbag like him.

459
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,320
Taweerath!

460
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,320
You bastard! You scumbag!

461
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,840
With business,
you've got nothing to worry about now.

462
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,160
I did everything for you as I promised.

463
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,880
Our company is doing great.

464
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,080
And those who hurt you

465
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,400
and those who conspired with them

466
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
will get their Karma as they should.

467
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,720
Excuse me.

468
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,320
What's up?

469
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,720
I'm done investigating as you asked.

470
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,600
Thank you.

471
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,080
They already gave the landowner a bid.

472
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,840
You can go ahead and give a higher bid.

473
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,880
Take care of it all for me.

474
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,160
Of course.

475
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,280
Great, you're here.

476
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,960
Honey.

477
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,880
I have something to talk about.

478
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,280
What's up?

479
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,800
I want to see your dad.

480
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,560
What else do you want him
to help you with?

481
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,520
He just agreed to sell you his land.

482
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,560
But this time,
someone's trying to sabotage me.

483
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,520
They're trying to buy
this land that I want.

484
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,840
They bid higher too.

485
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,640
So I wanted to borrow your dad's money.

486
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,280
Once my project starts,
I'll return the money.

487
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,440
Honey,

488
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,800
you know I never break my promises.

489
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,680
I'm always faithful to my word.

490
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,880
You're faithful with your word,

491
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,480
but are you faithful to me too?

492
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,480
Honey,

493
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,640
what's the matter?

494
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,840
You're normally more reasonable.

495
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,200
Maybe I am not really normal.

496
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,720
Rath! Rath!

497
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,360
What's the matter, Rath?

498
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,360
Rath!

499
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,800
Easy.

500
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,480
I'm fine.

501
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,360
I suddenly felt faint.

502
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,320
Then come rest on the bed.

503
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,240
Come.

504
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,640
He's been complaining about a headache

505
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,160
and asking me to get him medicine
for many days now.

506
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,880
And why didn't you tell me?

507
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,800
He told me not to,
that he didn't want to worry you.

508
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,360
He's probably very stressed from work.

509
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,560
Rath.

510
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,360
Why did you come down here?

511
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,280
I was going to bring you
rice porridge and water.

512
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,840
-I--
-And,

513
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,360
why are you all dressed up?

514
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,320
I got to thinking,

515
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,960
I don't want to bother you or your dad

516
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,360
with my business again.

517
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,320
I should

518
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,800
solve my own problems.

519
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,560
I'm going to the bank

520
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,920
to request more loans.

521
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,360
But if they reject me,

522
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,280
I'll just pay more interest

523
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,520
to someone who will lend me money.

524
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,840
I…

525
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,360
I should go now.

526
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,960
Um,

527
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,880
wait.

528
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,440
I'm free tomorrow.

529
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,520
Let's go see my dad together.

530
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,080
Really, honey?

531
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,680
Thank you so much.

532
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,920
I'm so glad you're helping me.

533
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,640
Can you promise me

534
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,160
you won't let me down?

535
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,200
We've been married for many years,

536
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,440
and I've never let you down.

537
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,320
You haven't before.

538
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,920
But now,

539
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,040
I'm not so sure.

540
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,960
I can assure you

541
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,240
because I love you only.

542
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,280
Seeing you in good health

543
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,120
brings me pleasure.

544
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,600
And what are you getting Pat

545
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,480
to ask me this time?

546
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,840
I know

547
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,720
I've bothered you a lot.

548
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,400
But everything I do, I do it for Pat.

549
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,400
Really? And how many shares

550
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,400
does Pat own in your company now?

551
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,280
In a way, all of my stocks

552
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,560
are like Pat's too.

553
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,920
Once she has a baby,

554
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,600
everything will belong to our child.

555
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,000
Then you should have one already.

556
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,400
You've been married for five or six years.

557
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,200
You just keep me waiting.

558
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,480
So,

559
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,480
later this year,
we're going to see a doctor

560
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,560
about trying for a baby.

561
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,800
Like always,

562
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,120
your husband doesn't want
to say it himself,

563
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,240
so he asks you to talk to me.

564
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,760
Well, you always taught me that,

565
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,080
when girls get married,

566
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,840
they have to support their husbands.

567
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,880
A tree needs great, strong roots

568
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
for it to grow bigger,

569
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,240
just as a wife must support
her husband for him to prosper.

570
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,400
That's why I end up helping every time.

571
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,120
You're my only child after all.

572
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,520
Tell me what you two want this time.

573
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,200
Someone is trying to buy
the land Rath is bidding on,

574
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,040
and they offered a higher price.

575
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,920
He really doesn't want to lose it,

576
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,840
so he has to bid higher.

577
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,800
If we don't have enough funds,

578
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,760
instead of finding more money
to compete with them,

579
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,320
why don't you try
turning your enemy into an ally?

580
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,360
Have them partner
with your husband on the project.

581
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,600
Things might get easier.

582
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,760
But would Rath agree to that?

583
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,800
Try to test the waters
with your husband's rival first,

584
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,080
then let him decide later.

585
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,640
If you want to help him,
you should give it your all.

586
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,440
I will arrange for him
to come and speak with you.

587
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,280
Dad, I'm at the shop now.

588
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,000
Will Mr. Trin really come?

589
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,440
Okay. I'll let you know how it goes.

590
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,760
Good afternoon, Mrs. Patchanin.

591
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,240
Good afternoon. Mr. Trin, right?

592
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,880
Yes, it's me. Your dad contacted me.

593
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,320
He said you have an offer
for buying the land?

594
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,880
That's right. Please have a seat.

595
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,040
I probably can't.

596
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,400
You'll have to talk to my boss.

597
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,520
And who is your boss?

598
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,400
-You…
-Yes.

599
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,040
It's me.

600
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,080
You've probably never seen
your husband like this before.

601
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,600
A gambler,
not the hard-working businessman

602
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,280
he pretends to be,

603
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,320
even to his own wife.

604
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,720
If you don't want to get hurt,

605
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,760
stay still and be quiet.

606
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,680
NEXT EPISODE

607
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,120
I know who the woman is.

608
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,760
How?

609
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,600
If you're here to pity me, then don't.

610
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,880
I have no pity for you.

611
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,880
But I do have an offer,
if you're interested.

612
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,480
