1
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,640
Your leg still hurts.
I can give you a ride.

2
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,280
It's okay.

3
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,160
I can get home fine.

4
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,600
Can't you go a little easier on me

5
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,560
Miss Pat?

6
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,280
I'm not being difficult.

7
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,280
Taweerath's case is serious.

8
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,360
This time the cops won't go easy on him.

9
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,120
You can quit worrying now,

10
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,800
even about me.

11
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,480
I know

12
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,600
what you're thinking.

13
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,040
Stop trying to read people's minds,

14
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,680
especially mine.

15
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,600
Don't worry about me.

16
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm not.

17
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,120
I'm more worried about myself.

18
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,680
Don't let your past mistakes

19
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,240
and your fear of the future

20
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,160
stop you from being happy in the present.

21
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,200
If we're sincere with each other,

22
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,480
there's nothing to fear.

23
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,800
Yes, Kiki?

24
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,079
Hello, Pat.

25
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,520
I just had some work come up.

26
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,120
You had work come up?

27
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,440
Yeah. Can you get home on your own?

28
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,400
Um…

29
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,960
Sure. I can go home on my own.

30
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,760
Don't worry. Okay.

31
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,680
Kiki can't give you a ride now.

32
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,200
You might want to come with me.

33
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,320
Fine.

34
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,320
Here, I'll take those.

35
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,280
- I got it.
- Your leg still hurts.

36
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,240
Come on.

37
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,440
Your bag too.

38
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's go.

39
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,360
So even Ingdao can fall.

40
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,040
The light that burns others
gets put out today.

41
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,200
Having fun talking about Aunt Dao?

42
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,480
Did you forget I work here too?

43
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm screwed.

44
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Do we have to cancel today?

45
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,240
Wait, Ava! What's the matter this time?

46
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,640
I don't have the heart to work.

47
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm leaving.
Everyone's gossiping about Aunt Dao!

48
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,040
Hey, calm down. You can't do this!

49
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,480
This is your last shoot.

50
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,160
And we have no idea
how it will go with the new drama.

51
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,360
You're not a superstar yet,

52
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,400
so don't be problematic. Got it?

53
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,800
So if you're famous,

54
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,360
you can do whatever you want,
is that right?

55
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,800
No one's talking to you, nosy!

56
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,240
I didn't mean to be nosy.

57
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,320
But since we're shooting a scene together,

58
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,760
I just wanted to come and tell you
to focus on your work.

59
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,640
Don't mix your work
with your personal life.

60
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,840
Ava's a professional.

61
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,800
She doesn't need you to teach her.

62
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,160
If she really is a professional,

63
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
she wouldn't be crying to go home

64
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,800
when her job isn't done.

65
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Or,

66
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,840
did you learn from your aunt

67
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,280
to believe you can cause trouble
if you're a superstar?

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,760
Are you insulting her? Huh!

69
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,360
Isn't it true?

70
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,200
Both you and your aunt

71
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
create chaos for everyone.

72
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,520
But she probably can't do anything now

73
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,880
since she has a case to fight.

74
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,600
Hey!

75
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,320
If you're responsible enough,

76
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,560
get back to work. Everyone's waiting.

77
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,160
That Pu girl sure is horrible.

78
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Do your best, Ava.

79
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,720
Let's go.

80
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,120
Pat! Pat!

81
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,440
Please listen to me. Pat!

82
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,720
What is it, Som?

83
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,320
You want her to be the leading lady
instead of Ingdao?

84
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,040
Yes. I'm sorry about last time.

85
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,520
But please help me out here.

86
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,080
Dao's being charged with a crime.

87
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,800
Even if she's bailed out,
I wouldn't know what to do.

88
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,920
I have work to continue. Please?

89
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,640
Som,

90
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,520
you're the one
who fired her on the fitting day.

91
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,920
Come on now.

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,680
That was long ago.

93
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,680
Why would you bring it up, Kiki?

94
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,600
Dear dear!

95
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,680
Think of it as a fresh start for us.
Please? Please?

96
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,560
Please? Can we start again? I beg you.

97
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,120
Please help me.

98
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,960
Please?

99
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,040
Fine then, Som.

100
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Thank you, Pat.

101
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Thank you.

102
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,280
Then I'll go tell the reporters

103
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,080
that Pat's the leading lady.

104
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,920
Sure, go right ahead.

105
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,000
No more changes, okay?

106
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,280
No more changes.

107
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,200
Now,

108
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,840
I’m not only caught up in your case,

109
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,960
but I also lost my leading lady role.

110
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,040
How will you take responsibility for that?

111
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,400
You told me it wouldn't affect me.

112
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,880
Don't worry.

113
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,680
We'll be okay no matter what.

114
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,240
What about my career

115
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,280
and reputation?

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,560
Just 'okay' isn't enough.

117
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,840
Everything will turn out fine.

118
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,840
Are you sure

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,960
you can handle this case?

120
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,520
You can trust me.

121
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,520
I promise.

122
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,840
Ingdao gave an interview to the reporters.

123
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,920
That means Taweerath's off the hook too.

124
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,160
Nikorn told me

125
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,800
that guy found someone
to take the fall for him.

126
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,960
His money, power, and connections

127
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,920
sure are something.

128
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,680
No matter what, I won't stop here.

129
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,200
A guy like Taweerath

130
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,920
has plenty of dirty secrets.

131
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,840
There’s definitely more
I can use against him.

132
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,960
Just be careful,

133
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,160
because he's definitely looking into this

134
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,360
to find out who informed the cops.

135
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,360
I'm more worried about Miss Pat.

136
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,080
Now that Ingdao's off the hook,

137
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,880
she might be back on set.

138
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,040
Up there a little more.

139
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,240
That's good.

140
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,840
- Fabulous.
- Thank you.

141
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,480
Dao, you're back!

142
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,120
How are you? I was so worried.

143
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,360
Sorry for all the trouble, Som.

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,400
No worries.

145
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,600
Why is Dao here, Kiki?

146
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,520
For the shoot of course.

147
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
But isn't she under investigation?

148
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,360
Didn't you see on the news? Here.

149
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,160
She just got out.

150
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
See?

151
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Something unexpected happened.

152
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,160
So naturally,
we had to make a few changes.

153
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,080
Would Dao be able to take it, Som?

154
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,040
She was a leading actress,

155
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,320
but now she's a supporting actress.

156
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,320
It's fine, Som.

157
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,040
After all, this isn’t the first time

158
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,040
I’ve had to give someone
my leading lady role.

159
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,800
Dao's such a nice person.
She's got a good spirit.

160
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,120
And now

161
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,560
she's taking the supporting role

162
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,360
so someone else gets the privilege.

163
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,440
Well, who told the leading lady

164
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,400
to do something so risky?

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,400
Thank God she didn't go to jail.

166
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,480
Who knows how much the bail was?

167
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,040
Kiki, are you trying to get sued?

168
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,000
Come on now.

169
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,280
What I meant was

170
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,640
she's spent so much money making merit

171
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,120
to ward off bad luck.

172
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,440
Don't look so guilty--

173
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,720
Sorry, I mean,

174
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,680
don't misunderstand me.

175
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,320
I don't have a problem, Som,

176
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
as long as work can go smoothly

177
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,840
without any issues.

178
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,600
I agree with Pat.

179
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
But who knows,

180
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,960
anything can happen.

181
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,640
You should take a break.

182
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,400
- Just you wait.
- Check out my leading lady.

183
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,680
Don't mind them. Let’s go. This way.

184
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,280
Thank you for helping me.

185
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,400
I promise I'll make it up to you.

186
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,080
Okay.

187
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,600
So you're the one

188
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,920
who filmed me that day?

189
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,440
Do you know

190
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,800
how much trouble you caused me?

191
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,400
Please don't hurt me.
I was hired to do it.

192
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,480
- Who hired you?
- Mr. Tham.

193
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,600
Hurry, go!

194
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,960
That was it for your shoot. Are you tired?

195
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,480
I'm not. It was just a few scenes.

196
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,920
Really? Wanna go home now?

197
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,040
Wait,

198
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,560
or are you waiting to see someone?

199
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,840
I'm not.

200
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,280
Are you sure?

201
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,280
Then I'd better

202
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,000
go change so we can head home.

203
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Noom! Mr. Tham got shot!

204
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,160
In the parking lot.

205
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,160
Mr. Tham!

206
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,160
Pat, wait for me!

207
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Yes, Mr. Rath?

208
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,520
He got away.

209
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,000
Was it Rath's doing?

210
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm not sure.

211
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,480
But if you ask how many enemies I have,

212
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
there's just one.

213
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,880
It's because you got involved
with my issues.

214
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,280
I'm telling you,

215
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,600
it had nothing to do with you.

216
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,800
Even without you,
I would have done the same.

217
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,960
I have to pay Taweerath back
for Fah's sake.

218
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,480
But because you got involved with me,

219
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,320
you had to show your face

220
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,360
and reveal that you're his enemy.

221
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,160
Sooner or later,

222
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,760
with or without you,

223
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,880
I would have done the same.

224
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,760
This still would have happened.

225
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,160
But I don't want you
to risk yourself like this again.

226
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,520
I'm ready for the risk

227
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,080
if it will make that scumbag
pay for what he did.

228
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,720
Both to Fah

229
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,280
and to you.

230
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,080
And this is not just revenge.

231
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
I also want to protect you.

232
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,960
I thought you were hurt.

233
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Why are you standing up?

234
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,680
It's small, so it doesn't hurt much.

235
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
The doctor said I could leave
in a couple of days.

236
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,720
Then I'm relieved.

237
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,040
You have a guest, so I should go home.

238
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,160
Miss Pat, wait.

239
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,160
I heard from Tham

240
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,320
that now

241
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,640
you and Taweerath are already divorced.

242
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,200
Yes.

243
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,320
Although he fooled you,

244
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,320
you're luckier than my daughter.

245
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,840
I've heard quite a bit about Miss Fah.

246
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,600
Now that you're

247
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,520
off the hook and out of his life,

248
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,760
you should start your life over.

249
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,520
After all, you were born lucky.

250
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,880
You were once a famous celebrity,

251
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,600
and your father is well-known in society.

252
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,880
So you wouldn't be expecting anything
from my nephew, would you?

253
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,480
I'll leave it at that.

254
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,120
I hope you understand.

255
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,320
It's not so hard to understand.

256
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,560
And no matter
how difficult my situation is,

257
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,440
I'd never think to rely on someone else.

258
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,360
Whatever it is you're worried about,
please forget it.

259
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,840
And I only came here today

260
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,840
as an acquaintance of his.

261
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,600
If you'll excuse me.

262
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,480
In the end,

263
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,880
you did mess up.

264
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,600
But I got him hurt pretty badly, Mr. Rath.

265
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,760
But I wanted him dead.

266
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,000
Mr. Rath, don't!

267
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,880
You're so useless!

268
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,840
Now that he got away,

269
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,080
he won't stop! Damn it!

270
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,600
Rath, Rath!

271
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,880
Are you killing your worker?

272
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,200
Get out.

273
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,720
I was just pissed he messed up.

274
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,160
What did he mess up to get you this angry?

275
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,560
It's about Tham.

276
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,600
What about him?

277
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,360
You should go.

278
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,360
What if Mr. Rath or someone sees?

279
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,680
Why did you have to let him
hurt you this bad?

280
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
What about you?

281
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,040
Why did you give up your reputation

282
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,800
and your life
for a guy like Mr. Taweerath?

283
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
About that,

284
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
you should know best, shouldn't you?

285
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,600
I found out everything.

286
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
About…

287
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,320
our child.

288
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,840
I have nothing left.

289
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,720
Not my child,

290
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,600
not my career.

291
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,800
The leading lady role that was once mine,

292
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,280
somebody else has it now.

293
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,000
It's not your fault at all.

294
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,640
You're right. It's Patchanin's fault.

295
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,640
It's all because of her.

296
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,920
If you're unhappy,
you should quit the industry.

297
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,400
I'll take care of you.

298
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,000
No.

299
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,560
I can't let our child die for nothing.

300
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,480
They have to pay
for what happened to me and our child.

301
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,160
We can't fight them.

302
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,120
Let's not mess with them, Dao.

303
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,880
See? It's because you're a coward!

304
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,680
That's why
we always have to hide like this.

305
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,160
You have no money

306
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,240
and not even any courage.

307
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,840
Who can you take care of?

308
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,800
I won't let anyone

309
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,360
trample over me anymore.

310
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,000
I'll take back whatever's mine.

311
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,320
Mommy's sorry.

312
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Mommy really tried her best.

313
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,080
Is it because of me

314
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,040
that you're letting him
treat you like this?

315
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,360
I do it for the money.

316
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,520
Since the day we broke up,

317
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,320
I learned just how important money is.

318
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,960
But even till now,

319
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,680
you're no different than before.

320
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,800
Dao,

321
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,160
what if I am different now?

322
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,320
I know all of Mr. Taweerath's secrets.

323
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,400
Whatever he can give you,

324
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,000
I can give you too.

325
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,120
So can we get back together like before?

326
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,760
You?

327
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,240
Have it all like Taweerath?

328
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,000
There's just no way.

329
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,840
But if you still miss what we once had,

330
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,400
I ask just one thing.

331
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,440
Don't try to get in my way.

332
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,680
You said you'd head back.

333
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,640
I'm just grabbing my bag.

334
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,040
I saw you talking to Pumeth.

335
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,680
Don't tell me

336
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
you worry about him.

337
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,920
It's what people who mess up deserve.

338
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,760
That's exactly why

339
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,920
I was talking to him.

340
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,160
I don't want him to mess up again,

341
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,960
or it'll cause me trouble too.

342
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,520
Is that it?

343
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,200
Also, I didn't leave yet

344
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,800
because I just had an idea

345
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,920
on how we can get back at our enemy.

346
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,880
How will you get back at Tham?

347
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,680
As for the CSR activities
and the Family Stability Association,

348
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,200
Mr. Wiwat ordered you
to handle them specifically because

349
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,040
they have to do with our company's image.

350
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,640
Perhaps because of
the news about me from before.

351
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,000
Yes, something like that.

352
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,640
The association's already here.

353
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,480
It will be an easy deal for you.

354
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,640
Good afternoon. I'm Tham.

355
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,440
It's our pleasure
to be working with your association.

356
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,360
Sorry, but we have to leave.

357
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,120
Hold on,

358
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,840
we haven't talked yet.

359
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,080
Did we do something to upset you?

360
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,560
Our association promotes
honesty and morality,

361
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,840
which are important basics of a family.

362
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,080
Working with a company

363
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,480
whose executive behaves immorally

364
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,400
isn't what we do.

365
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,000
Me?

366
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,080
Behave immorally?

367
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,320
You should see the news about you

368
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,520
before you invite people
to work with your company.

369
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,840
Wait.

370
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,920
Hold on!

371
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,800
Mr. Tham.

372
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,920
WHY THEY DIVORCED

373
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,600
Hey!

374
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,560
Someone posted the news and videos

375
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,200
defaming you and your company.

376
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,320
Should we sue?

377
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,760
That would lead to more news about us

378
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,320
and upset my uncle even more.

379
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,880
The shareholders and board of directors

380
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,560
want you to write a letter
to explain about the news.

381
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,000
If you can't explain this,

382
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,280
it will affect your position.

383
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,040
But I bought the videos that day.

384
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,000
How did these get out?

385
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,400
There's you carrying Pat too.

386
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,360
Someone else must have secretly filmed us

387
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,760
besides that reporter.

388
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,600
Just hurry and leave.

389
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,120
I'll take care of the reporters.

390
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,720
I don't want to run away.

391
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,480
We're not running away.

392
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,160
We're just getting back on our feet.

393
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,440
Please don't see them yet.

394
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,600
I got so screwed the last time you did.

395
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,760
Let's go, Miss Pat.

396
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,200
Ah!

397
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,440
- Are you here to shoot news?
- Yes. Is Pat on her break yet?

398
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,880
She finished her shoot this morning.

399
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,920
That's not true. We still see her car.

400
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,280
It's probably not hers.

401
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,920
Maybe it's another car.
Did you remember correctly?

402
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,840
Guys, there's Pat!

403
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,440
Wait, wait, wait!

404
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,040
Ugh!

405
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,160
Pat!

406
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,560
Pat.

407
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,360
Let's go.

408
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,360
The video I secretly took

409
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,240
is like killing two birds

410
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,440
with one stone, isn't it?

411
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,360
Well done, my niece.

412
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,680
Are you okay?

413
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
I'm alright.

414
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,240
And don't worry about my medication.

415
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,480
I always consult my doctor.

416
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,080
I've had my fair share
of bad news about me,

417
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,400
so a little more won't hurt.

418
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,240
I'm more worried about Mr. Tham
who will go down with me.

419
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,240
I heard quite a few of his CSR activities
were canceled

420
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,200
and he had to write an explanation letter.

421
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,320
He's in trouble because of me.

422
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,520
I shouldn't have gotten into his life.

423
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,040
It's not your fault.

424
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,920
This must be their doing.

425
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,960
They're constantly harassing
you and Mr. Tham.

426
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,640
I think so too.

427
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,160
But no matter what,

428
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,320
I won't stop going after them.

429
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,000
See?

430
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,560
I can help you get your revenge too.

431
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,320
I guess I should thank your niece too.

432
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,360
That's right.

433
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,640
Ava's reward, as you asked.

434
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
That's it?

435
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,040
And this

436
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,240
is for you.

437
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,600
I hope this is not
some cheap diamond necklace

438
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,360
that belonged to Patchanin
and kept in a box like last time.

439
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,360
I bought a new one just for you.

440
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Thank you.

441
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,240
Actually,

442
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,000
for me,
this isn't enough to get him back.

443
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,160
Don't worry,

444
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,640
I'll help you break him into pieces

445
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,120
just as I'll take everything away

446
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,000
from your ex-wife.

447
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,040
Dao, one day you'll see

448
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,920
that I can do everything I promised you.

449
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,080
Quit sponsoring the show.

450
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,520
I can't.

451
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,200
The recent scandal alone is bad enough.

452
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,800
And if we keep sponsoring the show,

453
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,080
they'll further believe that you

454
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,320
were seeing Patchanin
before they divorced.

455
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,280
But I already explained in detail
in my letter to the board of directors.

456
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,960
The board members

457
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,000
are still giving you a chance

458
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,040
because of your past performance.

459
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,280
But the outside world won't do the same.

460
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,520
It will damage your reputation even more.

461
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
Don't forget,

462
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,000
all the shareholders and board members

463
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,360
also have the right

464
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,800
to remove you from your position.

465
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,880
Or are you ready to quit being CEO?

466
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,520
But if we quit sponsoring the show,

467
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,600
they'll think we got scared away
by the news.

468
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,080
And we're a large company.

469
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,840
It will look bad if we break a promise.

470
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,440
Then hold a press conference.

471
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,600
Tell them it's not true.

472
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,520
And bring Patchanin along
so she can confirm

473
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,840
that there's nothing going on
between you two.

474
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,600
Then I'll have to ask her first,
to see if she wants to.

475
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,639
Whether she wants to or not,
it doesn't matter.

476
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,639
What matters is

477
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,960
what you can do to make this go away
as soon as possible.

478
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,639
Got it?

479
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,360
You hiding from me

480
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,840
is not making things any better.

481
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,840
But seeing you now

482
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,880
will just make things worse.

483
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,520
At the hospital,

484
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,920
my uncle said something to you, didn't he?

485
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,880
Let's just say he worries about you,

486
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,280
and you should follow his advice.

487
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,480
And why should we believe
in what goes against our feelings?

488
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,200
Why can't we be sure about our feelings?

489
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,720
Especially my feelings for you.

490
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,440
I believe you feel it too.

491
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,480
Otherwise, at the hospital
you wouldn't have…

492
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,320
It's all in your head.

493
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,160
Wait.

494
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,040
Before you go,

495
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,960
I want you to hear my offer

496
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,440
if you still want to defeat them.

497
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,840
The script got changed?

498
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,280
The writers edited the script,
so I brought it for you.

499
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,720
But why is there just Miss Pat's?

500
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,320
Well, everyone else's script
stays the same.

501
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,560
But for the leading lady,

502
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,720
we needed quite a few changes.

503
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,160
Must be because of the recent news.

504
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,640
I saw lots of people
leaving angry comments on your Instagram.

505
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,480
Hmm, or did you change it
so that the leading lady

506
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,200
dies right from the start?

507
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,240
If the leading lady dies,

508
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,200
people may stop watching.

509
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,480
But if the villain dies in agony,

510
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,880
people might like it.

511
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,320
- Hey!
- Stop it.

512
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,600
Right now!

513
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,200
Ugh!

514
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,120
I hope you understand.

515
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,040
And you two,

516
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,840
keep that same energy
when you fight in a scene.

517
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,440
Go, go.

518
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,640
Come on, come this way.

519
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,680
Now!

520
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,360
Ugh.

521
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,200
You're the leading lady,
yet so many of your lines got cut.

522
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,640
So are you really one now?

523
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,840
Should we just back out?
We haven't done that many scenes.

524
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,320
That will just please whoever
spread the news about me and Mr. Tham.

525
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,520
Aw.

526
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,640
But to work for someone
who doesn't respect you,

527
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,840
I don't think it's right.

528
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,680
But I do understand Som.

529
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,040
Look, I'll go talk to Som myself

530
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,400
so I could do as she pleases.

531
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,680
Miss Pat.

532
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,360
There's a gift for you.
Apparently, it's from a fan.

533
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,600
Aw.

534
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,800
See, Pat? There are still so many
who love and support you.

535
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,960
I bet

536
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,880
it's a gift to cheer you up.

537
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,760
Aw.

538
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,400
Should I open it?

539
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,760
SLUT!!

540
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,440
My god! Who sent this?

541
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,080
This is going too far!

542
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,760
Since you've invited me
to your parties a lot…

543
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,760
If you'll really invite me, then I'll go.

544
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,680
NEXT EPISODE

545
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,280
As soon as these two

546
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,880
stop being useful to each other,

547
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,720
they'll probably kill each other.

548
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,920
Everyone can start again.

549
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,120
Especially me.

550
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,520
You really think
anyone would still believe

551
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,040
a scumbag like you?

552
