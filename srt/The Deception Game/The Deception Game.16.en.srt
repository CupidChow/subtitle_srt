1
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
No fair.

2
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,640
Why are you drinking soda?

3
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,440
Let's get you a new glass.

4
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
This one's better.

5
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,520
Chug! Chug! Chug!

6
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,280
Chug! Chug!

7
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,960
Pu.

8
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,200
Let's leave.

9
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,800
No one talks about work here.

10
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,120
What are you, her mother?

11
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,880
How can you tell her to leave?

12
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,240
Was one punch not enough for you?

13
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,120
Go ahead then.

14
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,400
You're still new to the industry.

15
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,880
This could be your downfall.

16
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,520
If it's our downfall,

17
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,760
then it will be for someone else here too.

18
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,560
He took a picture of me.

19
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,840
If you want to party,

20
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,320
I'll leave you alone.

21
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,120
But delete her picture.

22
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,680
I don't want my company's presenter
in any trouble.

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,280
Or should I call the higher-ups
at the station

24
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,000
and tell them about you?

25
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,440
Stay away from Pu.

26
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,440
Let's go, Pu.

27
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,680
- Why did you do it?
- Ava, listen.

28
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,520
- Aunt Dao!
- Ava!

29
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,560
It's you.

30
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,040
You filmed Ava and I talking, right?

31
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,440
Give me your phone.

32
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,480
No way.

33
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,280
It's important evidence

34
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,880
proving that you and Taweerath

35
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
killed Miss Pat's father.

36
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,640
I told you to give it, now!

37
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,760
Chat won't pick up. I don't know why.

38
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,720
But

39
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,920
he told me before I got here
that he's already here.

40
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,760
Give it to me.

41
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,440
I told you to give it!

42
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,400
- Give it!
- Hey!

43
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,720
- Do you wanna die? Give it!
- No.

44
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,840
Give it!

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,440
Chat!

46
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,240
Chat!

47
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,360
- Pu.
- Chat!

48
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,760
Chat!

49
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,760
Chat…

50
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,440
- Ava?
- Chat!

51
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,040
Ava.

52
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,840
What are you doing?

53
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
I'm calling an ambulance.

54
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,840
Listen to me.

55
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,640
We do nothing.

56
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
We'll need some time

57
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,720
to find out the cause
of the victim's fall.

58
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,320
I saw Ava on the rooftop.

59
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,760
Ava?

60
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,640
She almost got Chat arrested again.

61
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,040
It must be her.

62
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,120
Are you harassing us?

63
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,760
You want my niece and I

64
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,640
to be on the news
with the police visiting us this late?

65
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,440
We're just here to find the truth.

66
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,840
Someone saw Miss Ava

67
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,080
on the rooftop when Mr. Chat fell.

68
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,520
Excuse me?

69
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,120
Mr. Chat who?

70
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,480
Quit lying. You know him.

71
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,880
Ava shoved him, didn't she?

72
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,360
How could she do that?

73
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,520
And who saw it?

74
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,440
I did.

75
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,040
Or are you denying
that Ava went to the bar?

76
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,840
If she won't come out,

77
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,840
I'll drag her out here myself.

78
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Stop it.

79
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,520
Pu.

80
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,880
I think you should ask Miss Ava
to talk to us.

81
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
She's not here.

82
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,840
Why are you making excuses?

83
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,200
This is a case where someone died
and Ava's involved.

84
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Or are you trying to cover up your crime

85
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,520
like you did with my father?

86
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,400
What an awful heart you have,

87
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,400
going around calling people murderers.

88
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,080
Ava's in no state to hurt anyone now.

89
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,680
What happened?

90
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,360
What's this about, Aunt Dao?

91
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,960
Why did they come to our house?

92
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,960
See?

93
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,360
She's injured this badly.

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,400
How could she do such a thing?

95
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,360
What happened?

96
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,400
She got a really bad headache

97
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,880
while she was out partying,

98
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,440
so she called me to pick her up.

99
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,520
She doesn't really like
that kind of place,

100
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,920
but she can't say no to her friends.

101
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,200
And on our way back,

102
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,360
the road was really dark.

103
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,200
The street lights were broken

104
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,800
so we had an accident.

105
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,480
I don't want to go to jail.

106
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,080
I'm calling Mom.

107
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,920
- I'm calling Mom.
- Ava, you can't.

108
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
You can't.

109
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,960
Listen to me.

110
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,120
We'll be fine,

111
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,280
but we need to get hurt a bit first.

112
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,960
What are you going to do?

113
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,200
Luckily, I wasn't injured too badly,

114
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,920
unlike Ava, as you can see.

115
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,920
If you don't believe me,

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,240
ask the nurses.

117
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
She's right.

118
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,440
I was the one
who picked them up at the scene.

119
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,280
And I came home

120
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,800
to grab my things because

121
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,160
I thought I'd have to look after her
at the hospital.

122
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,200
But she called and said
she wanted to rest at home,

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,400
so I had her come home by ambulance

124
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
because it was very late

125
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
and I didn't want to go back and forth.

126
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,520
More like you had an accident
trying to run away from your crime.

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,160
What are you saying?

128
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,120
I don't understand.

129
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,160
Do you recall
what time the accident happened?

130
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,440
Around 10:00 p.m.

131
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
But it was also around 10:00 p.m.

132
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,680
when Chat fell.

133
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,800
And I saw Ava

134
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,920
when Chat fell.

135
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,080
You were probably seeing things,

136
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,920
because at that time,

137
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Ava's the one who called an ambulance

138
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,800
to pick us up.

139
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,120
How could she have done it?

140
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,720
She's right.
We had a call from Miss Ava's number

141
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,000
at 10:00 p.m.,

142
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,640
but the line got cut off.

143
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,280
Then we got another call at 10:20 p.m.

144
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,600
It hurts, Aunt Dao.

145
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,440
My feet are hurt.

146
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,680
Ava, call an ambulance.

147
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,760
The same number you called before

148
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,720
and say what I tell you to. Got it?

149
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,480
Yes.

150
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Take a look.

151
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,880
May I?

152
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,720
When the accident happened,

153
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,080
it hurt a lot, and I got so dizzy.

154
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,360
Aunt Dao was unconscious.

155
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,880
I tried to call an ambulance,

156
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,800
but suddenly,

157
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,560
I just passed out.

158
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,560
When I came to,

159
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,760
I quickly called an ambulance.

160
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,120
I hope no one really believes that

161
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,640
we almost got ourselves killed
just for that.

162
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,320
But I'm afraid

163
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,640
I'll need you both
at the station for questioning.

164
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,040
Sure.

165
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,400
We did nothing wrong,
so we're always ready.

166
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,200
Thank you.

167
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,680
There's no evidence proving Ava was there,

168
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,680
so the case is going in another direction.

169
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,680
Ava's alibi makes it seem like

170
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,600
I was just seeing things.

171
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,120
If you really saw her on the rooftop,

172
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,520
then she has to be involved in this.

173
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,120
But there's no evidence left.

174
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,880
We probably can't do much more.

175
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,200
Well, Chat's phone is still missing.

176
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,800
The real culprit might have it.

177
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,320
Yes, Miss Pat?

178
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,760
Oh, Pu?

179
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,400
No, Pu's not coming to see me.

180
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,840
We'll get rid of the phone here.

181
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,400
No one will know, right?

182
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,200
We're throwing it in the river.

183
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,280
Who will find it?

184
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,600
You!

185
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,680
Pu, don't.

186
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,760
Miss Pat, let go of me!

187
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,400
- No.
- I told you to let go!

188
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,320
I'd never let you become a murderer.

189
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,640
Let go!

190
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,960
Miss Pat…

191
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,840
Both of you, go away!

192
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,280
Before I call the police.

193
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,400
Let's go, Pu.

194
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,000
Aunt Dao…

195
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,720
How did you find me?

196
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,480
I went to your house
and couldn't find you.

197
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,040
I called Jane, and you weren't with him.

198
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,040
So I was sure you were following Dao.

199
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,560
Then I saw you driving here to follow her.

200
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
I'm going back there to deal with them.

201
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,280
Pu, stop it!

202
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,800
I don't want you to ruin your future
and turn into a murderer.

203
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,800
I went through something similar before.

204
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,520
Don't you see? If you don't stop

205
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,880
you'll lose everything.

206
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,680
The satisfaction isn't worth it.

207
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,960
Quit it with the fancy speech.

208
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,960
You're just scared.

209
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,640
You didn't have the guts
to do what I'm about to.

210
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,520
If you dealt with them in the first place,

211
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,440
my brother wouldn't have died.

212
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920
You are to blame

213
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,320
for his death too.

214
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,480
Pu.

215
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,360
If you won't help me,

216
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,640
don't act like you mean well.

217
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,160
Why didn't we dump it somewhere else?

218
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,400
Ava,

219
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,640
lower your voice.

220
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,200
Besides Pu,

221
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,520
we have no idea
who else might be following us.

222
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,760
Don't act suspicious again.

223
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,160
Then what should we do now?

224
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,880
Should we ask Rath for help?

225
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,800
No way.

226
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,720
We can't tell anyone else about it.

227
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,200
Got it, Ava?

228
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,240
But I'm scared, Aunt Dao.

229
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,640
I'm so scared I can't do anything.

230
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,160
Don't worry, Ava.

231
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,960
I have a plan.

232
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,080
What do you want?

233
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,040
I wanted to talk to you.

234
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
About your brother.

235
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,880
Ava and I had nothing to do with it.

236
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,560
Really?

237
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,520
But Mr. Tham saw Ava
on the rooftop when he fell.

238
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,079
I believe you were there too.

239
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,359
There's no use lying to me.

240
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,680
What if I'm not the one who's lying,

241
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,200
but it's actually Mr. Tham?

242
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,000
Why would he lie to me?

243
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,200
That's why they say,

244
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,400
"Don't be too nice

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,480
or too naive

246
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,520
because people will think you're stupid

247
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,320
and they'll exploit you."

248
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,560
You know

249
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,960
how much Patchanin hates me.

250
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,080
She even wants to kill me

251
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,720
so she can take revenge

252
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,600
and take everything back.

253
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,080
It's only natural

254
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,000
Mr. Tham would lie
to help her get rid of me.

255
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,000
What are you saying?

256
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,600
No leading lady

257
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,840
would kill someone by herself, right?

258
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,800
You haven't found
your brother's phone yet, have you?

259
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,840
Didn't you suspect a thing?

260
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,800
It's as if someone's trying

261
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,200
to get you to believe it's me and Ava

262
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,000
who caused your brother's death.

263
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,520
Why don't you try finding the truth

264
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,520
about the one who's exploiting you?

265
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,600
Thank you for taking me
to get my wound dressed.

266
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,160
You have to go two more times.

267
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,680
I'll take you to the hospital
for the next appointments.

268
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,280
What about Pu? How is she?

269
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,840
I haven't seen her since that day.

270
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,040
Pu!

271
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,640
I'm sorry about that day.

272
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,560
I wanted you to come to your senses.

273
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,360
I didn't want you to be rash.

274
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,560
She's really worried about you.

275
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,440
Don't worry,

276
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,600
Pat and I will try to find the truth
about your brother's death.

277
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,880
Pu.

278
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,960
Pu,

279
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,440
what are you looking for?

280
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,360
Pu?

281
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
- Pu.
- Pu.

282
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,480
What are you doing? Why are you
going through Miss Pat's stuff?

283
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,240
I'm looking for evidence.

284
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,520
Evidence?

285
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,680
What do you suspect?
Why are you doing this?

286
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,080
If I told you,
you wouldn't tell the truth anyway.

287
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,600
Pu, wait.

288
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,280
Pu, wait!

289
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,560
Pu, let's talk about this.

290
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,800
Pu!

291
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,720
What's this about?

292
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,960
If you keep quiet,
we won't know what you want.

293
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,800
What are you looking for?

294
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,720
Chat's phone.

295
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,720
I couldn't find it because you took it.

296
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,160
You both exploited me.

297
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,120
You used Chat's death as an excuse

298
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,080
to make me suspect Ingdao and Ava.

299
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,560
You want me to get rid of them for you?

300
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,640
Haven't I done enough for you, Miss Pat?

301
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,840
You used Chat's death to manipulate me.

302
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,960
You went too far.

303
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,400
Please listen to me.

304
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,440
I don't know anything about the phone.

305
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,240
Someone once told me,

306
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,920
"It really hurts when you're fooled,

307
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
especially if you've been sincere."

308
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,800
From now on,
I won't let you fool me again.

309
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,000
I won't believe a word you say anymore.

310
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,880
Pu…

311
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,120
- Pu!
- Miss Pat.

312
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,320
There's no use saying anything now.

313
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,000
She must be very sad
about her brother's death.

314
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,640
She's probably distraught.

315
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,520
Let's leave her alone for now.

316
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,960
Mrs. Piangkae, thank you for coming today.

317
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,960
It's my pleasure

318
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,240
to get to know you officially.

319
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,680
I'm a regular at J Cup.

320
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
The pleasure's mine too.

321
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,360
I've been following your business as well.

322
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,320
This is my son.

323
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Jane.

324
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Actually,

325
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,280
Taweerath and I have met before.

326
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,080
Oh, really?

327
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,200
Yes.

328
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,240
Okay.

329
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,160
It's all familiar faces here today,
Mrs. Piangkae.

330
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,520
Janepob's close friend is coming too.

331
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,880
Why did you let the kid join us, Dao?

332
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,000
Pu's a junior in the industry.

333
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,480
Also,

334
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,840
we play in a drama together,

335
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,440
so I wanted her to get to know all of us.

336
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,520
Thank you for inviting me, Miss Dao.

337
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,000
Dao's really something.

338
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,560
She got Pu to fall into her clutches.

339
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,360
Or could it be

340
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,480
that kid fell out with Patchanin?

341
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,600
Right.

342
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,760
What are you trying to do, Pu?

343
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,320
I'm joining Miss Dao and Mr. Rath's party.

344
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,000
My brother told me…

345
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,160
- You misunderstood Pat.
- Misunderstood?

346
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,720
More like I finally realized.

347
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,120
Why would I help others

348
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,880
when helping myself is better?

349
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,720
Smart people

350
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,680
must learn to create
their own opportunities

351
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,800
instead of waiting idly.

352
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,440
Pat's here.

353
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,760
So this is why

354
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,960
you wanted me to return your award here?

355
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,280
Did you two

356
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,120
invite Patchanin too?

357
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,520
I didn't.

358
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,240
Mr. Rath and Miss Dao
didn't invite you here.

359
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,920
Please leave.

360
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,000
You'll just kill the mood here.

361
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,040
I didn't want to come.

362
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,840
When I'm done, I'll leave.

363
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,920
Are you sure about what you're doing now?

364
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,960
What is it I'm doing?

365
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,080
I'm just socializing,

366
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,560
meeting new people

367
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,120
who will give me a chance
far better than what I got.

368
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,600
Isn't it natural
for people in the industry?

369
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,240
Or did you want me to stay dumb
and close to people who exploit me,

370
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,160
only to find out I've been discarded

371
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,600
once I'm no use to you anymore?

372
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,520
You really think
that's how I see you and treat you?

373
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,160
Quit your bullshit.

374
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,680
No one would buy it.

375
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,320
You can have it back now,

376
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,680
the award you wanted back.

377
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Take it.

378
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,760
You were so eager to get it, right?

379
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,720
Then bend down and pick it up yourself.

380
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,800
What?

381
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,640
I have one last wish for you.

382
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,200
May you achieve everything

383
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,720
as you wish.

384
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,880
I'll let it slide one last time.

385
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
If you treat me like this again,

386
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,000
I won't hold back.

387
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,040
Miss Pat, please leave.

388
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,600
Calm down, Pu.

389
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,200
Is this your doing?

390
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,080
Isn't it better this way?

391
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,760
Every time you trust someone,

392
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,760
those people will always teach you

393
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,360
not to trust anyone ever.

394
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,240
I understood that so clearly today.

395
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,760
But you can't say that
about everyone, Miss Pat.

396
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,560
Why not?

397
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
Can't you see

398
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,920
how many people I trusted

399
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,720
that have betrayed me?

400
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,600
Not me though.

401
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,920
You can trust me

402
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,560
and count on me.

403
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,960
Enough.

404
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,960
You drank too much.

405
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,960
Let me drive you home.

406
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,280
Let me do what I want for once.

407
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,440
No matter how drunk I am,

408
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,920
you'll still take care of me, right?

409
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,040
You said I can trust you and count on you.

410
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,200
Prove it then.

411
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,520
Miss Pat, Miss Pat.

412
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,400
Careful. Step.

413
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
Another step.

414
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,480
This way.

415
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,360
Watch your step.

416
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,520
I am.

417
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,200
Why am I seeing

418
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,520
two of you?

419
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,400
How could there be two of me, Miss Pat?

420
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,080
There.

421
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,240
I'm really seeing two of you.

422
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,280
Let's try this.

423
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,920
Your hand.

424
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,480
Now,

425
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,280
how many do you see?

426
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,880
There really is just one of you.

427
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,520
I must be so drunk.

428
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,920
And you'll get tired
of a headstrong woman like me.

429
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,960
Will you believe me

430
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,360
if I say I won't?

431
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,000
You will.

432
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,440
And you'll ditch me like the others.

433
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,120
I'm not like the others.

434
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,240
And I'll prove to you

435
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,520
that I can do what I say I can

436
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,360
if you'd just dare

437
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,880
to confirm it yourself.

438
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,720
Miss Pat!

439
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,720
Miss Pat…

440
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,840
You're pretty heavy.

441
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,120
Careful. If you're too drunk and fall in,

442
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,160
what if no one sees?

443
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,120
I was getting too comfortable, wasn't I?

444
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
It's okay.

445
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,240
You can do whatever you want here.
You're our guest. I don't mind.

446
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
What about Miss Dao?

447
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,440
Why did she leave you all alone like this?

448
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,960
The guests are starting to leave,

449
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,320
so Dao's walking them out.

450
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,840
Then I should leave too.

451
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
Thank you.

452
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,200
You've grown a lot.

453
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,040
If it was like before, you'd hate me

454
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,680
and wouldn't let me touch you.

455
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,320
I guess I've grown up.

456
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,200
I'm all alone now too.

457
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,840
I don't want to act
like some dumb kid anymore.

458
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,920
I know about your brother.

459
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,920
I'm sorry.

460
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,680
If you ever need my help,

461
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,440
let me know.

462
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,320
I like to help competent, smart people.

463
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,840
What are you trying to do?

464
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,360
You were never this way.

465
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,360
What I do is my business, not yours.

466
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,000
What do you want from Taweerath?

467
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,600
You've never tainted yourself so badly.

468
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,480
And why does it have to be him?

469
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,560
Hey.

470
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,040
Tell me.

471
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,800
Maybe

472
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,320
I can give it to you too.

473
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,400
Whatever it is I want,
you can't give it to me.

474
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,560
You're nothing but a mama's boy.

475
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,560
Why did you get up?

476
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,840
Don't you have a headache?

477
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm…

478
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,480
I'm alright now.

479
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,320
Actually,

480
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,280
you don't have to take care of me.

481
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,840
I can take care of myself,

482
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
so you don't have to sleep

483
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,320
on the couch like this.

484
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,600
I know

485
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,720
you can take care of yourself.

486
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,160
But I just

487
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,080
want to take care of you
better than you can yourself.

488
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,440
Do you need anything?

489
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,880
I'll go downstairs to--

490
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,320
Miss Pat.

491
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,560
You said I should dare
to confirm your word.

492
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,080
Now I'm sure.

493
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,120
I'll try.

494
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,760
<i>I'm launching a new condo.</i>

495
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,640
<i>It's on the land</i>
<i>my ex-wife's father used to own.</i>

496
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,120
No matter what, I won't let him
take Dad's land so easily.

497
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,680
<i>This is your reward.</i>

498
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,800
<i>But if you can get Patchanin</i>
<i>removed from the drama,</i>

499
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,960
I can give you even more.

500
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,840
I bet you know Rath was never honest
or sincere with anyone,

501
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,240
<i>including you too.</i>

502
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,920
<i>If you want to be above all of my women,</i>

503
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,840
you have to prove to me first

504
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,040
that you're worth enough.

505
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,920
Someone with no money
and not even any hope,

506
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,240
who'd want that? I need more.

507
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
