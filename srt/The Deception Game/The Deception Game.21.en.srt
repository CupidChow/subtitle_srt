1
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,280
You probably see me as an evil person now.

2
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,320
But I didn't mean to.

3
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
I didn't mean to cause Dao's miscarriage.

4
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,880
And I didn't know
Dad would do that to her.

5
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,200
I really didn't mean
for any of it to happen.

6
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,840
You did it on purpose.

7
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,200
You just won't admit it.

8
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,480
Pu!

9
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,280
Pu.

10
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,920
I was wrong.

11
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,800
I thought Miss Dao was the one
who kept hurting you.

12
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,520
But in reality,

13
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,000
you started it all.

14
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,520
I can explain.

15
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,040
There's no need to.

16
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,080
I heard everything.

17
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Chat and I shouldn't have
gotten involved with you and Miss Dao.

18
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,960
Chat died

19
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,680
because you were so eager to hurt Miss Dao

20
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,160
when in fact, it was you
who caused all your problems.

21
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,280
You still want to help this woman?

22
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,960
You're no leading lady.

23
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,840
You're a hypocrite,

24
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,080
just like Miss Dao said.

25
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,600
You said you'd stay and talk to Miss Pat.

26
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,280
Why the rush?

27
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,160
I even bought dinner.

28
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,960
I have somewhere to be.

29
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,680
Wait.

30
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,280
Is something wrong?

31
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,320
I won't rely on anyone about Chat anymore.

32
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,360
I'll handle it myself.

33
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Pu! Wait, Pu.

34
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,960
I didn't think things would go this far.

35
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,360
I…

36
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,400
I think

37
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,440
I should go.

38
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,040
WOMEN'S PRISON

39
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
Please come in.

40
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,320
Can I talk to her alone?

41
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,560
I take it you heard
about your brother's case

42
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,440
from Patchanin?

43
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,120
Actually, I never left the case alone.

44
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,720
Not one day did I stop
seeking justice for my brother.

45
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,040
So you wanted to get close to me

46
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,440
to find out about your brother?

47
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,920
And I know

48
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
you're not the one who caused him to fall.

49
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,560
Patchanin told the police

50
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,360
I caused your brother's death.

51
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,200
You think I know nothing?

52
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,520
Ava looks like she's gone mad
from trying to hide her guilt.

53
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,400
It's obvious.

54
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,560
You should come clean

55
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,320
about who killed my brother already.

56
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,320
I didn't think things would go this far.

57
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,200
I…

58
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
I think

59
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,560
I should go.

60
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,320
On second thought,

61
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,200
when I wanted to avenge Fah
and acted on impulse,

62
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,920
I almost hurt you too.

63
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,160
No one can make
good decisions all the time.

64
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,760
The question is,

65
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,040
would you forgive the people you love?

66
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,400
I always thought

67
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,720
I could live by myself.

68
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,560
But now I can't

69
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,480
if I don't have you.

70
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,000
Me too.

71
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,480
Do you remember

72
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,160
when I asked you to let me prove myself?

73
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,400
That I'd take care of you

74
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,720
and stay right by your side?

75
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,720
I'll never forget my own words.

76
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,760
And I won't make you regret

77
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,800
giving me a chance.

78
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,720
Why won't you pick up, Aunt Dao?

79
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,000
You told me we'd be going to the UK.

80
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,840
You can't go anymore, Ava.

81
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,840
The police are investigating your aunt,

82
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,440
so we wanted to hear the truth
from you, Ava.

83
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,880
What are you saying?

84
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,120
Why would she get arrested?

85
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,560
For Chat's case, of course!

86
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,440
You'd better tell the truth.

87
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,400
Why did my brother have to die?

88
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,720
I don't know anything. I don't!

89
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,720
Admit your guilt already, Ava!

90
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,000
You're stable now,

91
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,280
so tell me everything
that happened that night.

92
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,400
What did you and your aunt do
to my brother?

93
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,280
Or do you want the one
who loves you the most,

94
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,480
who would do anything for you,

95
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,560
to go to jail instead of you?

96
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
Tell me the truth, Ava!

97
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,000
I told you, tell me everything!

98
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,960
Start talking, Ava.

99
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,760
For Aunt Dao.

100
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,880
Tell us the story.

101
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,880
Aunt Dao…

102
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,440
I don't know…

103
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,680
Tell me!

104
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,480
Leave my daughter alone!

105
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,880
Help me, Mom!

106
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,680
Get out!

107
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,040
Before I call the police.

108
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,960
Go ahead

109
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,840
so they can hear the truth from Ava too.

110
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,760
Stop your nonsense.

111
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,760
Ava never did anything wrong.

112
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,960
Why would she need to confess?

113
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,880
You're her mother.

114
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you really not know

115
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,560
what your own daughter did?

116
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,320
What?

117
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,240
You got arrested?

118
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,040
You want me to look after Ava?

119
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,560
I don't know anything!

120
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,440
Get out!

121
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,840
And leave Ava alone already.

122
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,120
I told you to get out!

123
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,200
Let's just go, Pu.

124
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,760
Come on.

125
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,080
TIGER LADY

126
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,840
- Good afternoon, Som.
- Good afternoon.

127
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,720
What's the matter?

128
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,560
We're pitching a new show to the channel,

129
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
so we wanted to find out about Dao.

130
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
About Dao? Why?

131
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,920
Well,

132
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,320
we wanted to recommend her
to be our new show's host.

133
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,120
But the problem is
we can't contact her at all,

134
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,400
so we wanted to know
if something happened to her.

135
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,600
I thought you guys were close to her.

136
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,680
Why would you ask others
about your close friend?

137
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,320
Well, like I said, Pat,

138
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,880
I can't contact her.

139
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,240
That's right. We can't contact her,

140
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,600
so how on earth are we supposed to know?

141
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,400
Well, if even you guys can't contact her,

142
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,120
then how on earth
is anyone else supposed to know?

143
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,920
Isn't that true, Som?

144
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,640
Yeah. If you'll excuse me,

145
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,160
I have an important meeting.
Let's go, Pat.

146
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,840
Okay.

147
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,120
You think I believe you don't know?

148
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,120
She came here,

149
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,920
so there must be an issue with Dao.

150
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,440
Hold on, Pat.

151
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,440
I waited for you.

152
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,400
You can't just pretend not to see me.

153
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,120
They say

154
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,560
when you hear or see ghosts calling you,

155
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,320
don't respond.

156
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,640
Lately, I don't want my luck
to get any worse,

157
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,200
so I have to pretend not to see you.

158
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,720
Can't you be nice
to your ex-husband for once?

159
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,840
I have good news for you

160
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,520
about you suing me for my project.

161
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,720
I took care of everything.

162
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,680
Not only did I buy the land
at a cheap price,

163
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,440
but I also took care of all the problems,

164
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,640
thanks to you.

165
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,600
Hey!

166
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,160
Stop acting tough with me, Pat.

167
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
Because if you don't stop messing with me,

168
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,360
don't say I didn't warn you.

169
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,400
You think I'm scared of you?

170
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,000
You think you were the one who ended Dao?

171
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,800
Don't flatter yourself, Pat.

172
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,440
I did everything for you.

173
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,480
If I could get her to end up like that,

174
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,920
then for you,

175
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,280
I can also do the same.

176
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,880
And how about you?

177
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,160
How do you think you'll end up?

178
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,160
Right now,

179
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,840
the police are investigating
Pumeth's death.

180
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,160
Soon, they'll find out who was behind it.

181
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,160
Before you can mess with me,

182
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
you'll be in jail by then.

183
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,640
Besides the victim's valuables,

184
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,360
we also found this keycard he kept.

185
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,640
Do you happen to know

186
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,920
what it's used for?

187
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
I've got no clue.

188
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Can I see it?

189
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,040
Officer,

190
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,080
may I peel off this sticker?

191
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,880
Sure.

192
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,640
TWENTY-FOUR HOUR STORAGE

193
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,920
May I take a picture?

194
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,680
Just so I can find out more about it

195
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,040
and let you know.

196
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,320
Sure.

197
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,000
Is that so?

198
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,760
Okay. Thank you very much, officer.

199
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,120
What's up, bro?

200
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,360
Miss Ingdao won't say anything.

201
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,680
All she's saying

202
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,360
is that Ava wasn't there that day.

203
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,880
Miss Dao must be protecting her,

204
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,080
taking all the blame.

205
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,080
I think

206
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
Pumeth might've known about it too.

207
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,440
They used to be lovers,

208
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,880
there's no breaking that bond.

209
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,120
He must've been
helping Miss Dao all along.

210
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,640
If we figure out what the keycard is for,

211
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,520
we'll uncover whatever else he was hiding.

212
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,120
I searched his house
and his office thoroughly.

213
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,800
This is all I found.

214
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,120
There's nothing inside
that would concern you.

215
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,320
That damn Pumeth knew all my secrets.

216
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
There's no way
he didn't leave behind proof.

217
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Or someone else found it already?

218
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,400
A gift from me.

219
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,240
Thank you.

220
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,400
Tell me what you want.

221
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,840
About Patchanin,

222
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,640
how much does she know
about Pumeth's death?

223
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,280
Do you happen to know that?

224
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,440
You know I've got nothing
to do with her anymore.

225
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,320
I wouldn't know about that.

226
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,520
I thought you had patched things up.

227
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,800
I know her true colors now.

228
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,040
It's impossible for me

229
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,360
to see her the same way again.

230
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,520
Then we have the same enemy.

231
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,960
Do you remember

232
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,520
when you told me

233
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,400
you wanted to rise
above all my other women?

234
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,640
What about it?

235
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,080
I accept your offer.

236
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,240
I want you to replace Ingdao.

237
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,600
Ow! Ow!

238
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,800
Ugh!

239
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,400
Get back here!

240
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,840
Get off me!

241
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,840
Where are you going?

242
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,360
Ow!

243
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,840
You think I'd want to be your wife?

244
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,920
I'm too smart
to trust my life to a jerk like you!

245
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,960
You're quite something, huh?

246
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,120
I'm nothing compared to you,

247
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,920
a manipulative jerk who uses women!

248
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Go ahead, then.

249
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,800
It will go viral.

250
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,480
Two businessmen fighting

251
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,200
over an actress.

252
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,560
That would make a fun story.

253
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,080
I hope this is the end of it.

254
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,680
I hope I won't see you
do this to her again.

255
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,960
Let's go, Pu.

256
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,360
You shouldn't have provoked him.

257
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
You shouldn't even get close to him.

258
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,640
But I want to know what he's planning.

259
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,680
Besides, I asked you to pick me up

260
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,360
because I knew you could handle it.

261
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,920
He's clearly uneasy
about Mr. Pumeth's death.

262
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,880
Don't get involved in this.

263
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,120
Leave it to me and Tham.

264
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,560
So, you're still helping Mr. Tham

265
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,680
and Miss Pat?

266
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,280
Yeah.

267
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,320
Then there's nothing left to say.

268
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,880
You know I'm disappointed in Miss Pat.

269
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,600
But I'm doing everything I can about Chat

270
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,160
for you too.

271
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,280
And how can I trust you?

272
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,800
Haven't I already proven myself

273
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,360
that you can trust me?

274
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,160
I've always been by your side.

275
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,720
So we're good now?

276
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,280
Wait, what's that on your face?

277
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,800
Stay still.

278
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,080
Idiot.

279
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,240
What's up with the key card?

280
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,360
Could it be for his house

281
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,040
or an office he was working at?

282
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,840
I thought so too,

283
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,080
but I had someone check.

284
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,600
Turns out the keycard to his place

285
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,000
and the one to his office

286
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,000
don't match this one.

287
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,160
Plus, Jane told me

288
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,360
Taweerath tried to ask Pu

289
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,040
if you knew anything about Pumeth.

290
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,600
Luckily, Jane helped her out in time.

291
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,680
Probably because I threatened him

292
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,800
that the police
are investigating Pumeth's death.

293
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,160
Now he's nervous

294
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,280
and trying to figure out what I know.

295
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,400
Then you need to be more careful.

296
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,520
He'll try something for sure.

297
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,120
I'm not scared.

298
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,040
As long as you're here.

299
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,640
Just to be safe,

300
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,520
I'm moving in with you.

301
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,240
There's more for you to see.

302
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,360
Here.

303
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,240
Someone's here to bail you out.

304
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,440
Go ahead, Ma'am.

305
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,240
You don't have to worry
about the case anymore.

306
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,400
The police examined Chat's phone.

307
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,800
There's nothing related to you on it.

308
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,320
No fingerprints, no DNA.

309
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,240
So even if there's a lawsuit,

310
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,520
you wouldn't be prosecuted anyway.

311
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,640
But I never contacted you.

312
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,040
Who sent you?

313
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,240
I'm here to help you, Dao.

314
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,240
You can relax now.

315
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,280
Someone like you would really help me?

316
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,480
To cover up the news and the case,

317
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,840
only I can help you with that.

318
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,400
Isn't that true?

319
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,600
Those are Ava's suitcases.

320
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,400
Why are they here?

321
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,080
Dao, are you alright?

322
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,120
Why are you here?

323
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,160
I brought Ava here.

324
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,000
Your sister was with her,

325
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,760
so I brought them both.

326
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,680
I'm just helping you as I promised…

327
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,360
so we can live together

328
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,280
as a happy family.

329
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,160
You don't believe me?

330
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,360
You can ask your sister

331
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,960
just how much I love you.

332
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,560
How's Ava doing?

333
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,440
Mr. Rath prepared a room for her.

334
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,920
She lives upstairs now.

335
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,760
He said he'd take good care
of you and Ava.

336
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,480
He gave me a large sum of money too,

337
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,120
and said I could spend it at the casino

338
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,320
as long as I leave you and Ava alone.

339
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,000
Then you should do as you're told.

340
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,760
How could I do that?

341
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,360
After all, when I saw Ava,

342
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,240
I found out

343
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,960
she's addicted to drugs.

344
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,560
I've been trying to help her.

345
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,000
But you,

346
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,800
you never cared about your daughter.

347
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,600
So go back to your casino

348
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,680
and spend your money happily like before.

349
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,560
But I'm still her mother!

350
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,160
How could I leave her in that state?

351
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,800
If you want to be a mother,

352
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,600
do as Rath told you.

353
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,320
Because if you stay,

354
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,720
Ava might not get to see
her mother's face again.

355
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,400
Just stay safe

356
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,760
for her sake.

357
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Stop!

358
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,320
Don't hurt my sister.

359
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,680
Or should I tell your boss
you messed with me?

360
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,040
Let's go!

361
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,320
Ging,

362
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,760
are you okay?

363
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,640
Stop it.

364
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,280
Everyone knows already

365
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,080
that we're not sisters by blood.

366
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,760
You don't have to help me.

367
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,800
Ging!

368
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,840
Even if we're not sisters by blood,

369
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,360
I always saw you as my real sister,

370
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,760
and that will never change.

371
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Even though

372
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,840
you're disappointed in me,

373
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,600
I never meant to take advantage of you.

374
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,000
That's not in the script.

375
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,560
The mood's right. Just let them.

376
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,120
You think I'll believe you?

377
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,440
Cut!

378
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,000
Pat, are you okay?

379
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,800
I'm okay.

380
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,960
Sorry. I was just following the script.

381
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,800
And what you said,

382
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,320
you were probably
following the script too.

383
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,040
What happened?

384
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,760
Just a little accident.

385
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,120
It's normal for drama shoots.
Mistakes happen.

386
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,040
But what are you doing here?

387
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,960
I happened to be around,
so I came to see you.

388
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Pat, I'm changing up the scene a little.

389
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,480
Oh, okay.

390
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,760
What about the new script?

391
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,240
I haven't got it yet.

392
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,080
- We won't need it anymore.
- Really?

393
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,560
Yes.

394
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,440
Does anyone see Pu?

395
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,080
She's giving an interview over there.

396
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,560
The rumor that a celebrity is involved
in your brother's death,

397
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,440
is it true?

398
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,560
- Is it?
- Is it true?

399
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
Yes,

400
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,160
and there wasn't just one.

401
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,480
Could you tell us who it is?

402
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,080
- Please, Pu.
- Please.

403
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,520
Hi, everyone.

404
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,840
We're kind of busy right now.

405
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,600
It's almost our last shoot,
so we're rushing it.

406
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,320
Pu might not be able to answer yet.

407
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,080
It won't take long.
Let's just get it over with.

408
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,480
- So who is it, Pu?
- Yeah!

409
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,040
- So?
- Please tell us.

410
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Giving false claims in an interview

411
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,080
can get you sued, Pu.

412
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm saying this because I care.

413
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,440
Think of it as a warning from your senior.

414
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,880
Isn't there news that you were arrested?

415
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,960
What about the rumors?

416
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,360
You still haven't told me

417
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,400
why you bailed me out.

418
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,440
I think you know

419
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,480
that whatever is not helpful for me,

420
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,240
I won't keep.

421
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,200
You should be glad, Dao,

422
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,320
that you're still helpful to me.

423
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,240
Haven't I helped you enough?

424
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,640
Leave me alone already.

425
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,480
You're the one
who chose to come into my life.

426
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,200
I'm the one who decides
if you'll go or stay.

427
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,720
Don't forget, now Ava's here too.

428
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,520
Rath,

429
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,480
I beg you, leave Ava alone.

430
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Then, whatever you want,

431
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,920
I'll do anything.

432
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,760
Go get the shoot done,

433
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,200
then I'll tell you

434
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
what you need to do.

435
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,600
Dada,

436
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,080
I want to practice my lines.

437
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,480
Let's go.

438
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,080
Excuse us.

439
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,920
My people told me

440
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,360
Taweerath's the one
who found Miss Ingdao a lawyer.

441
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,680
And now she and Ava
are staying in the same house as him.

442
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,160
Rath almost got Dao in jail,

443
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,360
yet now he's bailing her out.

444
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
I think

445
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,400
he must be getting her
to do something for him.

446
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,880
You seem worried about her.

447
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,320
I'm part of why she's in hell
being with a scumbag like him.

448
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,760
I should even thank her

449
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,480
for showing me his true colors.

450
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,199
Otherwise,

451
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,120
the one who's in hell right now

452
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,320
could have been me.

453
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,920
I'll help her if I can,

454
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,800
as redemption for what I did to her.

455
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,239
It might not be like what you think.

456
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,560
As two people who see you as an enemy,

457
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,080
they might be planning something together.

458
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,480
And you're the one

459
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,000
who might be their target.

460
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,320
The feedback on our pilot

461
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,200
was really good.
We got rave reviews and a good rating.

462
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,240
Well, we've got two queens of ratings

463
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,000
in the same show, after all.

464
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,720
How could it not be epic?

465
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,840
You're still shooting
as the show's on-air.

466
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,000
Will it be a problem

467
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,280
for people who are waiting?

468
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,520
We've shot 90 percent of it,

469
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,440
and the actors are prioritizing my show.

470
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,720
I assure you, there won't be a problem.

471
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,960
Right. I only have a few shoots left,
and we're done.

472
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,360
But today's the final scene
for my character is the last day.

473
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,360
Are you done early
because of the rumors about the case?

474
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,760
- Is that right?
- Is it true?

475
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,920
- Right?
- So?

476
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,200
If she really has a case,

477
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,560
will it affect the show
that's already airing?

478
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,000
No such thing happened.

479
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,360
But my script today is really challenging.

480
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
I should go practice my lines.

481
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,720
That's right.

482
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,880
Today is her final scene.

483
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,600
It's a really emotional scene.

484
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,160
Please allow her to focus.

485
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,160
Sorry.

486
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,960
What about the news that a celebrity
got involved in your brother's case?

487
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,080
- Who is it?
- Well…

488
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,000
I'd like to talk only about work today,

489
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,960
for Som's sake.

490
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Can you continue asking about the show?

491
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,800
Ah…

492
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,840
Okay.

493
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,080
Oh, there you are.

494
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,840
Dao,

495
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,880
they're done setting up the scene.
Are you ready?

496
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,680
Yes.

497
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,120
Action!

498
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,920
Kem! Kem! Kem!

499
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,960
Kem!

500
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,440
Kem!

501
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,720
Shouldn't you be happy I'm dying?

502
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,200
I'm not happy.

503
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,360
And I don't want you to die either, Kem.

504
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,520
Neither of us deserves that.

505
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,080
It's too late.

506
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,080
I chose this path.

507
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,960
The end for those who hurt others

508
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,000
is being left with nothing too.

509
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,520
Kem.

510
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,400
Kem! Kem!

511
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,480
Kem!

512
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,920
No…

513
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,400
- Kem, no!
- Cut!

514
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,000
Such professionals, both of you.

515
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,600
Miss Dao registered her marriage
with Taweerath.

516
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,560
<i>She knew he had all those debts</i>

517
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,280
<i>and lawsuits.</i>

518
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,200
Why did she still marry him?

519
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,640
NEXT EPISODE

520
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,400
<i>You have to help me, like you promised.</i>

521
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,040
How famous do you want to be?

522
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,280
That's the exact same logo.
I think this is it.

523
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,000
My friend's name is Pumeth.

524
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,800
<i>Has he ever been here?</i>

525
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,120
<i>So, you like playing cat and mouse, huh?</i>

526
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,920
Come here!
