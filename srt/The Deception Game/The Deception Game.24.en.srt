1
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,520
I have a guy with Ava right now.

2
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,520
If you don't do it,

3
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,520
I'll tell him
to get rid of Ava immediately.

4
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,000
Why do you have to drag her into this?

5
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,000
She's your weakness, isn't she?

6
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,120
Go ahead and kill Pat

7
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
if you don't want Ava to get hurt.

8
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,440
If you want me dead, do it yourself.

9
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,560
Why force her?

10
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,360
But that's no fun.

11
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,640
You're both actresses,

12
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,920
and I'm your audience.

13
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,640
This way,

14
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,480
it's so much more fun and exciting.

15
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,240
Why are you doing this?

16
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,120
I don't get it.

17
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,080
Surely you know why.

18
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,880
You're the one who wouldn't stop, Pat.

19
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,640
You're the reason I'm in this state.

20
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
And you…

21
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,480
You dared to betray me,

22
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,040
then parade in front of the press

23
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,160
like some perfect wife

24
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,440
begging her husband to turn himself in.

25
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,480
Don't you know?

26
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,840
When I see something so fake in the media,

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,560
it drives me mad!

28
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,360
You always blame others

29
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,880
when it's really all your fault.

30
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,120
Even without me and Dao,

31
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,640
your Karma would have caught up to you
for the evil things you've done.

32
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,600
I need my pills.

33
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,520
I'm sick. I need my pills.

34
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,760
What are you talking about?

35
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm sick. I have to take my pills.
Please, I need to!

36
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,600
Stop right there!

37
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,640
I need my pills!

38
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,560
- What's wrong with you?!
- I need my pills!

39
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,040
Something's going on.

40
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,040
Hey.

41
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,720
I'll go check.

42
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,720
But--

43
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,880
It might be dangerous.

44
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,040
You wait here.

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,040
Sit down!

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,840
Come back here!

47
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,680
You got a death wish?!

48
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,160
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,440
What's going on? What's taking so long?

50
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,000
It's okay.

51
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,640
It's okay. You're okay.

52
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,440
You're okay, Ava.

53
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,920
- Ava!
- Calm down, Ava.

54
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,640
What happened?

55
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,800
A guy was holding her hostage,
so I helped her get away.

56
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,120
- A guy?
- Yeah.

57
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,320
- What about Ms. Dao?
- I already asked her.

58
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,800
But she's not making any sense.
She won't tell me who the guy is.

59
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,960
Ava, what happened?

60
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,880
Don't hurt me.

61
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,200
- Please, don't hurt me.
- I won't!

62
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,960
Just pull yourself together, Ava.

63
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm just asking what happened.

64
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,440
Where's Ms. Dao?

65
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,160
And who's the guy in there?

66
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Uncle Rath

67
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,600
took Aunt Dao to…

68
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,480
To go see Aunt Pat.

69
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,800
What?!

70
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
- Ava! Ava!
- Ava! Ava!

71
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,680
Let's take her to a hospital. Now.

72
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,920
Pick up the knife.

73
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,960
Pick it up!

74
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,880
Now!

75
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,480
Dao…

76
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,400
Do it now.

77
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
Hurry!

78
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,880
I don't want to do this.

79
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
But Ava's being held hostage.

80
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,200
If I don't do it…

81
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,560
I'll leave it up to you, Dao.

82
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,200
Whatever happens, happens.

83
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,640
Even if I die,

84
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,640
I won't blame you at all.

85
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,440
Pat…

86
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
How touching.

87
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,520
So touching, really.

88
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,240
Are you done yet?

89
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,560
Or should I call the guy?

90
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,920
You forced my hand, Dao.

91
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,040
Don't!

92
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,280
Go ahead then.

93
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,080
I'm sorry, Pat.

94
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,520
Do it already.

95
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,120
The one who deserves to die the most

96
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,520
is you!

97
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,960
Dao!

98
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,280
Stop it, Rath!

99
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Let go!

100
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,120
Get off me!

101
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,720
Pat, Pat!

102
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,840
Pat, Pat!

103
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,680
Pat!

104
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,000
So Taweerath went to see Pat?

105
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,640
Jane, call the police right now.

106
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,480
I already did.

107
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,440
Pu and I are taking Ava to the hospital.

108
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,000
You just hurry to Pat.

109
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
Wait for me, Miss Pat.

110
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,960
You wanted me to be a murderer, right?

111
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,480
Well, here I am.

112
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,000
But the one who has to die

113
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,040
is you!

114
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,840
Not me.

115
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,880
Come on out!

116
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,880
I'll be a murderer like you want.

117
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,400
Come on!

118
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,080
Come on out!

119
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,560
Up already, girls?

120
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,600
You two are really meant to be together.

121
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,480
One of you

122
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,480
wanted to fight her way to the top.

123
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,480
But the other,

124
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,720
who's had it easy,

125
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,160
chose to ruin her life instead.

126
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,960
To us, our worst decision

127
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,880
was knowing you.

128
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,800
You scumbag!

129
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,240
But I think

130
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,600
the mistake you both share

131
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
is not letting go of your past.

132
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,080
Look at me,

133
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,440
I'm ready to let go now.

134
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,360
And I'm ready to start a new life.

135
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,720
Good luck.

136
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,480
I hope you both go and shine

137
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,200
as two stars in the sky,

138
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,600
down in hell.

139
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,600
Come here!

140
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Let's go.

141
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,280
Mr. Tham.

142
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,520
Let's go.

143
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,880
Mr. Tham!

144
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,120
Mr. Tham--

145
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,680
Don't, Rath!

146
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,320
Don't!

147
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,640
What now?!

148
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,800
Don't, don't!

149
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,240
Mr. Tham!

150
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Don't!

151
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,840
Get off me!

152
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,080
Are you okay?

153
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,840
Mr. Tham, Mr. Tham!

154
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,880
Mr. Tham, Mr. Tham!

155
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,760
Dao.

156
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,480
- Dao!
- Pat!

157
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,960
Stay away!

158
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,840
Just go!

159
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,360
But, Dao--

160
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,840
Stay away.

161
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,760
But…

162
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,920
Hurry.

163
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,119
Please help Ava.

164
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,120
Mr. Tham…

165
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,400
Dao.

166
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,680
Dao,

167
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,600
Dao.

168
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,240
Doctor,

169
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
how's Mr. Tham doing?

170
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,600
He's safe now.

171
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,480
We'll move him to a recovery room
in a couple of days.

172
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,600
If you'll excuse me.

173
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Miss Pat…

174
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,520
If I had let something happen to you,

175
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,720
I could never forgive myself.

176
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,480
Don't say that.

177
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,200
I should be the one saying that.

178
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,240
How could I live
if something happened to you?

179
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,880
I shouldn't have left you alone
at the house.

180
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,080
Otherwise,

181
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,200
you wouldn't have had to risk your life.

182
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,800
It's not your fault.

183
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,040
It's more because

184
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,200
I made him resent me.

185
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,600
He was following me.

186
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,000
He wanted to see me and Dao
die in front of him

187
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
so he'd be satisfied.

188
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,480
But in the end,

189
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,800
he's the one who died.

190
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,600
If it weren't for Ms. Ingdao's help,

191
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,440
we wouldn't have survived.

192
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,000
But the person
she worries about the most is Ava.

193
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,640
Just to know Ava is safe,

194
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,320
she would risk it all.

195
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,520
About Ava…

196
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,400
She's safe.

197
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,200
Janepob and Pu helped her in time.

198
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,680
At least

199
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,160
we kept our promise to Ms. Ingdao.

200
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,840
Now that Ava is safe…

201
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,360
Dao won't have to worry anymore.

202
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,520
Excuse me.

203
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,560
We just got reports from the scene.

204
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,440
It took hours for the firefighters
to get to your house.

205
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,360
Over half of the house was damaged.

206
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
I understand.

207
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,880
When we went inside to investigate
after the fire was out,

208
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,120
we found Mr. Taweerath

209
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,960
dead in the room upstairs.

210
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,240
Presumably, he died from smoke inhalation

211
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,000
followed by being burned to death.

212
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,680
He was trying to
kill Ms. Pat and Ms. Ingdao.

213
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,640
But luckily,

214
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,920
I helped Pat out in time.

215
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,800
But as for Ingdao…

216
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,080
But we didn't find Ms. Ingdao's body.

217
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,720
Excuse me?

218
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,040
We searched all over the house.

219
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,280
We didn't find her body.

220
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,440
But we'll keep looking.

221
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,440
If you'll excuse me.

222
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,480
Are you surprised?

223
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,520
Let's let the police handle it now.

224
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,920
I don't want us

225
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,480
to have to know

226
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,960
or want to know anything about this.

227
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,760
I agree.

228
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,280
Some things, we just have to let go.

229
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,200
Let's focus on us now.

230
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,640
Then you'd better get well soon.

231
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,640
Right now,

232
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm lonely staying
at my mom's house alone.

233
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,400
Then I guess
I'd better get well really soon.

234
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,520
Don't worry,

235
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,120
once Ava gets better,

236
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,960
she'll face her charges right away.

237
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,400
It's all clear to me now

238
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,560
what happened to my brother.

239
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,520
And Ava never meant to kill him.

240
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,360
I should apologize to you both

241
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,200
for what Ava and Dao did.

242
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,520
With everything that's happened,

243
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,000
I hope you can forgive me.

244
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,200
I'm not angry at Dao anymore.

245
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,520
I'm the one

246
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,680
who should ask for her forgiveness

247
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
for what I did to her.

248
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,280
The bitterness in our hearts

249
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,560
has ruined both our lives long enough.

250
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,920
I'm not angry at Ava anymore either.

251
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,800
If possible,

252
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,320
I'd like her sentence to be as light

253
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,480
as the court can give.

254
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,880
Thank you both so much.

255
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,160
Please take it.

256
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,800
What's this?

257
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,120
Dao wrote a will.

258
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,960
Once she's passed,

259
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,360
your house is returned to you.

260
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,640
Even if it was damaged in the fire,

261
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,360
you'd be happy to accept it, right?

262
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,720
It's my house after all.

263
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,880
And Dao kept her promise.

264
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,440
Of course, I'll accept it.

265
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,400
But her body hasn't been found yet.

266
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,600
There's not much I can do right now.

267
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,240
Don't worry about her assets.

268
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,280
I'll have a lawyer handle it.

269
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,920
Thank you so much, Pat.

270
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,160
We should go, Miss Pat.

271
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,800
Thank you, Aunt Dao,

272
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,560
for giving me this teddy bear.

273
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,920
Trying to run away, huh?

274
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,440
No, I'm not.

275
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,320
Why did you bring the cops and reporters?

276
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
To arrest a fraud like you, of course.

277
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,720
I've got all the evidence now.

278
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,000
I know exactly how you scammed me
and how much.

279
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,480
I shouldn't have trusted you.

280
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Arrest her, Officer.

281
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,880
Stay away from me!

282
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,280
I didn't scam you.
I never did any of that!

283
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,440
I've got concrete evidence here,

284
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,520
yet you still deny it?

285
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,640
Take a look for yourself!

286
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,400
Go ahead, take a picture, guys.

287
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
Blast her all over the news.

288
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,520
I bet you spent all the money in a casino.

289
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,080
Blast her everywhere
so she can't scam anyone else.

290
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,240
What are you, some kind of saint?

291
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,160
Huh?

292
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,520
- You're no saint!
- Ma'am!

293
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,760
Ma'am, please stop!

294
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,080
- Please stop!
- Please!

295
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,600
How dare you trick me, you jerk!

296
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,240
TWO YEARS LATER

297
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,600
Go ahead, Chompunuch is ready.

298
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,800
Wow, you look stunning!

299
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
She's the prettiest.

300
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,560
Are you happy to win
the Women's Rising Star Award this year?

301
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,040
Yes, I'm thrilled.

302
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,400
I must thank the higher-ups
who gave me this opportunity,

303
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,560
entrusting me with the role
that earned me this award.

304
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,640
You've been killing it in every show.

305
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,960
How do you feel about possibly being named

306
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,880
the new queen of TV ratings,
taking the place of Patchanin and Ingdao?

307
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
I wouldn't dare compare myself to anyone,

308
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,960
especially Pat and Dao.

309
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,880
After all, they both
helped and supported me,

310
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,560
getting me where I am today.

311
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,360
I hope both of them

312
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,960
would be proud of me.

313
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,800
How sweet.
You're both pretty and talented.

314
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,280
Thank you.

315
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,200
Mom…

316
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,320
Pu and I are publicly getting engaged.

317
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,080
You've been doing
whatever you please anyway.

318
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,560
Why bother telling me?

319
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,480
Because you're
the most important person to Jane.

320
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,760
Of course he'd want to tell
the one he loves the most.

321
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,400
She's right, Mom.

322
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,000
You're the one I love the most.

323
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,840
Come to think of it, I'd like it too.

324
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,560
If my son gets married soon,
he'll learn to be more responsible.

325
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,280
Especially these past two years,

326
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,720
he's proven to me

327
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,160
that he works harder thanks to you.

328
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,120
Do whatever you want. I'm okay with it.

329
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,840
Thank you, Mom.

330
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,080
Thank you, Mrs. Piangkae.

331
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,920
You can call me Mom now.

332
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,680
How long will you keep calling me that?

333
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,120
Okay, Mom.

334
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,080
I'm sorry…

335
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,520
I'm sorry.

336
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,320
I'm sorry!

337
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,320
See?

338
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,800
It's just one word.

339
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,880
But when you put a story behind it,

340
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,280
with emotions
and feelings from your heart,

341
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,360
it can convey so many different meanings.

342
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,240
And the more genuine you are,

343
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,120
the more your audience will believe you
and feel invested.

344
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,640
And to be a good actor,

345
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,240
you must be genuine in your craft.

346
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,480
Take every chance you get,

347
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,440
and never destroy anyone's dreams.

348
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Right, class is over today.

349
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,880
You can go home.

350
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,240
Hold on.

351
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
I've noticed that

352
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,600
even though
you've only been here a few times,

353
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,080
you're naturally talented in acting.

354
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,960
Thank you.

355
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,240
Here.

356
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,120
Give it a try.

357
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,560
I think you can do it.

358
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,360
Who knows?

359
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,760
You might just be the next superstar.

360
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,080
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

361
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,760
Chon,

362
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,040
let's go home.

363
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,480
I should go now. My friend is here.

364
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,920
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

365
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,520
Let's go.

366
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,640
How sweet.

367
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,800
Yeah.

368
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,480
You don't work in showbiz anymore,

369
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,000
yet you're always
giving new faces a chance.

370
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,600
Even if I hand them the opportunity,

371
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,880
if they don't work hard, it's useless.

372
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,480
It all depends on them.

373
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,960
Come on, let's go home.

374
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,520
It's been two years

375
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,160
since the fire,
yet no one has found Ms. Dao.

376
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,520
I guess we're the only ones
who visit Pumeth here.

377
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,120
MR. PUMETH PAKANONT

378
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,400
Looks like we're not the only ones

379
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,600
leaving him flowers.

380
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,120
I guess so.

381
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,280
That's good.

382
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,120
He won't feel lonely
with just us visiting him.

383
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,000
MR. PUMETH PAKANONT

384
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,480
Is something wrong, Miss Pat?

385
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,160
It's nothing.

386
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,040
I just saw someone
who reminded me of my old friend.

387
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,320
I'll always miss you,

388
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,600
Pumeth.

389
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,880
Someone wanted to buy your house,

390
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,600
so I accepted.

391
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,040
He'll come to sign the contract soon.

392
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,040
So you made decisions for the homeowner?

393
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,680
Well, I figured

394
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,240
you'd be ready to sell it now.

395
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,880
Plus,

396
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,280
you're living in a new house,

397
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,280
our house.

398
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,360
Our house?

399
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,440
Will you marry me?

400
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,360
You might still be afraid of married life,

401
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,320
but don't worry.

402
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,800
Even though
I'm not kneeling down to ask you

403
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,600
or making grand promises like others,

404
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,640
I'll let my past actions

405
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,560
help you decide.

406
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,640
And if I told you

407
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,320
this ring and the house
I've prepared for us

408
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,480
are symbols
of the family we'll build together,

409
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,080
would you accept it?

410
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,920
Even if you didn't have a ring,

411
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,240
a house,

412
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,160
or any valuables,

413
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,480
I'm ready,

414
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,520
as long as I have you with me.

415
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,120
THE END

416
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,920
