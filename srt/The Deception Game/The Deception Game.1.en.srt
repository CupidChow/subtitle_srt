1
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,440
You don't deserve this ring.

2
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,760
What are you doing?

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,560
I'm taking back everything I own.

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,720
A person like you

5
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
deserves nothing.

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,600
You're just a loser in denial.

7
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,160
Who are you to demand anything?

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,360
After all, he didn't choose you.
He chose me.

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,239
Hey.

10
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,480
Just accept the truth for once.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,920
What are you doing? Let go of me!

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,120
Let go!

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,720
Cut! Okay, great job!

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,680
Once we're shooting for real,

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,160
Ingdao, I want you to

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,200
get up here,

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,560
and you two will tug back and forth

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,600
like this, and I'll do an insert
to make it look scary.

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,520
-Okay?
-Got it.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,560
How about this?

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
When Dao and I are tugging,

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,440
I'm thinking

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,920
I could hold her arm like this,
and we'll glare at each other first,

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,080
just to make sure she's safe.

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,280
Sounds good.

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,680
-Help her change shoes, we're doing it.
-Okay!

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,680
I'll hold you tightly first
to make sure you don't fall.

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,480
Those shoes are Pat's. These are yours.

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,240
PATCHANIN

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,920
Can I wear these instead?
They match the dress better.

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,120
But Tle prepared these for you, Dao.

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,440
They're safer.

33
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,840
But I want to wear these.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,840
What are you doing?! Let go of me!

35
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,240
I told you to let go!

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,080
Hey!

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,280
Go check on her!

38
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
Dao!

39
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,040
TEN YEARS LATER

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,120
You're all so lucky to have been joined

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,360
by a leading lady
who taught today's class.

42
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,840
Come on now, leading lady?

43
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,440
It's been five years
since I got married and stopped acting.

44
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,600
You can't call me that anymore.

45
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,440
But I'm glad to use my experience
to teach all of you.

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,120
Students,

47
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,960
if you have any questions
about script analysis,

48
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,640
feel free to ask me next class.

49
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,520
For today, I'll leave Jarinya
to answer your questions.

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,240
See you next time.

51
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,840
Jarinya.

52
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm sorry, I really have to go.

53
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,080
It's your anniversary today,

54
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,280
yet you're here helping.

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,480
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,000
Just hurry. Your husband
must be dying to see you.

57
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,520
-See you.
-Alright.

58
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,480
Patchanin, can I get a picture with you?

59
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Sure.

60
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,399
Can I get a selfie too?

61
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,200
Of course.

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,320
Thank you!

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
-Thank you.
-Bye.

64
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,520
Are you okay?

65
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,640
I'm fine.

66
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,280
You're a celebrity.

67
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,560
Yes.

68
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,960
No wonder

69
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,520
you just walk around
like you own the place.

70
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,280
What's your problem?

71
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,040
What do you think?

72
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,640
Rath.

73
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Happy anniversary, honey.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
Thank you.

75
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,600
Have a seat.

76
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,120
Pat.

77
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Today I have a guest

78
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,240
I want you to meet.

79
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,800
Again?

80
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,840
This way, sir.

81
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,080
Here.

82
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,800
Good afternoon.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,360
Pat, this is Mr. Ethan Lee,

84
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,120
a Singaporean businessman

85
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
interested in my project, "Around Asia."

86
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,560
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Patchanin.

87
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,640
Good afternoon, Mr. Lee.

88
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,560
Let's sit down.

89
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,200
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

90
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,000
Thank you for your interest

91
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,640
in investing

92
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,240
in my husband's project.

93
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,640
Actually, I'm interested in
your other projects as well.

94
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,960
So today, I also invited
my partner here to discuss with us.

95
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,680
There he is.

96
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,040
Good afternoon.

97
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,280
That's Mr. Tham, CEO of Nile Real Estate.

98
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,960
I'm sorry for being late.

99
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,320
Have a seat.

100
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,160
This is your partner?

101
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
Correct.

102
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,000
Shall we order some food?
This could take a while.

103
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,400
No, it's fine.

104
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,640
I'm just here to warn Mr. Lee
that your project is too risky.

105
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,680
It's obvious how successful my project is.

106
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,080
You think I made up my profit numbers?

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,880
It brings in great income
because you use low-quality materials.

108
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,720
There are bound to be problems
in the long run.

109
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
Excuse me?

110
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,360
Anyway, I'm out.

111
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,880
If you'll excuse me.

112
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,360
Hold on!

113
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,720
If I upset you somehow

114
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,120
to the point where
you won't talk to my husband, I'm sorry.

115
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,600
But,

116
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,600
please don't let that affect his work.

117
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,600
I don't mix
personal matters with business.

118
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,800
And I've already explained
why I won't invest in his project.

119
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,440
I may not know much about business,

120
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,640
but I'm sure my husband

121
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,240
has planned everything carefully.

122
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,200
I really wonder

123
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
if you just love your husband so much

124
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,000
that you're blind to the truth,

125
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,080
or if you've chosen
to stay in the same boat as him.

126
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,400
But I must warn you,

127
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,800
once you're in the wrong boat,

128
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,280
be prepared to drown.

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,720
Hold on! Wait!

130
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,600
Dao, you're starring
in a new drama soon, right?

131
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,640
Our new queen of TV ratings!

132
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,920
Definitely,
but I can't reveal the details yet.

133
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,240
The producer and station will announce it.

134
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,520
Oh, it's Patchanin!

135
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,680
Wait, wait.

136
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,480
-Yes?
-Come join us.

137
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,160
Let's not waste this chance.

138
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,120
Hello, everyone.

139
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,160
-Hello.
-Hello.

140
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,640
Pat, I didn't know you were also coming

141
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,080
to Mrs. Mani's event today.
You're not on the VIP guest list.

142
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,120
I'm here today

143
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,480
just to celebrate
my anniversary with my husband.

144
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,440
Since we bumped into each other,

145
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,680
why don't you take a picture
of the real queen of TV ratings

146
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,440
and the new queen of TV ratings,

147
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,280
both of us together?

148
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,960
-Sounds good!
-Perfect!

149
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,000
You wouldn't mind, right?

150
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,360
Of course not.

151
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,520
You're pressing charges
against my daughter?

152
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,680
Patchanin pushed me down
the stairs on purpose.

153
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,640
I think you brought it on yourself.

154
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
My daughter is innocent.

155
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,560
More importantly,

156
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,000
maybe you don't realize,

157
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,600
you didn't just hurt yourself
falling down the stairs.

158
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,640
You also had a miscarriage.

159
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,800
That's not true.

160
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
That's not true!

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,400
If you still care about

162
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,120
your reputation and career,

163
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,000
step down from the leading lady role.

164
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,560
I'll help cover up
the news of your miscarriage.

165
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,120
I really can't stand

166
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,880
seeing Pat lower herself

167
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,760
to work with a trashy celebrity like you.

168
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,680
Here, so you don't think I'm being cruel.

169
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,640
Consider it compensation
for stepping aside from the leading role

170
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,280
for a rising star like you.

171
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,880
I do believe,
even if the accident hadn't happened,

172
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,560
someone like you

173
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,160
would've gotten an abortion anyway.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,120
Right?

175
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,560
Stand a little closer you two.

176
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,480
The color you picked is a classic one.

177
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,440
We'll call you
when new ones in that tone arrive.

178
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,720
Alright.

179
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,960
Thank you so much.

180
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,320
Thank you.

181
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,880
Why are you in my way? Move!

182
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,520
I'm afraid I can't.
May I search your bag before you leave?

183
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,400
You have no right to search my bag.

184
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,920
Move!

185
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,040
After we pick up Ava, let's go eat first.

186
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,840
Oops.

187
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,240
Patchanin.

188
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,040
Hi.

189
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,480
What a coincidence.

190
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,920
You two were once close friends,

191
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,040
and like the same things.

192
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,040
It's no surprise
you run into each other so often.

193
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,720
-Move!
-No ma'am.

194
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,640
-Move!
-Let me search your bag.

195
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,080
-No! Let go!
-Give me it!

196
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,240
Pu!

197
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,400
What happened?

198
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,320
Why are you treating a customer this way?

199
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,280
Search her bag and you'll know.

200
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,520
Did you steal?

201
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,840
What's going on Ava?

202
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,280
Help me, Aunt Dao. She called me a thief!

203
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,800
Good afternoon, Ms. Ingdao.

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,480
Are you blind or something?

205
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,120
She's my daughter, Ms. Ingdao's niece.
And you're calling her a thief?

206
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,600
She's your niece?

207
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,440
Explain this then.

208
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,840
Why would I steal that?

209
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,200
A cheap bag like this,
I could buy ten if I wanted.

210
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
She put it in my bag to frame me.

211
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,600
Why would I do that?
We don't even know each other.

212
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,240
How about this?

213
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,560
Good afternoon, Mrs. Patchanin.

214
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
Just check the cameras.

215
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,640
Sounds good. Then you'll see.

216
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,520
Hey!

217
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
That's unnecessary.

218
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,880
I'll buy that bag.

219
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,640
And also this one, this one, and that one.

220
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,440
Of course.

221
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,840
Pu, go ahead and help her.

222
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,800
But they're thieves.

223
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,000
No one would want to steal
a dirty bag like this one.

224
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,160
Also, ring up all those bags for me.

225
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,760
Oops.

226
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,960
Sorry, it slipped.
Would you pick it up for me?

227
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,160
Pu, pick it up for her. Come on.

228
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,320
Oh, wait. I'll use this card instead.

229
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,880
This one has a higher limit.

230
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Oops.

231
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,800
It slipped again.

232
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,800
My bad.

233
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,440
Or should I use another one?

234
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,760
I have so many. It's hard to choose.

235
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,680
Hey!

236
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,560
Don't you think this is too much?

237
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,000
None of your business.

238
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Tomorrow I'll bring my celebrity friends

239
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,160
to buy ten more bags from your store.

240
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,560
-Really?
-But…

241
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,200
I don't want to see
this tasteless employee,

242
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,920
who can't even tell
your VIP customers apart,

243
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,240
working here again.

244
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
Even better if she's gone today.

245
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,680
Pu, go pack up your things. Now.

246
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,960
I apologize on her behalf.

247
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,600
No worries,

248
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,760
but I hope you won't spread the word
about what happened today.

249
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,080
Of course. We wouldn't want
to defame our customers.

250
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,320
Wait!

251
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,560
I already quit. What else do you want?

252
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,840
Contact this number.

253
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,120
This store will surely hire you.

254
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,720
Ms. Ingdao covered up
her niece's crime with a bribe,

255
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
and now
you're buying my silence with a job?

256
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,480
In my current state,
I'm powerless against the two of you.

257
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,360
No need to do charity work
for a poor girl like me.

258
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,640
You're always helping
those who don't deserve it.

259
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,160
Do you get it now,

260
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,560
why I had to teach her a lesson?

261
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,800
But wasn't that a little too much?

262
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,960
She lost her job.

263
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,560
So you decided to be a justice warrior

264
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,840
helping kids in poverty?

265
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,320
Trying to grow your fanbase?

266
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,920
But you're no longer a leading lady,
so that's unnecessary.

267
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,360
You're right.

268
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,000
But at least I'm not like someone

269
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,680
who's known for her leading lady role

270
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,120
yet behaves the opposite way.

271
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,520
What I did today

272
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,160
is nothing compared to what you did to me.

273
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,920
If this is about ten years ago,

274
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,360
why didn't you just talk to me back then?

275
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Why give me the leading lady role?

276
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,000
I'll walk there.

277
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,040
It just arrived today.

278
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,960
I picked your favorite color.
Try holding it.

279
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,440
Thank you.

280
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,680
Do you like it?

281
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,760
Um…

282
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,280
On the bill, it says chain straps.

283
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,680
But these are leather straps.

284
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,280
They must have delivered the wrong bag.

285
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,600
My apologies. I didn't check well enough
before I accepted it.

286
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,840
Right.

287
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,880
Pumeth and I were quite busy
discussing about Mr. Lee,

288
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,600
so we didn't notice the mistake.

289
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
Everything's going wrong.

290
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,240
I'll have it replaced for you.

291
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,080
-Why don't you take your break?
-Yes, sir.

292
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,480
Rath.

293
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,480
Are you having problems at work?

294
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,440
Mr. Lee won't invest in my company.

295
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,680
He said he'd only
invest in Nile Real Estate.

296
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,320
I didn't take him for that kind of person.

297
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,400
But I already spoke to my dad for you
about the land in Sathon.

298
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,840
You can go ahead and quote a price.

299
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,840
Really, honey?

300
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,280
I already told you,

301
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll do anything I can to help you.

302
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,080
You're my husband.

303
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,120
And about the bag,

304
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,920
no need to waste time replacing it.
I can use it.

305
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,640
Isn't my wife just the best?

306
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,400
I only work here now.
I probably can't help you anymore.

307
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
Why don't you go find a new job then?

308
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Or a full-time job?

309
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,440
Don't tell me
you plan on working all these jobs

310
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,080
just so you can chase that dream of yours.

311
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Can you quit thinking about it already?

312
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,160
It's unrealistic.

313
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Hey! You thief! Get over here!

314
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,520
How dare you, stealing in broad daylight!

315
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,720
Me? A thief?

316
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,560
What if I don't leave?

317
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,760
What would you do?

318
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Stay back.

319
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,040
What's going on Pu?

320
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,080
Pop, there's a thief in our shop.

321
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,320
What thief? That's Jane.

322
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
He just started working here.

323
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,440
And why didn't you come meet me
at the front first?

324
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,080
I was going to grab my uniform and apron

325
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,200
before going,

326
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,320
but I didn't know where to find them.

327
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,240
And then someone came calling me a thief.

328
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,600
He's a new employee?

329
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,760
Yes. Please take good care of him.

330
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,840
Where's my apron?

331
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,720
This is what it looks like before
the first round of Star Sea's audition.

332
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,560
They're looking for fresh faces
to become Sea Seven Channel's actors.

333
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,200
I came because of my passion.
I want to be a star.

334
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,000
I want our seven finalists today

335
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,360
to have some experience

336
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,520
or have taken acting classes before,

337
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,880
so when the audition is over

338
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,840
they are ready to work right away.

339
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,240
Especially those with talent,

340
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
let's just let them pass. Sounds good?

341
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,680
But some may not have any talent.

342
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,080
They'd be at a disadvantage.

343
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,520
If we use that criteria, it just means

344
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,680
we're not giving a chance
to those willing to learn.

345
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,320
Pat, this is not an acting school.

346
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,640
This is an audition,

347
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,400
not a charity for children in need.

348
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,560
Who said anything
about charity for children in need?

349
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,600
We don't want our audition
to be unfair though, do we?

350
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,160
Word will get out
that the committee who are supposedly

351
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,040
honorable and famous

352
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,640
chose only their own people as finalists.

353
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,600
Oops, looks like

354
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,000
a certain celebrity
has family coming to audition.

355
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,760
What matters most
is the sponsors' satisfaction,

356
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,920
whatever type of person they want.

357
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,800
Everyone, this is Mr. Tham,

358
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,280
the CEO of Nile Real Estate,

359
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,640
one of our biggest sponsors.
He'll join our committee today.

360
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,360
Here you go.

361
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,960
Excuse me, I'd like to check in!

362
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,720
Time's up for check-ins.

363
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,920
If you want to be a star,

364
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,800
first you have to be punctual.

365
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm sorry.

366
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,920
Please help me out.

367
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,560
Could you let it slide? Just this once?

368
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,960
No.

369
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,160
Please go inside and check in Ava.

370
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,400
You said rules are rules,

371
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,560
how come she gets to check in?

372
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,440
Ah,

373
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,120
so the show treats her differently
because she's Ms. Ingdao's niece?

374
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,920
So she gets to do whatever she wants?

375
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,000
Excuse me?

376
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,840
What's going on?

377
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,800
Ava.

378
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,520
Pu!

379
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,080
Hello. I'm number 29, Ava Kantrakarn.

380
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,440
My talents are singing,

381
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,720
playing the piano, and ballet.

382
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,000
She's pretty

383
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,880
and also skillful.

384
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,800
Go ahead and act out what you've prepared.

385
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,040
Don't you know?

386
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,520
For me,

387
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,160
no matter how long I stay sad,

388
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,920
I'll never let go of…

389
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,760
let go of…

390
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,440
my thoughts.

391
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,280
…my thoughts.

392
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,000
Eyebrows?

393
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,800
The memories

394
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,240
we share will…

395
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,200
Ava!

396
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,480
You're so irresponsible!

397
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,680
Let it go, Dao. It already happened.

398
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,680
We can't go back and fix it.

399
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,280
Dao, how's Ava doing?

400
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,840
She's just anxious
because she takes this very seriously.

401
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,320
That's why it happened.
She's doing better now though.

402
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,360
We only have one candidate left.

403
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,160
Let's begin.

404
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,800
Hello. I'm number 30,

405
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,200
Chompunuch Pattara Amornlert.

406
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,440
STAR SEA CHANNEL AUDITION

407
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,560
Found you.

408
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,880
Pat talked to them for you.

409
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,640
If Ava gets to audition,
you should get to audition too.

410
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,200
I didn't think Mrs. Pat would--

411
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,240
She just likes fairness.

412
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,000
Oh, but…

413
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,160
don't you have any talents?

414
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,800
No.

415
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,040
I was an orphan.

416
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,000
I grew up with just my older brother,

417
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,960
so I never got to take extra classes.

418
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,080
But I have a dream just like anybody else.

419
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,080
That's why I'm chasing it,

420
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,120
and so I came here to audition.

421
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,680
Have you prepared an act?

422
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,160
Please begin.

423
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,680
Alright.

424
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,440
I have a dream just like any other girl,

425
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,880
and I've been trying my best
to make it come true.

426
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,920
But in the end,

427
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,880
it's all taken by someone

428
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,480
who's incompetent but privileged.

429
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,440
And they're not even ashamed
to abuse their power.

430
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,240
-But I think--
-I've seen it often.

431
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,840
Those who fail

432
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,360
then blame others.

433
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,520
That type of person

434
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,840
is nothing

435
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,840
but a sore loser.

436
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,640
With a pro like Ingdao joining her,
how can she pull it off?

437
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,720
Those who don't know their place,

438
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,360
thinking they're so great

439
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,880
even when they have nothing to offer,

440
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,920
you really think they can win?

441
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,440
If you want to look down on me,

442
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,920
just know I won't surrender.

443
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,080
Today you may be above me,

444
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,800
but someday,

445
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,120
I'll rise above you.

446
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,720
You!

447
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,400
Great job, Chompunuch!

448
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,120
Well done.

449
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,120
Great job.

450
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,520
Hey,

451
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,800
won't you thank me a little?

452
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,920
They admire you this much because of me.

453
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,840
Thank you.

454
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,280
Great job.

455
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,880
Pu.

456
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Why are you here?

457
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,880
You skipped work to audition here,

458
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,720
so I had to deliver the coffee here.

459
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,040
Wanna be a star?

460
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,800
You think it's bad?

461
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,520
I didn't say anything.

462
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,040
Plus, you did a great job.

463
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,360
Ms. Ingdao joined you unexpectedly,

464
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,840
yet you did so well.

465
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,600
In my opinion,

466
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,320
you definitely passed. Good luck.

467
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,800
Thanks.

468
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,400
With the total score,

469
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,920
here are our seven finalists.

470
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,320
In two weeks,
we'll have them debut with the press.

471
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,800
And we'll announce
the rules of the final round.

472
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,480
What?! Oh my god!

473
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,480
Ava passed but Pu didn't?

474
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,480
That's not fair!

475
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,920
Why isn't Chompunuch on the list?

476
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,120
How would she pass?

477
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,800
Her score wasn't enough.

478
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,960
But we all saw how good she was.

479
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,360
For transparency,

480
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,320
may I see the scores before the judgment?

481
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,040
We both passed.

482
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,159
And the name
of that cheap bag seller isn't on here.

483
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Really?

484
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,639
How do you know the results already?

485
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,639
This is the total score
from the committee.

486
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,159
What are you doing here?

487
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,360
This is the committee's meeting room.
Get out!

488
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,520
The scores leaked.

489
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,719
I can accept it

490
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,840
if I don't pass because of my performance,

491
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,719
but if it's because of
the committee's bias,

492
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,200
I can't allow it. I demand transparency.

493
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,920
Would you be satisfied
if you saw the scores?

494
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,120
Yes.

495
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,800
Those are the scores we gave you.

496
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,720
I believe there's a mistake
with the score sheet.

497
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,960
I found this torn-up score sheet.

498
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,280
It's Chompunuch's.

499
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,680
Don't worry,

500
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,240
I talked to the committee for you.

501
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,600
Everyone agreed to change their scores

502
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,120
the way you wanted.

503
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,880
With such a mistake,

504
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,560
I think we should check the cameras--

505
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,080
You're right!

506
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,600
Why is it all torn up like this?

507
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,680
This shouldn't have happened!

508
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,360
So, how about we total the scores
once again to be fair.

509
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,080
Kiki.

510
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,800
Please have her wait outside.

511
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,360
Let's go, Pu.

512
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,240
Come.

513
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,400
Yes, we have today's seven finalists now.

514
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,920
We have many more events coming,

515
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,880
so please stay tuned for our project.

516
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,680
If you'll excuse me.

517
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,440
Mrs. Pat.

518
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,080
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

519
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,240
I was disrespectful too.

520
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,360
You're not like

521
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,000
the others who always look down on me.

522
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,480
I judge a person's worth

523
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,360
based on their conscience.

524
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,320
I should go to work now.
Thank you so much for today.

525
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,240
Good luck, Pu.

526
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,040
But I disagree with her.

527
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
You were once a skilled actress.

528
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,640
God knows

529
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,560
if you demanding justice
for the audition today

530
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,560
was just another role you're playing.

531
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Sometimes I'm confused

532
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,160
about what kind of person you are.

533
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,720
That's not important.

534
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,560
But you must be upset with me

535
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,600
because I see right through you.

536
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,440
More like because you're biased.

537
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,160
That's why you see me so negatively.

538
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,560
You took away my husband's opportunity.

539
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Aren't you satisfied already?

540
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,800
Is that why you're saying all this to me?

541
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,240
I see you negatively?

542
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,000
I don't think so.

543
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,040
A girl who marries a guy like your husband

544
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,680
must either be dumb

545
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,640
or just as bad as him.

546
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,600
Yes, Kiki?

547
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,680
You're in the lobby?

548
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,160
Sure, I'll see you there.

549
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,440
On the bill, it says chain straps.

550
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,080
But these are leather straps.

551
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,840
They must've delivered the wrong bag.

552
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,000
My apologies. I didn't check well enough
before I accepted it.

553
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,240
Right.

554
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,080
I should leave now.

555
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,720
Thank you for today.

556
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,440
A girl who marries a guy like your husband

557
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,680
must either be dumb or just as bad as him.

558
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,680
He's just trying to annoy me.
It's all just a coincidence.

559
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,920
What?

560
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,040
What's going on?

561
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,440
Mr. Taweerath's wife is being targeted.

562
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,680
But by whom?

563
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,960
Mrs. Pat,
someone left this in your mailbox.

564
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,080
How did you know bad things
have been happening to me lately?

565
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,400
You said you had a problem with the host.

566
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
I'm only here to find the truth.

567
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,920
If your attitude and your heart are cheap,

568
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,760
you're no better than me.

569
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,840
NEXT EPISODE

570
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,560
Everyone, there's my wife!

571
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,480
Hey!

572
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,640
