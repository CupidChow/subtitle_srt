1
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,080
Yes, I'll see you later, Mr. Nikorn.

2
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,920
I'm heading to the meeting room.

3
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,280
- Okay.
- With all her scandals,

4
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,720
she still got to be
our brand ambassador somehow. My God.

5
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,720
It's either she has connections,

6
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,240
or

7
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,880
she gave something in exchange.

8
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,640
I work just like anyone else.

9
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,760
And if my performance
doesn't meet the company's expectations,

10
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,280
I can get fired too.

11
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,760
- Are you free this evening?
- No.

12
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,080
Are you still mad at me about last night?

13
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,720
If you ask anyone,

14
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,000
they will say you and I

15
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,840
are boss and employee.

16
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
But what if I ask you?

17
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,880
What are we?

18
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,920
We're just two people with the same goal,

19
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,760
wanting to get back at the same guy.

20
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,399
Please don't try to be more than that.

21
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,920
I don't want anything more.

22
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,480
Do your job right!

23
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
My project's about to launch,

24
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,920
and we're getting sued
for encroaching on a national park.

25
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,280
You said you handled it!

26
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,280
I really did handle it all.

27
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,800
You saw that I did.

28
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,120
But suddenly there's news
of a prosecutor suing us for our project,

29
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,320
so I wanted to tell you fast
before word gets out.

30
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
And how did the prosecutor find out?

31
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
Someone sent the land layout

32
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,280
and the project's important documents
to the police.

33
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,160
And how did they get those documents?

34
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,320
Go look into it!

35
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,720
Okay.

36
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,680
How did they go missing?

37
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,680
AROUND THE WORLD RESORT PROJECT

38
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,840
Here.

39
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,040
I believe he's hiding something illegal
about the project.

40
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
You should look into it.

41
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,080
Whatever I can do to get him convicted,

42
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,840
I'm on it for sure.

43
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,920
Pat, you did this, right?

44
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,680
Mmm.

45
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,320
Thank you so much.

46
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,600
I found out who sent the documents.

47
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,600
Who?

48
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,920
Mr. Tham.

49
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
God damn it!

50
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,720
Pat,

51
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,480
you must've helped Tham do this.

52
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,680
I won't lose billions on this for nothing.

53
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,840
Oh, Rath.

54
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,880
Don't think I don't know

55
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,640
what you and Tham did to me
behind my back.

56
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,320
What did we do?

57
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,000
You stole the documents from my desk
and gave them to Tham,

58
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
didn't you?

59
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,400
Do you have proof?

60
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,040
I don't think you do,

61
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
because since you and Dao framed me,

62
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,200
you had all the cameras
in the house removed.

63
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,000
You must have been afraid
proof of your evil would get out.

64
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,720
So you took advantage of that

65
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,720
and stole the documents.

66
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,120
Don't accuse me, Pumeth.

67
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,600
Pat!

68
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,240
What are you doing?

69
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,560
This is my company.

70
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,200
I could sue you for trespassing.

71
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,480
Is something going on, Mr. Tham?

72
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,120
Let's leave, Mr. Rath.

73
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,480
I'll get even with you for this.

74
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,919
We're good here. Thank you.

75
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,840
Okay.

76
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,160
He probably found out
about the land encroachment lawsuit.

77
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,480
I think so too.

78
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
Otherwise, he wouldn't come
all this way to bark at me.

79
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,480
He has a lot of powerful connections
backing him up though.

80
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,760
He got off the hook
with the last case too.

81
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,000
But this time,

82
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
how did the prosecutor
hear about it so fast?

83
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,360
Yes, Uncle?

84
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,240
An urgent meeting?

85
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,960
Since I'm a partner of the new project,

86
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,400
I'd like to choose Ava
to be our new presenter.

87
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,080
But we wanted to extend the contract
with Chompunuch,

88
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,720
since the board was very pleased
with the last project.

89
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,040
We haven't written
a proper contract with her yet.

90
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,560
Anything can be changed.

91
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,320
I think Ava

92
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,120
has a classy appearance,
fitting for the new concept

93
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,160
of this project

94
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
even more so than that Chompunuch kid.

95
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,240
Are you choosing Ava
because she's more fitting

96
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,600
or because you're close to Dao?

97
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,000
Actually,

98
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,920
I didn't want to mention this.

99
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,880
But since

100
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,680
she has someone backing her up like this,

101
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,960
I should show you why

102
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,600
I had to choose a new presenter.

103
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,000
I heard the girl's worked many jobs,

104
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,920
even that kind of service job.

105
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,880
If she becomes the presenter
for our new project,

106
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,720
what if someone looks into her past

107
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,960
and finds even more
explicit photos of her?

108
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
Won't it damage the public image

109
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
of our new condo?

110
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,760
I really appreciate you warning me

111
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
and sending the proof.

112
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,560
I'm glad we nipped it in the bud.

113
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,320
I told you because we're pretty close.

114
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,800
If you let that girl be the presenter
for the new project

115
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,720
that you're investing in

116
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,960
and problems arise,

117
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,640
I'd feel guilty for not warning you first.

118
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,680
You're canceling our deal
because of the photos?

119
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,880
I won't deny working at the bar,

120
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,520
but it was only for a few days.

121
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,480
And I never did
what the photo suggests I did.

122
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,760
If we wanted to prove the photo is edited,

123
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,120
it shouldn't be hard, bro.

124
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,680
I know that,

125
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,040
but the one insisting on the change
is a key partner in the project.

126
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,000
Who?

127
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,960
Mrs. Piangkae.

128
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,240
Now do you see

129
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,480
why it's so difficult?

130
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,960
She's so supportive of Ava,

131
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,120
probably because of Miss Ingdao.

132
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,360
I can't do this alone.

133
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,240
Pu, eat.

134
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,760
Is my case stressing you out?

135
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,840
I know I've caused you a lot of trouble.

136
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,200
I'm not stressed about you.

137
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm stressed about work.

138
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,000
The work I used to do…

139
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,840
I might not get to do it anymore.

140
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,680
Is it because of Ingdao and Ava?

141
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,560
No matter what, I'll fight.

142
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,600
I won't give up.

143
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,920
If you keep fighting like that,
they'll just trip you up.

144
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,560
Even if I get tripped up,

145
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,160
I'll get back up.

146
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,640
No matter what,

147
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,160
I'll find a better life for us.

148
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,560
Why did I suddenly get a flat tire?

149
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,160
Aunt Dao,

150
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,840
I've got a flat.

151
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,880
You got a flat?

152
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,080
Send me your location.

153
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,320
I'll hurry over.

154
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,040
Okay, please hurry.
I don't have any mechanic's number.

155
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,280
Mmm.

156
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,320
Come here.

157
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,320
Come with me.

158
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,360
Ava.

159
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,880
Ava!

160
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,840
Ava!

161
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,080
Ava…

162
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,320
Police? Please help me.

163
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,760
Help!

164
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,920
Yell if you want to die.

165
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,080
I only came to warn you.

166
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,760
If you want to keep your pretty face

167
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,520
for your drama shoots,

168
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,400
stay away from Pu.

169
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,680
Oh,

170
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,440
so Pu sent you to threaten me,

171
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,120
didn't she?

172
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,080
She knows nothing about this!

173
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,640
I know how evil you are.

174
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,800
Someone like you

175
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,720
needs harsh measures

176
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,320
to stop acting so evil.

177
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,040
My aunt will have the police
find me anyway.

178
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,760
Let go. Don't!

179
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Officer, this way!

180
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,640
Aunt Dao! Help me!

181
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,200
Stay away!

182
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,680
Ava! Ava!

183
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,720
- Aunt Dao! Aunt Dao!
- Are you okay?

184
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,520
Aunt Dao, I'm scared.

185
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,400
Sorry for bothering you, Pu.
I shouldn't have forgotten my charger.

186
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,200
No worries. You gave me a ride.

187
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
I'll go get the charger for you.

188
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,320
Chat, what are you doing?

189
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,480
Pu, if the police come,

190
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
tell them you know nothing.

191
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,000
I promise
I won't cause you any more trouble.

192
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,160
What did you do? Tell me now!

193
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,400
She's right.
Whatever it is, you should let her know

194
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,240
so she can help.

195
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,920
I…

196
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,560
I threatened Ava not to hurt you again.

197
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,960
But,

198
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,680
Miss Ingdao brought the police over.

199
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,960
How could you do that?

200
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,800
She's always harassing you,

201
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
and she stole your job too.

202
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
So I did it without thinking.

203
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,280
I should go.

204
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,800
Chat.

205
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,040
What should we do, Miss Pat?

206
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,760
Why did you come back?

207
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,440
If the police ask,
tell them you don't know anything.

208
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,200
Hey, Chat!

209
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Excuse me,

210
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,120
is this Chat's room?

211
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,720
Um, Chat's not here.

212
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,520
What's the matter?

213
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
Can we ask you a few questions?

214
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,880
Sure.

215
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,720
Chat, get in the car.

216
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,920
There's a checkpoint ahead.

217
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,400
You can stay here for now.

218
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
People don't come around here a lot.

219
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,960
No one can find you easily.

220
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,600
I'll stay at Kiki's for now.

221
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,920
We'll figure out later

222
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,320
what to do next.

223
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,920
I really appreciate your help.

224
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,760
I'm not helping you.

225
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,240
I'm helping Pu.

226
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,400
This is a photo of me
when I was a waitress at a bar.

227
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,560
I really was just a waitress.

228
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,360
I didn't do anything inappropriate
as the photo suggests.

229
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,120
And how did these photos get out?

230
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,880
I don't know
how Mrs. Piangkae got them either.

231
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,320
But I can confirm this.

232
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,840
If you want a witness,

233
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,360
I can ask the bar's manager
to vouch for me.

234
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,400
And how can we be sure
your witness won't lie to side with you?

235
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,880
You just have to reduce your bias

236
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,360
and listen to our explanation.

237
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,160
Pat.

238
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,160
I forgot to tell you
someone's coming today

239
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,080
to inform us more about your background.

240
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
And who's that?

241
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,520
Mr. Wiwat, thank you so much

242
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,640
for inviting me to this meeting today.

243
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,080
Here.

244
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,840
This is a police report on Mr. Chat,

245
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,640
Chompunuch's brother.

246
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,640
Her older brother

247
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,360
was arrested before

248
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
but got out on bail,

249
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,520
though the case isn't closed yet.

250
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,000
So Chompunuch had her brother threaten Ava

251
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,000
because she was afraid
she'd lose her job to her.

252
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,520
I never had my brother do such a thing.

253
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,040
Then bring him over,

254
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,720
so he can tell us the truth.

255
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,200
Don't just hide him
from the police like this.

256
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,680
Why?

257
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,400
Are you afraid?

258
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,680
That if your brother were arrested, they'd
find out you had something to do with it?

259
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,520
This should be enough to conclude

260
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,080
that we can't work
with someone with a record like yours.

261
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,920
It could damage our company's reputation.

262
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,480
I suggest we replace our presenter

263
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,040
with

264
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,000
Miss Ava.

265
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,840
Won't you hear what an important person
in the project thinks first?

266
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,440
I'll be representing Mrs. Piangkae

267
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,720
in today's meeting
about the new condo project's presenter.

268
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,760
A coffee delivery boy
representing Mrs. Piangkae?

269
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,560
Then, I should officially introduce him.

270
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,440
This is Janepob,

271
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,760
Mrs. Piangkae's only son.

272
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,440
Mrs. Piangkae's son?

273
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,080
I've been interning
at one of our company's cafes,

274
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,000
but now I'm ready
to fully help my mother with work.

275
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,840
The problem has come to my attention,

276
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,680
so I had an expert look into it

277
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,240
to make it fair
for the person we're working with,

278
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,960
and it turns out the photo was edited.

279
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,640
See,

280
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,840
this is the unedited version.

281
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,200
And this

282
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,280
is the expert's opinion.

283
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,480
Then,

284
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,720
we can press charges
against whoever edited the photo

285
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,160
to frame Pu.

286
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,640
If we find out who did it,

287
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,720
Chompunuch can sue them right away.

288
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
Now that the truth is out,

289
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,760
as my mother's representative,

290
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,400
I suggest that Chompunuch
remain the presenter.

291
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,600
Aunt Dao, did the board choose me
to be the presenter?

292
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,600
Janepob came to help,

293
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,000
so they still want her as the presenter.

294
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,760
That coffee delivery boy!

295
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
He's no coffee delivery boy.

296
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,840
He's Mrs. Piangkae's son.

297
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,840
Huh?

298
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,560
That guy

299
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,440
is Piangkae's son?

300
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,040
Pu,

301
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,880
are you mad at me?

302
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,320
Was it fun fooling everyone,
especially me?

303
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,520
I never meant to fool anyone.

304
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,560
I really had to.

305
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,600
No wonder

306
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,000
you're so close to Mr. Tham.

307
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,400
It must have been fun for you.

308
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,560
Sorry,

309
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,080
I guess I should call you Mr. Janepob now.

310
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,760
I thought you'd be glad
I came to help you.

311
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,080
If I were just
"Janepob the coffee delivery boy,"

312
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,760
I probably wouldn't be able to.

313
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,680
I guess so.

314
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,120
What can someone born poor even do?

315
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,800
No matter how hard they fight,
they'll never win.

316
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,200
It takes being born as "Mr. Janepob,"

317
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,840
son of a big company owner,

318
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,000
to have the power to help.

319
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,360
Pu,

320
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,040
I never meant to fool you.

321
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,600
And helping you isn't some game for me.

322
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,160
Thank you

323
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,120
for pitying me so much

324
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,520
that you'd stoop to my level just to help.

325
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,800
I'll remember you
as yet another person I owe.

326
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,200
Pu!

327
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,680
Looks like Miss Ingdao
really wants Pu's brother in trouble.

328
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,800
She won't let this end easily.

329
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,520
Stop running!

330
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,320
Where are you going?

331
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,520
Come here.

332
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,120
Hey, can't we handle this politely?

333
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,320
Why all this fighting?

334
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,480
Chat!

335
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,960
I know who sent you.

336
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,280
If you don't leave now,
I'll call the police.

337
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,480
Let's go.

338
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,760
Chat.

339
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,160
Miss Ingdao probably knows
that Chat is here.

340
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,080
He should turn himself in now.

341
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,080
Will he face serious charges?

342
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,520
If your brother tells the truth
about threatening Ava,

343
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,000
I can find you a good lawyer.

344
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
The sentence shouldn't be too serious.

345
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,240
So, people are hiding

346
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,960
a criminal from the police?

347
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,080
No wonder they couldn't find him.

348
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,600
Dao.

349
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,480
Your partners and board
need to hear about this, Mr. Tham.

350
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,800
If you don't want a serious case,

351
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,960
someone has to take responsibility.

352
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,400
Hello, Mrs. Piangkae.

353
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,280
With all this trouble,

354
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,920
I'd ask you to remove both the presenter

355
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,200
and the brand ambassador at the same time.

356
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,680
Mom.

357
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,080
If Patchanin is sheltering a criminal

358
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,800
and word gets out,

359
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,160
it will seriously damage
the company's reputation.

360
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,120
Is this Miss Ingdao threatening us?

361
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,120
No, she's not,

362
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,640
because she doesn't want
her niece caught in a scandal.

363
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,480
She just wants us

364
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,120
to help punish those responsible,

365
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,440
those who helped Ava's attacker.

366
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,040
But Pu had nothing to do with it.

367
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,480
Also,

368
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,680
it was agreed in the meeting yesterday

369
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,640
that Pu would stay on as the presenter.

370
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,240
That's only because
you used my name to help her.

371
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,040
Don't think I don't know

372
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,960
why you're so eager to defend her.

373
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,520
But Chat already turned himself in.

374
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,000
His charge isn't even that serious.

375
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,880
How disappointing.

376
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,200
The CEO of this company

377
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,840
can't separate
personal matters from business.

378
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,960
Or is this all because of that scandal

379
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,680
everyone's talking about?

380
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,120
Anyway,

381
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,040
if you can't resolve this issue

382
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,600
in a way that satisfies me,

383
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,520
I won't be staying on
as a shareholder in the project.

384
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,280
Mom.

385
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,520
I can overlook the issue with Chompunuch,

386
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,000
but not the one with Pat.

387
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,400
EMPLOYEE CONTRACT TERMINATION LETTER

388
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,720
I'm sorry.

389
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
I understand.

390
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,560
I agree to the company
terminating my employment

391
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,720
without any conditions,
as Mrs. Piangkae and Mr. Wiwat requested.

392
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,120
If Miss Ingdao hadn't shown up that day,
I probably could've helped you more.

393
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,360
I made a mistake
believing I could fix everything.

394
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,680
I can't help you with the corporate stuff.

395
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,920
But if it's anything else,

396
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,280
I'll find a way.

397
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,360
I've been busy,

398
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,160
so I couldn't visit you.

399
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,160
It's good you didn't come.

400
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,280
I don't want anyone suspecting anything.

401
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,800
Apparently,
Taweerath's been working non-stop

402
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,120
to save himself from the lawsuit.

403
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,320
If it weren't for your help,

404
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,680
what I reported
wouldn't have even reached the prosecutor.

405
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,360
It's all thanks to what Pat said

406
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,880
in the voice recorder you sent me.

407
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,840
I tried to reach you,
but you didn't pick up.

408
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,120
That's why I had to send it.

409
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,960
You sure are persistent.

410
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,000
It made me decide

411
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,640
to collect my thoughts,

412
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,720
to let go of my pride and anger.

413
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,880
That's when I realized

414
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,840
just how evil Taweerath is.

415
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,120
Lately, he's been pretending
to be nice to me.

416
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,840
Visiting

417
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,680
and contacting me often.

418
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,720
He probably wants to see

419
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,080
if I've forgiven Pat.

420
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,480
That's why you never contact her

421
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,080
and don't let me tell her

422
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,560
that you're helping us.

423
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,200
I don't want Taweerath
to suspect anything.

424
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,920
I want to make sure this case

425
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,160
puts him in serious trouble first.

426
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,600
But,

427
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,720
Miss Pat's really upset right now.

428
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,320
If she knew you understood her,

429
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,680
I think she'd feel better.

430
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,960
Does she have any other problems?

431
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,640
Yes.

432
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,800
It's about her and my company.

433
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,240
Ah.

434
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,720
Then I need you to take something to her.

435
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,920
Thank you for sending those guys
to search Pat's house.

436
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,400
Even if we couldn't get Pu removed
as the presenter,

437
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,160
at least

438
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,240
we managed to get Pat out.

439
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,600
Now, the drama is all that's left,

440
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,520
and I'll make sure
she's removed from that no matter what.

441
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,200
Rath.

442
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,720
Weren't you listening to me at all?

443
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,040
What about the case,

444
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,840
did you handle it yet?

445
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,760
I've been pulling strings.

446
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,360
Pulling strings? And what if you fail?

447
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,200
Don't jinx it.

448
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,920
I'm not.

449
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,080
I just don't want you to get into trouble.
You've invested over a billion in this.

450
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,160
If you can't handle it,

451
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,600
you won't just lose the money,

452
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,680
you'll get sued.

453
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,080
If I get in trouble

454
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,360
or lose money,

455
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,240
someone's going to
have to take responsibility.

456
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,720
Anything new?

457
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,480
Yes.

458
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,080
The person backing Mr. Tham is Mr. Kobsak.

459
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,960
My father gave me this?

460
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,280
He said you like the flower.

461
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
He saw it bloom,

462
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,080
so he asked me to give it to you.

463
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,280
That means…

464
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,800
He understands you completely now.

465
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,920
Dad.

466
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,719
Dad,

467
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,080
it's me.

468
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,720
You have some nerve calling me.

469
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,280
You embarrassed me
and caused me so much trouble.

470
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,200
I'll never forgive you.

471
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,200
Don't try to reach me again.

472
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,880
Sure, you're my blood,
but I can cut you off too!

473
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,400
He's still mad at me.

474
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,880
There's no way.

475
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,560
I'll go see him.

476
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,760
Miss Pat!

477
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,960
Nuan?

478
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,760
Nuan?

479
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,320
Normally, she'd invite me in.

480
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,880
Dad?

481
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Dad, can I come in?

482
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,800
Dad.

483
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,240
- Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Miss Pat, wait!

484
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,440
- Dad! Dad!
- Miss Pat, wait! Calm down!

485
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,640
- Dad! Dad!
- We have to call the police!

486
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,720
- Dad!
- Miss Pat, let's call the police first!

487
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,400
Dad! Dad!

488
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,320
Dad!

489
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,280
I can cut you off too!

490
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,680
Are you happy now?

491
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,280
I hope you can finally
stop holding a grudge against my daughter.

492
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,440
A grudge?

493
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,200
This is more like bad karma

494
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,840
for what you and your daughter did to me.

495
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,760
And it's about time

496
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,880
you get your karma.

497
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,880
I can confirm
he wasn't mad at you anymore.

498
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,560
I should've gone to see him earlier,

499
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,240
to apologize sooner.

500
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,360
Why are you here?

501
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,200
I'm here to see my house, of course.

502
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,840
Your house?

503
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,440
Mr. Kobsak already sold this house

504
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,000
and a lot of his land to Mr. Rath.

505
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,200
Seriously, all this time

506
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,440
we were together,
does it mean nothing to you?

507
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,760
You can't contact Pu either?

508
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,760
No. Please hurry over.

509
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,160
Let's go find Chat and Pu.

510
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,320
I've got a bad feeling about this.

511
