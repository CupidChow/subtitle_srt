1
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Miss Pat?

2
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,840
I HAD TO HURRY TO WORK
SO I DIDN'T PREPARE FOOD.

3
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,920
LOCK UP IF YOU GO OUTSIDE.

4
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,800
Pat, the next scene is a fight scene.

5
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,400
This is a real knife,
but we dulled it down.

6
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,680
Oh,

7
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,120
we're doing a fight scene next?

8
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,040
Yes, are you ready for it?

9
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,160
Uh,

10
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,880
- Yes, I am.
- Alright.

11
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,560
You were three hours late.

12
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
If you're not ready, just tell them.

13
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,680
I never said I wasn't ready.

14
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,920
Then hurry up,

15
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,600
because you've already
slowed everyone down a lot.

16
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,760
I hope you don't consider yourself
so important that we should wait for you.

17
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,600
Don't worry. I'm not like you, Dao.

18
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,560
But I've never seen
Miss Dao run late to a shoot.

19
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,320
Plus, she studies
the script before coming.

20
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,840
Very professional.

21
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,680
So are you, Pu.

22
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,320
Are you studying the role of a betrayer?

23
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,200
Ah,

24
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,160
that's the next scene.

25
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,280
Miss Pat.

26
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,320
- Thank you, Rosé.
- Of course.

27
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,840
Act as you're briefed.

28
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,600
And be careful with the knife.
It's dangerous.

29
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,960
Once you start tugging, I'll say cut.

30
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,960
- Okay?
- Okay.

31
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,400
Stand by! Let's go!

32
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,320
Pu, wait for your cue.

33
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,680
Ready…

34
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
Kem,

35
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,280
you're betraying our masters

36
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,120
to run away with them?

37
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,120
The ones who are accusing us

38
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,640
of burning the village down?

39
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,040
The masters?

40
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,240
They're just hypocrites,

41
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,560
fooling us into thinking they're moral

42
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,920
and that we should be grateful to them.

43
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,120
They were using us.

44
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,240
Eventually, they'll take our lives.

45
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,960
You believe The Wild Tiger?

46
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,400
Actually,

47
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,240
I'm not just leaving,

48
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,640
but I'm also taking my revenge

49
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,200
for how they used me my whole life.

50
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,760
In that case,

51
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,240
I have an ungrateful person to get rid of.

52
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,800
Kem, Bua,

53
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,160
we're sisters. Why are you fighting?

54
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,440
Cut!

55
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,480
Why did you do that, Dao?

56
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,880
I should ask you, Pat!

57
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,760
Are you using your same old tricks?

58
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,640
What the hell do you mean?

59
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,520
I saw you.

60
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,960
You hurt her on purpose.

61
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,280
Oh dear.

62
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,960
As the producer,
I feel so bad this happened.

63
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,560
No worries.

64
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,880
I'll try to understand

65
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,720
that Pat's just really sad
about Mr. Kobsak.

66
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,120
She's probably not ready to work.

67
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,760
Luckily, I wasn't hurt too badly.

68
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
If she'd done this to someone else,
would they feel okay

69
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,880
risking themselves just to shoot a scene
with the leading lady?

70
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,480
She's right. I'm getting scared too.

71
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,560
Oh dear.

72
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,760
Pat, I think you might want
to go see someone.

73
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,600
What do you mean, Som?

74
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,120
In this day and age,

75
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,680
if you have mental health problems,

76
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,320
you need to see a therapist.

77
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,360
I want them to help check

78
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,720
if you're fit for work,

79
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,560
so I can find solutions
in case you're not.

80
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,159
Whether it's cutting you out
or giving you a smaller role.

81
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,880
Som--

82
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,159
Pat,

83
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,080
I'll need
the assessment result quite soon.

84
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,159
I need to keep the production going.

85
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,200
Pu.

86
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,680
Didn't you see it too?

87
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,680
That Dao stabbed herself on purpose?

88
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,280
No.

89
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,880
I saw you hurting Miss Dao on purpose.

90
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,800
I wasn't bending the facts.

91
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,040
You've changed a lot, Pu.

92
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,480
If changing means you can survive,

93
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,880
who wouldn't want to change?

94
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
But if surviving

95
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,280
means you have to stoop so low,

96
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,440
you won't survive for long.

97
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,640
We'll see.

98
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
Pu.

99
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,200
Hey!

100
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,400
Go ahead then.

101
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,960
You already hurt me.

102
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
If you hurt her too,

103
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,280
Som won't need to wait
for your mental health assessment.

104
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,680
Right.

105
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,280
You can't commit
two crimes in one day, Miss Pat.

106
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,120
Let's go, Pu.

107
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,520
We have many scenes to shoot.

108
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,440
Let Pat see her shrink.

109
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,320
Miss Pat.

110
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,480
Are you alright?

111
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,680
Mr. Tham.

112
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,520
What are you doing here?

113
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I woke up and didn't see you,

114
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,720
so I got worried

115
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,240
and came here.

116
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,800
I have a headache. Can you take me home?

117
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,280
Sure.

118
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,240
Take it.

119
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,760
But it's so expensive.

120
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,400
This is your reward for helping me today.

121
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,800
But if you can get Patchanin
removed from the drama,

122
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,360
I can give you even more.

123
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,960
I wasn't helping you.

124
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,120
I was just telling the truth as I saw it.

125
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,440
Fine.

126
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,080
Your truth got you that reward.

127
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Please take it.

128
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
As a celebrity, you need stuff like this.

129
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,120
And don't forget
to post pictures on social media.

130
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,000
Let everyone know

131
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,240
how much better your life is now.

132
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,400
Show those who once insulted you

133
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
and kept you below them.

134
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,160
Let them squirm
as they see you on the screen.

135
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
Open it.

136
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,440
Aunt Dao,

137
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,080
why did you let her in our house?

138
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,680
Ava.

139
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,160
Ava, Ava.

140
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,000
Ava, Ava…

141
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,720
What's the matter with her?

142
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,040
She's sick. You should go home.

143
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,120
- Let's go.
- Aunt Dao…

144
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
Aunt Dao.

145
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,800
Ava, Ava.

146
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,440
Aunt Dao, please don't let her
in our house again.

147
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,160
- I don't want to see her face.
- Ava…

148
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,760
- I don't…
- Calm down. Pu's gone now. It's okay.

149
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,240
Okay? Let's go.

150
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,200
I WANT TO SEE YOU

151
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,800
THANK YOU DAO

152
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,760
So Dao

153
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,760
gave you this bag?

154
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,040
So you like snooping around.

155
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,480
Don't <i>like </i>the post,
then no one will know.

156
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,360
I only do it with people who interest me.

157
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
But if you like that stuff,

158
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,960
I can find you more too.

159
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,040
But I'll need to give
something in exchange, right?

160
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,960
Well, I'm a businessman,

161
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,760
not a social worker.

162
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,400
But I assure you,
if you do business with me,

163
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,240
you'll live comfortably your whole life.

164
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
I'm not easy
like all the other girls you knew.

165
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,320
If I'm giving you something,

166
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,200
I'll need something bigger

167
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,880
and better than all your previous girls.

168
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,560
All of them?

169
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,920
Looks like you don't have the guts.

170
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,600
Maybe I should go find
someone who can offer more.

171
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,360
Fine.

172
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,520
I can give you more than I give Ingdao.

173
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,320
But you have to
prove your worth to me first.

174
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,240
I know

175
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,040
that the girls around you

176
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,080
must be able to do more
than just lay in bed.

177
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,760
Tell me,

178
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,320
what do you need me to do?

179
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,200
I'll use the land I got from Mr. Kobsak
for my new project,

180
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,000
but I want a capitalist
who's wealthy enough as my shareholder.

181
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,920
You're a famous celebrity now.

182
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
Do you think your connections

183
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,920
could help me?

184
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,000
If you want to be above all of my women,

185
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,520
you have to prove yourself to me.

186
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,320
Have you guys seen this?

187
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,720
What is it?

188
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,680
That Pu Kid.

189
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,160
- THANK YOU, DAO
- She has only played in two dramas.

190
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,640
Who knows where she got the money from,

191
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,240
buying an expensive bag to show it off,

192
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,520
sitting in a fancy restaurant.

193
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,200
And she's at a five-star luxury bar too.

194
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,520
Or maybe she got a sugar daddy?

195
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,880
I gave her the bag.

196
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,400
Last week you invited her to your house,

197
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,440
and now you give her the bag too?
Did someone curse you?

198
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,680
Why would you say that?

199
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,480
You always hated her guts.

200
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,040
I never hated anyone.

201
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,880
She's coming today too.

202
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,040
There she is.

203
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,960
I brought everyone desserts.

204
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,079
Did you buy them from the streets
for five to ten baht each?

205
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,079
We don't eat that kind of stuff.

206
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,880
They're from my hotel.

207
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,119
But if you don't like them,

208
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,839
I must apologize.

209
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,880
Oh? And who's that?

210
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,440
Why did you bring some adult
who lives near your rental house?

211
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,280
This is Mrs. Som Aiyarang.

212
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,240
Som Aiyarang? Sounds familiar.

213
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,240
Mrs. Som is worth tens of billions.

214
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,600
- Tens of billions?
- Tens of billions?

215
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,320
- Mrs. Som!
- Mrs. Som!

216
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,080
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

217
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,680
Wow, Mrs. Som.

218
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,920
You look so beautiful.

219
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
- You're so beautiful today.
- How did you get her here?

220
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,920
- Please have a seat.
- So beautiful.

221
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Mrs. Som's rich husband
passed away years ago.

222
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,360
She handles all of his inheritance

223
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,960
because her daughter married
and moved abroad

224
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,400
and had no interest in business.

225
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,680
Pu brought Mrs. Som to our house?

226
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes,

227
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,560
she said Captain introduced her.

228
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,960
Plus, Mrs. Som's a fan of <i>Star Sea</i>.

229
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,480
She bought Pu lots of votes.

230
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,360
She adores Pu, so she agreed to come.

231
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,560
It seems no matter where Pu goes,

232
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,960
everyone adores her.

233
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,200
Mrs. Som is looking
to invest in real estate.

234
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,400
She's still deciding
between Mr. Kobsak's land that you got

235
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,920
and Mr. Tham's land.

236
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,880
That damn Tham.

237
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,560
When will he stop competing with me?

238
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
Excuse me,

239
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,640
Mrs. Som is about to leave.

240
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,840
Tomorrow she flies to London
to see her daughter.

241
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,320
Rath,

242
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,080
you should hurry and go talk to Mrs. Som

243
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,680
before someone beats you to it.

244
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,840
An insider told me Mrs. Som

245
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,040
agreed to partner with Taweerath's company

246
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,680
in his midtown condominium project.

247
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,400
I heard

248
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,400
he's selling Mr. Kobsak's land to Mrs. Som
for far cheaper than the valuation,

249
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,840
but he'll make it up
with the profit from the condo's sales.

250
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,240
No wonder Mrs. Som went silent
and never got back to us.

251
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,040
Anyway, please follow my new project
and Rath's new project too.

252
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,520
Yes. I'm launching a new project.

253
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,800
The budget is over a billion.

254
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,880
- Woah.
- Woah.

255
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,800
It's on very expensive land
right in the center of the city.

256
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,280
It belonged to my ex-wife's father.

257
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,880
He really loved me.

258
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,000
He gave me the land before he passed away.

259
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Actually, I didn't want to tell you this.

260
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,320
I wanted to keep it a secret first.

261
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,600
If something comes up, I'll let you know.

262
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

263
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,720
Are you alright?

264
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,600
I'm fine.

265
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,560
I'm just upset

266
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,520
that I can't expose
a single evil thing Rath did.

267
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,320
And he's taking advantage
of my father's land.

268
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,400
I don't believe
he got the land rightfully.

269
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,960
I want evil people
to get their Karma for once,

270
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,640
even if just a little bit.

271
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,320
I want to pay him back just as you do.

272
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,040
No matter how hard it is,

273
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,280
I won't back down easily.

274
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,120
Hang in there, Miss Pat.

275
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,440
Of course.

276
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,160
No matter what, I won't let him
take Dad's land so easily.

277
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,800
We shouldn't have told the news
before signing a contract.

278
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,840
Since you agreed to sell the land,

279
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,800
Mrs. Som hasn't gotten back to us yet.

280
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,360
If we don't have a signed contract,
the project can't begin.

281
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,320
In that case, you'll be in trouble.

282
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,200
No matter what,
I'm sure there won't be any problems.

283
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,960
Mrs. Som chose to invest
with me, not Tham.

284
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,720
There's no way she will change her mind.

285
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Okay.

286
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,760
Got it.

287
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,680
I'll inform Mr. Rath
and get back to you.

288
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
It's Mrs. Som's secretary.

289
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,720
Is it about signing a contract?

290
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,040
They said they'd bring the contract
for you to sign

291
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,640
whenever you're available.

292
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Do it today then.

293
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,560
The price we agreed on

294
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,680
wasn't this low.

295
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,760
This is like
I'm giving Mrs. Som the land for free.

296
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,760
But you'll get
a bigger share of the profit

297
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,560
than we discussed.

298
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,680
That's the deal.

299
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,920
Isn't it a bit strange?

300
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,200
This is how Mrs. Som makes contracts
with other businessmen too.

301
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Once the condo has been built, she'll buy

302
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
more than 30 rooms in it

303
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
for better long-term profits.

304
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,840
I guess that's fair. With land sales,

305
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,720
it's a one-time thing.

306
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,960
But if she buys rooms in a condo,
she can sell them

307
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,160
or rent them out as well.

308
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,440
Mrs. Som sure is farsighted.

309
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,560
If you have no issues,

310
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,000
I can assure you

311
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,880
she'll be happy to work with you again.

312
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Yes, Sir?

313
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,840
The new condo project?

314
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,960
I'm about to sign the contract.

315
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,320
You'd like to invest too?

316
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,120
Sure.

317
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,720
I'll come show you the details myself.

318
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,920
I'll see you then.

319
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,720
If that's the case, I have no issues.

320
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,680
Of course I'd trust someone like Mrs. Som.

321
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,760
Here you go.

322
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,120
Your reward

323
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,800
for introducing me to Mrs. Som.

324
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,120
It looks like Miss Pat's.

325
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,400
I remember her
wearing a necklace like this.

326
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,440
So you don't want it?

327
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,880
Why would I reject it?

328
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,840
The only problem is that

329
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,920
it's old and out of fashion now.

330
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,880
It would be embarrassing
to wear this anywhere.

331
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,120
If it's okay, I'd like to pick one myself.

332
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,680
Of course.

333
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,960
I still have a lot of Pat's stuff.

334
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,200
And tonight,

335
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,480
Dao's not sleeping at my house.

336
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,520
You can go pick it yourself.
Whatever you like,

337
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,440
you can come and get it from the bedroom.

338
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,320
Are you sure
it won't be a problem if I go?

339
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,320
You're really not scared?

340
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,880
Then let's go. I'm not scared of anyone,

341
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,120
not even Ingdao.

342
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,480
I didn't think I'd run into you here.

343
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,360
Didn't Miss Ingdao
come with you, Mr. Rath?

344
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,040
I'm here to talk about work with Mr. Rath,
so Dao didn't come.

345
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,560
Mr. Rath,

346
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,920
you should go home.

347
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
Anyway, thanks for the work you did.

348
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,240
Hey.

349
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,280
Let go.

350
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,400
Are you the same Pu I used to know?

351
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,560
Someone with no money and no hope,

352
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,720
who would want that?

353
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,280
So your greed

354
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,120
has paid off?

355
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,000
Not yet.

356
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,840
Because I need more.

357
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,960
Then tell me what you want.

358
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,880
If Taweerath can buy it for you,
I can too.

359
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,040
Name your price.

360
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,600
How much do you want?

361
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
I know you have money,

362
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,680
but if you want to show it off,
do it somewhere else.

363
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,120
And don't do that to me again.

364
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,400
They had a really big fight.

365
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,200
This is why

366
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,240
they say, "Money is the sharpest paper.

367
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,120
It can cut anything off,

368
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,400
even your family or lover."

369
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,000
Those who say
the heart matters more than money

370
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,240
are just creating beautiful quotes
to comfort themselves through life.

371
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,040
Oh,

372
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,680
what about the meeting for
the other investors to talk to Mrs. Som?

373
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,840
I scheduled it with them already.

374
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,200
They all agreed to come.

375
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,040
Mrs. Som's secretary said she'd come too.

376
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,200
The land I got from that old fart for free

377
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,160
will make me billions.

378
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,080
I can't wait to see the look
on Pat and Tham's faces

379
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,440
once the project launches.

380
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,560
What will it look like?

381
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,840
When will Mrs. Som arrive?

382
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,680
I'm waiting to sign the contract.

383
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,240
She should be here in just a moment.

384
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,280
Don't worry,

385
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,080
all of you are my VIP investors.

386
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,840
I won't disappoint you.

387
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,360
Mr. Rath, Mrs. Som and her secretary
aren't picking up at all.

388
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,560
What?

389
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,840
What does this mean, Mr. Taweerath?

390
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,160
What's the matter, Mr. Chan?

391
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,840
Well, in my group chat,

392
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,000
my friend said Mrs. Som
never agreed to invest with you.

393
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,240
My wife texted me that too.

394
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,720
What's going on, Mr. Taweerath?
Are you trying to fool us?

395
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,520
Why would I do that?

396
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,840
How could someone like me fool anyone?

397
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,720
Right.

398
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,520
Mr. Rath just closed the sale
with Mrs. Som too.

399
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,760
This doesn't look good. Let's go.

400
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,120
Uh, wait--

401
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,120
Everyone, please wait.

402
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,240
I'll talk to them, Mr. Rath.

403
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,680
What's going on? How did this happen?

404
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,640
Why would someone like Mrs. Som
act this way?

405
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,200
This deal is worth billions.

406
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,880
How am I supposed to know?

407
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,880
I shouldn't have signed the contract
like you told me to.

408
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,440
You're blaming me?

409
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,360
You're the one who liked her offer.

410
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,960
That's why you sold the land.

411
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,800
If Mrs. Som would do this to me,

412
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,600
I'll take back my land.

413
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,520
If you want your land back,

414
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,920
you'll have to talk to me.

415
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,440
How does this concern you?

416
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,960
Well, the land is in my name now.

417
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
Here's proof.

418
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,080
It's my father's land.

419
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,240
I wouldn't let anyone
take advantage of it so easily.

420
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,640
I wanted to ask you to help me.

421
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,080
The proof of Taweerath's evil deeds

422
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,080
that I gave you, it's all true.

423
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,000
I want Dad's land back.

424
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,360
My dad

425
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,920
would never have sold the land to Rath.

426
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,960
If I do it, I'll lose my credibility.

427
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,200
But right now, only you

428
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,840
can help Miss Pat.

429
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,400
Fine.

430
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,760
Mr. Kobsak

431
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,240
has helped me many times too.

432
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,080
So this time,
I'm helping his daughter in return.

433
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,480
Thank you.

434
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,920
I should thank you too.

435
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,720
Thanks to you,
I got Dad's land back at a price

436
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,400
so cheap, it's like I got it for free.

437
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,040
If you're mad,
blame yourself for not being cautious.

438
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,680
I never thought

439
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,520
you'd use such a shameless trick.

440
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,200
Well, since you're both so shameless,

441
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,880
I've realized I can't play fair

442
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,760
if I want to get rid of scumbags like you.

443
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,960
Anyway,

444
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,120
if you want Miss Pat's land back
for your project,

445
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,440
offer a price that's fair

446
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,720
and fitting for what you've done,

447
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,080
and I'll have my legal team consider it.

448
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,000
This won't end so easily, Rath.

449
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,480
Because this was nothing
compared to what you did to me.

450
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,040
I still have
plenty of surprises left for you.

451
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,080
This is bad, Mr. Rath.

452
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,680
What now?

453
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,200
I tried talking to them,
but they're really upset.

454
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,600
They're withdrawing
from the previous project too.

455
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,880
Damn it!

456
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,000
You think you'll win by doing this?

457
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,600
You seem anxious, Dao.

458
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,640
I told you,

459
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,920
this is just the beginning.
There are many sequels to come.

460
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,960
You were the one who said
you'd push me to my lowest.

461
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,640
Then let me tell you this.

462
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,520
I'll take back everything
you and Rath stole.

463
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,120
And you'll need to pay interest.

464
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,720
Miss Dao.

465
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,680
Calm down.

466
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,640
If someone sees, you'll be on the news.

467
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,720
Mr. Tham,

468
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,360
you seem like a smart guy.

469
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,360
Didn't you hear what Patchanin said?

470
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,480
She wants everything back.

471
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,960
I bet

472
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,640
she wants Rath back too.

473
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,880
I stopped being stupid long ago.

474
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,239
A guy like Rath isn't worth enough
for me to regret losing.

475
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,320
You're the only one who is still blind.

476
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,880
I wonder

477
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,719
if you really love him
or just want to get back at me.

478
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,719
And you're with him
for your personal gain.

479
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,120
If you're still sensible enough
to open your eyes,

480
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,960
you'd know Rath was never honest
or sincere with anyone,

481
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,560
not even you.

482
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,679
You think you can mess
with my head so easily?

483
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,719
I'm not like you.

484
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,719
Knowing you, it should be hard
for anyone to mess with your head, right?

485
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,760
You should know Taweerath well already.

486
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,760
What he did to Miss Pat behind her back,

487
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
I bet you know.

488
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,600
Maybe he's doing
the same thing to you now.

489
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,080
I know it's hard to watch your back,

490
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,040
but I want you to try.

491
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,880
Maybe your back is
full of nasty wounds now.

492
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,520
I hope you realize soon.

493
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,760
Let's go.

494
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,640
Next month I'm starting a new course,
one that I can increase the price on,

495
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,120
so I wanted you

496
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,800
to help promote it

497
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,680
and come teach a class just once or twice.

498
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,160
And if you can make a deal
with the drama crew

499
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,520
for our students to play in a scene,
that would be perfect.

500
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,600
<i>If you're still sensible enough</i>
<i>to open your eyes,</i>

501
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,360
<i>you'd know Rath was never honest</i>
<i>or sincere with anyone,</i>

502
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,320
<i>not even you.</i>

503
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,560
Ah!

504
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,080
Dao,

505
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,920
what's wrong? Do you not like my course?

506
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,480
It's nothing. I was thinking
about something else, so…

507
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,640
Are you upset about something?

508
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
Or is this about Mr. Rath?

509
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,560
What did you hear?

510
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,000
I didn't hear anything,

511
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:52,320
but you seemed stressed,
so I thought it might be about Mr. Rath.

512
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,000
If you know something, just tell me.

513
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,560
Don't let me find out later
that you knew and didn't tell me.

514
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,040
Well, actually,

515
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,680
it's a small thing.

516
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,680
Maybe it's nothing.

517
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,960
Well, on the day
you threw a party at your house,

518
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,800
that Pu girl…

519
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
At first I didn't think much of it.

520
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,360
But two days ago,

521
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,600
I was checking out Pu's Instagram,

522
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,800
and I saw Mr. Rath <i>heart </i>her post.

523
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,200
But a few seconds later,
the <i>like </i>was gone.

524
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,240
I bet it was an accident
while he was snooping on her page.

525
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,400
But I didn't dare to tell you.

526
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,280
I was afraid you'd think
I was trying to stir things up.

527
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,520
What is this, Mr. Rath?

528
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,560
Why call me here just to do this to me?

529
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,280
I can do worse
if it's about people trying to fool me.

530
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,080
If this is about Mrs. Som,

531
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,880
I really don't know anything.

532
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,440
I only got her contact from Captain,

533
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,040
and I did everything you asked.

534
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,640
I should've suspected.

535
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,600
How could someone like you
get close to Mrs. Som so easily?

536
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,000
It must have been Miss Pat's plan,

537
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,760
using me to get back at you

538
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,040
so that you'd get back at me too.

539
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,880
But don't worry.
I've got a plan for your revenge.

540
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,400
Aren't you a VIP here?

541
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,480
Should we talk in a room upstairs

542
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,240
so I can explain in detail?

543
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,120
Let's head upstairs first.

544
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,440
Sure.

545
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,440
NEXT EPISODE

546
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,640
I bet you didn't want anyone to know
you were in the room with Taweerath.

547
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,680
<i>I wanted to talk to you.</i>

548
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,480
<i>I'll tell you this as a kindness.</i>

549
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,960
<i>There's another girl</i>
<i>Rath is taking care of.</i>

550
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,640
<i>Who is she?</i>

551
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,760
<i>I've prepared a gift for you.</i>

552
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,440
<i>How's life treating you?</i>

553
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,040
I can tell from your eyes,

554
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,280
you're not happy.

555
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,800
Fighting a scumbag like Taweerath
isn't easy,

556
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,200
<i>but no matter how hard it gets,</i>

557
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,840
<i>I'll always be right by your side.</i>

558
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,680
