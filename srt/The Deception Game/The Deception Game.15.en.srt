1
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,800
Aunt Dao,

2
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,400
Rath came to see you.

3
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,720
Are you okay?

4
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,080
What were you doing in the storage room?

5
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,680
Nothing,

6
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,920
just putting some stuff away.

7
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,960
Tell him I'll be down in a bit.

8
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
Okay.

9
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,720
Normally, we’d go out

10
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,120
to buy things for him.

11
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,600
That’s when he’d be home by himself.

12
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,920
Mr. Tham and I came to see him,

13
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,640
but no one was around,

14
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,440
so we went upstairs to see him.

15
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,000
We called as soon as we found him.

16
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,240
So that means

17
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,120
no one saw anyone entering or leaving?

18
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,279
That footprint…

19
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,800
Looks like a woman's high heel.

20
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,280
Could the culprit be a woman?

21
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,840
You got close to the body too, didn’t you?

22
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,920
I panicked, I didn’t know what to do,

23
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,640
so I was going to get closer.

24
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,760
She didn't touch him at all.

25
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,200
Don't worry,

26
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,760
we'll gather all the evidence

27
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,360
and examine the clues carefully.

28
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,640
Looks like you’re fond of cactuses.

29
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,080
Well, they're pretty, Dad.

30
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,960
They say we’re drawn to

31
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,400
things that resemble us.

32
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
Are you saying I'm like a cactus?

33
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,760
In a way, you are.

34
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,440
My daughter is strong,

35
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,760
with a few prickles.

36
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,920
You don’t let anyone hurt you easily,

37
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,760
even if you don’t always show it.

38
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,920
Dad, are you calling me
passive-aggressive?

39
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
So, you do know yourself well.

40
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,520
I should've gone to see him sooner,

41
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,400
to apologize sooner.

42
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,360
I can confirm,

43
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,960
he wasn't mad at you anymore.

44
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,920
He understood everything.

45
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,320
He was even helping us
deal with Taweerath.

46
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,760
But then this happened.

47
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,280
You have to stay strong.

48
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,800
What are you doing?

49
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,960
Checking my schedule. What's up?

50
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,480
How's Miss Pat holding up?

51
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,640
Since the funeral,

52
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,240
Mr. Tham's been taking care of her.

53
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,159
I never thought something like this
would happen to Mr. Kobsak.

54
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,960
You need to be careful too.

55
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,400
With Mr. Kobsak's case,

56
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,280
who knows if it was really a robbery.

57
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,040
That's what the police thought.

58
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,480
The footprint Miss Pat was suspicious of

59
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,720
seemed to be her own.

60
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,960
I'm no optimist.

61
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,040
People are cruel.

62
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,800
Who knows what they're scheming.

63
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,560
Even I

64
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,800
almost ended up in jail several times,

65
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
but luckily Mr. Tham saved me.

66
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,920
I don't care much about my future,

67
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,880
but I’d never want to ruin yours.

68
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,560
You're my only sister.

69
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,000
If something happened to you,

70
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,640
I'd never forgive myself.

71
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,920
Aw, Chat.

72
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,240
Oh,

73
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,560
and here’s your dessert.

74
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,920
You bought it for me?

75
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,560
Thanks.

76
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,600
No,

77
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,080
but the one who did is waiting downstairs.

78
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,040
Pu, hey.

79
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,160
Can we talk?

80
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,080
I have nothing to say to you, Jane.

81
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
Or should I say, Mr. Janepob?

82
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,640
Can't you forgive me just once?

83
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,440
But you've done nothing wrong.

84
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,360
I’m the one who’s been a fool.

85
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,520
I couldn't tell who you really were.

86
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,480
Can we drop the sarcasm?

87
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,680
All that time,

88
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
even though I didn't tell you who I was,

89
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,240
I was always sincere with you.

90
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
- Let go.
- No.

91
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,920
Just a sec.

92
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Mom?

93
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,360
I'm at…

94
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,920
I'm at the office. I'll call you back.

95
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,680
Mr. Kobsak left a short will
a long time ago.

96
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,880
Everything goes to Miss Pat.

97
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,600
His assets

98
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,160
include the money in his bank account

99
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,360
and the car he always drove.

100
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,920
What about the house and the land?

101
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,560
He sold those a long time ago.

102
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,400
That's impossible.

103
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,200
There's no way
he sold the house and all his land.

104
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,840
No one knew, Pat.

105
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,800
Why are you here?

106
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,440
To see my house of course.

107
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,960
Your house?

108
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,360
Pat,

109
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,240
it seems you didn’t know

110
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,560
that Mr. Kobsak

111
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,760
already sold this house

112
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,800
and much of his land to Rath.

113
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,840
I saw the funeral went smoothly,

114
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,280
so I came to plan
what I’ll do with this place.

115
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,200
Should we renovate it?

116
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,000
Then sell it to foreigners?

117
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,840
We’d make a nice profit,

118
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
and they wouldn't mind that

119
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,760
someone died here.

120
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,600
Get out.

121
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,720
Miss Pat, calm down.

122
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,000
I said get out.

123
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,920
Get out! Get out!

124
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,960
- Get out! Get out!
- Miss Pat, calm down.

125
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Pat,

126
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,360
you have no right
to tell the owner to leave.

127
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,280
He'd never sell the house,

128
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,560
especially to someone like you.

129
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,080
I figured you wouldn’t believe me.

130
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,040
Check for yourself.

131
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,280
He signed off on it.

132
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,200
If possible,

133
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,480
I’d like the house ready

134
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,440
within the week.

135
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,960
Let's go.

136
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,680
We should give her time

137
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,760
to cope with her unexpected loss.

138
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
I don't want

139
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,160
to stay here too long either.

140
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,680
Let's go.

141
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,000
That footprint…

142
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,960
Looks like a woman's high heel.

143
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,840
Was it you?

144
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,960
Was it you?

145
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,240
- Pat!
- Pat!

146
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,640
Was it you?

147
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,560
- Pat!
- Did you kill my father?

148
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,360
Did you kill my father?

149
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,280
What are you talking about?

150
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,200
What did he do to you?

151
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,600
Why did you have to do it?

152
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,480
- Why did you do it?
- Miss Pat, what's this about?

153
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,400
It's your high heels.

154
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,320
The high heel print,

155
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,240
it was yours, wasn’t it?
You killed my father, didn’t you, Dao?

156
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,040
What are you saying?
Do you know what you’re accusing me of?

157
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,000
Pat, I know you're really upset
about your father,

158
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,720
but you can’t just
accuse people like this.

159
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,920
I told the police everything.

160
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,280
Soon,

161
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,160
they'll prove it was your high-heel marks.

162
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,640
You killed my father!

163
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,840
Miss Pat,

164
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,760
the detective
in charge of Mr. Kobsak's case called.

165
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,640
Yes?

166
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,360
Excuse me?

167
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,120
You found the culprit?

168
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,560
Did you hear that, Pat?

169
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,960
Next time, you should collect yourself

170
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,160
before you accuse someone without proof.

171
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,600
Murder is a serious crime, Pat.

172
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,240
Here’s the suspect we arrested.

173
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,640
As for the gun he used,

174
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,240
he said he threw it in the river.

175
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,440
But the print I saw,

176
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,880
it was a high heel shoe.
Maybe the culprit's not--

177
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,800
Maybe you got confused

178
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,400
and mistook your own footprint
for someone else's.

179
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,040
I remember where I walked,

180
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,480
and the print wasn't mine.

181
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,920
Miss Pat.

182
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,760
We're still investigating
and gathering evidence.

183
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,280
As for the investigation,

184
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,880
please leave it to us.

185
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,560
Once we we reach a clear conclusion,

186
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,599
I'll update you right away.

187
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,240
Miss Pat, are you okay?

188
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,480
We should wait until everything’s clear

189
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,160
and leave this to them.

190
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,800
Why are you so stressed?

191
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,200
The police arrested the real culprit.

192
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,840
There's no need to worry.

193
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,040
The real culprit?

194
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,400
You know what really happened.

195
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,200
Don't be that way, Dao.

196
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,920
Keep your voice down.

197
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,000
We shouldn’t argue here.

198
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,280
If someone hears us,

199
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,920
what would they think,

200
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,120
especially Ava?

201
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,120
Hey, Dao. Wait.

202
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,560
Why are you so stressed?

203
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,120
You should be glad

204
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,160
you got your revenge
on one of the people who hurt you.

205
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,480
Glad?

206
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,720
Someone died.

207
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,360
How could I not feel anything?

208
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,680
I'm not cold-blooded like you.

209
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
You're my blood,
but I can cut you off too.

210
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,120
I hope you can stop holding a grudge
against my daughter now.

211
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,880
A grudge?

212
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,760
More like bad Karma

213
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,520
for what you and your daughter did to me.

214
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,280
And it's about time

215
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,280
you paid for it.

216
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,280
You should pay for what you did to me too.

217
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,800
You helped Tham hurt me.

218
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,120
Do you know

219
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,200
how much money I lost?

220
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,440
I want you to pay damages
by selling me this house

221
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
and the rest of your land.

222
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,640
You're nothing but a thief.

223
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,680
You want me to sign the sale

224
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,400
without paying a single baht?

225
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,480
If you don't sign it,

226
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,280
I might get even madder

227
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,960
and take it out on Pat.

228
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
You thug!

229
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,800
Quit messing with her already.

230
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,400
Leave her alone!

231
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,880
Do you get it now?

232
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,360
How it felt to be threatened
by your power?

233
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,440
How resentful it makes you feel?

234
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,720
Just sign it as Rath told you

235
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,560
so we can get this over with.

236
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,920
Are you happy now?

237
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,160
Hey,

238
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,640
do whatever you want to me.

239
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
But you must keep your promise

240
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
that you won't mess with Pat again!

241
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
I can't promise

242
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,280
because your daughter

243
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,840
still has to pay
for what she did to me too.

244
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,680
But Pat had nothing to do with it.

245
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,840
It was just an accident!

246
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,040
She never knew about your pregnancy
or your miscarriage.

247
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,520
And when you got removed from
the leading lady role and Pat took it,

248
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,480
it was his doing!

249
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,520
The leading actress got injured?

250
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,400
Will it be months
before you can shoot again?

251
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,640
As your main sponsor,

252
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,840
I can't wait that long.

253
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,280
Also,

254
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,600
you've only shot a few scenes.

255
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,720
Find a new actress.

256
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,360
Whoever's ready, give her the role.

257
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,160
But if you want to wait,

258
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,040
I'll withdraw my sponsorship.

259
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,600
He's talking nonsense.

260
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,080
When people are scared to die,
they'll say anything.

261
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,400
Nonsense?

262
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,080
I may have been wrong

263
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
to insult you

264
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,800
and exploit your weakness
to give my daughter the role.

265
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,480
But it wasn't just me

266
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,960
who ruined your future back then.

267
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,360
He did too!

268
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,000
Think this through, Ingdao.

269
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,680
Don't make the same mistake

270
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,000
my daughter did.

271
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,040
Pat made a mistake before

272
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,400
because of this damn guy.

273
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,680
It was him!

274
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,760
Rath!

275
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,720
Why did you do that?

276
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,440
To finish it of course.

277
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,320
Dao,

278
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,240
you held a grudge for a long time, right?

279
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,400
It's time you were compensated
for what you lost.

280
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,400
I'll let you finish him.

281
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,680
No.

282
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,320
I can't do it.

283
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,400
I can't.

284
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,880
Mr. Rath,

285
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,360
we’ve been here too long.

286
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,640
The staff will be back soon.

287
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,600
Clean up.

288
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
- Deal with the cameras too.
- Got it.

289
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,440
Let's go.

290
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,320
Dao,

291
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,360
I know you're worried,

292
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,160
but you shouldn't be.

293
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,280
I cleaned up everything already.

294
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
No one can mess with us.

295
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,880
Us?

296
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,480
Everything was your doing.

297
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,440
You killed Mr. Kobsak,

298
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,320
not me.

299
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,840
Was it all me, Dao?

300
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,920
That day, the ones who held the gun

301
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,560
were me

302
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,720
and you too.

303
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,360
Even if you didn't pull the trigger,

304
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,360
you're still considered

305
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,120
an accomplice.

306
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,120
Now we are both

307
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,760
in the same boat.

308
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,880
Don't be scared.

309
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,440
From now on,

310
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,320
nothing can tear us apart.

311
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,480
I love you no matter what.

312
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,880
Everything I did,

313
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,760
I did it for us.

314
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,120
No.

315
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,360
I didn't mean to.

316
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,480
I didn't mean for this to happen.

317
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,000
No.

318
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,600
Why isn't Mr. Mawin here yet?

319
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,880
Mawin? He's not coming.

320
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,200
You told Mr. Mawin to lie to me?

321
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,080
Pu, hey.

322
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,520
Pu.

323
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,080
If I didn't do this,

324
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,400
you wouldn't see me.

325
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,880
We have nothing to do with each other now.

326
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,400
Slap me again.

327
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,200
Nothing can hurt more
than you avoiding me.

328
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Seriously,

329
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
all this time,

330
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,320
did it mean nothing between us?

331
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,080
But

332
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,560
your mother…

333
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,040
I don't care about anything

334
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,840
or anyone.

335
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,680
Even if I have to fight the entire world

336
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,440
for you,

337
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,960
I will.

338
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,520
You invited her to your cafe to treat her.

339
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,680
- Talk about cheap.
- Bro.

340
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,400
Be quiet.

341
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,000
My Cafe, J Cup,

342
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,760
will start serving lunch items,

343
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,400
so I invited you two to try them.

344
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,120
Just kidding.

345
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,160
I've been meaning to treat you to dinner
to apologize about my mother.

346
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,600
I'm not angry with Mrs. Piangkae.
I understand.

347
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,160
Hearing that from you,

348
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,200
I'm so relieved.

349
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
Too bad that today

350
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,840
Pu's busy, so she couldn't come.

351
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,800
So that means

352
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,240
you guys made up?

353
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,560
What did you do to make up with her?

354
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Bro,

355
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,280
I have my ways.

356
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,480
But whether we're totally good now,

357
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,880
I'm not quite sure.

358
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,040
If you're sincere with her,

359
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,800
she'll understand you.

360
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,320
You said she's busy.

361
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Doing what?

362
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,560
She said she had a new drama shoot
with the director,

363
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,800
so she couldn't come.

364
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,360
- A shoot?
- Yes.

365
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,080
This late?

366
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,000
The director said here?

367
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,800
Why would I lie to you?

368
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,840
They'll be here soon.

369
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,160
It's just us actors here.

370
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,480
Then I'll wait outside.

371
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,160
What are you doing?

372
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,920
If you go,

373
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,120
I'll post it on Instagram.
They'll write news about us.

374
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,160
- Hey.
- Don't think too much.

375
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,440
Think of it as hanging out before work.

376
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,720
Why don't you sit?

377
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,200
I'll get you a drink.

378
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,240
Don't worry,
this time I won't force you to drink.

379
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,240
Did you urge Captain to do this?

380
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,360
Yeah.

381
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,360
Last time it was a miss.

382
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,120
This time I'm setting them up again.

383
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,800
He'll get her for sure.

384
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,440
Oh, where is it?

385
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,600
The new stuff I asked you to find.

386
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,920
It's in here.

387
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,440
Something sweet, no alcohol.

388
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,520
Thanks.

389
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,400
Did you get to know them yet? Let's go.

390
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,000
CHAT

391
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,800
She sent her location but won't pick up.

392
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,280
Did something bad happen to Pu?

393
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,320
Ava,

394
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,320
everyone else left.

395
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,840
We'll miss the best part
with Captain and Pu.

396
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,199
Just a sec.

397
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,639
Aunt Dao.

398
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Aunt Dao!

399
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,520
What kind of friend are you?

400
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,880
How can you let your friend do this?

401
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,960
But Ava's the one who asked me
to find the stuff for her.

402
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,920
Next time, you can keep it
and ruin your own future.

403
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,880
Don't give it to someone else, got it?

404
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,120
- Yes.
- Let's go.

405
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,920
Aunt Dao! Aunt Dao!

406
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,160
You can't contact Pu either?

407
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,800
No.

408
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,120
She sent me her location,

409
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,240
but I can't reach her.

410
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,920
<i>I'm here now, Miss Pat.</i>

411
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,440
Please hurry over.

412
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,320
Okay.

413
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,400
Let's go find Chat and Pu.

414
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,640
I'm having a bad feeling.

415
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,160
- Come on, Ava.
- Aunt Dao!

416
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,960
Where are you taking me?

417
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,160
- Away from here.
- No, I'm not going.

418
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,600
I don't want to go home.

419
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,680
Ava. Ava!

420
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,760
Ava. Ava!

421
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,080
Stop!

422
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,240
Come home with me now.

423
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,080
You said you wanted to be a star,
to play in a drama,

424
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,560
but this is how you behave?

425
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,960
You built your reputation

426
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,000
just to throw it away
because you like fun?

427
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,960
It's my happiness.

428
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,200
Why do you care?

429
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,840
If word gets out,

430
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,040
your life is ruined.

431
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,000
Do you know how serious it is?

432
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
What I did

433
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,040
is nothing compared to what you did!

434
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,000
What I'm doing

435
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,880
is just to find myself
a little bit of happiness,

436
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,880
but you killed someone!

437
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,680
What are you on about?

438
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,800
You and Rath

439
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,560
killed Mr. Kobsak.

440
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,320
Where's the book?

441
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,760
Blood.

442
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,800
Why is Aunt Dao

443
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,120
keeping bloody pants?

444
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,680
Dao, wait. Dao.

445
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,000
Aren't you a little too stressed?

446
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,920
You should be glad

447
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,400
you got your revenge on one of the people

448
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,720
who hurt you.

449
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,360
Glad? Someone died.

450
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,000
How could I not feel anything?

451
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,160
I'm not cold-blooded like you.

452
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,440
There's no need to worry.

453
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,240
I cleaned up everything already.

454
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,560
No one can mess with us.

455
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,400
Us? Everything was your doing.

456
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,440
You killed Mr. Kobsak, not me.

457
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,680
Was it all me, Dao?

458
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,360
Even if you didn't pull the trigger,

459
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,360
you're still considered

460
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,280
an accomplice.

461
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,440
Why did you kill him?

462
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,960
Why did you have to do it? Why?

463
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,320
Why, Aunt Dao, why?

464
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,920
Ava, Ava.

465
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,480
- Why, Aunt Dao, why?
- Ava, Ava.

466
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,600
<i>You filmed Ava and I talking, right?</i>

467
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,040
<i>Give me your phone.</i>

468
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,800
No way.

469
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,720
<i>I told you to give it, now!</i>

470
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,600
<i>What are you trying to do, Pu?</i>

471
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,560
<i>Smart people must learn to create</i>

472
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,800
<i>their own opportunities.</i>

473
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,320
<i>You can have it back now.</i>

474
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,600
<i>You were so eager to get it, right?</i>

475
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,200
Bend down and pick it up yourself.

476
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,960
<i>You don't have to take care of me.</i>

477
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,560
<i>I can take care of myself.</i>

478
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,080
<i>But I just</i>

479
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,560
<i>want to take care of you</i>
<i>better than you can yourself.</i>

480
