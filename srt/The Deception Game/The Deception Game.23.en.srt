1
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,600
And that's what happened, officer.

2
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,520
Miss Pat!

3
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Miss Pat!

4
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,560
Why didn't you tell me anything?

5
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,800
The police called,

6
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,080
and I was so worried about you.

7
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm sorry I made you worry.

8
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,160
Pu, Pu!

9
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,080
Are you hurt?

10
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm fine.

11
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,880
How typical of you,

12
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
acting tough as always.

13
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,640
So, as you stated,

14
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,680
the gun belongs to Mr. Taweerath,

15
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,920
but Miss Patchanin fired it, correct?

16
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,840
Yes.

17
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
But it was an accident.

18
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,120
None of us three had a weapon,

19
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,680
so Pat took the gun from Mr. Rath

20
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,320
before he could shoot us.

21
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,840
I was just defending myself.

22
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,760
That's right.

23
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,760
If she hadn't,

24
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,920
Mr. Rath would have killed

25
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,080
all three of us.

26
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,520
Alright. But I'll still
need the three of you

27
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,640
to come to the station
for further questioning.

28
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
Sure.

29
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,720
I asked the police for the recording,

30
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,520
Mr. Kobsak's recording from that day

31
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,600
before it all happened.

32
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,720
Ready to hear it?

33
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
Yes.

34
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,320
<i>You're my blood,</i>
<i>but I can cut you off too!</i>

35
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,240
<i>Don't try to reach me again.</i>

36
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,880
<i>Are you happy now?</i>

37
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,840
I hope you can stop
holding a grudge against my daughter now.

38
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,480
You should pay for what you did to me too.

39
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
You helped Tham hurt me.

40
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,280
Do you know

41
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,440
how much money I lost?

42
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,840
<i>I want you to pay damages</i>
<i>by selling me this house</i>

43
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,280
<i>and the rest of your land.</i>

44
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,720
<i>You're nothing but a thief!</i>

45
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
<i>You want me to sign the sale</i>

46
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,960
<i>without paying a single baht?</i>

47
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,200
<i>If you don't sign it,</i>
<i>I might get even madder</i>

48
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,880
<i>and take it out on Pat.</i>

49
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,520
<i>You thug!</i>

50
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,360
<i>Quit messing with her already.</i>

51
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,000
<i>Leave her alone!</i>

52
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,680
Mr. Rath, we've been here too long.

53
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,920
The staff will be back here soon.

54
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,480
<i>Clean up. Deal with the cameras too.</i>

55
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,360
<i>Got it.</i>

56
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,960
And that's

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
the recording where

58
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,440
the police said parts were removed,

59
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,120
but it's enough to prove

60
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,320
Taweerath killed your father.

61
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,560
It's because of me

62
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,080
that he died like this.

63
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,760
No. That man is pure evil.

64
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,480
None of this is your fault.

65
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,440
The guy in jail already confessed

66
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,080
to being Rath's fall guy.

67
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,000
This will be huge news.

68
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
But don't worry.

69
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,040
I'll help you handle the reporters.

70
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,560
I…

71
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,640
didn't know anything
about his illegal activities.

72
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,280
But I still hope Mr. Rath

73
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,080
will turn himself in and fight the case.

74
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,480
Because I'll always worry about him.

75
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
We're husband and wife, after all.

76
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
There's news that a celebrity is involved
with Mr. Taweerath in running a casino.

77
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,520
Do you know who they're talking about?

78
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,360
What's the matter?
Are you worried for Dao?

79
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,080
I'm stressed for myself.

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,080
Why, though?

81
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,760
Hey, don't tell me

82
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
you're the celebrity
they're talking about.

83
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,280
Are you crazy?

84
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,240
I don't know anything about it.

85
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,960
Quit talking nonsense.

86
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,000
You look so guilty. Maybe it's you.

87
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
<i>But I still hope Mr. Rath</i>

88
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,320
<i>will turn himself in and fight the case.</i>

89
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
<i>Because I'll always worry about him.</i>

90
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,600
<i>We're husband and wife, after all.</i>

91
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,640
I meant none of it.

92
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,680
If you died and no one found your body,

93
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,120
I'd be so glad.

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
Why did you ask me to come here?

95
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,159
Did you hear anything about Rath?

96
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
It's not about him.

97
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,320
If it were, the only thing
I'd want to hear

98
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
is that his body has been found.

99
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,040
Then what is it?

100
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,320
I wanted to talk to you about this house.

101
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,760
I registered my marriage with Rath,

102
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,920
so technically,

103
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
part of this house is mine.

104
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,080
If he were dead,

105
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,360
it would belong to me alone.

106
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,000
But if he's alive,

107
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,480
I'll sue for divorce

108
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,800
since he did so many bad things.

109
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,080
With all his crimes,

110
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,280
he'd get no less than a year in prison.

111
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,400
Or maybe

112
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,680
even life.

113
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
Either way,

114
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,960
this house will end up mine.

115
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,040
So you want this house?

116
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,080
I used to.

117
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,360
But I have my own house now.

118
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,520
So I want to give this house back to you.

119
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,560
Legally,

120
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,280
I can't transfer it to you just yet,

121
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,080
but I want to do it now.

122
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,920
I'll take Ava back to my place.

123
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,920
Give me a couple of days to pack,

124
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,080
and I'll move out.

125
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,960
Then you can move back in.

126
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,640
Thank you, Dao,

127
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,160
for giving it back.

128
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,640
There's something
I need you to answer honestly.

129
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,920
What is it?

130
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,880
About Chat's death.

131
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,160
Can you tell me

132
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,600
what happened that night?

133
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,480
I get it

134
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,600
that you and Pu suspect me and Ava.

135
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,560
But I assure you,

136
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,240
we really don't know anything.

137
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,520
As for Chat's phone,

138
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,200
Ava just found it.

139
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,680
She didn't know whose phone it was.

140
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,000
But when I realized
it belonged to Chat, Pu's brother,

141
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,040
I was scared people would misunderstand,

142
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,760
and I worried about Ava's reputation.

143
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,840
So, I did something stupid.

144
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,200
I thought that would end it.

145
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,640
But eventually,

146
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,200
Rath framed Ava,

147
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,000
fabricating evidence

148
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,320
to frame her.

149
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
I bet you know

150
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,920
he's capable of doing anything

151
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,720
to force me to get what he wants.

152
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,520
What should I tell Pu?

153
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Dao insists she and Ava

154
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,760
weren't involved in Chat's death.

155
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,440
But I really saw Ava there.

156
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
I wasn't imagining it.

157
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,240
I believe you.

158
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,600
Even if Dao's changed enough

159
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,640
to give me back my house,

160
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,760
I don't completely trust her.

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,320
But we don't have any evidence
left to prove anything.

162
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,200
I don't know what to do next.

163
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,360
I'm just worried about how Pu will feel.

164
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,560
In the end,

165
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
there's no justice for Chat.

166
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,920
We really tried our best.

167
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,560
I'm sure Pu will understand.

168
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,320
When I move back into my house,

169
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,440
can you come with me?

170
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,360
How could I let you go alone?

171
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,720
Besides, you're probably not used to
living in a big house by yourself.

172
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,640
I should stay the night with you,
like I did here,

173
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
so you won't feel lonely, shouldn't I?

174
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Finally,

175
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,160
you got your house back.

176
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,560
This house

177
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,120
is where I used to dream

178
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,160
of living with my family

179
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,160
and my loved ones.

180
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,800
But now it holds the worst memories.

181
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,320
Still, I'm glad I got it back.

182
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,680
All the bad things are in the past now.

183
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,400
Whatever makes you happy,

184
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,040
feel free to do it now.

185
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,520
There's something I've been wanting to do,

186
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,400
and I planned to do it

187
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,640
as soon as

188
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,960
I got my house back.

189
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,400
What's that?

190
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,240
Are you sure you won't regret it?

191
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,160
Not a chance.

192
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,680
I learned from you that

193
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,680
if you hold on to the past
and don't let it go,

194
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
you'll never start a new life.

195
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,040
From now on, in my memories,

196
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,560
there won't be a guy
named Taweerath anymore.

197
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,280
As for his stuff in the house,

198
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,160
I'll donate it all.

199
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,320
I hope the merit I make from it

200
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,280
will help the police find him

201
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,440
and arrest him
so he can finally serve his time.

202
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,360
<i>For our recap today,</i>
<i>starting with the first news,</i>

203
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,040
<i>the police have issued an arrest warrant</i>
<i>for Taweerath, a real estate businessman</i>

204
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,520
<i>and husband of a famous actress,</i>

205
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,000
<i>who has yet to be found.</i>

206
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,240
<i>Police speculated</i>
<i>they will locate him for arrest soon.</i>

207
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,320
Hey!

208
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,160
What the hell?

209
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,360
My store's all messy now.

210
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,119
Pick it up!

211
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,119
What are you looking at?

212
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,240
Hey, hey, hey.

213
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,319
Don't, don't.

214
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,880
The trash is wet and reeks.

215
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,920
If you use the broom and dustpan,

216
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
I'll have to throw them away.

217
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,920
Then how am I supposed to clean it?

218
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,960
Use your hands!

219
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,160
My hands?!

220
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
Yeah, of course.

221
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,840
What's wrong with them?

222
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,120
Pick it up, quick!

223
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,280
Quickly!

224
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,080
Can't you do it faster?
Quit whining already.

225
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,600
Damn it!

226
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,760
Remember,

227
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,120
do as I say no matter what.

228
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,760
Don't you forget that

229
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,760
If I hadn't saved your life,

230
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,920
you'd be a ghost in the river by now.

231
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,520
Is he dead?

232
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,680
He's alive!

233
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,000
Quit stalling and do it,

234
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,760
or I'll get angry again!

235
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,600
I can't believe the day has finally come.

236
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,200
Patchanin and Ingdao,

237
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,320
walking into the station together.

238
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,880
What a sight!

239
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,880
After all, Pat and Dao
are birds of a feather.

240
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,040
Till now, I haven't heard
any news about Mr. Rath.

241
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,160
- I can't help but worry about you two.
- Hey!

242
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,080
What are you talking about, Rati?

243
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,120
I'm saying this out of concern.

244
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,760
I don't think
you should worry about us, Rati.

245
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,640
You two should worry about yourselves.

246
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,640
I heard one of you

247
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,480
might be getting called in by the police

248
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,000
for running a gambling site and casino.

249
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,120
While the other
probably hasn't figured out yet

250
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,360
that her best friend scammed her
into investing in a show.

251
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,760
I've had it happen to me before too.

252
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,920
That sounds really exclusive,

253
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,760
Pat, Dao.

254
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,520
Who could it be? I can't even guess.

255
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,280
Jarinya! You scammed me?

256
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,120
We've got nothing to do with this.

257
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,520
- You two figure it out. I have to go.
- Bye.

258
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,960
Jarinya, I'm going to talk to accounting

259
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,800
to see if you really scammed me!

260
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,440
Rati, I didn't scam you!

261
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,320
Rati! Don't believe what people say!

262
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,200
I'll recommend both of you
to the higher-ups

263
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,080
to be nominated
for the Queen Of Ratings this year.

264
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,960
You shouldn't, Som.

265
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,520
I don't want to be nominated
for any award.

266
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,520
Plus, there's so much
controversy about me.

267
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,920
I'm not fit for it.

268
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,160
And I told you I'd back out too, Som.

269
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,640
Come on, both of you.

270
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,360
Our drama got so many views
and a great rating.

271
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,720
It would be such a shame
not to nominate anyone.

272
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,280
Then you might want to recommend Pat only.

273
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
Please, Pat. Don't back out.

274
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,880
Please?

275
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,160
Fine, then. I won't back out.

276
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,480
But you have to recommend both our names,

277
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,800
to prove both our abilities at once.

278
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,760
Alright, then. Let this award

279
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,280
be a way to fairly judge our abilities.

280
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,960
We're here to talk about work today.

281
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,440
So, you'll work together on another show?

282
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,680
We'll have to see about that.

283
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,080
Anything new on your husband's case, Dao?

284
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,960
How has Pat been cheering you up
as your close friend?

285
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,880
About that,

286
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,640
my answer stays the same.

287
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,320
<i>I want him to turn himself in,</i>

288
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,960
<i>admit his guilt,</i>

289
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,440
<i>and take responsibility for what he did.</i>

290
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,480
Bullshit!

291
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,600
Give me my phone!

292
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,240
- You dare destroy my store?
- Give it!

293
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,520
- Let's go!
- So,

294
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,040
you want a piece of me?

295
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,000
Don't, don't, don't!

296
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,920
I… I give up!

297
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,600
Do you know

298
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,680
how I got rich?

299
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,520
You… You're rich?

300
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,680
Yeah! Super rich.

301
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
So rich you can't even imagine.

302
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,000
In fact,

303
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,440
I shouldn't have ended up like this.

304
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,440
But because of those two…

305
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,160
They probably don't know

306
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,480
I've got another card up my sleeve.

307
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,600
Just wait till I get better.

308
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,640
If you want to get rich,

309
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,440
do as I say.

310
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,000
Sure.

311
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,920
Wow, you both look so pretty today.

312
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,600
How do you feel about
being nominated in the final round?

313
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,040
I'm really happy we both got nominated.

314
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,280
I'm so excited too.

315
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,160
Actually, no matter who wins today,

316
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,760
I'll be happy for both of us.

317
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,920
Ava,

318
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,200
why are your hands so sweaty?

319
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,600
I haven't met many people in so long.

320
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,160
It's making me feel a bit weird.

321
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,720
What's the matter?

322
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,040
Ava and I have to go up
and give flowers together,

323
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,880
so I thought we could practice.

324
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,040
It's about to start.

325
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,280
You two go talk.

326
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,000
We came too.
Why don't we get to go up on stage?

327
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,160
You really need to ask?

328
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,360
Must be her aunt's connections.

329
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,160
No one would care about her
if it weren't for her aunt's help.

330
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,320
You're acting like Ava's not your friend.

331
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,840
What's wrong?

332
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,440
Nothing.

333
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,240
And now for tonight's big award.

334
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,120
In honor of the award,

335
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,720
I'd like to invite

336
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,000
a representative from the board
of JC Investment Thailand,

337
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Mr. Janepob Katavee,

338
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,120
to announce the winner

339
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,400
of the award today.

340
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,240
First, I'd like to congratulate the winner

341
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,160
of this year's
Best Actress in a Leading Role.

342
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,600
And the T-Star Award
for Best Actress in a Leading Role

343
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,000
this year…

344
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
goes to…

345
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,600
Mrs. Ingdao Kantrakarn!

346
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Congratulations!

347
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,800
Congrats, Dao.

348
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,760
Thanks, Pat.

349
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,920
I'd like to congratulate
Mrs. Ingdao again.

350
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,560
Let's take a look at

351
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,080
her impressive work one more time.

352
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,800
<i>You filmed Ava and me talking, didn't you?</i>

353
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,360
<i>Give me your phone!</i>

354
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,960
<i>No way. It's important evidence</i>

355
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,800
<i>proving that you and Taweerath</i>

356
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,200
<i>killed Miss Pat's father.</i>

357
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
<i>I told you to give it!</i>

358
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,280
<i>Give it to me.</i>

359
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
<i>I told you to give it!</i>

360
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,440
You!

361
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,120
You really did kill Chat!

362
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,920
- Someone call the police!
- No!

363
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,440
- Call the police!
- No, no!

364
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,360
- Pu!
- Leave her alone!

365
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,960
Let's go, Ava.

366
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,520
Are you okay?

367
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,120
What's going on, Pat?

368
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Luktan.

369
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,440
I never thought
you'd turn out to be a murderer, Ava.

370
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,800
Move.

371
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,600
Aren't you curious

372
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,160
where the video came from?

373
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,000
You did this?

374
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,560
You were there that night?

375
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,160
Not me, Mrs. Dao.

376
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,760
Someone sent it to me.

377
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,640
He was there too, but nobody knew.

378
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,360
You came to pick me up--

379
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,760
Go back to your friends.

380
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,880
- But--
- Come on.

381
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,560
Just go. I'll meet you there.

382
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,400
Okay.

383
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,040
Mr. Rath.

384
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,040
The police are coming for you, Ava.

385
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,360
No!

386
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,160
No, I'm not going!

387
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,760
I didn't do anything wrong!

388
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,120
You backstabbing friend!
Why did you do this to me?

389
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,040
- Ava!
- Huh?!

390
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,560
Ava, that's enough. Come with me!

391
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,400
Luktan!

392
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,400
Blood! There's blood!

393
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,920
Here, Luktan. Let's go.

394
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,520
Ava did this to me.

395
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,520
Mrs. Dao ran away with her.

396
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,400
Please take me to a hospital.

397
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,640
I'm scared, I'm scared.

398
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,760
Don't be.

399
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,760
Aunt Dao,

400
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,040
I need to take Uncle Rath's pills. Please.

401
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,880
You said you'd quit!

402
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,200
I can't!

403
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,120
I can't control myself
if I don't take them.

404
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,840
Please.

405
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,160
No. I won't let you!

406
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,520
Come pack up with me.

407
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,440
Let's go.

408
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,440
Aunt Dao!

409
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,120
You said you missed me

410
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,080
and wanted me to come back, right?

411
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,840
Aunt Dao!

412
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,160
Don't hurt her!

413
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,160
Come here!

414
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,840
Aunt Dao!

415
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,440
Don't worry about your niece,

416
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,080
worry about yourself!

417
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,960
Please don't hurt Ava.

418
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,720
Aunt Dao…

419
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,400
You watch her.

420
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,920
If she tries to run, shoot her.

421
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,160
What do you want me to do?

422
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,440
If you want your niece to live,

423
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,960
do as I say.

424
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm taking back what's mine.

425
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,800
Let's go!

426
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,320
- Ava!
- Aunt Dao!

427
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,800
- Ava!
- Aunt Dao!

428
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,720
Ava!

429
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,120
You can leave me here.

430
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,200
I'll ask the police
about Mrs. Dao and Ava.

431
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,640
You can wait for the news at home.

432
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,680
Okay.

433
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,840
Will you be okay alone?

434
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,640
I told you to find someone
to stay with you, but you won't.

435
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,840
Well, I got used to living alone
at the other house.

436
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,040
And you'd always stay with me anyway.

437
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,000
I'll be back with you soon.

438
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,480
Call me if something comes up.

439
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,160
Okay.

440
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,280
I'll go now.

441
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,760
Dao!

442
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,280
Rath!

443
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,560
We're all together now.

444
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,639
Let's not get anyone else in the way, Pat.

445
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,400
No one can help you two now.

446
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,360
If something happens to Ava,

447
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,840
I'll make sure you pay!

448
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,159
We've already come this far.

449
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,600
What else can you possibly do?

450
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,280
What are you trying to do?
Why are you doing this to us?

451
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,600
I just want to take back what's mine.

452
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,120
Nothing here is yours.

453
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,679
Nothing was ever yours in the first place.

454
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,000
Why not?!

455
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,880
I built everything myself,

456
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,400
but you ruined it all!

457
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,440
You've got so many criminal charges.

458
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,000
You think you'll run free?

459
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,160
It would be best

460
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,040
if you turned yourself in.

461
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,520
You might serve less time.

462
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,440
A guy like me would never go to jail.

463
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,200
Since we were once husband and wife,

464
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,760
I'll give you a chance, Pat.

465
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,200
I need cash

466
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,640
and all your valuables

467
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,760
so I can hide away for a while.

468
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,840
Dao.

469
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,320
Help me out, would you?

470
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,320
Pat,

471
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,120
hurry and do as he says.

472
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,240
BOONYAVEJ HOSPITAL

473
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,240
Excuse me, she's my friend.
I can take her from you.

474
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

475
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,240
I called and asked the staff at the event.

476
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,320
They said you had them
play the video with Ava in it.

477
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,600
I asked you about Chat.

478
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,480
You said you knew nothing.
So how did you find the video?

479
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,200
Tell the truth, Luktan.

480
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Don't let it go so far

481
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,800
that you get charged
for lying about that night

482
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,920
or even being an accomplice.

483
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,840
I have nothing to do with it.

484
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,840
I didn't see anything that day.

485
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,080
And the video's not mine.

486
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,040
So how did you find it?

487
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,520
If I tell you,
you have to leave me out of it.

488
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,400
Put everything in the bag.

489
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,360
How long

490
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,680
do you think you'll last by doing this?

491
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,320
Don't worry about me.

492
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,800
I know how to run away

493
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,160
without the police finding me.

494
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,480
You can leave now.

495
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,360
Go!

496
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,880
Stay calm, Dao.

497
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,720
You got your stuff.

498
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,600
Why don't you leave?

499
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,800
Come here.

500
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,080
It wouldn't be like me

501
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,880
to leave so easily.

502
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,520
What else do you want?

503
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,280
Go.

504
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,400
I want to see a headline…

505
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,320
"Girl Kills Best Friend" before I go.

506
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,240
Go ahead and kill Pat
if you don't want Ava to get hurt.

507
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,160
Why do you have to drag her into this?

508
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
Come here!

509
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,600
You got a death wish?!

510
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,600
Something's going on.

511
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,520
