1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,800
Then the final score

2
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,440
will have to be decided by Mr. Tham.

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,360
I choose Chompunuch.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,160
About Pu, I thought you would help Dao.

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,640
I just picked the one
with the best performance.

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,440
Those who trample on others

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,600
and steal their opportunities,

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,120
I hate them the most.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,680
I want to go see your father.

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,880
What else do you want him
to help you with?

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,720
Then try to test the waters
with your husband's rival first,

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,560
and I will arrange for him
to come and speak with you.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,520
You…

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,920
Yes, it's me.

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,640
It's you who is after Rath's land.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,040
I was thinking of buying that land
in my own name,

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,000
so I had my people
handle this matter for me.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,200
This kind of thing
doesn't have to be on the front page.

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,280
Go ahead.

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm looking forward to hearing your offer.

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm curious to see

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,320
if it's interesting enough
for me not to buy that land.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,800
Why are you quiet?

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,480
Or are you thinking of the lines
your husband wrote for you?

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,480
You…

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,520
Am I wrong?

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,760
You're talking business
on behalf of your husband.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,720
If he doesn't tell you what to say or do,

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,760
you probably couldn't do it on your own.

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,320
Thank you for looking down on me.

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,840
I shouldn't have wasted my time here.

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,520
If you get this hot-headed,

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,560
your business will fail easily.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,160
I don't plan on doing business
with someone like you.

35
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,680
What about the land your husband wants?

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,360
Aren't you going to help him?

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,760
You came all this way to meet me yourself.

38
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,120
Are you leaving empty-handed?

39
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
You can do anything for your husband.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,320
But I wonder

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,560
if he'd do the same for you.

42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,040
Are you trying to mess with my head?

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,880
There was an attempted assault earlier,

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,320
and there was also my family.

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,680
Do you think I'll believe
anything you say?

46
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,400
Then prove it yourself,

47
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
how much you should trust your husband.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,440
No one's words are as good
as seeing it with your own eyes, right?

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
Unless…

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,240
You're afraid you can't handle the truth.

51
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,160
Pat.

52
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,200
Pat.

53
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,400
Pu, Rath has already left.

54
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,160
I'll follow him. I'll call you
right away if I have any news.

55
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,840
Okay, I'll wait.

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,760
Wait a minute.

57
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,160
Where are you going?

58
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,840
Only regular guests are allowed in here.

59
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,240
Uh…

60
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,960
How do you know
who is a regular guest and who is not?

61
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,960
Well, based on appearances,

62
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,960
there are only VIPs here.

63
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,600
If someone is here
to replace Anne tonight,

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,040
let her in right away.

65
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,360
It's me. I'm the one replacing Anne.

66
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,040
I was about to tell him.

67
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,560
Then follow me inside.

68
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,080
Ms. Ya!

69
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
Yes!

70
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
I won again!

71
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,800
You've been lucky
so many times already, Ms. Ya.

72
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,520
It's because of you,
my lucky angel, sitting right beside me.

73
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,160
Thank you so much for bringing me here.

74
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,640
If it weren't for a regular guest
like you, I wouldn't have been here.

75
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,440
Just don't tell anyone about this,
especially--

76
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,760
Oh.

77
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,200
Don't worry.

78
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,520
I won't say a thing to Pat.

79
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,040
Woah!

80
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,960
I won again!

81
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Yeah!

82
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,560
Mr. Taweerath is here.

83
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,000
He is not alone.

84
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
I have a video clip to show you.

85
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,640
Give me your phone.

86
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Give it to me!

87
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Ow!

88
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,000
Get up now! Get up!

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,840
Go!

90
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,720
Why hasn't she texted back?

91
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
She said she would send the clip.

92
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,200
Or did something happen?

93
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,280
Don't make that face, Janepob.

94
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,640
Don't you enjoy
coming to places like this?

95
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,080
I do,

96
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,040
but not with
my mother's friends like this.

97
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,280
We're from different ages,
different generations.

98
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,120
Hey,

99
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,880
If it weren't for work,

100
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,120
I wouldn't have come to a place like this.

101
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,559
That's why I brought you along.

102
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,880
When you start working,

103
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,000
you'll have to get to know more people.

104
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,880
Does this mean you'll stop--

105
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,480
I mean stop controlling me?

106
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,520
And I don't have to work
at that coffee shop anymore, right?

107
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,160
Then you should behave,

108
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,560
so you won't have to do an internship
like a regular employee

109
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,360
and come back to be an intern

110
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,280
at the executive level instead.

111
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,960
Actually, Mom, I'm not too concerned
about the internship.

112
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,480
No matter what position

113
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,880
or where I'm at, I'm fine with it.

114
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,440
But I do have one request.

115
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,280
Can I have my credit card back, Mom?

116
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,480
Because of this,

117
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,360
I had to teach you some hardships.

118
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,320
By the way, who did you invite?

119
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,760
A famous star. She is going to be
my partner in a new business,

120
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,560
so I had to find somewhere private

121
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,640
to discuss it in secret like this.

122
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,880
Who is it?

123
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,720
Ingdao.

124
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,280
Ouch.

125
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,720
Mom, my stomach hurts a lot.

126
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
-But--
-I'm going to the bathroom for a moment.

127
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,560
Jane!

128
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
Not now…

129
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,760
Hello, Ms. Piangkhae.

130
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,600
Perfect timing.
Ms. Ingdao, please have a seat.

131
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,920
Have you eaten anything yet?

132
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,960
Yes, I have.

133
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,880
Something's come up, so I need to go.

134
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,200
If I run into Ms. Ingdao,
it'll cause a big problem.

135
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,680
If you don't want
to get hurt more than this,

136
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,400
stay still and be quiet.

137
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,080
Keep an eye on her. I will be back.

138
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,040
Yes, sir.

139
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,000
Hey bro,

140
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,640
something's up.

141
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,520
I'm sorry, but if you don't have
a VIP card, you really can't enter.

142
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
She's with me.

143
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
Are you a VIP customer here?

144
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,720
No.

145
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Why do you have the card?

146
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,640
You don't need to know.

147
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,600
Hey, what are you doing?

148
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,440
Don't be suspicious.

149
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,200
Do you want to get thrown out?

150
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,400
I'm worried about Pu.

151
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,520
Jane is here, you don't have to worry.

152
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,960
You seem really close
to that coffee shop worker.

153
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,800
Just like you and Pu.

154
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Do you have a table yet?

155
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,640
I'm not here just to drink.

156
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,280
Oh, then please follow me.

157
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,920
Here.

158
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,920
If there's any issue
with the contract, let me know.

159
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,040
I'll have the legal team review it again.

160
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,600
I trust you.

161
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,680
Thank you so much for meeting me here.

162
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,680
But…

163
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,720
I want to keep today's matter a secret,

164
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,000
along with whoever else I'm meeting.

165
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,880
Of course.

166
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,000
Whatever is convenient for you,

167
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,800
I'll be fine with it.

168
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,360
Is that the person you came to see?

169
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,760
It looks like someone I know,

170
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,080
but I can't see clearly, so I'm not sure.

171
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,040
Right.

172
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,520
I bet ten!

173
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,760
I'll open the cards now.

174
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
Is this what you wanted me to see?

175
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,000
No.

176
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,240
That's what I want you to see.

177
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
You've probably never seen
your husband like this before.

178
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,000
He's a free rider,

179
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,080
a gambler,

180
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,600
a risk-taker,

181
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,960
doing things for his own gain.

182
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,240
He's not the hardworking businessman

183
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,520
he pretends to be,

184
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,400
even to his own wife.

185
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,960
Mr. Taweerath. I caught the girl Pu.

186
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
She was secretly recording
a video of you at the casino.

187
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,160
Is something wrong?

188
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,840
Oh, it's nothing.

189
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,600
I have to go now.

190
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,600
If you need anything, just ask.
I've sent someone to take care of you.

191
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,920
Thank you.

192
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,240
Why did you bring me outside?

193
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,120
Do you want to confront
your husband in a place like this?

194
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,640
I want to know what he will say to me.

195
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,560
You can take me back to him if you want.

196
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,840
If you do that,

197
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,800
it'll be a waste of time.

198
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,680
What you want to know will stay hidden.

199
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,320
I don't need to remind you, do I?

200
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,120
About the secret you want to know
about your husband?

201
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,720
If you already know, then tell me!

202
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,080
You clearly know more about him than I do.

203
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,040
You brought me here to see him like this.

204
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,800
You wanted me
to see him in a place like this.

205
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,880
You already know

206
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,080
that I suspect him of cheating.

207
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,680
You even know who with, don't you?

208
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,680
-Tell me now!
-Stop.

209
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,320
-Stop messing with my head like this!
-Stop!

210
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,560
Just tell me! Tell me now!

211
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,560
Calm down!

212
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,640
I don't know either.

213
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,360
That's why I want you
to see it for yourself.

214
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,240
Fine.

215
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,680
Tonight, I will get the answers myself.

216
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,560
Mrs. Pat.

217
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,480
Mrs. Pat!

218
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,760
Mr. Tham?

219
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,360
Who did you come with?

220
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,680
I came alone.

221
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,960
I just thought I might run into
someone I was hoping to meet.

222
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,319
So I came here.

223
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,599
And did you find them yet?

224
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,880
Yes,

225
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,839
right in front of me.

226
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,680
What else are you scheming up
to trick me again?

227
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,960
I haven't forgotten

228
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,440
the day of the competition.

229
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,280
Hold on.

230
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,640
I just want to apologize.

231
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,000
That day,

232
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
I just didn't want to break any rules.

233
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,080
Looking back,

234
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,880
I realize I may have
hurt your feelings too much.

235
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,360
I want to make it right with you.

236
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,000
How so?

237
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,720
Hey! What are you doing here?

238
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,080
I just started working for Mr. Pumeth.

239
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,280
He asked me to tell you he's waiting,

240
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,680
and I'll stay here to keep watch.

241
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,680
Let me check with him
over the radio first,

242
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,880
on where I should go.

243
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,800
Sure.

244
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,920
Jane!

245
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,680
That kid is gone.

246
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,320
Ouch!

247
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Sorry, sir.

248
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,360
Where's the phone?

249
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,080
If Pat sees the clip she recorded,

250
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,280
I'll definitely lose my piggy bank.

251
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,640
Find the girl.

252
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,320
See if she's still around. Go!

253
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,800
Understood.

254
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,360
Thank you for saving me.

255
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
But how did you get here?

256
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,040
I came to apply for a job.

257
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,480
I thought the pay here was better.

258
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,200
I didn't expect to find you
locked up in a storage room.

259
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,840
Are you okay? Did they hurt you?

260
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,880
I'm fine,

261
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,600
but they took my phone.

262
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,520
Mr. Rath probably has it by now.
I have to go get it back.

263
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,680
Can I borrow your phone?

264
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,720
Ava? What is she doing here?

265
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,320
There's a VIP room upstairs.

266
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,960
Why did Ava go up there?

267
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,840
How do you know?

268
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,080
Before I applied here, I did my homework.

269
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,440
Pu…

270
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,840
I'm so relieved you're safe.

271
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,360
You should go home now
and don't put yourself at risk again.

272
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,600
I'll take care of the rest.

273
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,280
Ava is here?

274
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,560
In a VIP room?

275
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,240
I'll find you. Just wait for me.

276
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,480
Okay.

277
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,680
Ava.

278
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,520
She definitely didn't come here alone.

279
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,360
Rath.

280
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,000
This is my apology for what happened.

281
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,160
With that expression,

282
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,760
do you think I don't mean it?

283
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
I'm just not sure

284
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,640
what kind of person you really are.

285
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,960
But since you apologized,

286
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,720
I won't hold it against you.

287
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,680
After this drink,

288
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,680
we can let bygones be bygones.

289
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,440
We've made up.

290
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,680
Right.

291
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,480
Mr. Tham!

292
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,720
How could you do this to me?
Are you drunk?

293
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,360
I didn't expect
to see you and Ms. Ingdao here.

294
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,480
You're also acting
like a complete jerk to her.

295
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,240
Or is this how you treat

296
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,280
every woman you meet?

297
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,880
Not every woman,

298
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,920
but a beautiful one like her,

299
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,800
it's hard for a man like me

300
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,720
not to be moved.

301
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,520
Even with Mrs. Pat,

302
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,600
who is already married.

303
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,240
Tham, you!

304
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,200
Rath! Rath!

305
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,200
If you don't want to get hurt,
don't mess with Pat!

306
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,000
Mr. Tham!

307
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,120
Hurry up and stop this!

308
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,680
Calm down, sir.

309
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,160
It's those two.

310
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,600
Hey, let's go!

311
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,840
You two, that's enough.

312
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,560
Don't fight because of me.

313
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,160
Between you and me,

314
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,360
this won't end tonight!

315
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,840
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

316
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,840
Stop it.

317
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,600
Why did you tell me to come here?

318
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,120
Just give me the money and we're done.

319
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,320
Give it to me!

320
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm going to order some food.

321
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,800
I want to have dinner with you, Mom.

322
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,200
Dinner with me?

323
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,680
In this room?

324
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,960
Are you out of your mind?

325
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
The owner of this room will be here soon.

326
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,000
I already asked Mr. Taweerath.

327
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,200
God! Let's do it another day.

328
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,520
I'm in a hurry today.

329
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,360
If it weren't here,

330
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,000
when you came to get the money,
there wouldn't be another time.

331
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,120
When I called you,
you didn't even pick up the phone.

332
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,480
Didn't even think to call me back.

333
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,520
Do you even care about me?

334
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,160
Your aunt's been taking good care of you.

335
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,040
Why should I worry?

336
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,960
How about this?

337
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,360
You quickly become a famous star.

338
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,280
Be a leading actress like your aunt.

339
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,840
When you're rich,

340
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,080
I'll come and live with you.

341
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,560
So if I don't have money,
you won't bat an eye for me, right?

342
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,640
You let me stay with Aunt Dao,
asking for her money.

343
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
But she is not my mother!

344
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,880
Don't you ever think about
being a mother to me?

345
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,560
If you're going to keep doing this,

346
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,960
you might as well have left me an orphan.

347
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,920
Did you just tell me to die?

348
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,000
You ungrateful child!

349
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,120
If you don't want me to grow up,
let me die instead!

350
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,120
Where's my money?

351
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,720
Ava!

352
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,520
You still haven't given it to me!

353
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,800
I know who the woman is.

354
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,320
You do?

355
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,640
How?

356
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,160
It's Ava.

357
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,720
You must be mistaken.

358
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,240
How could I be?

359
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,480
You don't know what I've seen
or what I've been through.

360
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,880
Mrs. Pat, listen to me.

361
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,360
Ava didn't do anything with your husband.

362
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,600
Mrs. Pat.

363
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,200
Mrs. Pat.

364
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,160
I didn't know

365
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,080
Mr. Tham was interested in you too.

366
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,520
Why?

367
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,880
Can he only be interested in your wife?

368
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,600
Oh, right.

369
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,920
I'm not as good as your wife, am I?

370
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,480
That's why you weren't jealous
when you saw me with him.

371
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,800
Because I know

372
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,320
you did it on purpose.

373
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,720
Besides,

374
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,840
I didn't think of it that way.

375
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,760
Because if that were the case,

376
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,960
you wouldn't be here with me right now.

377
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,760
Or…

378
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,720
Did I do something
to make you feel inferior to Pat?

379
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,920
Whatever you wanted,

380
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
I gave it to you.

381
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,880
That bag you wanted, I bought it for you.

382
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,960
But in the end,

383
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,680
I had to give it to Ava

384
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,760
because I was afraid
your wife would find out.

385
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,160
Do you know

386
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,520
all of this has made me start questioning

387
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,880
what I'm even doing?

388
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,480
Even when we went to London
and played golf together,

389
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,040
I still needed Ava to cover for me.

390
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,440
Last week, you said
you went to England for work,

391
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,680
you used your credit card to buy
a woman's bag worth hundreds of thousands.

392
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,320
And yet, you never gave it to me.

393
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,040
I spent the money

394
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,560
to surprise my wife,

395
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,560
but the delivery was delayed,
so you caught me.

396
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,560
It just arrived today.

397
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,160
I picked your favorite color.

398
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,360
On the bill, it says chain straps.

399
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,440
But these are leather.

400
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,160
A girl's golf glove.

401
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,200
We haven't even posted
a single picture of us together.

402
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,440
And then there's the party at your house.

403
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,080
You told me to get out of the room

404
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,280
because you were afraid
people might get suspicious.

405
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,720
You should hurry.

406
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,800
Other people will be suspicious.

407
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,640
Why should I lower myself
for a man like you?

408
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,280
Hey…

409
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,280
Dao…

410
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,000
I didn't know
you'd be offended by so many things.

411
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,480
Also, you didn't help Ava
like you promised.

412
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,960
You know I had to do that.

413
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,360
I didn't want you to feel bad.

414
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,320
My business still depends on Pat's money.

415
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,200
Once my company is stable enough

416
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,040
to stand on its own,

417
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,400
you won't have to sacrifice
anything for me anymore.

418
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,320
Did you know?

419
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,040
If I loved you any less,

420
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,520
I would have let you go.

421
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,160
But I love you so much

422
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
that I can't lose you.

423
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,920
Thank you.

424
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,040
What's the thing that's
important to Mrs. Pat in all this?

425
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,040
I can't tell you.

426
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,000
That's okay.

427
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,960
But right now, Mrs. Pat has disappeared

428
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,000
and we couldn't reach her.

429
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,280
Could you try to contact her?

430
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,600
He's helped you so much.

431
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,400
Why are you still suspicious?

432
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm just worried about Mrs. Pat,
whether she's safe or not.

433
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,360
I'll try to reach her.

434
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,080
Happy anniversary Honey.

435
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,720
Thank you.

436
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,440
I picked your favorite color.

437
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,640
I love you the most.

438
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,280
Hey…

439
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,480
I saw everything.

440
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,520
I've seen everything…

441
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,400
you wanted me to see.

442
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,320
I know it all now.

443
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,920
It was not Ava.

444
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,440
But…

445
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,200
It was Dao.

446
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,000
Rath doesn't love me.

447
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,440
He's with me because of my money.

448
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,280
You must be

449
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,760
in so much pain.

450
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,360
Is this it?

451
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,760
You wanted to see me like this?

452
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,360
Here I am.

453
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
A fool

454
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,600
who has been deceived
by her own husband all along.

455
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,680
Wait. Listen to me!

456
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,360
Stop bothering me.

457
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,960
If you're here to pity me,

458
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,880
then don't!

459
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,680
I don't want it.

460
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,960
I don't have any of those things for you.

461
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,320
But I do have an offer,

462
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,360
if you're interested.

463
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,400
What offer?

464
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,400
If you want revenge

465
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,480
on the one who hurt you,

466
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
we should work together

467
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,280
to take revenge on your husband.

468
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,480
In order to make someone listen to us,

469
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,640
this is the perfect time.

470
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,560
I went to see Ya,
she said you weren't feeling well,

471
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,040
so she wanted me
to bring you some soup.

472
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,800
I'll go warm it up.

473
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,160
NEXT EPISODE

474
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,880
It's obvious you're trying
to steal Mrs. Pat's stuff.

475
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,000
A lack of guidance, right?

476
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
You!

477
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,640
Don't even think

478
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,360
that what you did to me will end here.

479
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,320
I don't plan to end it here either.

480
