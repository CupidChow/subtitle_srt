1
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,000
You idiot!

2
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,040
I told you to get me the Rayong project,
not Chiang Mai.

3
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,240
Can't you read, huh?

4
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,320
Go get it!

5
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,840
I'm sorry, sir.

6
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,560
Now!

7
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,760
Why can't anyone
do their job as flawlessly as Pumeth?

8
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,520
Then why don't you ask him
to come back and work with you?

9
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,440
He's a great worker,

10
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,320
and he's really loyal to you.

11
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
So,

12
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,840
what's the problem between you two?
Why did you beat him up so badly?

13
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,320
Loyal, huh?

14
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,160
I didn't want to say anything

15
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,320
because I didn't want
to get even angrier, Dao.

16
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,160
And why would you get angry?

17
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,960
Don't play dumb with me, Dao.

18
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,520
If you care about him so much,
just say it.

19
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,720
I was just asking.

20
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,720
If you two don't care for each other,

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,680
then why did he try to run away
with you from me?

22
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,520
What do you mean?

23
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,400
I saw him preparing
plane tickets and money

24
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,760
to take you away from me.

25
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,160
I always knew

26
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,440
you and Ingdao had something in the past.

27
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,960
So she had you find the money
and plane tickets?

28
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,120
She doesn't know anything.

29
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,000
I did this on my own.

30
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,640
Please let her go.

31
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,560
What else did you do to him?

32
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,840
You care about him that much?

33
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,400
I don't know what you've heard,

34
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,240
but Pumeth and I,

35
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,600
we're not a thing.

36
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,760
Whatever he does,

37
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,240
it's got nothing to do with me.

38
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,400
I just don't want you to misunderstand him

39
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,760
and take it too far.

40
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,120
If you don't care about him, then fine.

41
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,760
You've got nothing to worry about, right?

42
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,080
As long as you behave

43
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,880
and don't betray me,

44
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,400
you won't end up like him.

45
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,880
What do you mean by that?

46
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,040
What did you do to him?

47
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,960
Dao,

48
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,400
you should focus on
yourself and your niece.

49
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,960
Don't let anyone find out

50
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,200
what the two of you did.

51
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,600
What are you talking about?

52
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,160
Do you really want me to spell it out

53
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,480
that your niece is a murderer?

54
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,560
You knew?

55
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,800
I know everything

56
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
about you.

57
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,320
<i>Congrats, Dao. You got to be the</i>
<i>leading lady like you always dreamed of.</i>

58
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,200
Hey,

59
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,200
don't be upset

60
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,720
if I can't tell anyone about us yet.

61
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,800
Wait until I'm more famous,

62
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,720
so I can work and save up a lot of money.

63
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
Then we'll start a family together, okay?

64
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,760
I'll do my best too.

65
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
I'll make sure you live comfortably

66
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
and I'll take good care of you.

67
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,160
Thank you.

68
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
It's fine. I'll give it to her.

69
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,280
Are you hot? I got you some water.

70
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,360
Thank you.

71
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,640
Want some more?

72
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,040
Dao!

73
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
If you're here to see me,

74
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,120
why look at other girls?

75
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,440
Dao,

76
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,400
are you seriously in the mood
to be jealous right now?

77
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,840
I just don't want to be undervalued.

78
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,040
So what's your deal?

79
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,200
Can't you see?

80
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,960
He's been following me around everywhere.

81
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,120
Even on set,

82
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,840
he's here watching.

83
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,040
That's why I had to meet you here.

84
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,560
Then,

85
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,600
why not just end this quickly

86
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,200
and give me the document I asked for?

87
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,080
I'm not sure I can do that.

88
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,280
But you said
you have already made up your mind.

89
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,600
I bet you know

90
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,560
how cruel Rath can be.

91
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,880
Every time we think
it will be an easy escape,

92
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,960
it never is.

93
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,400
Even this time.

94
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
The person who tried to help me

95
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,880
got into trouble,

96
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,159
and was beaten badly.

97
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,360
Who knows what's happened to him now?

98
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,240
And who is that?

99
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,200
Pumeth?

100
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,600
Yeah.

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,040
He tried to help me and Ava,

102
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,440
but Rath caught him.

103
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,840
If I take a risk to help you now,

104
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,080
Ava and I

105
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,960
will be in even more danger.

106
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
But if you keep playing it safe

107
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,120
and stay Rath's obedient pet,

108
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,040
are you sure you'll be safe?

109
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,440
I don't care.

110
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,960
Either way,

111
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,480
I'm not risking myself for you.

112
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,880
Whatever we agreed on,

113
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
it's off.

114
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,840
You can't do this, Dao.

115
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,840
We had a deal.

116
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,000
Things have changed.

117
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,960
For my own survival,

118
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,160
everything we agreed on,

119
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
it can be undone whenever, right?

120
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,800
What are you asking Dao to do?

121
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,160
What are you saying?

122
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,520
Don't think I don't see

123
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,640
how you've been trying
to get close to her.

124
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,800
Someone like you

125
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,440
wouldn't just approach her

126
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,360
for friendly chit-chat, especially
not the woman who stole your husband,

127
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,640
would you?

128
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,840
You're just

129
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
imagining things.

130
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,160
If it weren't for this drama shoot,

131
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,480
I'd never get involved with her.

132
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,480
Well I hope that's true.

133
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,960
Because whatever it is you're plotting,

134
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,440
I can assure you

135
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,000
it won't work.

136
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,440
And for everything you've done to me,

137
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,360
it won't end well for you.

138
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,400
And don't you think

139
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,720
I'll let you mess with me again.

140
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Hmm,

141
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,800
the way you're snapping at me…

142
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,360
I wonder what you remind me of…

143
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,160
Oh!

144
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,480
I know.

145
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,880
You're like a dog
desperate to get its bone back.

146
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,880
- Pat!
- Hey!

147
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,680
Let go!

148
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,000
What are you doing?

149
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,480
So the dog has gone from snarling

150
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,600
to pouncing for the bone?

151
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,000
Patchanin,

152
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,080
how dare you call your ex-husband a dog?

153
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,480
Why are you so angry

154
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,400
if it's not true?

155
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,920
Hmm, or could it be

156
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,080
you're upset
because she hit the nail on the head?

157
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,280
Damn you Tham!

158
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,080
We can throw punches right here.

159
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,320
If you're ready to take the fallout,

160
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,560
then so am I.

161
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,160
Let's see

162
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,800
who takes the most damage.

163
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,840
Why was he picking a fight with you?

164
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,520
He suspects me and Dao.

165
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,520
But the bigger issue now is

166
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,800
Dao won't help me anymore.

167
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,080
Maybe

168
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,960
he has figured out your deal with her?

169
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,920
I doubt it.

170
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,600
I think he's just suspicious.

171
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,360
But Dao's terrified he'll find out

172
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,680
because someone has

173
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,720
already been hurt by Rath.

174
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,680
Who?

175
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,960
Pumeth.

176
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,320
Dao said he disappeared
because he was helping her and Ava,

177
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,560
so now she's too scared
to go against Rath.

178
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,280
Pumeth.

179
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,920
He's close to Taweerath.

180
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,320
He must know a lot of his secrets,

181
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,160
so when Rath found out
he was secretly helping someone,

182
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,280
there's no way that guy
would let him go easily.

183
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,120
I think

184
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,520
you need to forget about Dao
and come up with a new plan.

185
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,520
She probably sees
Rath's true colors by now.

186
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,680
She won't stay with that scumbag for long.

187
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,000
She's just scared for the moment.

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh, Miss Dao!

189
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,680
Miss Ava's been
in such a good mood all day.

190
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,680
She didn't yell even once.

191
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,880
Before she got on her phone,

192
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,920
she was taking a walk in the garden.

193
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,040
She must be happier now.
That's why she's doing so much better.

194
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,600
Oh, I almost forgot.

195
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,520
What's that?

196
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,720
Oh,

197
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,360
the vitamins Mr. Rath's been giving her.

198
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,520
He said to make sure
she takes them on time.

199
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,240
What's wrong, Miss Dao?

200
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,880
When she takes these, she's happy all day.

201
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,080
Rati had someone she knows run a test.

202
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
They're not vitamins, Dao.

203
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,200
They're sedatives.

204
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,200
Seriously though,

205
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,480
who would dare sell you fake vitamins?

206
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
It's someone I know.

207
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,800
Ugh, people are so evil these days.

208
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,360
Even someone you know

209
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,640
would sell you sedatives
and call them vitamins?

210
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,360
They're just like those
who sell fake creams, diet pills,

211
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,920
and supplements.

212
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,520
It's a good thing

213
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,480
you had us check them for you.

214
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
You're right.

215
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,440
People who go behind your back like that

216
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,200
are beyond evil.

217
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,120
I think

218
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,400
you should deal with them fast,

219
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,360
so scumbags like that
are gone from society.

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,080
That way, they can't trick anyone else.

221
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,400
Why did you throw them away?

222
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,720
From now on, if Rath gives Ava any pills,

223
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,400
let me see them first.

224
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,400
Don't let Ava take anything
without running it by me, okay?

225
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,320
Got it, but what if she asks for some?

226
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,560
Don't say anything.

227
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,760
Just give her this instead.

228
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,560
Okay.

229
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,120
Pon!

230
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,200
Pon!

231
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,240
Yes?

232
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,920
Pon,

233
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I haven't had my vitamins today.

234
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,720
Sure, I'll get them for you.

235
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,080
Ava,

236
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,360
Mrs. Som is asking about your schedule.

237
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,320
When can you shoot again?

238
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,680
I…

239
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,480
I don't…

240
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,200
want to go back to work yet.

241
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,800
Should I ask them to reduce your lines?

242
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,800
Can they do that?

243
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,640
Of course.

244
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,319
Or maybe

245
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,599
you could work on a new show.

246
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,920
I'll talk to Mrs. Som for you.

247
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,319
Okay.

248
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,520
Pumeth is dead.

249
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,560
His body was found two days ago.

250
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,200
No one has filed a missing persons report,

251
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,560
and no family has come forward.

252
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,560
Pumeth used to do
all kinds of work for Rath.

253
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,000
Even the dirty jobs.
He was happy to do them

254
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,520
and cover for Rath.

255
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,400
He should've known better.

256
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,400
Betraying Rath

257
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,920
never ends well.

258
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,720
Why did he help Dao
to the point of ending up like this?

259
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,640
I wondered that too,

260
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,680
so I had someone look into

261
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,320
Miss Ingdao and Pumeth's relationship.

262
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,600
This is all we got.

263
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,520
This should be enough to confirm

264
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,000
they used to be a couple.

265
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,000
We should tell the police
to go after Taweerath.

266
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,120
He's definitely behind Pumeth's death.

267
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,080
Please don't tell Dao about this yet.

268
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,960
Why not?

269
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,160
If they really were a couple,

270
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,000
knowing about this

271
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,360
will devastate her.

272
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,760
I don't want her
to go through that right now.

273
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,600
I'll tell her myself.

274
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,160
Sure.

275
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,640
Why are you here?

276
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,480
I don't have to be at the shoot today.

277
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,400
Since you've been so quiet lately,
I thought I'd stop by.

278
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,720
I brought you cupcakes, your favorite.

279
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,920
I don't want them.

280
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,600
Keep them and leave.

281
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,440
And don't come to my house again.

282
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
You're annoying.

283
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,160
Hey, wait.

284
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,520
I came here to talk things out with you.

285
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,360
That's bullshit.

286
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't believe you!

287
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,080
I'm being serious.

288
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,760
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you.

289
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,480
I know now

290
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,320
that you had nothing to do
with Chat's death.

291
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,680
Tell you what,

292
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,960
wherever you want to go,
whatever you want to do today,

293
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
I'll take you, and I'll pay for it too.

294
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
But,

295
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,960
don't be greedy.

296
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,800
Don't buy anything expensive.

297
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,200
You don't have to.

298
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,600
If I want to get something
or eat something,

299
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,520
I can pay for it myself.

300
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,800
So,

301
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,160
does that mean you're coming with me?

302
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,720
Or did you already
have plans with someone else?

303
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,880
It's time for my vitamins.

304
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,760
Pon! Where are my vitamins?

305
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,000
- Pon!
- Yes, I'm coming.

306
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,560
Here you go, Ava.

307
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,040
Hey,

308
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,360
you took your vitamins.

309
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,400
So now you can go shopping with me, right?

310
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,080
- Ava, what's wrong?
- I didn't mean to!

311
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,600
What are you scared of?

312
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,440
I didn't mean to! I didn't mean to!

313
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,720
I didn't mean to!

314
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,880
Ava!

315
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,600
Get back!

316
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,120
I didn't mean to make you fall.

317
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,160
Please don't punish me!

318
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,560
What did you say?

319
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
I didn't mean to make you fall.

320
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,840
Chat…

321
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Chat, I'm sorry.

322
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,280
Chat, please. Please.

323
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,480
Please forgive me. Please.

324
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,240
Miss Ava!

325
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,640
What's the matter with her?

326
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,240
I don't know for sure.

327
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,600
Miss Ava! Miss Ava!

328
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,840
I need to edit the script first.

329
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,000
- I'll tell you when I'm done.
- Okay.

330
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,440
- Got it.
- Okay? Thank you.

331
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,120
What are we filming after this?

332
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,160
This scene.

333
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,400
- Got it.
- Okay?

334
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Good.

335
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,400
We need to talk. It's important.

336
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,640
I've got nothing to say.

337
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,960
What if it's about Pumeth?

338
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,400
Why are you bringing him up again?

339
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,200
You were the one who told me

340
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Rath beat him up and that he disappeared,

341
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,680
so I had Mr. Tham look into it.

342
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,320
And what did you find out?

343
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,520
Why should I tell you?

344
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,480
Wait!

345
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,400
You're the one
who wanted to tell me about him.

346
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,880
Well, I told you.

347
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,080
I found him.

348
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,280
Besides that, I can't tell you anything.

349
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,800
Fine, I'll tell you a bit more.

350
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,680
Based on his condition when I found him,

351
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,320
he had been beaten up badly.

352
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,520
You have to help him.

353
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,600
And why would I help someone
who works for Rath,

354
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,640
someone who has messed with me
so many times?

355
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,880
He was taking orders from Rath,

356
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,240
but in the end, Rath hurt him too.

357
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,880
But he's Rath's henchman.

358
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Why would Rath do that?

359
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,040
He tried to help me and Ava

360
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,440
start over,

361
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,360
but Rath found out.

362
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,960
So Rath punished him severely.

363
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,040
Pat,

364
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,080
you have to help him.

365
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,760
If I help him,

366
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,200
what's in it for me?

367
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,760
Well, Dada,

368
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,880
you're such a good assistant today.

369
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,080
Even when I'm heading to the restroom,
you're right there to watch me.

370
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,600
Well, Dao,

371
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm just afraid Pat might find you
and you'll start fighting again.

372
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,440
So I'm here to prevent any dog fights--

373
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,800
I mean, to prevent catfights for you.

374
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,560
I really care about you, Dao.

375
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,000
If Mr. Rath
ordered you to follow me around,

376
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,000
then just say it.

377
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,480
You think I'm so dumb I couldn't tell?

378
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,760
Dao, dear,

379
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,280
how could Mr. Rath
order me to do anything?

380
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,280
You're just imagining things.

381
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,880
Then,

382
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,440
should I check your phone

383
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,600
to see your texts with Mr. Rath?

384
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,080
Come on, Dao.

385
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,560
Mr. Rath cares about you a lot,

386
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,760
but he can't be here to take care of you,

387
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,440
so he asked me to take good care of you.

388
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,240
Take care of me well, right?

389
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,480
Then,

390
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,880
can you get everyone out of there?

391
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Whoever is in there,

392
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,880
tell them to leave

393
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,320
because I

394
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,960
want the restroom all to myself.

395
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,440
Aw, Dao.

396
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,720
Do you really want me to do that?

397
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,560
They'll curse my family
and post about it on social media.

398
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,720
Please don't make me do it, Dao.

399
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,960
So you can't do that?

400
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,320
Well, if you can't,

401
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,600
then stay here.

402
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,720
Don't follow me around
till it gets annoying.

403
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,080
You're my assistant, not my jailer.

404
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,320
ACTORS' RESTROOM

405
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,440
Dada!

406
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,120
Fine, I'll go.

407
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,720
Here to use the restroom, Pat?

408
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,280
Yes.

409
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,520
Dada, could you please move?

410
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,840
What's the matter?

411
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,400
Nothing, nothing.

412
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,120
Let's go, Dada.

413
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
I just

414
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,360
wanted to touch up my face for the scene.

415
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,800
Okay.

416
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,520
Hello.

417
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,640
No such thing happened, Mr. Rath.

418
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,400
They didn't even say a word to each other.

419
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,840
They didn't look at each other either.

420
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
It's really tense between them.

421
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,080
Okay, okay. Well, I'm hanging up now.

422
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,440
Rath is having a problem
with a condo project.

423
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,480
If you want to mess with him,

424
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,640
I'll give you the information.

425
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,960
But you have to promise

426
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,840
you'll take good care of Pumeth

427
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,800
and make sure he's okay.

428
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,280
You seem to care about him a lot.

429
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,200
He tried to help me,

430
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,800
so I want to help him too.

431
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
What do you say?

432
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,160
Will you do what I asked?

433
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,280
Sure,

434
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,760
I accept.

435
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,560
Sorry, Dao.

436
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
I really had to lie too.

437
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,000
Hey, Pu.

438
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,200
How did it go with Ava?

439
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,440
Okay.

440
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,400
I'll meet you there
after we're done shooting.

441
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,560
Ava was hallucinating till she confessed

442
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,960
that she pushed Chat off the roof.

443
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,640
But still, I can't do anything, right?

444
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,840
The police already closed the case.

445
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,680
If we want it reopened,

446
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,440
we'll have to find more evidence.

447
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,520
I'll do anything

448
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,920
to reopen Chat's case.

449
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,120
I won't let it slide.

450
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,520
You should rest, Pu.

451
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,200
Let's go.

452
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,360
I wanted you to see this.

453
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,360
Dao gave me the information.

454
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,560
In here,

455
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,600
is everything about Rath's
condo project that's facing a problem.

456
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,320
Dao gave me this

457
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,760
because she wanted me to help Pumeth.

458
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,800
So how would you help him

459
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,560
if he's already dead?

460
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,840
The only thing we can do

461
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,880
is get Taweerath arrested for killing him.

462
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,880
No.

463
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,080
He can't get arrested yet.

464
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,040
If he does now,

465
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,680
I won't get to take
everything back from him.

466
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,040
When will you stop lying
to Miss Ingdao about Pumeth?

467
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,560
I understand you, Miss Pat.

468
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,160
I want to get back at him for Fah too.

469
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,800
But to use a dead person as our tool,

470
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,200
isn't that going too far?

471
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,320
But if I didn't do this,

472
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,200
Dao would never help me.

473
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,120
I'll take back all of what's mine

474
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,120
and my father's from Rath first.

475
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,640
And then,

476
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,280
I'll send him to rot in jail

477
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,760
when he has nothing left.

478
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Only that

479
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,440
is fitting for someone like him.

480
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,600
You seem happy.

481
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,440
My new condo

482
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,360
just reached its sales target.

483
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,160
Over 60 percent of the tenants
have transferred ownership.

484
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,280
Congratulations.

485
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,280
My success

486
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,120
is like your success, Dao.

487
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,480
Of course, I'd have to
congratulate you on every venture,

488
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,560
as long as it's truly successful.

489
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,160
Hello.

490
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
What?

491
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,960
Someone's suing to revoke the approval

492
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,320
of my new condo's construction?

493
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,040
But it's been finished for ages.

494
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,760
Almost the whole condo is sold now.

495
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,920
Who's suing us?

496
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,480
You said you took care
of silencing everyone who knows.

497
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,880
Clearly, the building's height

498
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,960
and the land in front of it

499
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,720
violate the Building Control Act.

500
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,560
He's definitely done, bro.

501
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,640
Because of what we're suing him for,

502
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,320
once the court reaches a verdict,

503
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,840
they'll revoke the building permit

504
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,360
and order the condo demolished.

505
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,640
The tenants will definitely sue
Taweerath's company together.

506
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,360
Taweerath won't let it
get demolished so easily.

507
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,840
And the only way he can avoid that

508
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,600
is to buy up all the land
and buildings in the area

509
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,720
to make sure
the entrances and exits are legal.

510
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,080
If he buys them now,
he'll have to negotiate their prices.

511
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,360
He'll have to no matter what.

512
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,640
He has no choice.

513
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,080
As the plan goes,

514
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,800
we'll have to buy the land
in front to make entrances and exits.

515
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,639
How much would that be?

516
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,159
Five hundred million.

517
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,920
Five hundred million?

518
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,920
Rath,

519
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,320
just pay it,
so you won't have to lose more.

520
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,520
But there's another problem.

521
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,440
Since word got out about the lawsuit,

522
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,320
all the land we should be buying
has already been purchased.

523
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,400
Who bought it?

524
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,400
I had someone look into it.

525
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,080
But now, all the land

526
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,159
appears to be owned by one person.

527
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,400
That's good then, Rath.

528
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,800
That will make for an easier deal.

529
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,960
You won't need to talk
to multiple landowners about the sale.

530
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,840
Then go arrange a meeting with them

531
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,960
and buy the land fast
so we can get this over with!

532
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,640
Got it.

533
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,400
Okay.

534
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,920
That company, Begin,

535
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,280
is just a small firm
that was only recently registered.

536
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,400
Why did they have us
negotiate the price directly with them?

537
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,720
I really want to know

538
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,520
who they think they are.

539
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,600
They might just
want to meet you in person.

540
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,720
It's not every day a small firm gets to
meet a big businessman like you.

541
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,920
If that's the case, then great.

542
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,520
It's only 500 million.

543
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
I can find it easily.

544
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,520
But what I really want to know is

545
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,960
how word about my condo got out.

546
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,080
If I find out who leaked it,

547
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,520
I'll get rid of them.

548
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,320
Shall we head inside?

549
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,800
They're waiting for you.

550
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,800
- Where's the table I booked?
- That way, sir.

551
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,560
We're representing Begin

552
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,360
to negotiate the land sale.

553
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,960
Thank you

554
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,440
for your interest in the land
owned by a small company like ours.

555
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,400
The land in front of Rath's condo,

556
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,920
how come it's yours now?

557
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
I'm interested in a real estate business.

558
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,120
You know that too, Rath.

559
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,200
That's why I asked Mr. Tham
to start a company for me

560
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,600
and buy up all the land in the area

561
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,080
in my name.

562
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,680
I negotiated
with all the landowners in the area.

563
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,400
Everyone agreed to sell to you.

564
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,200
Apparently, they were unhappy
with the construction to begin with.

565
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,640
Not only was it a nuisance,

566
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,280
but there was zero safety.

567
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,920
Plus, there were many accidents
during the construction,

568
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,440
but word didn't get out

569
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,440
because Taweerath
covered it up using money.

570
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,760
He missed a few locals, though.

571
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,520
Before he knew it, the condo got sued,

572
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,960
and all the land
got transferred to our new company.

573
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,800
Now,

574
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,120
we just wait till he contacts us.

575
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,120
So you two bought up all the land

576
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,520
and caused a problem by suing my condo.

577
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
Rath,

578
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,280
there's no use getting angry now.

579
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,280
Because now,

580
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,640
you have to buy the land back.

581
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,920
She's right, Rath.

582
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,320
If you do something stupid

583
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,320
and get me and Mr. Tham upset,

584
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,160
our negotiation today might be over.

585
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,120
Then tell me,

586
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,600
are you selling it or not?

587
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,520
Of course, we're happy to sell it.

588
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,080
Otherwise,

589
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,760
we wouldn't have come to see you.

590
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,240
Then tell me,

591
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,560
how much is it?

592
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,080
The appraisal price is 500 million.

593
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,800
So, I'll sell it to you for…

594
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,960
One billion.

595
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,360
One billion!

596
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,040
You're acting without thinking
if it's wrong,

597
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,440
just like the guy you hate.
