1
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,080
Dad…

2
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,080
The only way an intelligent person
stoops to the level of an idiot

3
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,760
is by losing all self-control.

4
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,840
You used to be smart,

5
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,680
but now you've become
the stupidest person,

6
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,200
bringing a gun to kill someone

7
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,400
without thinking about the consequences!

8
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,280
I didn't do it, Dad.

9
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,520
Whatever you say doesn't matter anymore.

10
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,360
The evidence at the crime scene
and the witnesses

11
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,880
all point to you shooting Ingdao,

12
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,320
attempting to murder her.

13
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,800
Dad…

14
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,480
Let's not discuss it further.

15
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,160
Either way, I'm still your father.

16
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,360
Even if you've done
the worst thing imaginable,

17
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,720
it's a burden I must carry.

18
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,200
We're here to visit Mrs. Pat.

19
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,640
Kobsak ordered me

20
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,320
not to let anyone in to see Mrs. Pat.

21
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Tham,

22
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,320
I thought I made it clear

23
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,480
that you can't see Pat anymore.

24
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,800
You would say this is
between husband and wife,

25
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,720
nobody else's business.

26
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,280
But I don't think that's the case now.

27
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,440
Because if things have gotten serious
and become a legal matter,

28
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,640
someone who genuinely loves

29
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,240
and means well for Mrs. Pat

30
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,560
should get involved now.

31
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,680
If you're pretending to be
this saint who means well,

32
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,920
and yet you're ruining my daughter's life,

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,400
I don't want to hear it!

34
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,840
No matter what, I'm still her father.

35
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,440
So I'm ordering

36
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,120
both of you, don't come here again!

37
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Rath.

38
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm glad you're awake.

39
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,080
Get out!

40
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,520
Why are you telling me to leave, honey?

41
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,960
I'm so worried about you.

42
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,120
Quit your bullshit, you're making me sick!

43
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
Since you've got this much energy,

44
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,120
maybe I shouldn't worry

45
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,360
about you passing out again.

46
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,120
Isn't it because of you

47
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm in this state?

48
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,720
Don't do that, Pat.

49
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
Please stop framing me, I'm begging you.

50
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,160
You should know by now

51
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,760
what charges you're facing.

52
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
It's all up to me now.

53
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
What do you mean?

54
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,240
Dao's condition is stable now.

55
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
The police are waiting
to question me and her

56
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,560
about what happened.

57
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,920
What do you think I should tell them?

58
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,600
Attempted murder?

59
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,440
Intentional murder?

60
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,040
Or maybe voluntary manslaughter?

61
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,080
Hmm…

62
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,200
What's it called again? I can't remember.

63
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,240
I didn't shoot Dao.

64
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,840
I'll tell the police
everything you did to me.

65
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
You set me up and framed me!

66
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,680
Pat, what you're claiming here,

67
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,320
do you have any witnesses or evidence?

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,280
The police aren't just
going to take your word for it.

69
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,000
Whatever you thought you could use,

70
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,680
it's all gone now.

71
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,400
Not even a piece left.

72
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,320
I searched Mrs. Pat's bag and car,

73
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,800
found nothing except the phone.

74
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,600
And I've deleted everything from it,

75
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,120
and from her dashcam too.

76
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,880
I made sure none of it can be recovered.

77
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,400
I even took care of
the cameras inside the house.

78
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,880
Thank you so much.

79
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,360
Get plenty of rest, honey.

80
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,640
Did that hurt?

81
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,720
And here I thought
you didn't have any human emotions!

82
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,080
Pat!

83
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,240
No!

84
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,880
Let go!

85
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,720
-Let go!
-Quit acting tough with me, Pat.

86
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
You weren't like this before!

87
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,680
It's because you're a scumbag!

88
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,360
Look in the mirror
and see how vile you've become

89
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,480
to make me like this. Let go!

90
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,720
-Let go!
-Hey, Pat!

91
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,720
I told you to let go!

92
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,200
Surrender to me!

93
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
You'll never win against me.

94
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,760
Let go of me!

95
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
There's no point in being stubborn.

96
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,160
What you need to do now

97
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,840
is whatever I tell you,

98
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,919
so we both can end this marriage cleanly.

99
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,440
You scumbag!

100
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
You scumbag!

101
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,920
Ma'am, please calm down.

102
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,400
Calm down.

103
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,160
It's okay.

104
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,920
I went to Mrs. Pat's to see Jaew.

105
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
The neighbors said she quit.

106
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,040
Huh?

107
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,640
How is that possible?
Jaew really loves Pat. Why would she quit?

108
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,080
They said she's leaving town
to go back home.

109
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,760
All of a sudden?

110
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,320
Maybe what we suspected is true.

111
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,440
Something more happened
besides Pat shooting Dao.

112
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,640
That's why Jaew quit.

113
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,840
Or maybe

114
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,640
she was forced to.

115
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,360
Nikorn,

116
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
I need your help.

117
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
For you, honey.

118
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,200
Thank you.

119
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,040
I was so shocked.

120
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,280
I didn't think
you'd actually risk your life

121
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,520
and shoot yourself.

122
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,080
You saw?

123
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,040
I happened to see while you and Pat

124
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,600
were fighting over the gun.

125
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,800
"I'll let you be the murderer
you so desperately want to be."

126
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,000
I was so impressed.

127
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,640
Good thing I was lucky,

128
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,280
so it only grazed me
and I wasn't hurt too badly.

129
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,200
And now I'll show you

130
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,840
just how worth it

131
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,160
your investment in me is.

132
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,200
For our happiness,

133
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,520
I'd do anything.

134
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,120
What are you doing, Mrs. Pat?

135
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,680
I'm better now, so I'm going home.

136
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,320
I'm afraid I can't let you.
It's Mr. Kobsak's order.

137
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Don't use my father as an excuse.

138
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,160
Aren't you Rath's lapdog?

139
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,760
Why would you listen to my father?

140
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,320
Mr. Rath doesn't want you to leave either.

141
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,800
I knew it.

142
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
Don't bother hiding
your leash and collar from me.

143
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,680
Let's just be honest here.

144
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,000
Pat,

145
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,240
how are you doing?

146
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,400
You're not dead,

147
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,240
so how do you think I'm doing?

148
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
You're still hurt. You shouldn't be here.

149
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,840
Can I speak to Pat

150
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,160
without any interruptions?

151
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,640
Pat,

152
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
I'm not mad at you at all.

153
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,000
I understand how you feel

154
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,240
and why you did it.

155
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,840
I didn't do it!

156
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,880
I think Pat's feeling uncomfortable
with so many people around.

157
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,280
May I speak to her privately?

158
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,960
Sitting in a wheelchair too long
can be exhausting.

159
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,600
How are you?

160
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,840
Is it easier to breathe now
that there are fewer people?

161
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,720
That day,

162
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,880
I really shouldn't have snatched
the gun from your hand.

163
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,040
Do you really want to kill me?

164
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,240
You think killing me
and then spending your life in prison

165
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,040
would make you happy?

166
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,080
Rath must've already told you

167
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,760
he wants a clean divorce

168
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,960
on our own terms.

169
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,840
You really think I'll back down now?

170
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,680
That's up to you.

171
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,960
If you refuse,

172
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,480
I'll tell the police

173
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,160
you shot me on purpose.

174
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,960
But if you agree,

175
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,440
I'll tell them myself that

176
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,680
it was an accident,

177
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,800
that I accidentally shot myself.

178
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,040
I don't believe

179
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,080
that all the evidence is gone!

180
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,920
So, you want this to be difficult?

181
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,880
Fine.

182
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,160
What are you doing?

183
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,160
Ow! Help!

184
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,360
Somebody help! Pat!

185
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,440
-Please don't hurt me!
-What are you talking about?!

186
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,320
She was really worried about you!

187
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,960
She insisted on seeing you,
even though she's still recovering.

188
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,320
Let's go, Ms. Dao.

189
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,080
You said you quit
to leave town and go home.

190
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,240
So why are you here?

191
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,400
I…

192
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,240
-What is it?
-I got a new job.

193
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,840
The pay is better,

194
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,720
so I decided to stay instead.

195
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,520
The one at the garment factory?

196
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,960
They pay better than Pat?

197
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,840
You know?

198
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,680
Do they pay enough
to buy a house in your hometown

199
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,760
and cover your parents' medical bills

200
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
just like Pat did?

201
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,400
Go back to your town.

202
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,040
And don't show your face here.

203
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,520
But what about Mrs. Pat?

204
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,000
Pat will be fine.

205
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
But if you stay here any longer,

206
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,480
you will be the one in trouble.

207
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,800
I'm scared.

208
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,960
If I don't do as he says,

209
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,280
who knows what could happen to me.

210
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,400
But part of me
was also so worried about Mrs. Pat,

211
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,360
so I didn't want to leave just yet.

212
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,560
You saw everything that day, right?

213
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,360
Yes.

214
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,560
Pat didn't shoot Dao, did she?

215
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,800
Ms. Dao pointed the gun at herself,

216
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,960
intending to shoot herself.

217
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,599
If you're worried about Pat,

218
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,040
you have to help her.

219
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,599
If Taweerath can threaten you,

220
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,800
I can help you too.

221
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,880
You just need to tell the truth.

222
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,160
I'll help Mrs. Pat. I'll tell the truth.

223
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,319
Thank you so much, Jaew.
Pat would really appreciate you.

224
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,960
Why did Pat turn off her phone?

225
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,720
The divorce you wanted.

226
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,560
Sign it, Pat. All the agreements.

227
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,760
Your dad agrees to this too.

228
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,240
Dad!

229
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,320
You want me to sign these
along with the divorce?

230
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,480
Do we have any other choice?

231
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,160
Or would you rather go to jail
for attempted murder?

232
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,720
I'll let you do anything,

233
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,560
but I won't let you go to jail.

234
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,480
Our family's reputation
would be destroyed!

235
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,360
Listen to your father, Pat.

236
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,200
With this contract,

237
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,400
I'll lose my house,

238
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,920
access to all my belongings,

239
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,200
and you get back all the shares.

240
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,840
These are your terms?

241
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,880
That's not all though.

242
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,840
What else is there, Mr. Lawyer?

243
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,160
All of Mr. Taweerath's debts

244
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,000
must be paid off
by Mr. Kobsak from now on.

245
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
And all your community property

246
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,680
will belong solely to Mr. Taweerath.

247
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,560
And you may not sue him following this.

248
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,640
I won't sign it!

249
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,840
Mr. Tham.

250
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,480
Where's Pat? I brought Jaew here.

251
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,760
She's with Mr. Taweerath and his lawyer.

252
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,600
Mr. Kobsak is there too,

253
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,800
so we couldn't get in to see her.

254
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,240
No wonder I couldn't reach her.

255
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,880
Do you know what they're talking about?

256
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
I overheard Taweerath
talking to his lawyer before he saw Pat.

257
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,000
It seems they're using

258
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,640
the fact that Mrs. Pat shot Ms. Dao

259
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,400
to force Mrs. Pat to sign a contract
giving all her assets to Taweerath

260
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,720
and agreeing
not to sue him after the divorce.

261
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,480
That bastard!

262
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,680
We have a witness now.

263
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,240
Pat won't have to sign
that awful contract.

264
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,120
Then let's hurry and bring Jaew.

265
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,160
Let's go.

266
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,320
What should we do now, Dad?

267
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,360
Pat,

268
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,480
sign it.

269
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,080
Don't you see
this contract is basically robbing me?

270
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,520
Don't you see Rath's true colors now?

271
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,400
Pat,

272
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,920
looks like you still don't get it.

273
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,800
I get it just fine. You're a scumbag!

274
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,840
Dad,

275
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,680
can I explain this to her by myself?

276
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,360
By all means.

277
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,320
Dad…

278
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,880
Dad? Dad!

279
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,680
-Dad!
-Pat!

280
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,520
Quit being stubborn.
Because if you don't sign it,

281
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,400
you'll be charged with
the intentional killing of Dao.

282
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,600
Not only that,

283
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,960
I'll sue you

284
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,840
for cheating too.

285
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,000
You're suing me?

286
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,600
If word gets out,

287
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,720
along with my evidence,

288
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,200
the news that only hinted at your name

289
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,800
but wasn't confirmed yet,

290
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,360
will soon be confirmed.

291
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Pat!

292
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
When that happens,

293
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,280
knowing how much your father
cares about his family's reputation,

294
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,840
how would he react?

295
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,720
And then your boyfriend,

296
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,200
that Tham guy.

297
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,520
After ruining his company's reputation,

298
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,600
surely he'll lose his position as CEO.

299
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Sign it.

300
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,240
Why are you all here again?

301
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,200
Didn't I already tell you

302
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,520
not to come here again?

303
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,800
But I had to.

304
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,920
So stubborn.

305
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,240
We're here to help Mrs. Pat.

306
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,080
Help?

307
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,080
Knowing you,

308
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,200
you'll just cause
my daughter more trouble!

309
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,160
But I have a witness who can confirm

310
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,080
that Pat didn't shoot Dao.

311
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,160
Who? Where are they?

312
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
She's here.

313
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,680
Wait…

314
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,600
Where's Jaew?

315
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,840
You know what Mr. Taweerath would do

316
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,560
if you break your promise.

317
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,480
I'll give you another chance.

318
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,480
Don't show your face again,

319
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,960
and you and your family will stay safe.

320
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,200
Got it?

321
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,120
Got it?

322
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,360
Sir.

323
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,360
Do I look like an idiot to you?

324
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,840
But what I said is true.

325
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,680
You're talking nonsense.

326
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,680
Are you trying to fool me?
Get out of my face!

327
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,840
How annoying.
You're like a bunch of flies.

328
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,360
Is everything finished?

329
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,720
Yes, Dad.

330
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,720
You're a little too late.

331
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,720
Pat!

332
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,120
It's over.

333
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,200
I already signed the divorce papers.

334
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,640
Do you really have to give
this house to Mr. Taweerath?

335
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,320
As agreed in our contract,

336
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,800
here's all the stuff you can take.

337
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,080
You must be Pat's servant,
carrying her things.

338
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,760
Take it.

339
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,720
Yes,

340
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,240
I'm her personal bellhop.

341
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,200
And you two

342
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,320
must be…

343
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,080
reptiles building a nest
in someone else's house,

344
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,000
right?

345
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,200
Pu!

346
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,960
Stop it, Dao!

347
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,960
Stop!

348
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,280
Let go!

349
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,440
Don't hurt Pat!

350
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,120
-Come here!
-Let go, Dao!

351
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,040
Let go!

352
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,480
That day,
I should have let you get hurt more.

353
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,640
But fine, I'll just do it today.

354
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,560
Don't make me go insane again!

355
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,760
Quit it, Pat.

356
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,040
Leave with your stuff,
and let's just end things here.

357
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,480
-Let's go, Pu.
-Okay.

358
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,480
Ms. Pat,

359
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,280
take a break if you get tired.
I can take it from here.

360
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,840
I won't get tired just from this.

361
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,680
It's my house after all.
I shouldn't bother anyone.

362
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,920
I'm already troubling you too much
by having you help me.

363
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,960
Don't say that.

364
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,040
Right now,

365
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,640
I'm no longer who I used to be.

366
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,800
I have almost nothing left.

367
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,800
That's just not true, Ms. Pat.

368
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,120
There are still a lot of people
who love and care about you.

369
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,280
At least I do.

370
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,360
I feel a lot better knowing you're here.

371
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,320
When I look at you,

372
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,760
it reminds me

373
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,200
that I must overcome
every obstacle in life just as you do.

374
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
We all have our own obstacles.

375
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,840
Just never give up.

376
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,640
I'll take out the trash now.

377
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,400
Here, I'll help.

378
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,880
Ms. Pat. Wait, Pat!

379
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,880
Wait.

380
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,480
Why? I want to see Pat.

381
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,040
But…

382
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,760
Ms. Pat! Ms. Pat!

383
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,600
She's not ready to see you.

384
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,200
But I really want to see her.

385
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,920
People are keeping an eye on you two.

386
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,400
And the rumors
about you and Pat are still out.

387
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,960
Even if you want to help me,

388
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,080
hold my hand, or cheer me up,

389
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,360
in the eyes of those who believe the news,

390
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,600
even just seeing us holding hands,

391
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
they'll think we're having an affair.

392
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,000
I guess so.

393
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,720
I didn't think it through.

394
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,120
Ms. Pat!

395
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,120
If you need any help,

396
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,160
just let me know anytime.

397
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,840
I'd help you with anything.

398
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,680
Please give me some time.

399
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,840
Bro,

400
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,600
I think Pu's right.

401
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,800
If you went to see Ms. Pat now
and someone saw you,

402
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,480
you'd just help confirm that dumb rumor.

403
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,680
Isn't that the guy
who had an affair with Patchanin?

404
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,120
Yeah.

405
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,680
So Pat's really divorced Rath now, right?

406
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,920
I'm also talking to the higher-ups
about the news regarding me and Pat.

407
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
When such news gets out,

408
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,640
they'll surely remove her
from the Star Sea committee.

409
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,600
Um… Dao, I have to hang up now.

410
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,960
Mr. Tham.

411
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,680
I heard the news about you and Ms. Pat,

412
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,440
about embezzling from the acting school.

413
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,240
But I have evidence.

414
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,880
The false evidence?

415
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,440
False evidence?

416
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,840
What do you mean?

417
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,640
I happened to find more evidence.

418
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,680
You said on the news
that it looked a lot like Ms. Pat's.

419
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,280
But it turned out to be under your name.

420
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,400
How did you find it?

421
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,920
I don't really know.

422
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,320
That's why I came to ask.

423
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,000
Because with this evidence,

424
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,320
it looks like you embezzled the money.

425
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,480
What should I do?

426
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,320
Today we're discussing
the final round of the contest.

427
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,640
As for the press conference
we canceled before,

428
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,600
we'll have to hold a new one,

429
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,560
and we'll announce the winner this time.

430
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,120
How should we decide who wins then?

431
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,520
About that,
we'll have to discuss it again.

432
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,840
But I don't think we can continue

433
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,440
when there are still false rumors
about a judge on the show.

434
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,160
Right, Ms. Jarinya?

435
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,440
Right.

436
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,320
Since you're here,

437
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,160
I apologize for misunderstanding you.

438
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,560
I admit I was too rash.

439
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,360
When I got the false evidence,

440
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,160
I quickly held a press conference.

441
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,840
But… I really misunderstood you.

442
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,200
I already talked
to the higher-ups at the station.

443
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,560
Please don't be mad at me.

444
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,160
I'll help debunk the rumors quickly.

445
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,400
I'm relieved to hear that.

446
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,240
Now we can work together without worry.

447
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,960
Isn't that right? Sui? Yui?

448
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,840
Careful, okay?

449
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,200
Huh?

450
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,800
Dao…

451
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,000
You're still hurt. Why did you come?

452
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,080
I told her to rest,

453
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,800
but she wouldn't listen.

454
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,160
She wants the project to succeed.

455
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,600
You've got a great spirit.

456
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,600
Anyway,

457
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,120
please take care of her.

458
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,680
Call me when you're done.
I'll come pick you up.

459
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,400
Thank you.

460
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,600
Of course.

461
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,080
STAR SEA CHANNEL CONTEST

462
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,040
How did Patchanin still make it?

463
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,560
Can I tell you later?

464
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,560
Come, Dao.

465
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,480
Tell me if you need a break.

466
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,480
Here.

467
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,960
I'm fine.

468
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Have a seat.

469
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,040
After all the confusion from before,

470
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,280
there were suggestions

471
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,720
that we as the committee
will decide who wins

472
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,600
and announce the winner
along with the winner of the campaign.

473
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Sounds good.

474
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,320
I don't think it's a good idea.

475
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,840
The rules clearly stated

476
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,960
that the fans will get to vote.

477
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,320
But if we suddenly changed them,

478
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,440
the other sponsors surely won't be happy.

479
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,400
That's right.

480
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,920
If we decide this way,

481
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,400
the audience will think
that we rigged the results,

482
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,640
deciding privately
among ourselves like that.

483
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
If our show has an issue
due to false rumors,

484
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,080
that would be too silly.

485
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
In that case,

486
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,480
My company and I
will back out before the announcement.

487
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,960
Please don't do that, Tham.

488
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,920
Then, let's discuss again

489
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,320
which method would yield a better result,

490
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,040
if we should decide by ourselves

491
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,200
or let the fans vote.

492
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,600
Hello, I'm Ava Kantrakarn.

493
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,760
I'm 18 years old, 165 cm tall,
and I weigh 47 kg.

494
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,000
My talents are singing,
ballet, and playing the piano.

495
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,199
Hello, I'm Pu,
Chompunuch Pattara-Amornlert.

496
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,480
I'm 18 years old.

497
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,120
I weigh 40 kg and I'm 165 cm tall.

498
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,480
My talent is that I can cook any dish.

499
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,280
I'm a barista too.

500
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,480
Hello, I'm Captain Kriangkrai,
number three.

501
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,679
I'm 18 years old.

502
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,920
I'm 180 cm tall. I weigh 70 kg.

503
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,520
My talent is dancing.

504
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,960
You told me you'd just have me win.

505
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,760
But now I still have to wait
for the votes!

506
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,040
Well, someone interfered.

507
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,679
You're number two?
I'll buy you all my votes.

508
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,120
When you say buy, you mean with 200 baht?

509
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,800
Just save it for gas.

510
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,480
How insulting.

511
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,360
I'm not insulting you.

512
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,560
I just don't want to trouble you.

513
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,760
Let's let the fans decide.

514
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,960
Then I can assure you,

515
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,160
most Star Sea fans

516
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,880
will vote for you.

517
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,720
Are you Pu from the Star Sea contest?

518
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,280
-Yes, it's me.
-It really is you. Can I get a selfie?

519
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,960
Sure, of course.

520
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,320
Please note

521
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,560
that the last time was a misunderstanding.

522
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,240
There was no embezzlement.

523
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
What about the other rumors?

524
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,160
Thank you all.

525
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,400
Pat won't be answering any other questions

526
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,120
because Jarinya and Pat
need to be somewhere now.

527
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,840
Thank you so much. You may leave now.

528
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,760
Please leave. Come on.

529
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,800
Let's go.

530
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,680
Please leave.

531
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,880
Come on.

532
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,920
Please leave.

533
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,840
Please leave.

534
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,720
Please.

535
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,800
I debunked the rumors.

536
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,600
Consider our issue resolved, Pat.

537
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,720
Is it really?

538
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,120
Actually, the reporters should have heard

539
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,080
that you framed me.

540
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,400
And you're the one who embezzled money,

541
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,320
not me.

542
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,240
If we're talking money,

543
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,960
I brought it for you.

544
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,800
The money you told me to return
as soon as possible.

545
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,800
Please take it

546
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,880
so you can stop speaking of it.

547
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,480
Who helped you?

548
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,240
Was it Dao or Rath?

549
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,360
That's not important.

550
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,120
And I have something else important
to tell you.

551
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,520
Well,

552
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,520
the higher-ups

553
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,880
wanted to remove you
from the Star Sea committee.

554
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,200
You shouldn't be here.

555
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,360
I just wanted to see you,

556
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,480
see if it ended well,
the thing about you getting framed.

557
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,600
Thank you for helping me with that.

558
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,520
But I can't help you with other things,

559
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,680
and with how

560
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,200
You were removed from
the Star Sea committee.

561
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,640
They already called me and told me.

562
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,280
I just found out too.

563
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,800
I'm sorry.

564
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,240
No need to say sorry.

565
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,640
You've already helped me so much.

566
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,880
And everything

567
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,040
is like this because of me.

568
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,160
I let my anger get the better of me

569
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,400
till I lost control

570
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,320
and fell right into Rath and Dao's trap.

571
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,720
So I must accept the consequences.

572
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,840
Don't worry, Ms. Pat.

573
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,560
No matter what,
I won't stop till I get my revenge on him.

574
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,360
And I won't let you
face any bad rumors again.

575
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,160
I'll stay away from you.

576
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,440
You'll never see me again.

577
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,760
The voting is almost over
for the Star Sea contest.

579
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,600
We'd like to interview Pat

580
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,240
about how she shot Dao.

581
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,840
-Is it true, Dao?
-It's not true!

582
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,880
-It's not true!
-Come with me.

583
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,800
What is it?

584
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,720
NEXT EPISODE

585
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,520
You wanted to talk about something
that's not a personal matter.

586
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,000
Those who do evil things,

587
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,600
it ends the same for all of them.

588
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,680
All my clients called to cancel
their deal with me.

589
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,000
Then let me help you.

590
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,680
This is just the start.

591
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,000
Just wait till the day
you lose everything.

592
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,520
