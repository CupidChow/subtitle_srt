1
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,640
So do you care about Mrs. Pat,
or do you hate her?

2
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,920
Didn't you say you wouldn't
be soft-hearted for her anymore?

3
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,040
But last night,
you seemed worried about her.

4
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,880
You know…

5
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,320
In order to make someone listen to us

6
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,320
and do as we say

7
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,040
without any doubt,

8
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,920
what do we have to do?

9
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,840
What?

10
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Make them suffer the most,

11
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,000
be the weakest,

12
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,240
and then give them a hand.

13
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,120
This is the perfect time

14
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,000
for me to use her,
to get revenge on Mr. Taweerath.

15
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,360
So you're saying that
last night was just an act

16
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,880
to make Mrs. Pat let her guard down,
thinking that you helped her,

17
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,560
so that she would trust you

18
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,920
and eventually go along with your plan?

19
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,520
You're really bad, man.

20
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,960
I'd rather be a bad person

21
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,080
if it means that
the worst person gets their Karma.

22
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,960
That woman stole Fah's happiness.

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,560
What she had to go through

24
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,160
was well deserved.

25
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,120
But are you sure

26
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,760
that Mrs. Pat will agree to work with you?

27
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,680
She is not a fool, you know.

28
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,880
Mrs. Pat.

29
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,680
Were you okay last night?

30
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,760
I'm fine, Pu.

31
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,960
Thank you for yesterday.

32
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,440
Then let's see

33
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,000
if she will work with me.

34
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
Think wisely, man.

35
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,079
I don't want you
to go any deeper than this,

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,560
okay?

37
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,760
I had people search the entire bar,
but they couldn't find the kid's phone.

38
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,880
How could it be gone?

39
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,560
At the time, it was in my shirt pocket.

40
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,280
And how did Mrs. Pat act?

41
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,200
Nothing.
When she woke up, she seemed fine.

42
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,680
Just complaining about being tired.

43
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,000
Then it means the kid
is still afraid to tell her anything.

44
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,600
Anyway, if there is no evidence,
she wouldn't believe the kid's words.

45
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,800
Did you make your decision last night?

46
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,320
I haven't decided anything yet.

47
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,320
Why?

48
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't know exactly what you want from me

49
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,160
to make that offer.

50
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,840
You already know
the whole truth about your husband.

51
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,920
Are you going to just let it go?

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,440
Or are you going to stop him

53
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,320
from doing what he does to you
behind your back?

54
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,760
Women…

55
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,600
Women?

56
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
So what?

57
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,720
Don't women have the right
to take their time making decisions?

58
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,960
Don't you ever think about doing anything?

59
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
I don't think about anything at all.

60
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,800
Even last night,

61
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,360
I didn't know if you were sincere or not.

62
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,720
I don't want to think or do anything
while I'm still not in my right mind.

63
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,160
Then you should go back
and get yourself together.

64
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,480
Try to think carefully

65
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,680
and differentiate between
your current status as husband and wife.

66
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,880
Are you still important to him

67
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,600
or just useful to him?

68
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,520
That's why he's still with you.

69
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Then we can come back
and talk about this again.

70
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,440
Try to think carefully

71
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,600
and differentiate between
your current status as husband and wife.

72
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,840
Are you still important to him

73
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,560
or just useful to him?
That's why he's still with you.

74
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,880
Oh!

75
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,280
Mrs. Pat!

76
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,600
What's wrong with you, Mrs. Pat?

77
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,920
I'm feeling dizzy.

78
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,880
Excuse me.

79
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,080
Oh, you're burning up.
Do you have a fever?

80
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,640
Please sit down.
I'll go get you some medicine.

81
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay.

82
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,840
I had a suspicion

83
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,960
that you were sick.

84
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,360
I've noticed you look tired
for the past few days.

85
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,760
Hello, Mr. Rath.

86
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,800
Hi, Pat.

87
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,200
I went to see Ya,
she said you weren't feeling well,

88
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,000
so she wanted me to bring you some soup.

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,960
Pat.

90
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,880
I think you are really sick.

91
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,560
I think…

92
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,080
you should cancel your dinner
with your friends tonight.

93
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
I have to go out to a meeting anyway.

94
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,400
It's okay.

95
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,160
I will feel better
after taking some medicine.

96
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,280
I will order food from the hotel instead.

97
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,280
Since you're already here,

98
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,920
let's have dinner together.

99
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,160
Or…

100
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,320
do you already have a date with someone?

101
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,680
Actually, I do have an appointment,

102
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,200
but since you invited me
to stay, I'll stay.

103
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
Here's the medicine, Mrs. Pat.

104
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,560
Taking medicine
on an empty stomach is not good.

105
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,280
Why don't you eat something first?
I'll go warm it up for you.

106
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,280
Here.

107
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,680
You go call and order
at the address I gave you.

108
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,200
Tell them to be here before 6 p.m.

109
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,640
Go now, or we won't make it in time.

111
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,880
I'll give the soup to Pat myself.

112
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,160
Yes, ma'am.

113
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,120
Jaew went to order food,

114
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,120
so I brought soup instead.

115
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,440
Thank you, Dao.

116
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,080
Hurry up. It's warmed up just right.

117
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Eat some, darling,

118
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,280
so you can take your medicine.

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,280
I must be really sick,

120
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,760
that's why I feel
the soup has a foul smell.

121
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,440
Or maybe
Jaew didn't wash the bowl properly.

122
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,120
Or maybe,

123
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,120
the hand that held the bowl

124
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,360
was dirty and smelly,

125
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,920
so the smell stuck to the bowl.

126
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
I will go rest in my room.

127
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,000
I've been good to your wife.

128
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,920
But look at what your wife said to me.

129
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,680
She's been having mood swings lately.

130
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
I don't know what's wrong with her.

131
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,120
Please be patient with her.

132
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
Sure,

133
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,360
since I'm already here tonight,

134
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,080
I'm not going to ruin your wife's dinner.

135
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,600
When you're done with the job,

136
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,160
send the money to me as promised.

137
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,280
Then please pay attention to the child,

138
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,760
in a way that is worthy of
the money I'm going to send.

139
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,680
Pat is here.

140
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,200
Pat.

141
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,400
I brought Ava and Chat with me.
I hope you don't mind.

142
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,240
Sure,

143
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,560
the more the merrier.

144
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,760
Let's go.

145
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Oh, Rath.

146
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,000
Are you not going to the meeting today?

147
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,680
I already canceled the meeting.

148
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,440
I'd rather stay
and help you with the guests.

149
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,640
Good.

150
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,280
It's even better if you are here

151
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,840
because there should be
a lot of fun things this evening.

152
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,000
Uh, by the way,

153
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,600
have you been busy recently?

154
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,440
You haven't been to the casino--

155
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,320
I mean the golf course.

156
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,680
Yes.

157
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,000
Mr. Rath doesn't have much free time.

158
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,440
There's a meeting every day.

159
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,240
Well, something like that.

160
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,760
But you canceled it today
to come and be with…

161
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
all of us.

162
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,680
Wasting the whole day like this.
I guess you'll have to have a meeting

163
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,560
from morning until night tomorrow.

164
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah.

165
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,000
It seems like you care more
about Mr. Rath than Pat.

166
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,880
She cares about everyone.

167
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,800
Even with Mr. Tham,

168
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,560
she still cares about him.

169
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,080
Wow Dada, did I miss something?

170
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,320
What's going on between Dao and Mr. Tham?

171
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,080
Really?

172
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,040
Are you talking about me?

173
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,960
Please have a seat.

174
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,880
At the Star Sea contest,

175
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,360
I saw Dao and Mr. Tham.

176
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,240
They seemed very close.

177
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,080
Especially,

178
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,080
in the dressing room.

179
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,760
So I invited Mr. Tham to come as well.

180
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,760
Thank you

181
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,080
for inviting me to dinner.

182
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,560
I am very happy

183
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,240
to see you all again.

184
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,360
The gossip news must be coming.

185
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,160
And the initials will be in there too.

186
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,840
Wow, Aunt Dao, your ring is so beautiful.

187
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,800
I can still see the sparkle
of the diamonds from here.

188
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,280
Who bought it for you?

189
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,480
Directly to the point?

190
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,360
It's a secret.

191
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,240
Wow!

192
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,520
You're really good at keeping secrets.

193
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,640
Even though I'm your manager,

194
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,000
I've never suspected anything.

195
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,360
Pat!

196
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,680
I've never seen a real one.

197
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,680
It's so beautiful.

198
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,200
Oh, the diamonds are dazzling!

199
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,760
For Dao, it's just a ring to wear for fun.

200
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,080
But for me,

201
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,960
it's a wedding ring.

202
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,120
Is that the one
Mr. Rath used to propose to you

203
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,760
on the day of the award?

204
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,040
Exactly.

205
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,040
Mr. Rath…

206
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,000
proposed to me in front of the press.

207
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,640
The reason I'm wearing this ring today

208
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,520
is that I haven't worn it for a long time.

209
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,720
I'm afraid people will forget

210
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,880
that we are not dating

211
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,760
and got married openly,

212
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,920
not hiding in the shadows.

213
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,760
But sometimes, hiding and sneaking around

214
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,480
can be quite exciting,

215
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,080
especially for those
who are tired of the old,

216
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,320
bland tastes.

217
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,480
Then, those who enjoy that kind of thing

218
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,440
should drink plenty of water.

219
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,160
Because if they are sneaking around,

220
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,280
I'm afraid they might choke to death.

221
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,040
But maybe
he doesn't want it for the taste,

222
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,360
perhaps he wants it because it's free.

223
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Uh, I think we should eat.

224
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,680
Oh, good!

225
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm hungry now.

226
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,760
It looks delicious!

227
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,680
Tham! Tham!

228
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,400
It's a beautiful ring!

229
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,560
Your boyfriend
must have spent a lot of money on it.

230
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,560
It must be quite expensive too.

231
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,960
It doesn't matter how expensive it is,
what matters is who gave it.

232
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
He secretly asked to be engaged first.

233
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,520
Don't tell our father just yet.

234
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,920
You called, and I rushed here

235
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,680
thinking I would get some kind of answer.

236
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,600
So, this is your answer, right?

237
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,560
You don't want to work with me,

238
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,040
but you plan to use me
as a tool against Ms. Ingdao.

239
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,720
You were the one
who told me to get myself together.

240
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,960
Now that I'm fully conscious,

241
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,400
I'm doing my best

242
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,720
to bring my family back to normal.

243
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,400
This must be the way of thinking
for a conscious person.

244
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,080
Yes.

245
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,760
Because people who aren't conscious

246
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,080
will try to destroy
their own happy family.

247
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,960
So, am I wrong

248
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,040
to keep it
and not let anyone take it away?

249
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
If that's your decision,

250
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,360
don't expect me to be a pawn
for you to use easily.

251
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,200
And the things you took from others

252
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
will also be taken back as well.

253
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Whoever wants to take something, go ahead,

254
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,120
but I will never let anyone
take my happiness away.

255
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
The dishes are delicious today.

256
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,800
Agreed.

257
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,800
Well,

258
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,960
speaking of which, Pat and Mr. Rath
have been married for a long time, right?

259
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,680
That's right.
Didn't your anniversary just pass?

260
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
It's been six years, right?

261
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,440
That's right.

262
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,360
You two have been married for a long time.
Why don't you have a child yet?

263
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,920
Or do you have some problems?

264
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,640
If it were other men,

265
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,520
they would have found a woman
who could fulfill them a long time ago.

266
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,640
As for women with problems,

267
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,600
they shouldn't blame
their husbands either.

268
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,880
Oh, Pat. Don't take this the wrong way.

269
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,800
I didn't say it was you.
I'm talking about someone else.

270
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,880
But I think that

271
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,560
men who use this as an excuse
to be with other women

272
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,440
are probably just trash.

273
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,160
As for women who know he is taken
and still think about pursuing him,

274
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,440
I don't really know

275
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,160
what to call them.

276
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,320
I think you just said it to sound cool,

277
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,840
like someone who has no experience
with family matters.

278
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,360
I've seen many families

279
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,920
where the wives accept it.

280
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,960
Their families seem happy.

281
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,680
You are very correct.

282
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,720
People must know their own shortcomings

283
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,080
and learn to blame themselves
before blaming others.

284
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,440
Don't you think so, Pat?

285
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,040
Pat.

286
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,720
Pat…

287
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,720
what about Dao's food?

288
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,480
It's just in time.

289
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,880
It seems like there are a lot of guests,
so there wasn't enough food.

290
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So I asked Jaew to make some more.

291
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,000
Why don't you try it?

292
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,520
Wow, Pat.

293
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,320
You've prepared
only good stuff for us today.

294
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,520
The berries and meat are delicious.

295
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,240
Hello?

296
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
All right…

297
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,840
How is it?

298
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,800
The soup you brought me,

299
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,960
is it delicious?

300
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,160
In yours,

301
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
it was just house slippers.

302
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,360
But for me,

303
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,120
I use my favorite
brand-name shoes just for you.

304
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
What happened?

305
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,320
Aunt Dao, are you okay?

306
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,200
Uh, maybe…

307
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,800
is it too hot and burned your mouth?

308
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,520
I'm so sorry Dao.

309
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,760
Aunt Dao!

310
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Jaew.

311
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,240
Could you clean up the mess?

312
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,840
I think the soup is too hot.

313
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,560
Please continue.

314
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,920
Is that soup really hot?

315
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,840
You don't need to know.

316
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,680
You don't have to tell me.

317
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,920
I never thought
Pat could make you look like this.

318
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,720
I think tonight

319
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,000
definitely won't end here.

320
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,920
Let me take a picture and post it.

321
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,600
-So beautiful.
-Right?

322
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,160
Dao.

323
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,000
Are you okay?

324
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,840
Yes,

325
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,280
but I must excuse myself.

326
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,480
Where is Ava?

327
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,160
Uh, I think she's in the bathroom.

328
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,560
But don't go just yet.

329
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,320
I ordered a cake
from that famous shop that you like.

330
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,800
Let's stay and eat first.

331
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,120
That's right.

332
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,760
Should I…

333
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,160
cut a piece of cake for you to take home?

334
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,040
I'll take care of it.

335
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,040
Dao, have a seat.

336
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,240
Come here.

337
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,800
Then I'll cut the cake for everyone.

338
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,080
Good.

339
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,640
Thank you.

340
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,080
Did you throw up?

341
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,520
I'm so sorry, Dao,

342
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,800
for teasing you too harshly,

343
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,640
but to be honest,

344
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,080
I don't really like using such low,
dirty methods like you.

345
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,400
Did you just trick me?

346
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,840
Don't even think

347
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,320
that what you did to me will end here.

348
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,440
I don't plan to end it here either.

349
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh!

350
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,200
Pat, what are you doing?

351
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,200
I was just joking around.

352
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,720
I see that everyone is bored,
so I'm trying to do something exciting.

353
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,960
I think you went too far.

354
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,440
Did you do it on purpose?

355
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,840
I think it's better to calm down a bit.

356
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,960
That's right. Calm down everyone.

357
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,200
She was just joking around
like someone who pulls pranks, right Dao?

358
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,960
Exactly. Like clickbait content.

359
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,200
Yeah.

360
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,200
Pat is like that.

361
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,920
I don't mind.

362
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,200
If I have any content like this,

363
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,920
I'll come and try it on you.

364
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,880
Sure, Dao.

365
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,280
I'm always ready.

366
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,840
Give it all you've got, I like it.

367
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,360
What are you doing?

368
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Why did you come in here?

369
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,280
I should be the one asking you,

370
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,920
but it seems like that isn't necessary.

371
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,680
It's obvious that you're trying
to steal Mrs. Pat's stuff.

372
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,800
I caught you red-handed.

373
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,240
Let go of me! I said let go!

374
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,560
Let go of me!

375
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,320
Let go!

376
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,720
You have such a habit of stealing.

377
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,360
Even in Mrs. Pat's house,
you still have the nerve.

378
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,000
Do you lack something?

379
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,760
I see, it must be a lack of warmth?

380
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,120
A lack of guidance, right?

381
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,640
You!

382
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
-Ow!
-Come here!

383
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,880
-Come here!
-Stop it!

384
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,880
Let go of me!

385
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,400
Stop it!

386
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,280
What did you do to Pu, Ava?

387
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,600
You should ask that girl

388
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,400
what she's doing here.

389
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,520
That's right.

390
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,040
How did that kid get into our house?

391
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,640
Aunt Dao!

392
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,840
I asked Pu to help me in the kitchen.

393
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
But she came in
and stole things from your room.

394
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,200
When I saw her,

395
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,160
she attacked me.

396
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,000
You're such a blatant liar.

397
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,360
This kid really came in
and went through your things.

398
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,520
It wasn't me.

399
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,160
Ava is the one who did it!

400
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,840
I walked in and saw her,
so she went crazy.

401
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,080
And she even used the same old tricks.

402
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,040
Who would take a word from someone

403
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,080
as ill-mannered as you?

404
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,240
That's right.

405
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,160
She's just lying to get by.

406
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,640
There's no way
I would do something like that.

407
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,000
What are you doing?

408
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,160
I'll take a stubborn thief
like you to the police.

409
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,320
Rath, stop it!

410
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,880
If Ava didn't do anything,
I'll take her home.

411
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,800
Go.

412
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,160
Come here.

413
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,560
Let go of her!

414
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,520
It's because of how you are

415
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,920
that this kid could trick you.

416
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,800
You asked her to be in the kitchen.

417
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,480
If she wasn't here
to steal something valuable,

418
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,840
why would she be in here?

419
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,120
Or were you the one who let her in?

420
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,720
I sent Pu to find you.

421
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,080
So, it was you.

422
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,200
But this kid

423
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,000
came in and stole
something valuable anyway.

424
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,040
I was the one who looked through things.

425
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,520
I planned to come back and clean up

426
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,160
after we finished eating.

427
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,560
Then Pu happened to come after you,

428
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,480
so everything ended up like this.

429
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,360
Is that right, Pu?

430
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,680
Yes.

431
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,240
You can go now.

432
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,760
Then, I'll leave.

433
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,280
I'll walk you out.

434
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,760
Why did you hit me, Mom?

435
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,680
I knew right away that it was you

436
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,360
who stole their stuff!

437
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,080
It's a good thing

438
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,080
you didn't get caught,

439
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,120
otherwise it would have been
a total embarrassment!

440
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,880
But I said Pu was the one who did it.

441
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,000
Mr. Taweerath still believed it.

442
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,960
If you didn't have
your aunt to protect you,

443
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,840
who else would believe you?

444
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,600
Do you even have a brain?

445
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,080
Or there's not much going on
between those ears!

446
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,520
Why are you so stupid?

447
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,600
Like mother, like daughter.

448
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Did you just call me stupid?

449
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,880
Come here!

450
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,920
Mom, no!

451
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,480
Mom! Stop it!

452
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,679
Stop it!

453
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,679
Mom!

454
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,199
Ouch!

455
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,520
Why did you get in the way?

456
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,400
Are you satisfied?

457
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,440
Or if you're not,

458
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,880
you can take it out on me.

459
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,400
Since I've already been hit as well.

460
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,560
Well, she did something wrong
and still argues back to me!

461
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,320
How could I not get mad?

462
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,320
If you're still angry, you can leave.

463
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,520
Once you've calmed down,
then come back and talk to your kid.

464
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,040
If there's a next time,
I won't let you live!

465
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,760
Ava.

466
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,000
It's fine.

467
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,600
She will be in a better mood.

468
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,320
She's always like this, right?

469
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,920
Aunt Dao.

470
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,960
I'm so sorry.

471
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,680
I just wanted to look at her bag.

472
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,760
But when I saw it, I couldn't help myself.

473
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,320
Ava.

474
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,440
Listen to me.

475
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,120
If your aunt

476
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,080
gets married

477
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,480
and goes public with Mr. Rath,

478
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,520
whatever you want,

479
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,000
I will find it for you.

480
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,320
Don't worry about it.

481
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,760
You don't have to steal from others,

482
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,120
understand?

483
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,640
Yes.

484
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,680
Aunt Dao…

485
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,560
If Mom loved me

486
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,880
as much as you do, it would be great.

487
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,200
Shut it!

488
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,720
Where is my niece?

489
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,800
Inside.

490
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,560
Ava!

491
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,480
Hey, what did you do to her?

492
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,800
She's lazy.

493
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,200
I sent her to sell garlands,

494
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,000
but she only brought back a little money.

495
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,720
It wasn't even enough to buy food.

496
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,840
When she grows up,

497
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,360
I'll send her to work at a karaoke bar!

498
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,120
With a face like this,

499
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,520
I'm sure she'll make a ton of money.

500
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,640
People like you shouldn't be mothers!

501
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,800
Why?

502
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,480
Suddenly developed a maternal instinct
after your miscarriage?

503
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,640
You're yelling at me,

504
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,960
despite the fact that
you were also knocked up!

505
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,400
Even if I didn't know I was pregnant,

506
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,040
if my child was born,

507
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,760
I will take good care of him or her.

508
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,800
I surely won't do what you did.

509
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,880
I'll take care of Ava myself.

510
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,480
If I leave her with you,

511
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,320
you'll definitely use her for money.

512
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,480
As for you studying acting here,
I will find a suitable class for you.

513
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,600
But right now, our school is facing
an ongoing problem.

514
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,920
I didn't want to bother you, Pat.

515
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,400
But I have to talk about it.

516
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,280
What's the matter?

517
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,280
Our school has been open for three years.

518
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,120
The classrooms are old and run down.

519
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,120
We are losing students

520
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,800
because we don't have the budget

521
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,240
to advertise and promote our school.

522
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,200
So I think we might need
to increase our funds…

523
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,320
I was just about
to talk to you about this.

524
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,960
Here it is.

525
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,160
You know that Ms. Jarinya
is addicted to gambling.

526
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
If you give her the money just like this,

527
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,400
she will probably end up
spending it at a casino.

528
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,360
I already know that.

529
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,360
I want it to be like that anyway.

530
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,600
Don't worry, Pu.

531
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,920
Whatever I pay for,

532
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,360
I will definitely get it back.

533
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,280
Let's go. I will give you a ride.

534
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,080
It's okay. I can go by myself.

535
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,800
I'll stop by to see my brother
before work. Goodbye.

536
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,000
Whatever you want.

537
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,960
Stop!

538
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,160
Woah! Let go!

539
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,760
Let go of me! Let go!

540
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,720
Pu!

541
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,200
Ouch!

542
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,400
Go!

543
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,680
Pu! Pu!

544
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,280
Let go of her! I said let go!

545
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,520
Let go!

546
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,880
Help! Help me please!

547
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,720
Pu!

548
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,840
-Mr. Tham…
-Pat, are you all right?

549
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,880
Careful!

550
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,000
Hello, officer. Please help!

551
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,720
There are gangsters here
at TJ's acting school.

552
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,920
Go!

553
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,720
Pat, are you okay?

554
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,680
I'm fine.

555
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,040
Mrs. Pat, are you all right?

556
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,600
I'm fine, are you?

557
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,120
That wedding ring
that you are so proud of,

558
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,560
it used to belong to Fah.

559
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,720
Or do I have to die

560
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,000
before you believe me?

561
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,520
I've already sent all the clips
from the casino to Mrs. Pat.

562
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,800
Your image of a good husband is gone.

563
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,040
NEXT EPISODE

564
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,040
If you're willing to help,
whatever you want me to do…

565
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,080
You can go wait for me in this room.

566
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,240
Are you sure

567
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,840
that taking me to this room
won't cause any problems with your wife?

568
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,120
You hurt my feelings

569
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,560
and made me feel ashamed.

570
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,080
Please go ahead and have fun with her!

571
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:38,080
