1
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,920
Dao.

2
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,440
A gift basket from our crew
for your final scene.

3
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,000
You were amazing in the scene.
It made us cry.

4
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,600
Such a shame it's your last one.
Let's work together again someday.

5
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,520
Of course.

6
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Let's get back to work.

7
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,160
I can hold it for you.

8
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,480
Let's go change.

9
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Dao.

10
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
Could you put it away for me?

11
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,360
Okay.

12
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,040
What is it?

13
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,640
I wanted to talk about us.

14
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,840
But I don't think
she has anything to say to you, Pat.

15
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,560
Or do you feel guilty

16
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,040
and want to apologize to her

17
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,440
for sending her to jail?

18
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,800
I don't think you should though.

19
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,360
She wouldn't want your apology.

20
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
If it's about Chat,

21
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,040
I don't have to apologize.

22
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,960
You're the one
who sent her to jail on purpose,

23
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,880
not me.

24
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
But if it's about the past,

25
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,560
I want to apologize, Dao.

26
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,040
Is there anything else

27
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,600
I don't know about your past together?

28
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,520
Hmm?

29
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,360
Save your apologies.

30
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,760
I don't want to remember
the past or any nonsense.

31
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,960
Mr. Rath,

32
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,000
please tell your ex-wife to go.

33
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,440
I just want to go change
and get some rest.

34
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,720
You heard her, Pat.

35
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,280
Stop bothering her.

36
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,360
Or maybe

37
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,480
you're not trying to bother her.

38
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,360
Maybe you're trying to bother me.

39
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,960
I don't want to bother you.

40
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,560
But if it means getting rid of you,

41
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,600
maybe I do.

42
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,080
If you think you can,

43
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,520
go ahead and try.

44
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,280
Miss Pat.

45
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,400
I told you to stay away from that guy.

46
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,640
I wasn't trying to bug him.

47
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
I just wanted to talk to Dao.

48
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,400
You know,

49
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,520
when we were playing the final scene,

50
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,960
even if it was just the show's script,

51
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,160
I could feel it.

52
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,600
It was what she wanted to tell me.

53
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,120
Shouldn't you be happy

54
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,440
I'm dying?

55
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm not happy.

56
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,200
And I don't want you to die either, Kem.

57
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,400
Neither you nor I deserve to die.

58
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,800
It's too late.

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,880
I chose to walk this path.

60
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,840
The end for those who hurt others

61
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,080
<i>is being left with nothing too.</i>

62
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,920
No one can just
change their mind like that.

63
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,000
But at least,

64
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,440
I'm glad

65
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,840
you're seeing her more positively.

66
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Why?

67
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,840
Because now that
you're back to being yourself,

68
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,440
I don't have to worry you'll change again.

69
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,520
Well, you're the only one
giving me a chance.

70
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,880
But I wish

71
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,400
Pu would give me a chance too.

72
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,960
Because, besides you,

73
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,240
she's the only one

74
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,920
who I want to understand me the most.

75
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,880
If I have the chance,

76
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,280
I'll help you talk to her.

77
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,800
Thank you.

78
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
Are you starting
to understand Miss Pat now?

79
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,040
Who can really tell
what someone is thinking?

80
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,240
But she really cares about you.

81
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,640
You heard her.

82
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,240
Maybe that's
what she wanted Mr. Tham to hear.

83
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,040
I know you don't want to hate her.

84
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,280
Wouldn't it be better
to focus on the good things

85
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,080
she's done for you?

86
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,440
Stop being mad at her.

87
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,080
Got it?

88
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
That hurt!

89
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,800
Change your clothes and come downstairs.

90
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,960
I'm not going.

91
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,680
Come on, Dao.

92
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,640
We already talked.

93
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,840
You said you'd stop
being stubborn with me.

94
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,960
My lawyer and the sheriff
are waiting downstairs.

95
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,240
I'll never get
a marriage certificate with you.

96
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,240
You think I want it that bad?

97
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,120
If it weren't for the money problems
from my old cases,

98
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,440
I wouldn't need you
to help me manage my debt

99
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,320
or rebuild my credibility.

100
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,000
Come to think of it,

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,120
naturally, a husband and wife

102
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,160
should always support each other,

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,880
right?

104
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,280
So that's why I'm still useful to you,

105
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,680
isn't it?

106
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,360
If my company's shareholders

107
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,120
hadn't sued me,

108
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,640
you'd be useless to me now.

109
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
I'll go wait downstairs.

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,480
Don't keep us waiting.

111
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,400
You're really pretty in that dress, Dao.

112
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,920
So fitting for our special day.

113
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,440
Shall we get started?

114
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,440
Congratulations, you two.

115
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,280
Here you go.

116
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,520
And this

117
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,440
is the contract
for after the marriage certificate.

118
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,760
Thank you so much, honey.

119
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,200
- Could you take a photo for me?
- Sure.

120
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,040
Please look into the camera.

121
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,720
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

122
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,240
One, two, three.

123
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,080
One more.

124
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,320
Smile a little.

125
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,000
Smile so everyone can see

126
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,680
how happy you are.

127
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,320
I know you're a professional actress.

128
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,880
Smile.

129
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,040
Please look into the camera.
One, two, three.

130
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,840
One more.

131
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
Okay.

132
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,800
- Thank you.
- Of course.

133
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,800
Check this out.

134
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,080
SUPERSTAR GETS MARRIED PRIVATELY
RIGHT AFTER SHOOT WRAPS

135
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,640
Dao registered her marriage
with Taweerath.

136
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,680
Yes.

137
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,320
She knows

138
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,160
he has all those debts

139
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
and lawsuits.

140
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,560
Why did she still marry him?

141
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,320
He probably forced her
to get a marriage certificate

142
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,840
to rebuild his credibility,

143
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,560
so he won't get removed
from management in his company.

144
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,200
And he's probably

145
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,000
making Miss Ingdao
take the fall for his debts,

146
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,360
just like when he tricked you

147
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,920
and had Fah take the blame
for all his crimes.

148
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,960
So Dao's the victim instead of me.

149
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,640
Congratulations, Dao.

150
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,880
Thank you.

151
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,520
Hey, you should've told us.

152
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,520
We could've been your bridesmaids
for the ceremony.

153
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,560
Well, Mr. Rath and Dao

154
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,280
wanted it to be
private, small, and simple.

155
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,800
That's why they didn't invite anyone.

156
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,240
But can a superstar like you

157
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,400
really skip having a wedding reception?

158
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,480
Yeah.

159
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,920
Aw.

160
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,960
You just got married.

161
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,680
Why do you look so unhappy?

162
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,240
Or are you stressed about Pat and Pu,

163
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,720
because they think

164
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,080
you're involved in Pu's brother's death?

165
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,360
I'm not worried about that at all.

166
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,600
Because all the blabbermouths

167
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,640
talking without evidence

168
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,560
will get sued by me.

169
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,720
No apology gifts.

170
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,080
I only accept cash.

171
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,840
If it's not about the case,

172
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,800
then maybe something else is bugging you?

173
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,600
Your drama is doing great, though.

174
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,240
You're lucky with work and lucky in love.

175
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,560
Nothing should be bugging you.

176
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,320
Well, it must be about Luktan.

177
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,640
Oops.

178
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,320
Dao, I--

179
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,160
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say it.

180
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,920
But someone told me a rumor.

181
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,320
They saw Mr. Rath

182
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,360
going out with a girl
named Luktan. She's Ava's friend.

183
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,000
Oh, and there's that Pu kid too.

184
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Hey, Rati.

185
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,280
You're talking crazy.
All this might not even be true.

186
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,320
Hey!

187
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,480
Think of her feelings a little.

188
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,920
I've got a headache.
I should go get some rest.

189
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,920
Show yourselves out.

190
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,040
Aunt Dao.

191
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,440
You married Uncle Rath,

192
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,360
but why don't you look happy at all?

193
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,480
Is it because of me?

194
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,880
Of course not.

195
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,160
Or is it about Luktan,

196
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,440
like Rati said?

197
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,000
If that's the case,

198
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,320
I'll go ask her myself.

199
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,160
And if it's true,

200
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,360
I'll see her

201
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,079
as a backstabbing friend.
I'll cut ties with her. As for Pu--

202
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,240
Ava,

203
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,760
don't worry about me.

204
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,720
I don't care
about that kind of stuff anymore.

205
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,119
I'm just annoyed with those three.

206
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,640
Take them for example, Ava.

207
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,800
They're hypocrites.

208
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,520
No matter how close you are to them,

209
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,160
in reality,

210
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,200
they're not ready
to truly congratulate you

211
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,880
or be happy for you

212
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,600
when they see you happy

213
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,400
or succeed.

214
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,040
All they do is wait
to add insult to injury

215
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,880
when they see you fail or get hurt.

216
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,240
Luktan is no different.

217
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,600
Don't get too close to her.

218
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,920
Try to stay away from her.

219
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,480
Okay.

220
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,800
<i>I'm here.</i>

221
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Please hurry over, Mr. Rath.

222
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
What can I get for you?

223
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,080
Ah, you're a celebrity!

224
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,960
Can I get one Blue Mocktail please?

225
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,400
Okay.

226
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Just a moment please.

227
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,480
Why are you so late? You said you'd hurry.

228
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,280
Hey,

229
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,080
what's the matter?
You were never this upset.

230
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,080
I'm about to get ditched.
How could I smile?

231
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,240
I don't live under a rock.

232
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,840
I know you registered
your marriage with Mrs. Dao.

233
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,480
I was just doing it for my own benefit.

234
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,760
I never said I'd ditch you.

235
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,560
Who would believe you?

236
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,120
I'd better pursue my acting career

237
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,200
<i>so that if I do get ditched,</i>
<i>I'll still have my money and my fame.</i>

238
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,240
<i>You have to help me like you promised.</i>

239
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,720
How famous do you want to be?

240
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,800
More famous than Pu.

241
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,240
<i>And Ava.</i>

242
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
<i>Or just as much as Mrs. Ingdao</i>

243
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,920
<i>and Miss Patchanin would be nice too.</i>

244
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,880
Don't say you can't help me.

245
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,480
I helped you with so much.

246
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,040
<i>I gave the drugs to Ava like you asked,</i>
<i>till she's so far gone now.</i>

247
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,720
<i>I helped you find customers</i>
<i>in the industry too.</i>

248
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,480
I helped you make
both money and connections.

249
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,800
Mr. Rath gave Ava the drugs?

250
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,840
It's the exact same logo, bro.

251
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,360
I think this is it.

252
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,600
How can I help you?

253
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,280
I have a few questions.

254
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,840
I have a friend named Pumeth.

255
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,720
Has he ever been here to use your service?

256
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,160
May I?

257
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,800
Sir,

258
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
please keep it for me.

259
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,880
If you'll excuse me.

260
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,200
TWENTY-FOUR HOUR STORAGE

261
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,680
Yes, he uses our storage here.

262
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,800
He asked about
our security measures in depth.

263
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,560
To access the storage,

264
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,280
you'd need a key card
that belongs to the renter.

265
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,400
Like this one?

266
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,320
TWENTY-FOUR HOUR STORAGE

267
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,240
Exactly! This one.

268
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,960
Officer,

269
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,560
I know what the key card is for now.

270
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,160
I can't stay with you tonight.

271
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,800
I've got important stuff to do.
I'll come see you when I'm done.

272
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,720
Okay.

273
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,880
Why am I so dizzy?

274
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,280
You think you're the only smart one?

275
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,560
Why are you so late? You said you'd hurry.

276
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,880
What's the matter?
You were never this upset.

277
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,160
Mr. Rath--

278
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,120
You must have drunk a lot.

279
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,240
I'll walk you to my car.

280
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,760
Thank you so much, Pat, Dao.

281
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,400
The feedback for the drama is really good.

282
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,440
The ratings are doing well too.
It's all thanks to you both

283
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,960
for agreeing to star in my show.

284
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,960
It's a reunion for you and Dao
to work together again.

285
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,240
I should be the one thanking you

286
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,200
for giving me the chance
to star in a drama again.

287
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,120
And,

288
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,320
with Dao, too.

289
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,240
The higher-ups even told me

290
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,760
they'd nominate you both
for the big award.

291
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,240
I'll have to back out.

292
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,840
Just nominate Dao alone.

293
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,640
Hmm,

294
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,040
it's just a nomination.

295
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,400
I don't think you have to back out.

296
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,720
Or,

297
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,280
are you afraid you won't win?

298
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,120
Is that why you're backing out?

299
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,440
You can think that if you want.

300
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,400
I just don't want
to compete with anyone anymore.

301
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,960
If I could turn back time,

302
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,120
I wouldn't even want to win.

303
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,120
I'd rather not win
at someone else's expense.

304
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,760
I hope you like this place.

305
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,200
It's the best spot
to send you to join your brother.

306
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,960
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANYMORE.
GOODBYE, MISS PAT.

307
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,800
Som, I have to be somewhere.

308
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,480
If you'll excuse me.

309
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,400
Oh?

310
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,640
Wait…

311
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,920
Wha--

312
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,360
Pat?

313
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,320
Pat!

314
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,760
Som, since she left,
I think I should get going too.

315
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,680
Wha-- Dao?

316
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,520
Oh dear, we haven't even ordered food yet.

317
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,160
Pu, where are you?

318
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,640
Why are you doing this to yourself?

319
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,760
Miss Pat, I'm not taking my own life.

320
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,440
Mr. Rath kidnapped me.

321
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,000
I don't know
what he's planning to do to me,

322
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,360
but

323
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,120
I happened to find out
he's been giving drugs to Ava.

324
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,000
He sold drugs to a lot of celebrities too.

325
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,720
He really did all that?

326
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,680
But he'd even do that to Ava.

327
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,320
Pu, where are you now?

328
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,080
I'm at the back of a factory, MACM.

329
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,200
Okay, Pu. I'll hurry over.

330
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,400
Don't hang up yet.

331
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,320
Pat!

332
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,120
Dao.

333
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,600
I heard everything.

334
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,800
Are you going to go help Pu?

335
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,640
This doesn't concern you.

336
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,200
What can you do if you go alone?

337
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,400
Only I can help you now.

338
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,640
Pu,

339
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,200
Dao and I are coming to help.

340
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,720
Wait for us.

341
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,960
Hey, Dao.

342
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,600
How can I be sure
you're not with any other girls?

343
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,320
So after we registered our marriage,

344
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,080
you're acting like a wife,
keeping tabs on her husband?

345
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,080
Even if I unwillingly
registered our marriage,

346
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,800
I don't like people
talking about me behind my back,

347
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,480
saying I'm stupid, living blindly,

348
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,600
while you're out with other women.

349
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,000
But I'm not!

350
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,280
I just have something important to do.

351
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,200
It's late, and you're still not home.

352
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,800
That's what you have to say?

353
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,360
<i>I'm not some naive wife</i>
<i>who believes your every word.</i>

354
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,520
Do something to make me trust you.

355
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Here. See?

356
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,240
Do you think I'd be meeting a girl here?

357
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,440
Quit being so needy. I've got work to do!

358
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
Rath really is where Pu said.

359
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,280
You have to hurry, Pat.

360
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,280
Pu, buy me some time.

361
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,640
I'm on my way.

362
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,640
Okay, Miss Pat.

363
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,240
PATCHANIN

364
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,160
Pu? Pu!

365
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,000
Pu!

366
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,200
It disconnected.

367
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,080
I think Rath found out

368
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,280
Pu's talking to you.

369
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,920
Where are you going?!

370
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,120
Let go!

371
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,240
- Where are you going?!
- Let me go

372
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,360
- No!
- Let me go!

373
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,360
Where are you going?

374
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,800
Stop!

375
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,640
Stop!

376
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,040
So, you like playing cat and mouse?

377
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,840
Come here!

378
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,680
Thank you both

379
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,600
for finding us important evidence.

380
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,880
Mr. Pumeth rented the storage unit
to keep all the evidence.

381
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,440
What's the evidence?

382
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,520
It's proof of
Mr. Taweerath's various crimes.

383
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,800
There's also evidence
related to Mr. Kobsak's death.

384
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,760
Even though parts of the audio
and video are missing,

385
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,120
it's very clear

386
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,240
that it was Taweerath's doing,

387
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,800
with Mr. Pumeth helping him.

388
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,720
If you'll excuse me.

389
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,360
Tomorrow, the headlines
will tell the story

390
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,280
of an actress who killed herself

391
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,840
after being depressed

392
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,320
because her brother fell from a building.

393
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,160
So many people will feel sorry for you.

394
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,560
Where are you going? Come here!

395
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,720
Get up!

396
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,280
- Stay still!
- Get off me!

397
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,040
Stop it, Rath!

398
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,560
Miss Pat, don't. He has a gun!

399
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,800
Stay back, Pat.

400
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,880
A scumbag like you

401
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,040
doesn't deserve to live anymore.

402
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,200
Miss Pat!

403
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,040
Dao.

404
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,880
Come on.

405
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,600
Stay still!

406
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,520
You did great.

407
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,480
You were fooling Miss Pat after all.

408
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,520
I thought you'd changed

409
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,360
that you followed her here to help me.

410
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,280
Why would I help you?

411
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,480
I'll do whatever it takes to survive.
Of course I'd choose that.

412
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,480
He's never been sincere with you.

413
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,400
He's been using you,
and yet you'll still help him?!

414
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,240
I guess you don't understand

415
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,080
what "mutual benefit" means.

416
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,120
That's my wife.

417
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,440
I knew I chose right.

418
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,760
How's everything, bro?

419
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
Miss Pat's not picking up.

420
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,800
It's important too, Mr. Kobsak's case.

421
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,760
She needs to know.

422
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,200
I'll call again.

423
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,840
Yes, this is Tham speaking.

424
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,400
What?

425
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,480
Okay, I'll hurry over.

426
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,440
What happened?

427
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,320
Bro!

428
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
What do you plan to do with her?

429
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,080
This kid knows too much.

430
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,840
I'll have to make it look like a suicide.

431
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,400
As for Pat,

432
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,920
I got rid of Mr. Kobsak first.

433
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,159
Now it's time
I send his daughter to join him.

434
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,520
You killed her father?

435
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,320
Yeah, I killed him!

436
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,680
Confused, aren't you?

437
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,560
Dao!

438
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,440
Confused yet?

439
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,960
Miss Pat…

440
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,680
Pat!

441
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,120
Finally,

442
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,720
I get to hear the murderer confess

443
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,840
that he killed my father with my own ears.

444
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,840
You admitted it yourself, Rath.

445
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,520
So you were working together

446
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,200
to trick me?

447
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,680
I need to tell you the truth

448
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,240
about one thing.

449
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
About

450
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,360
Mr. Kobsak's death.

451
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,200
What are you saying?

452
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,440
On the day he was shot,

453
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,240
I was there.

454
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,080
Dao?

455
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,480
But I didn't kill him.

456
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,080
Rath did.

457
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,800
I was really angry

458
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,320
and hated you and your dad so much,

459
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,000
but I never wanted anyone to die.

460
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,000
Why are you telling me this now?

461
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,560
Because this is our last chance

462
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,240
to make Rath confess everything

463
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,120
and send him to jail,

464
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,520
once and for all.

465
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,040
I'll handle this.

466
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,200
We're risking Pu's life.

467
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,080
If you trust me,

468
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,240
I promise

469
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,440
we can keep everyone safe

470
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,040
from a scumbag like him.

471
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,680
Dao, Pat,

472
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,600
calm down. I can explain.

473
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,280
I… I…

474
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,920
Rath, wait!

475
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,720
Trying to betray me?

476
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,960
- Get off!
- Get off me!

477
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,720
You!

478
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,880
Stop, Rath!

479
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
I've already called the police.

480
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,240
Turn yourself in
and confess all your crimes!

481
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,680
In your dreams.

482
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,520
Don't think I won't shoot you.

483
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,680
You'd really dare
shoot your ex-husband, Pat?

484
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,360
<i>I have my own house now.</i>

485
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,760
<i>I want to give this house back to you.</i>

486
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,440
Thank you, Dao.

487
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,160
There's something I've been wanting to do,

488
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,040
<i>and I planned to do it</i>

489
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,960
<i>as soon as I got my house back.</i>

490
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,040
<i>Pat and Dao are birds of a feather.</i>

491
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,680
<i>Till now,</i>

492
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,560
I still haven't heard from Mr. Rath.

493
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,560
Don't worry about us.

494
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,560
You two should worry about yourselves.

495
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,640
<i>And the T-Star Award</i>
