1
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,320
How did you get here?

2
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,240
Chompunuch told me

3
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,320
you might be here,

4
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,960
at your mom's old house.

5
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,400
I lived here since I was little,

6
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,880
when my grandparents were still alive.

7
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,400
But after my mom

8
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,080
and grandparents passed,

9
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,760
I rarely came back.

10
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,800
Even Rath doesn't know about this house.

11
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,360
You must trust Chompunuch a lot.

12
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,520
In our lives,

13
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,040
there should be someone
we can trust completely,

14
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,920
don't you think?

15
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,880
I'm so hungry.

16
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
Are you?

17
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,720
Ooh.

18
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,960
Let me have a taste.

19
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,560
This is all I can make here.
Can you eat it?

20
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,920
I don't expect it to be anything fancy
like that dinner I had at your house.

21
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,320
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
I pressured you too hard.

23
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,080
I got to thinking,

24
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,840
when you're at a crossroads in life,

25
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,200
you should have time to decide
what's best for you

26
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,440
because it will affect your whole life.

27
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,920
I should understand that about you.

28
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,399
Sometimes I wonder

29
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
if you genuinely want to help me

30
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,280
or if you see me as a tool.

31
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,560
But whatever. No matter what you think,

32
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,480
I've already decided

33
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,480
to deal with everything myself.

34
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,360
Keep eating.

35
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,400
Looks like you're a lot happier.

36
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,880
I am.

37
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,680
I don't want to be sad for long.

38
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,560
I have a lot more to deal with.

39
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,560
PUMETH

40
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,760
He's called you many times.

41
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,640
Won't you answer?

42
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,240
Yes, Pumeth?

43
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,360
Mrs. Pat, Mr. Rath got in an accident.

44
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,760
Excuse me?

45
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,840
How's he doing?

46
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,520
He hasn't woken up yet.

47
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,280
What happened?

48
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,960
When you left
and no one could contact you,

49
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,240
he drove out to find you himself.

50
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,200
He looked really troubled.

51
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,560
He must have been so worried about you
that he didn't see the car coming,

52
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,120
so he had an accident.

53
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,360
He was in serious condition
when he got here.

54
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,720
You should eat

55
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,040
so you can take the medicine.

56
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,880
Pat.

57
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,280
I…

58
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,400
You shouldn't talk yet.

59
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,040
I can't eat

60
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,520
if I don't get to talk to you.

61
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,440
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,680
Especially during my brush with death,

63
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,200
I came to realize

64
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,000
how bad my actions were

65
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,480
and who I love the most.

66
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,640
Rath.

67
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,920
Why are you here?

68
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,480
And why can't I visit you?

69
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,480
Did someone forbid it?

70
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,480
No one did.

71
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,880
I just don't want you here.

72
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,440
You should go.

73
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,120
Why would you do this to me?

74
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,160
This is probably for the best, Dao.

75
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,800
It may be the best for you,

76
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,840
but not for me.

77
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
Fine.

78
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,200
You'll regret

79
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,560
doing this to me.

80
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,920
Rath is hurt this badly,

81
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,480
and you still say that?

82
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,280
Don't worry.

83
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,640
It's not just Rath

84
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,040
who'll regret it.

85
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
You'll regret it too.

86
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,800
Dao!

87
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
What?

88
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,040
Are you coming to tell me you've won?

89
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,120
Won?

90
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,880
I never competed with you.

91
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,800
Why should there be a winner or a loser?

92
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,240
It's just you

93
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,320
who did something immoral,
stealing someone's husband.

94
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,800
I think you should apologize

95
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,640
and recognize your mistake in front of me.

96
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,840
You want me to apologize?

97
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,320
What about you?

98
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,600
Did you ever apologize
or recognize your mistake with me?

99
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,920
If you're talking about the past,

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,320
you were the one who made those choices.

101
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,000
When will you stop using the past

102
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,240
to justify your wrongdoings?

103
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,840
You never think
you've done anything wrong, do you?

104
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,800
No.

105
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,240
I don't see what I did wrong.

106
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
You think you're so noble?

107
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,120
At least I have a conscience

108
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
to not act immorally.

109
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,040
If people knew what you did,

110
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,240
do you think they'd still be on your side?

111
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,880
And those who are on your side now,

112
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,560
what's their reason?

113
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,280
It's fine.

114
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,880
One day,

115
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,960
I'll drag you down so you realize

116
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,560
that someone like you,

117
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,640
without your dad backing you up,

118
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,800
without your money,

119
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,760
without your fame,

120
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,240
someone like you

121
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,200
is just as worthless in everyone's eyes.

122
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,200
Go ahead then,

123
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,120
if you think you can.

124
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,480
All done, Dao. You're so pretty!

125
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,920
Stop it. Please start the interview.

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,040
I'll start then.

127
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,480
May I ask your opinion?

128
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
How do you feel

129
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,200
now that you're in
the final round of the contest?

130
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm happy for them

131
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
and also excited for them.

132
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Please stay tuned
to see who makes it to the last round.

133
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,160
What about you, Pat?

134
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,880
As for me, I want everyone
to give it their all.

135
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,240
Show us everything you're capable of.

136
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,760
Excuse me.

137
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,800
I have a delivery for Ingdao.

138
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,320
Did someone send you a gift

139
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,360
to encourage you before work?

140
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,480
Why don't you open it?

141
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Yes, yes.

142
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,160
Must be from one of your fans.

143
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,080
Want to open it?

144
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
Then I'll open it.

145
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
Yes, go ahead.

146
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,240
GO TO HELL

147
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,080
What's that?!

148
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,920
Who sent that?!

149
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
"Go to hell."

150
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,680
Dada!

151
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,800
Dada, I'm scared!

152
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
It's okay, Dao. You're safe.

153
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,760
Staff, throw it away!

154
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,960
Okay!

155
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,640
Who did this?

156
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,760
Excuse me,

157
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,760
who sent this?

158
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,200
-Mrs. Patchanin.
-What?

159
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,080
What are you talking about?

160
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,000
It's true. Even the address
and phone number…

161
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,760
It really is her.

162
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,240
Pat.

163
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,320
Did you have to do all this?

164
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,600
You want me to die this much?

165
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,320
This is going too far, Pat!

166
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,840
What are you talking about, Dada?

167
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,280
It's evident.
Even the phone number is hers.

168
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,440
-You expect me to stand for this?
-I don't believe she did this!

169
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,040
I've known her for ten years.
She would never do this.

170
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,280
She's not like you all.

171
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,040
Come on, then!

172
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,720
Is it true?

173
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,440
Did you send this to Dao?

174
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,120
That's not true. None of it is.

175
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,960
There's proof of your address and number.

176
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,840
How can you deny this?

177
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,760
How could you believe them?

178
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,600
None of it's true.

179
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,960
I've already told you this much.

180
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,320
I hope I won't see

181
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,880
any of you
writing misleading headlines about this,

182
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,480
or we'll take it to court!

183
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,680
Let's go, Pat. What a joke!

184
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,120
Are you threatening me?

185
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm not!

186
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,240
It must be true
if her manager is this angry.

187
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,880
Take lots of pictures.
This is going to be a hot topic.

188
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,480
Because of that day,

189
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,280
the higher-ups at the station
postponed the contest's press conference.

190
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,760
Just wait until this dies down,
and then we'll see.

191
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,000
But I already told the station the truth.

192
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,720
But the trends now

193
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,960
only involve your conflict with Dao.

194
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,760
It's stealing all the attention
from the contest.

195
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,800
And can you let Kiki know

196
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,800
not to get mad at the reporters again?

197
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,600
The angrier you look,

198
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
the guiltier you seem.

199
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,840
This whole situation

200
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,280
is really affecting our school.

201
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,960
Parents who were upset with the news

202
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,440
had their kids drop out.

203
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Suddenly, our income dropped.

204
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,640
We may need to find
more money to invest in our school.

205
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,600
This should be enough for now.

206
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,600
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND BAHT

207
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,200
It is.

208
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,120
Did you really contact me
to sell my product?

209
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,040
This place doesn't seem

210
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,560
like it cares about my product.

211
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,640
What I need

212
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,000
isn't your water purifier.

213
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,240
Then why did you ask me to come?

214
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,800
You used to be
Mr. Taweerath's accountant, right?

215
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,280
Wait.

216
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Let's talk first.

217
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,480
We should talk first,

218
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,040
Mr. Pruek.

219
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,800
This is my boss

220
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,840
who wants to discuss
Mr. Taweerath with you.

221
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,520
I quit a long time ago. I know nothing.

222
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,440
You're being charged with fraud, right?

223
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,560
I heard

224
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,800
you were tricked into taking the blame
for Mr. Taweerath's company.

225
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
If you help me,

226
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,800
I'll help you with the case.

227
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,000
This is all the information Pruek gave.

228
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,320
In all the bars and casinos you went to,

229
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,200
Taweerath is a major shareholder.

230
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
And there's about to be a new shareholder.

231
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,760
It's Ms. Jarinya.

232
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,480
No wonder

233
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,080
they were together that day.

234
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,800
Would Mrs. Patchanin know

235
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,840
someone so close to her

236
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,400
is partnering with her husband
in an illegal business.

237
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,160
No matter what I say now,
she won't believe me.

238
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,520
I won't get involved.

239
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,080
Why are you smiling?

240
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,080
Nothing.

241
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,760
I just wonder how long
you'll keep pretending

242
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,760
not to care and stay out of this.

243
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,320
You should stay away
from the school for now.

244
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,120
All eyes are on you.

245
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,160
I don't want you to be uncomfortable.

246
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,480
Okay.

247
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,680
I should get going.

248
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,680
Alright.

249
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,240
Good afternoon.

250
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,160
You have a delivery.

251
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,960
Who is it?

252
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,720
Just a delivery guy.

253
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,240
I don't know how
they knew you were here though.

254
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,880
What's up?

255
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,440
A copy of Jarinya's check

256
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,119
written for the bar we went to.

257
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,000
So many transactions.

258
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,319
Is this about

259
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,440
Jarinya's gambling addiction?

260
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
May I see the school's accounting records?

261
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,160
I'll think about it.

262
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,520
Pat.

263
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,760
So you didn't want me to come
and feel uncomfortable

264
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,680
because you had someone else coming.

265
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,400
Jarinya,

266
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,480
if you'll excuse me.

267
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,120
Remember how you challenged me?

268
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,880
Soon, you'll see for yourself.

269
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,800
Um,

270
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,840
why did you come see me?

271
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,840
To talk to you about something.

272
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,200
The checks you wrote for somewhere else,

273
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,200
the amounts match
those of the school's withdrawals.

274
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,640
Clearly, you embezzled money.

275
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,360
I… I--

276
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,800
I'm not here for your excuses.

277
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,600
I want the truth.

278
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,920
I'm sorry. I got addicted to gambling.

279
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,360
You're addicted to gambling?

280
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,320
It's my fault.

281
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,120
But I swear I've already quit.

282
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,880
After I clear this debt,

283
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,240
I'll get out of your way.

284
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,440
Can you really do that?

285
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,040
Of course.

286
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,240
Please don't press charges.

287
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,480
I have my parents to take care of.

288
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,720
Please consider our friendship.

289
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,800
Please forgive me. Just let it slide.

290
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,120
Sure.

291
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,320
I'll let it slide.

292
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,120
But you have to return all the money

293
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,560
as soon as possible.

294
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,280
Of course. I'll quickly return it.

295
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,600
Also,

296
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm pulling out my shares from the school.

297
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,320
-Mrs. Pat.
-Pu.

298
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,040
Jarinya knows I caught her embezzling.

299
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,720
She must've gotten desperate
and asked Dao for help.

300
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,960
And in the contest's final round,

301
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,640
Dao will probably come up
with a plan to help Ava.

302
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,800
I'm worried about you.

303
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,240
Thank you for your concern.

304
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,880
Be careful from now on.

305
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,800
Don't do anything risky.

306
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,320
You too.

307
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,520
The press conference
where everyone misunderstood you,

308
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,160
Dao definitely planned that.

309
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,160
I think so too.

310
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,920
But what I'm more curious about

311
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,280
is who's sending me all this evidence.

312
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,760
It must be someone who wants to help you
and get close to you,

313
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,560
so my only guess is Mr. Tham.

314
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,520
Are you mad at me?

315
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,800
Why would I be?

316
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Well, if you weren't mad at me,

317
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,280
you would've brought me proof
of Jarinya's embezzlement yourself.

318
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,480
You wouldn't have remained anonymous.

319
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,800
You misunderstood.

320
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,160
It's fine if you won't admit it.

321
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,640
I have to thank you anyway

322
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,040
for helping me all this time.

323
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,680
I just hate seeing you stay dumb.

324
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,960
But even if I helped you with Ms. Jarinya,

325
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,720
when it comes to your husband,
I can't make you any smarter.

326
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,920
You've never found love

327
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,760
and never married.

328
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,120
You'd never understand.

329
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,760
If I found love and it kept hurting me,

330
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,040
I'd rather not.

331
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,440
I probably won't take
this kind of job anymore.

332
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,840
This time

333
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,080
we'll pay you three times more.

334
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,960
And it's a private party.
They'll close the place.

335
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,080
Think about it.

336
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,880
Just let me know before the day.

337
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,320
Everyone is talking about you and Aunt Pat
whenever they mention Star Sea.

338
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,400
They barely mention
my name or the finalists.

339
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,880
So now,

340
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,640
what will happen to me in the final round?

341
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,800
Nothing has changed about the contest.

342
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,920
Just prepare well.

343
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,800
But will I win?

344
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,120
You know

345
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,000
that witch is also in the final round.

346
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,840
Plus,

347
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,040
she has Aunt Pat backing her up.

348
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,320
Either way, we have to be prepared.

349
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,600
We'll win regardless.

350
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,120
I'll ruin them both

351
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,600
at the same time, you'll see.

352
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,920
I finished early.
You didn't have to pick me up.

353
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,600
I didn't want to come pick you up.

354
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,280
But if you got hurt somehow,
I'd be screwed.

355
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,840
I'd lose my breadwinner.

356
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,120
Admit you care about me.

357
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,840
Who told you I do?

358
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,800
Fine, you don't.

359
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,440
It's good that you came
so I don't have to pay for a cab.

360
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,800
Wrong. You still have to pay for gas.

361
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,280
But you don't have to pay today.

362
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,320
Maybe later this month.

363
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,520
I'm looking for Mr. Chat.

364
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,760
What's wrong?

365
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,640
Are you Mr. Chat?

366
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,640
Yes Officer.

367
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,280
Why are you arresting me?

368
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,760
We'd like you to come down to the station.

369
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,560
-Take him.
-Please let my brother go.

370
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,600
Chat!

371
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,960
-Why though?
-Stop resisting.

372
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,800
-Pu.
-Chat!

373
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,640
What happened?

374
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,400
How am I going to help him?

375
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,840
Apparently, Chat was the driver
for an illegal delivery.

376
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,600
But that was long ago.

377
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,640
He just got arrested now?

378
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,480
The police said the case isn't over.

379
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,040
But someone reported he was the driver,

380
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,000
so they had to arrest him.

381
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,960
I'll have to find money to pay his bail.

382
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,160
I'll help.

383
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,360
You have money?

384
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,840
Of course.

385
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,560
But give me some time.

386
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,920
I'll have to ask my mom.

387
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,080
Don't. Don't trouble yourself
for my problem.

388
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,720
It's in the hundreds of thousands.

389
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,040
And I shouldn't trouble your mom
because of this.

390
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,000
Thanks for trying to help though.

391
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,960
Pu, wait.

392
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,640
We'll pay you three times more.

393
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,560
And it's a private party.
They'll close the place.

394
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,720
Pat.

395
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,800
Where are you going?

396
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,360
I need to talk to someone.

397
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,640
If you're filing for divorce,

398
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,560
can you change your mind?

399
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,120
You saw how much I love you.

400
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,120
Please give me one more chance.

401
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,560
I'm talking about a drama.

402
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,920
And I already told you,

403
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,120
I'll wait until you get better.

404
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,560
Just focus on your recovery

405
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,360
and don't walk too much.

406
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,280
The doctor said you need plenty of rest.

407
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,240
If you need anything,

408
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,720
just ask Jaew.

409
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,800
Why not you?

410
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,960
I'll sleep in the guest bedroom.

411
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,280
I want to suggest your name to the station

412
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,080
as the leading lady for my drama.

413
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,680
It will be big news.

414
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,280
Because it's you,
the real Queen of TV ratings.

415
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,840
But you have to make sure that

416
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,680
once you star in my show,

417
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,480
you'll stay on good terms
with your husband.

418
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,240
And who is it that you said
will have dinner with me?

419
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,360
That's him, Mr. Tham.

420
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,560
I'm asking him to sponsor me

421
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,360
because I need the location
to shoot my show,

422
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,960
so I invited you both to talk here today.

423
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,360
Is there a problem?

424
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,080
I should take this call.

425
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,920
Sure, Som.

426
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,720
You're still in the mood
to star in a show?

427
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,120
I'm just working a job I used to do.

428
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,240
I don't see a problem.

429
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
What about your husband?

430
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,440
The divorce?

431
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,400
I told you, I'm not deciding anything yet.

432
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,600
Haven't you heard

433
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,720
that hesitation will hurt us?

434
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,320
Hurt for being too slow
in thinking or acting?

435
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,880
If you want your personal revenge,

436
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,040
I won't get involved.

437
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,960
You have the right.

438
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,600
You sure you can't get involved?

439
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,880
After all, you're so stupidly
in love with your husband.

440
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,360
Mr. Tham!

441
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,040
Hey.

442
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,680
If you leave,
what am I supposed to tell her?

443
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,800
Tell her I left because of you.

444
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,440
You want to go?

445
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,600
Let go of me.

446
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,000
Pat,

447
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,920
Mr. Tham,

448
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,240
what's going on?

449
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,400
I sent you some money. Go ahead and check.

450
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,160
Just half of it for now.

451
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,880
I'll send the rest when we're done.

452
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,120
Today should be easy enough.

453
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,000
It's just the host
and some friendly faces,

454
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,520
along with celebrities' children.

455
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,000
Just don't make them angry.

456
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,520
They're about to arrive.

457
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Do your best.

458
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,520
Okay.

459
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,920
Help me bring food to their table.

460
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,120
Party hard you guys.
It's my mom's treat the whole night.

461
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,280
Luktarn.

462
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,200
Ava, come sit.

463
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,960
Sorry, I had
a little too much fun dancing.

464
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,960
The beat's too fire.

465
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,960
Bring a new one.

466
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Soda and ice.

467
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,240
There you go.

468
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,800
You must be tired,
walking around and serving everyone.

469
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,560
Since we know each other,

470
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,080
I really feel sorry for you.

471
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,960
So,

472
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,280
you wanna party with us?

473
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,520
Right, guys?

474
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,000
Woohoo!

475
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,440
Chug it all in one go,

476
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,560
then come dance with us.

477
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,040
You have to dance like this.

478
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,320
Go ahead.

479
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,120
Take it.

480
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,040
I hired you.

481
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,160
Sorry, I choked a little.

482
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,760
Are you trying to act innocent,
like you don't drink?

483
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,640
Bullshit. No one would buy that.

484
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,440
I didn't ask you to believe me.

485
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,640
Did you forget that you're still working?

486
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,680
I hired you to entertain us.

487
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,640
I can end this job now.

488
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,880
Dao.

489
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,080
If the committee knew you worked here,

490
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,560
what would they say?

491
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,600
Don't worry.

492
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,760
Everyone who came here tonight

493
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,520
came to have fun.

494
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,880
I wouldn't want to kill the vibe.

495
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,560
I'll promise not to tell the committee

496
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,200
that you work here.

497
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,360
Guys, don't tell anyone.

498
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,400
If you tell us not to talk,

499
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,560
then we won't.

500
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,520
Everything remains a secret

501
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,920
if you bring us a little fun tonight.

502
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,240
What do you want me to do?

503
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,200
All we ask

504
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,920
is that you drink with us. That's it.

505
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,240
If you drink it all,

506
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,520
I'll give you extra cash.

507
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Fifty grand.

508
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,720
Woah, Aunt Dao.

509
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,880
That's so generous of you.

510
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,160
Drinking just this much gets her 50,000.

511
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,040
Look, Pu. Even if you became a prostitute,

512
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,160
you wouldn't get this much.

513
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,120
Drink up.

514
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,960
Chug! Chug! Chug!

515
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,800
Chug! Chug! Chug!

516
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,800
No matter how badly I need money,

517
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,520
I'd never lower myself
for scumbags like you.

518
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,600
You think this would end so easily?

519
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,360
When we decide who wins the contest,

520
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,600
you'll be disqualified

521
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,080
because you'll be caught
working as a prostitute.

522
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,680
I do honest work.

523
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,360
I never did that kind of work.

524
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,240
Or will you lie about me?

525
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,600
Wow, you're actually smart.

526
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,760
You think everyone will believe
just your word alone?

527
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,000
Of course. Someone like me

528
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,520
wouldn't just say stuff.

529
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,280
I need witnesses and evidence.

530
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,560
But judging from your looks now,
it's quite believable enough.

531
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,080
Just a photo of me and your word?

532
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
I have witnesses too.

533
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,320
The guy who hired you.

534
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,680
He'll tell everyone

535
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,440
he hired you to be a prostitute.

536
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,640
Oh, and I also have proof

537
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,800
that he sent money
to your account to hire you.

538
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,440
This is enough to ruin your life.

539
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,920
What do you want?

540
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,960
The evidence
Patchanin will use for the divorce,

541
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,800
and the evidence she'll use to sue me,

542
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,040
I know you have it all.

543
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,440
Give me everything.

544
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,480
Decide for yourself

545
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,400
if you want to protect Patchanin,

546
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,840
who's not even related to you,

547
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,720
or to protect your future

548
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,240
and the future of your brother
who's in jail.

549
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,520
EVERYTHING'S TAKEN CARE OF.
COME MEET ME OUTSIDE.

550
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,160
You got it all?

551
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,920
Yes, all of it,

552
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,840
and the password too.

553
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,720
You're really not injured?

554
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
You think I'm dumb enough to have a crash

555
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,320
because I'm worried about Pat?

556
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,960
But at the hospital…

557
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,320
I bet you know

558
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,200
money makes everything easy,

559
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,960
like with the evidence in our hands now.

560
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,480
You almost disappointed me, you know that?

561
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,080
But…

562
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,040
you're not disappointed,

563
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,520
are you, honey?

564
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
Who the hell?

565
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,400
Grab her.

566
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,960
NEXT EPISODE

567
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,320
Trying to get away?

568
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,960
You can't contact Pu?

569
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,880
She must be in danger.

570
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,600
How could Jarinya frame you
for embezzling the school's money?!

571
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,920
What should your next case be?

572
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,200
How about assault?

573
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:54,520
To prevent things from getting any worse,
do not ever contact Pat again.

574
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,040
I can't even stand
living in the same world as you.

575
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,760
I've got nothing to lose!

576
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,640
