1
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,840
Then I'll have to refuse

2
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,120
your request to film here.

3
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
Oh,

4
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,200
but why, Pat?

5
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,680
We both

6
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,680
thought this place had a nice vibe,

7
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,800
so we wanted to do the interview here

8
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,800
and help promote your shop.

9
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,240
You could start taking photos now.

10
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,800
Okay.

11
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,120
And you're asking
about our lifestyle, right?

12
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,600
Right.

13
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,720
Didn't you hear? I said I refuse.

14
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,120
It's okay, Pat.

15
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,240
I know you're struggling.

16
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,000
As your ex-husband,
I just wanted to help you out.

17
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,320
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND BAHT

18
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,320
This is so you can have a nicer shop

19
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,960
without having to be outside in the sun.

20
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,800
Take it, Pat.

21
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,960
I can help you even more

22
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
if you just ask nicely.

23
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,080
You can keep your dirty money.

24
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,440
Pat,

25
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,680
you can't keep acting tough
with me for long.

26
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,480
I don't think she's that desperate.

27
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,000
She already escaped hell.

28
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,920
Don't try to drag her back there.

29
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,440
Why don't you stick your nose
somewhere else?

30
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,760
You aren't her husband anymore.

31
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,880
I can stick my nose wherever I want.

32
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,800
All of you, get out.

33
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,760
You too.

34
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,600
Miss Pat.

35
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,080
If you stay, I won't play nice anymore.

36
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,440
Rath, let's go.

37
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,680
You should leave too.

38
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,080
I'm closing.

39
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,120
I asked them

40
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,440
to take photos of everything

41
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,920
and send them to me.

42
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,240
I'll let you decide
what the headline should be.

43
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
Dad…

44
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,440
If Taweerath hadn't sent me this,

45
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,920
I wouldn't have known my only daughter

46
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,080
had stooped so low!

47
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,120
But it's not true at all, Dad.

48
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,880
There's probably a hot topic now

49
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,480
about how I neglected my own child

50
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,280
to the point
where she's struggling on the streets!

51
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,600
But to be fair, what I'm doing

52
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,480
isn't hurting anyone,

53
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
and there's nothing to be ashamed of.

54
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,400
Will you never realize
what you did wrong, Pat?

55
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,760
Will you never understand
how much we've lost?

56
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
I have to face all this shame

57
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,000
and bad reputation because of you.

58
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,840
So what good does having a child do?

59
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,680
That's because you never listen to me.

60
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,480
You never once listened to me.

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,400
You only listened to someone else

62
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,800
because you

63
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,880
see me as just a decoration to show off!

64
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,240
Pat, you!

65
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,040
If that's the case,

66
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
then we're no longer father and daughter!

67
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,400
I had them arrange the tables
in a special way

68
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,400
just for you.

69
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,200
Thank you.

70
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,320
I also have a surprise for you.

71
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,800
Is that for me?

72
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,720
The old owner can't retrieve it anymore.

73
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,240
So who else should own it

74
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,560
if not you?

75
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,800
The diamond is so small though.

76
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,120
Yes,

77
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
but…

78
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,320
now everything else

79
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,720
is all yours too.

80
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,040
Pat,

81
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
what are you doing?

82
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,320
I'm ending this once and for all.
And this time,

83
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,800
I won't miss.

84
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,560
What are you doing here?

85
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,760
Mr. Tham.

86
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,120
Did Pu tell you?

87
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,560
She's just worried

88
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,360
you might do something
that could hurt you like last time.

89
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,480
I almost did

90
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,800
because I really want them both
to get their Karma.

91
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,440
But I have to be mindful.

92
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,480
I won't let my anger take over

93
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,480
and make me do
something stupid like last time.

94
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,680
Even if I killed them,

95
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,440
I'd only feel satisfied for a moment,
but then I'd go to jail.

96
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,720
But no matter what,

97
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,040
I'll make sure they both get their Karma.

98
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,440
In that case,

99
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,320
I have something to tell you.

100
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,840
Here you go.

101
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,320
Thank you.

102
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,360
Taweerath is having a meeting
with Karanda,

103
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,400
Mr. Tri's wife.

104
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,760
You mean the politician

105
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,040
who's a former minister?

106
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,200
Taweerath's company

107
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,960
can buy up land
in good locations at a low price

108
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,880
because he bribes them
for information about land

109
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,720
that would be expropriated
for road construction.

110
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,280
And they're probably involved
in bid rigging for other projects.

111
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,280
Could I get a selfie with you?

112
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,080
I'm hooked on every drama you play.

113
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,080
Of course.

114
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,800
Just one more.

115
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,280
Rath always knows how

116
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,760
to use the people around him
for his own benefit.

117
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,040
Because he never truly loves anyone.

118
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,320
If his plan to bribe fails,

119
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
he'll just find another way

120
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,400
to get what he wants.

121
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,840
I'm sure you know this already.

122
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,240
Tomorrow I'll have Nikorn
get the car back from your shop.

123
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,560
You really shouldn't get involved
with that guy again.

124
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,800
You should have someone…

125
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,520
by your side.

126
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,640
And if that someone is me,

127
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,080
would that--

128
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,080
I'm home, Pu.

129
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,880
Don't worry about me.

130
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,440
And don't you have a drama shoot tomorrow?

131
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,000
You should go to bed.

132
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,560
You should head inside,

133
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,520
get some rest.

134
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,760
Yeah.

135
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,720
You should have someone by your side.

136
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,520
And if that someone is me…

137
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,000
No matter how good you are,

138
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,200
I don't want to get hurt again.

139
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,760
Ava, let's go do your makeup.
We're about to shoot the scene.

140
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,360
I'm not ready. I haven't had coffee yet.

141
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,640
Then I'll go get you some coffee.

142
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,840
Everyone,

143
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,360
this is

144
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,800
Mawin, the owner of Mawin Boutique.

145
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,760
I'm Ava.

146
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,920
Hi, I'm Captain.

147
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,560
I'm Pu.

148
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,800
Nice to meet you all. I'm Mawin.

149
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,520
Um, all these clothes…

150
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,640
Oh, these?

151
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,120
I wanted an actor to wear my clothes.

152
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,600
Mr. Director,

153
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,840
don't forget the clothes for the tie-in.

154
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,320
It's for…

155
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,000
Chompunuch to wear.

156
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,160
Me?

157
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,480
Yes.

158
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,880
Good luck everyone. If you'll excuse me.

159
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,080
It's done.

160
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,840
Thanks, dude.

161
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,760
Well, it's helpful for my brand too.

162
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
You know, that kid,

163
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,000
she's gonna be famous in no time.
Trust me.

164
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,240
It's good that I had her wear my clothes.

165
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,400
Clearly I'm one step ahead of everyone.

166
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,960
Anyway,

167
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,040
you've got a sharp eye.
Are you flirting with her?

168
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,440
Because you're helping her a lot.

169
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
So you know.

170
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,720
Don't tell my mom.

171
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,800
This perfectly fits the plot
of disguising yourself

172
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,120
to find true love.

173
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,760
Mr. Mawin.

174
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,840
Do you two know each other?

175
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,080
- Well…
- He asked me to model for him.

176
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,920
He said he owns a boutique too.

177
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,520
Sir,

178
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,480
I don't think I'm fit to be a model.

179
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,480
I'd better head inside
to deliver the coffee now.

180
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,680
I'll get back to work now.

181
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,080
Hmm.

182
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,640
Anyway, did you want to say something?

183
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,080
Oh, I wanted to say thank you

184
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,120
for choosing me to wear your clothes.

185
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,320
Ah, about that. You're welcome.

186
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,080
Please give it your all.
Someone's secretly supporting you.

187
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,280
I meant your fans. They're supporting you.

188
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Oh.

189
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,040
Anyway, if you'll excuse me.

190
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,440
- Okay.
- See you again.

191
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,240
You two, after you fight, the leading man
pulls the leading lady in for a kiss.

192
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,599
Don't actually kiss.
I'll help make sure you don't.

193
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,240
Okay, ready!

194
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,480
Slate, enter.

195
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,079
Don't worry, I won't.

196
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,160
Six, scene five, cut one, take one.

197
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,520
And action.

198
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,640
Akin, stay away from me.

199
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,880
Now everyone thinks that

200
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,480
I do everything for money.

201
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,800
Then just tell them

202
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,440
I'm happy to help you
without wanting anything in return.

203
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,480
But I didn't want it.

204
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,880
But I wanted to give it.

205
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,320
They actually kissed.

206
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,920
Cut! We got it!

207
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,800
Next location. Let's go.

208
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,560
I'm sorry.

209
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,680
It's okay. It's for work.

210
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,320
I should go change.

211
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,200
Jane! Jane!

212
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,120
Hey!

213
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,000
You came to see me?

214
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,800
Yeah, but I'm leaving now.

215
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,440
What's wrong?

216
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,000
Why do you look mad at me?

217
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,880
I'm not.

218
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,880
But you obviously are.
You know I'm working, right?

219
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,200
I understand you're working.

220
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,320
But I saw
you hold hands outside the scene.

221
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,520
You call that work?

222
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,080
Well, yeah.

223
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,920
Really, I don't need
to be answering your questions.

224
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,960
Then why did you follow me?

225
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,560
You never care how I feel

226
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,040
anyway, do you?

227
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,720
Why do you have to be so difficult?

228
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
- A supporting character?
- Yes.

229
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,920
A supporting character.
But she's the second oldest sister

230
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,720
who's both capable and smart.

231
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,000
There was a little issue
with the old project.

232
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,000
So I'm offering you
a new project that's even bigger.

233
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,320
You have to trust me.

234
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,080
I'd never tarnish your reputation.

235
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,640
It's good that you got a drama.

236
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,800
It will divert attention away
from the rumors.

237
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,960
Plus, this project of hers

238
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,200
is very big.

239
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,640
I was thinking I'd cast Pu too.

240
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,160
The role's great.
You'd both get famous all at once.

241
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Then, who would be the leading lady, Som?

242
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,840
The channel hasn't decided yet.

243
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,160
I'll need some time to decide.

244
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,920
I'll call you to let you know.

245
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,360
Don't take too long, okay?

246
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
Now if you'll excuse me.

247
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,480
I'll walk you there.

248
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,440
You.

249
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,800
When will you quit being stubborn?

250
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,640
If you worked with me,

251
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,000
you wouldn't have to sit through something
that devalues you this much.

252
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,000
Or do you prefer
a supporting character role

253
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,240
to being a brand ambassador
for my project?

254
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,280
I don't care

255
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,240
if I'm a leading or supporting actress.

256
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,600
If the role's interesting, I'd take it.

257
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,760
I saw you hesitating though.

258
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,760
I just have to think it through is all.

259
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But I should thank you

260
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,880
for helping me decide.

261
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,720
Hello, Som?

262
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,280
It's Pat.

263
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,920
I accept the role.

264
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,840
We're friends in the industry now.
Let's just forget

265
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,960
whatever's past.

266
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,880
You're right.

267
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,560
We have to work together anyway.
Let's just be friends.

268
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,120
For Captain's sake, I'll give it one day.

269
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,480
One day, Ava?

270
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,200
For things like this,
we have to wait and see.

271
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,160
Pu, you play along too.
For our future's sake.

272
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,480
If you want to date someone
in the industry,

273
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,120
you need to be open-minded.

274
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,120
If you really want to support her,

275
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,640
learn to understand her.

276
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,160
Hey,

277
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,680
I'm not that narrow-minded.

278
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,040
I just can't stand that guy.

279
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,200
Captain?

280
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,600
Yeah.

281
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,960
Is she faking a nap or seducing you?

282
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,040
Why don't you prove it?

283
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,880
Apparently, the girl's easy.

284
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,760
- Go ahead, come on.
- Should I really?

285
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,040
Really?

286
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,840
Come on then.

287
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,080
You're gonna take advantage of her, huh?

288
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,560
Right?

289
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,280
Stop it. What are you doing?
Why are you punching Captain?

290
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,560
He was taking advantage of you, Pu.

291
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,760
That's not true. I wasn't.

292
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Yeah, it was a misunderstanding.

293
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,280
- I'll talk to Captain. Go.
- No.

294
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,040
You need to leave with me now, Pu.

295
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,280
Come on.

296
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,600
That hurts!

297
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,760
Hey,

298
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,440
let go of me!

299
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,080
What's wrong with you?
You're suddenly so unreasonable.

300
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,040
More like you are.

301
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,160
Suddenly, you're so unrealistic
you'd really believe that guy.

302
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,760
You want fame that bad?

303
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,080
That you'd let him do anything?

304
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,200
If that's how you see me,
then stay away from me.

305
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,280
I heard there was a fight
when you were hanging out with Captain.

306
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,720
Is that true, Pu?

307
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,640
Jane misunderstood.

308
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,360
But I already talked to Captain.

309
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,800
Good thing you're not famous yet,

310
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,800
so no one cared to write the news.

311
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,960
Be more careful next time,

312
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,520
or you'll end up failing before you shine.

313
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,680
Okay. I'll be more careful.

314
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,600
Good.

315
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,360
Oh, you're here. Pat, Pu.

316
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,920
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

317
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,280
Why isn't the leading actress cast yet?

318
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,200
What's taking so long?

319
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,880
Um…

320
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,840
Shall we head to the dressing room first?

321
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,840
- Let's go.
- Sure.

322
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,680
- Why didn't she answer?
- Dressing room, please.

323
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,000
Um…

324
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,280
Som, don't tell me the leading actress is…

325
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,080
The leading actress
for Tiger Lady is gonna be Ingdao.

326
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,400
Ava's cast too.

327
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,520
So this is why

328
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,000
you wouldn't let me know the full cast,

329
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,760
saying you can't disclose it

330
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,560
or can't decide yet.

331
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,320
Som,

332
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,240
I probably won't take the role anymore.

333
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
Let's go, Dada.

334
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,920
Hold on, Dao.

335
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,000
I'll have reporters come shoot news here.

336
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,160
It's a drama with you as the leading lady

337
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,880
and Pat costarring in it.

338
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,760
The ratings will be huge.

339
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
She's right, Dao.

340
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,000
Even just the fitting day
will catch everyone's attention.

341
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,680
Then there will be
so many events waiting for you too.

342
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,200
What do you think, Pat?

343
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,240
I already gave Som my word
that I'd take the role.

344
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,120
I wouldn't cause her trouble for sure.

345
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,200
Som,

346
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,440
they want to interview the actors.

347
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,520
What do you think, Dao?

348
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,800
Fine then.

349
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,440
I'll trust you.

350
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,320
I'll take the leading lady role
you offered.

351
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,320
The surprise
you mentioned before, is it Pat?

352
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,760
And that's not all.

353
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,240
So two Queens of TV ratings
are costarring in the show?

354
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm so glad she cast me
as the leading lady.

355
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,280
Pat's playing a supporting character too.

356
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,960
You're playing a supporting character?

357
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,240
Um, let's just say
they're both leading ladies here.

358
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,680
In fact, on the show,

359
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,400
the three leading ladies are sisters.

360
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,600
And Pu here became famous from Star Sea,

361
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,640
so she's the youngest leading lady.

362
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,400
- Ah.
- Ah.

363
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,800
And this is Ava.

364
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,120
She's cast for a leading role too.

365
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,200
That's right. It's such a great role too.

366
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,840
Thank you, Som.

367
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,520
But the supporting character Pat's playing

368
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,600
really suits her
because she just got sued for divor--

369
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,040
She just got through a divorce,
so she'd relate to the role easily.

370
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Ingdao is cast as the eldest sister,
who has to be a really good person.

371
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,200
I think it must be challenging for her

372
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,400
because it's the furthest from the truth.

373
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,440
What she meant to say is that

374
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,960
Dao's changing her whole persona
for the role,

375
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,880
so there may be some slight changes.

376
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,080
Can we do a shoot of just them?

377
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,560
Sure, go ahead.

378
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,000
Get closer.

379
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,680
Strike a pose.

380
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,040
Get closer. Perfect.

381
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,960
- Strike a pose.
- Good, strike a pose.

382
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,960
- Another one please.
- Let's see some smiles.

383
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,560
This way please.

384
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,320
- Could you turn a little? Perfect.
- Beautiful.

385
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,280
Did Som lie to you?

386
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,120
What are these outfits?

387
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,920
How unfitting for a leading lady.

388
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,960
Are these all we got?

389
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,360
They just sent costumes
that suit your character for you to try.

390
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,160
But if you don't like them,

391
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,240
Som will find you some more.

392
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,280
And how can I be sure

393
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,000
the new ones will look better?

394
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,720
I'll let her know then.

395
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,720
Did you come here to work

396
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,600
or to cause problems
for Som and the staff?

397
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,400
So what?

398
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,560
I'm the leading lady.

399
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,760
I have the right to speak out
so that my work is absolutely perfect.

400
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,680
And you,
you're willingly a supporting actress,

401
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,280
so act like it.

402
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,680
And shut up.

403
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,680
You see, Pu.

404
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,600
To be a good star and actress,

405
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,280
you need to focus on your acting.

406
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,440
Make yourself stand out
with your acting skills.

407
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,240
But then there are those meteoroids

408
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,440
who are always trying hard
to steal the spotlight.

409
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,920
You think I'm trying
to steal the spotlight?

410
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,240
Then you're just a light
that went out long ago.

411
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,560
What are you gonna do to her?

412
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,520
None of your business!

413
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,040
Pu!

414
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,360
Ouch!

415
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,920
Damn you, Pu!

416
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,480
Pu!

417
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,560
Get off of her, Pu! Stop!

418
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,320
Get off of her, Dao!

419
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
Jane.

420
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,960
Got a delivery?
Or are you looking for someone?

421
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,840
I could ask you the same.

422
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,800
Did you come here as a sponsor?
Or are you supporting someone personally?

423
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Som! It's bad!

424
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,480
There's a really bad fight
in the dressing room!

425
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,920
- Who's fighting who?
- Ava and Pu.

426
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,040
Is today doomsday or something?

427
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,920
Let's go.

428
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,360
Good God!

429
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,880
Miss Pat!

430
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,640
Hey! What the hell?

431
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,440
I'll have to delete it.

432
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,840
Mr. Tham and Miss Pat didn't
give you permission. They'll sue you.

433
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,400
Who are you to be saying all this?

434
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,040
Whether I'll get sued or not
has nothing to do with you.

435
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,560
So you have to give it back.

436
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,840
If you don't,
you're the one getting arrested.

437
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,000
Then I'm buying it.

438
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,760
A hundred grand. What do you say?

439
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,920
You got the money?

440
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,920
I'll send it right now.

441
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,480
You have that much money?

442
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,840
Pu, I do have some savings.

443
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,080
Plus,

444
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,800
I can ask Mr. Tham for money any time.

445
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,800
That just cleaned out my bank account.

446
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,560
You don't have to. I got it.

447
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,320
Are you badly hurt?

448
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,679
No, but…

449
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,159
You shouldn't have done what you just did.

450
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,600
Did what?

451
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,679
You carried me.

452
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,480
You're hurt this bad,
and still, I can't help you at all?

453
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,920
You're divorced now.

454
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,960
Why do you care what people say?

455
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,719
Sometimes, what people say

456
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,720
doesn't necessarily reflect
what we do and who we are.

457
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,720
But it also reflects your heart
and your own thoughts

458
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,280
about who you think you are.

459
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,960
And if I'm sure I've done nothing wrong,

460
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,400
I wouldn't fear their negative words.

461
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,160
We're in trouble, Pat!

462
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,720
- What is it, Kiki?
- Som's demanding to see you.

463
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,920
It's just the fitting day,

464
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,360
and the leading lady is already hurt.

465
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,120
I don't think
Dao can work with you anymore.

466
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,440
You and your kid gave me an injury.

467
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,640
What about Miss Pat's injury?
Who can be held responsible?

468
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,480
If you won't let Miss Pat
stay on the show,

469
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,480
then our deal's over.

470
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,680
That won't be a problem for her

471
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,160
because I'll sponsor her
for the show's locations.

472
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,360
I have filming locations to offer
just like Nile Real Estate.

473
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,480
Just decide for yourself

474
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,320
if you'll keep the leading lady

475
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,400
or some supporting character
with a bad reputation.

476
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,280
Um…

477
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,880
I'm sorry, Pat. I'll have to choose Dao.

478
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,880
I apologize, Mr. Tham.

479
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,840
You might want to reconsider.

480
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,920
Because if you choose the wrong person,

481
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
you'll have an even bigger headache later.

482
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,680
What are you talking about?

483
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,000
What is it, Pumeth?

484
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,320
The DSI visited our company?

485
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,640
We're here
for Mr. Taweerath and Ms. Ingdao.

486
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,400
What's this about?

487
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,960
We'd like you to come with us
for questioning

488
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,440
about bribing a public official.

489
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,920
Please come with us.

490
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,960
Please.

491
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,800
Good God!

492
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,040
Aunt Dao! Uncle Rath!

493
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,760
What is this about, Pat?

494
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,360
Naturally,
evil people deserve to go to jail, Kiki.

495
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,240
But whatever news they write about,
that's up to them.

496
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,200
Som,

497
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
if you'll excuse me, I should go change.

498
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,640
- Let's go.
- Wait, Pat. Hold on.

499
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,840
Pat! Pat! Pat!

500
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,960
Why did it have to happen
to my characters?

501
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,760
Som! Som! Som!

502
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,520
- Calm down.
- Som!

503
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,040
Was that your doing?

504
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,520
All I did was send proof
of his evil deeds to the police.

505
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,240
Awesome, bro.

506
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,040
And why should we believe
in what goes against our feelings?

507
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Why can't we be sure about our feelings?

508
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,000
Especially my feelings for you.

509
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,280
And I believe you feel it too.

510
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,760
Why is Dao here, Kiki?

511
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,200
Isn't she under investigation?

512
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,120
Would Dao be able to take it, Som?

513
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,040
She went from a leading actress
to a supporting actress.

514
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,000
Because this is not the first time

515
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,160
I have to give someone
my leading lady role.

516
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,880
Because I just had an idea
on how we can get back at our enemy.

517
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,640
NEXT EPISODE

518
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,760
Noom! Mr. Tham got shot!

519
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,920
Mr. Tham!
