1
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,800
Thank you so much to both of you.

2
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,040
From now on, you have to be careful.

3
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,960
We don't know who they are
or what they want.

4
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,520
I hope the police can catch them.

5
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,280
Yes, I will be cautious.

6
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,880
I had my brother pick me up.

7
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,200
I'll excuse myself.

8
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,000
Sure.

9
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,800
Thank you.

10
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,360
I helped Pu, not you.

11
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,200
Also,

12
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,280
I think your husband
is behind all of this.

13
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,920
Why would he do that?

14
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,040
Can't you see?

15
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,440
That night at the casino,

16
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,240
his man captured Pu.

17
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,640
If she hadn't escaped,

18
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,440
what do you think
would have happened to her?

19
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,120
He was probably afraid
Pu would tell me about the casino.

20
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,480
But actually, something like this

21
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,280
wouldn't make me
want to break up with him.

22
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,960
And what about him cheating on you?
Isn't that enough?

23
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,120
You've never been married,
never had a family.

24
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
You don't really know.

25
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,280
We're husband and wife,

26
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,240
breaking up isn't as easy
as changing shoes.

27
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,040
Is it because before you could get
the man you love so much

28
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,280
and this wedding ring,

29
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,520
you had to work hard to take it
from someone else, right?

30
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,960
That's why you can't let him go easily.

31
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,000
What are you on about?

32
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,680
I never stole him from anyone,

33
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
and I never stole this ring either.

34
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,320
Then go tell my sister yourself.

35
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,200
MS. NAMFAH WANPRAPAS

36
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,760
Fah took poison

37
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,080
on the day you married Mr. Taweerath.

38
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,440
I never knew about this.

39
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,080
Then you should know

40
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,200
that you and your husband
are the reason for my sister's death.

41
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,320
I don't even know your sister.

42
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,120
There must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

43
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Even now, you still dare to deny it?

44
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,040
Why are you so nonchalant?

45
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,880
You're suffering because another woman
is stealing your husband.

46
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,120
You're lamenting
about how much pain you're in.

47
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,800
At that time,

48
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,080
Fah was suffering as well.

49
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,000
But I never stole Rath from your sister.

50
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,760
That wedding ring
that you are so proud of,

51
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,640
it used to belong to Fah.

52
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,120
And you keep telling others
that you never stole anything from anyone.

53
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,680
Mr. Taweerath was the one
who gave this ring to her.

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,160
She was so happy

55
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,800
to be engaged
and marry the person she loved.

56
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,000
But in the end,

57
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
you took everything from her.

58
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,920
I swear on my life,

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,760
I never knew about this.

60
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,160
Even now,

61
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
you're still lying.

62
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
Do I have to die

63
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,280
so I can prove

64
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,720
that I had nothing to do with this
and then you'll believe me?

65
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,320
People like you

66
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,760
wouldn't dare do that.

67
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,880
Mrs. Pat, what the hell are you doing?

68
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,880
I'm going to prove

69
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,480
that I had no clue about your sister.

70
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,400
So you want me to run you over?

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
At this point,

72
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,040
even if I had to die, I'd do it.

73
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,080
If I had known Rath
was going to marry someone,

74
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,960
I would never have been with him.

75
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,400
Because I would never think
about stealing someone.

76
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,480
I want to reassure you

77
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
that I personally chose this ring myself,

78
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,680
and Rath took me
to pick it out at the store.

79
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,480
I can also confirm

80
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,960
that he really gave this ring to Fah.

81
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,400
I took this picture myself

82
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,000
when he gave her the ring.

83
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,480
Fah said she was very happy

84
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,800
and that it was a secret engagement.

85
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,720
Even our uncle didn't know about it.

86
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,520
But he was the one
who took me to the store.

87
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,720
The seller told me that this ring
was the only one available.

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,240
There is no way
he would give me your sister's ring.

89
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,880
Even now,

90
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,960
you still won't admit it?

91
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,480
Then I will prove to you

92
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,720
that I did not lie.

93
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Mr. Tham wants to
buy a ring for his girlfriend,

94
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
so I would like to ask you
to help him look at jewelry.

95
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,200
My pleasure.

96
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,320
I wonder if you have
a design in mind yet, Mr. Tham.

97
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,240
Just like this.

98
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,600
This is the wedding ring that you
and Mr. Rath chose at my shop.

99
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,720
It's been a long time. You still remember?

100
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,559
Of course I do.
Blue diamonds, with such a high price,

101
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,200
are not easily available for purchase.

102
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,480
Is something wrong?

103
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,280
Is this a replica, Mrs. Pat?

104
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,880
-What?
-Are you…

105
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,840
looking down on her?

106
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,400
Not at all.

107
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,440
If I were to use this ring as a model,

108
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,800
I need to check it to be sure.

109
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,200
Absolutely.

110
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,240
This is not that blue diamond ring.

111
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,680
Is this a fake diamond?

112
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,600
You're the one who sold this ring to her,

113
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
and you're saying that it's fake?

114
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,280
Let me call and check first.

115
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,000
How could this ring be fake?

116
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,880
What did he say?

117
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,560
My friend told me that Mr. Taweerath

118
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,640
sold the real one to him a long time ago.

119
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,520
Then thank you very much.

120
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,760
We won't bother you anymore.

121
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,520
I'll excuse myself.

122
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,880
Did he lie to me

123
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,400
even about the wedding ring?

124
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,760
Dad.

125
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,760
I want a divorce.

126
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,640
Hey! Chat!

127
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,360
Chat! Wake up!

128
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,520
Chat!

129
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,320
What?

130
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,800
Hey! Let go!

131
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,840
-Let go!
-Get in!

132
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,240
Let go!

133
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,480
Pu!

134
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,080
Who are you? Why are you taking me?

135
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Mr. Taweerath…

136
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,080
Didn't I tell you

137
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,400
to stay away from Pat?

138
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,800
But you didn't believe me.

139
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,520
Don't mess with my stuff!

140
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,560
Give it to me!

141
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,320
How did you get this phone back?

142
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,520
Tell me!

143
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,880
People from the street
like you are so stubborn.

144
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,680
Fine.

145
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,560
If you plan to destroy the evidence,

146
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,240
I will tell you that it's too late.

147
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,440
I've already sent all the clips
from the casino to Mrs. Pat.

148
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,680
Your image as a good husband is gone!

149
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you think those clips
can do anything to me?

150
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,160
I can easily clear this up with my wife.

151
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,080
Do you think she will believe your lies?

152
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,080
If I can make a troublemaker like you
stay quiet for a while,

153
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,000
she will definitely believe
whatever her husband says.

154
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,960
Let go!

155
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,000
What are you going to do to her?

156
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,440
I'm recording this.

157
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,560
I don't want to cause trouble.

158
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,480
Release her

159
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,400
and I'll go.

160
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,520
Who are you?
Why do I have to do what you say?

161
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,040
I just called Mr. Tham and told him

162
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,800
that I would be the one picking her up

163
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
and taking her home.

164
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,600
He's with Mr. Tham.

165
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,040
She must be terrified anyway.

166
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,880
Then you can take her back.

167
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,880
I hope that what I said to you

168
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,840
will make you be better.

169
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,960
You suddenly came
to tell me about the divorce.

170
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
I thought it through.

171
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,600
I already know what he did.

172
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,240
You already know?

173
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,080
Someone told me

174
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,720
that he borrowed
a large sum of money from someone.

175
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,840
It must be about that land.

176
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,720
Hey,

177
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,160
you had a problem with him,
but you refuse to help

178
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,480
and just leave him to struggle on his own?

179
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,240
Dad…

180
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,440
Rath loves you very much.

181
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,360
He has always done things for you.

182
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,880
If there is a problem,
you should be able to talk it through.

183
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,400
-Dad--
-All right,

184
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,680
go back and talk it through
with your husband.

185
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,800
If you can help him,

186
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,640
I'm sure he's willing to change

187
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,400
and treat you nicely like before.

188
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,520
Also, don't let your emotions
bring shame to the family.

189
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,480
Think about me.

190
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,440
Don't mention divorce to me again.

191
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,760
Rath, I brought you coffee.

192
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Thank you, darling.

193
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,240
My father told me

194
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,320
that you borrowed money
from someone to buy that land.

195
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,800
I didn't want
to bother you and your father.

196
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,080
It's time for me
to do something on my own.

197
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,600
And what about when you told him

198
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,680
that you were going to consult a doctor
about having a child?

199
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,560
Wait until

200
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,720
I can buy this land first.

201
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,600
Then I will take you to see a doctor.

202
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,200
Give me a minute.

203
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,920
Yes, sir.

204
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,200
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

205
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,760
Are you really having this much trouble?

206
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,520
Please sit down.

207
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,760
If you need any help,

208
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,360
just tell me.

209
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,640
How about

210
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,920
we eat something first,

211
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,120
then we'll talk.

212
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,400
If it's about your husband,

213
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,520
you can tell me.
Don't beat around the bush.

214
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,560
I know

215
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,160
I shouldn't talk to you about this,

216
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,600
but I hope

217
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,360
that you'll help me.

218
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,640
It's about the land

219
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,520
you're going to buy before him.

220
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,400
Have you

221
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,640
learned nothing from the past?

222
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,120
I tried,

223
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,320
but when I found out
that he was in trouble

224
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,480
and had some problems,

225
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,800
I could understand him.

226
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,320
His company has been
losing money for a while now.

227
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,760
If he has problems with this land again,

228
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,840
he will definitely be in trouble.

229
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,800
But if…

230
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,240
-You are willing to back down--
-You know how much I hate him.

231
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,760
Do you think I'll help you?

232
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,080
If you're willing to help,

233
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,920
whatever you want me to do,

234
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,480
I'm willing to do it for you.

235
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,600
Are you really willing to do anything?

236
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,320
I was about to check out.

237
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,200
I'll tell the hotel

238
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,600
that I'll be checking out tomorrow.

239
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,200
You can go wait for me in this room.

240
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,960
Bro.

241
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,280
Why are you turning off the lights?

242
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,280
I thought you went back already.

243
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,280
I already told you,

244
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,920
once you drop off Pu,
you don't have to come back.

245
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,560
-I'll close the shop myself.
-If my manager hears that,

246
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,480
there's a good chance I'll get fired, bro.

247
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,800
Who would dare fire the owner's son?

248
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,760
Stop pretending already.

249
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,320
You want to get revenge
on Mr. Taweerath, right?

250
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,080
Then why are you here?

251
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,400
Isn't there someone
waiting for you for revenge?

252
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,680
No answer.

253
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,560
Since you want to be a bad person,

254
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,840
you should go and see Mrs. Pat.

255
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,840
She's willing to wait there.

256
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,760
Let's make Mr. Taweerath resentful.

257
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,840
In the end,
you still don't dare to do it, right?

258
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,440
Then you should stop
pretending to be a bad person.

259
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,240
Here's to us

260
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,480
pretenders.

261
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,120
SOMETHING'S COME UP. YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.

262
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
How long do you have to endure this,

263
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,560
Patchanin?

264
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,520
-It's all done.
-Thank you.

265
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,280
Pat.

266
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,000
I got this land.

267
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,080
My company is safe.

268
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,000
Thank you so much

269
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,320
for agreeing to talk to the owner.

270
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,280
Why did he agree to sell the land to you?

271
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,560
He said that the person who bid against me

272
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,680
has withdrawn.

273
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,760
Withdrawn?

274
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,000
Yes, and another thing,

275
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,760
the owner's wife is also your fan,

276
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,400
so he decided to sell the land to me.

277
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,400
I got this land because of you.

278
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,440
I'll call Jaew

279
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,240
to prepare a special meal for us.

280
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,120
Actually, I asked Jaew
to help out with Kiki's work at home.

281
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,760
Kiki is having
a housewarming ceremony tomorrow.

282
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,240
I plan to go help out today

283
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,040
and sleep over at her house.

284
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,640
Then I will come back tomorrow morning.

285
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,440
Is that okay with you?

286
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,080
Sure.

287
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,240
It's such a shame.

288
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,520
I thought we would be able
to celebrate together.

289
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,360
Then, I'll go now.

290
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,160
Are you sure

291
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
that bringing me to this room

292
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,320
won't cause any problems with your wife?

293
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,440
Today,

294
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,640
there is only the two of us here.

295
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,840
How could there be any problems?

296
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,840
I'm just warning you.

297
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,520
I usually see you being overly cautious.

298
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,480
Don't say that,

299
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,840
today is a good day.

300
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,360
Let's talk about us.

301
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,400
I want you to celebrate with me

302
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,680
because my success

303
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,840
is yours too.

304
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,880
You say that as if once the job is done,

305
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,960
you'll give me the shares.

306
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,320
If you want them,

307
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,480
I will give them to you.

308
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,120
What if I forget something here?

309
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,160
What will you do?

310
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,680
I'll have to check first

311
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,120
to see what you have.

312
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,560
So when you go back,

313
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,200
I can make sure

314
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,880
you haven't forgotten anything.

315
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,160
Pat.

316
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,560
Didn't you say you were going
to sleep over at Kiki's house?

317
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,840
I changed my mind.

318
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,440
There are already a lot of people
helping at her house.

319
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,600
I probably wouldn't be able to sleep.
It's better to come back home.

320
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,680
You should have called me first.

321
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,320
I just called my friend
to talk about the project.

322
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,720
It's fine.

323
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm tired, so I planned to take a shower
and then go to sleep.

324
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,440
The water heater
in the bathroom is broken.

325
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,360
I just took a shower and it was very cold.

326
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,040
You should go take a shower
in the guest room.

327
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,440
You get sick easily.
You might catch a cold.

328
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,880
Is that so?

329
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,880
I was planning to take a warm bath.

330
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,680
I'll hurry and
have the technician come fix it tomorrow.

331
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,120
Sure, then I'll go take a shower first.

332
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,200
HURRY UP DAO. I'LL TAKE YOU OUT
BEFORE SHE SEES YOU.

333
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,760
If you had told me first,
I wouldn't have gone out.

334
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,880
But I'll hurry back, darling.

335
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,560
Don't worry,

336
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,280
I know all your friends well.

337
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,880
I understand that men
also want some alone time with each other.

338
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,840
Don't worry.

339
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,080
I won't check in with your friends.

340
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,840
Oh, I forgot to mention

341
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,520
that tomorrow,

342
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,200
my father asked me
to do some business in Chiang Mai.

343
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,720
Tomorrow? Then you should go to bed early.

344
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,680
Don't wait for me.

345
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,520
Good night.

346
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,360
Let's make up for it tomorrow.

347
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,760
Are you sure

348
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,640
that I don't have
to rush out like this again?

349
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,440
I'm sick of this kind of thing.

350
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,720
I'll make it up to you.

351
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,640
If you want anything, just tell me.

352
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,360
What if I want your divorce papers

353
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,400
from Patchanin?

354
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,440
Can you give that to me?

355
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,640
Why?

356
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,920
Have you forgotten
everything you said to me?

357
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,040
You know how sincere I am with you,
how much I love you.

358
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,840
You're not just a short-term fling for me.

359
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,400
You will see my divorce papers with her,

360
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,720
but I need a little more time.

361
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,280
When you get to Chiang Mai,
please call me, darling.

362
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,760
Actually,
I wanted to take you to the airport,

363
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,000
but I have a meeting.

364
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,720
Should we go?

365
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,760
Then I'll go.

366
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,320
When you return, please call me.

367
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,120
If I'm free, I'll go pick you up.

368
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,880
Sure.

369
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,600
When she arrives at the airport, tell me.

370
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,720
Yes, sir.

371
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,840
I'LL PICK YOU UP TONIGHT, DAO.

372
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,840
Did Pat go to Chiang Mai?

373
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,600
Yes.

374
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,280
Pu took time off work this morning

375
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,920
to take her to the airport.

376
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,920
That's how I know.

377
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,080
I really don't understand women.

378
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,120
They know what their husbands are like,

379
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,920
how bad they are,

380
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,080
but they still give them the chance
to be with someone else.

381
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,240
When the cat's away, the mice will play.

382
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,680
This evidence alone

383
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,400
should be enough

384
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,520
to confirm that you're cheating on me.

385
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,440
Pat.

386
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,680
Please calm down and listen to me.

387
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,320
I have to thank you, Dao.

388
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,000
You've given me another piece of evidence,

389
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,239
in addition to

390
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,679
the panties you left in the bathroom

391
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,600
and the photos you sent to my phone.

392
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,920
Dao!

393
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,920
The evidence is here.

394
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,239
Does that mean
I can finally sue you for divorce?

395
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,239
Don't come near me!

396
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,920
Pat.

397
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,080
-You can't sue me for divorce.
-Why can't I sue you?

398
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,000
You've been having an affair,

399
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,920
sleeping with other women like this.

400
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,520
You've hurt my feelings

401
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,440
and made me feel ashamed.

402
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,640
Isn't that

403
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,280
enough reason for me
to sue you for divorce?

404
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,000
You too, Dao.

405
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,520
I'll sue you as well.

406
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
There's no use.

407
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,840
Even if you break that phone,

408
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,480
I have already sent
all the evidence to my guys.

409
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,880
Please continue.

410
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,120
Pat! Pat!

411
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,960
-Pat!
-Rath.

412
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,760
Since it's already like this,

413
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,600
you should let her go

414
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,760
and finally get a divorce

415
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,560
so that we don't have to hide
like this anymore.

416
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,280
Rath! Rath!

417
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,520
So what exactly happened?

418
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,640
I will make those two believe
that I don't know anything,

419
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,680
and then I will find an opportunity
to lie that I'm not at home.

420
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,120
When he thinks that you're not home,

421
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
he will bring
Ms. Ingdao to the house, right?

422
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,680
When he has the chance,

423
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,680
he will definitely bring
something fishy into the house.

424
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,680
As for Dao,

425
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,280
she probably wants
to be in my position so bad.

426
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,520
Then I will collect evidence
so those two can't deny it.

427
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,440
And I will deal with it all at once.

428
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,040
She lied that she went to Chiang Mai

429
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,880
and told me to meet her at the airport
and bring her bag here.

430
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,280
As for her,

431
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,720
she went to collect evidence
about her husband and his mistress.

432
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,960
Wow!

433
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,600
Those two must be dying
of resentment by now.

434
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,560
Bro, where are you going?

435
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,080
Pat! Pat!

436
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,200
Pat, wait!

437
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,400
Let go!

438
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,520
Who is that guy you're talking about?

439
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,440
Are you scared?

440
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,720
Are you so anxious
that you can't stand it?

441
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,280
But the pain you're experiencing

442
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,560
is incomparable to what I'm feeling now!

443
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Don't let these things

444
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,840
ruin our relationship.

445
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,960
I'm just having fun,

446
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,920
but in the end, I still love you the most.

447
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,800
Disgusting!

448
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,560
How could you say that? These things?

449
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,040
Go ahead and have fun with her
as much as you want.

450
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,520
And stop bothering me!

451
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,240
-Pat!
-Let go!

452
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,560
-Let go!
-Pat! Pat!

453
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,240
-Let go!
-Pat, I'm sorry.

454
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,520
I won't do this again.

455
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,080
-No! Let go!
-Pat!

456
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,000
Let go!

457
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,320
Pat! Pat!

458
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,360
Pat! Pat!

459
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,120
Pat, wait.

460
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,560
Let go of her!

461
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,600
Pat.

462
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,400
We should talk about this
between the two of us.

463
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,920
You shouldn't listen to outsiders.

464
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,200
Two of you?

465
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,560
At this point,

466
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,600
it should be the three of us.

467
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
I have nothing to say to you, Dao.

468
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,880
You should talk to my lawyer.

469
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,960
You heard her.

470
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,120
She doesn't want to talk to us.

471
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,040
Just let her go.

472
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,960
Actually,

473
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,040
no woman

474
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,160
wants to ruin her reputation
because of a divorce.

475
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,600
Don't worry about it.

476
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,920
Pat! Pat!

477
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,680
-Pat!
-Hey!

478
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,600
Pat.

479
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,480
I don't want to divorce you.

480
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,560
You're the only one I love.

481
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
I'm sorry.

482
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,040
Give me another chance.

483
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,880
I promise you

484
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,960
I won't hurt you again.

485
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,800
Pat.

486
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,880
I'll take you to the best doctor.

487
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,960
We'll discuss it together

488
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,920
about having a child.

489
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
Please, Pat.

490
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,600
Don't leave me.

491
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,520
I can't live

492
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
without you.

493
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,000
Do you really believe him?

494
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,400
Pat.

495
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,440
Believe me.

496
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,080
How could you do this to me?

497
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,360
How could you do this to me?!

498
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,920
How could you do this?

499
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,800
-How could you do this?
-Dao!

500
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,160
What's wrong with you?

501
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,080
You did it to me first!

502
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,600
What did you say to me?

503
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,040
And what did you do to me?

504
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,960
Huh!

505
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,400
Dao! Stop it!

506
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,600
Haven't you heard

507
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,520
that hesitation will hurt us?

508
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,840
Hurt at the thought
of doing something too slowly?

509
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,040
You think you're so high and mighty?

510
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,480
I'll drag you down myself.

511
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,120
Soon, you'll see for yourself.

512
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,040
NEXT EPISODE

513
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,880
Pat, do you want me to die this much?

514
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,560
Go ahead, if you think you can.

515
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,600
On the day of the competition,
you'll be disqualified

516
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,440
because you'll be caught
working as a prostitute.

517
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,640
Everything will be a secret

518
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,120
if you bring us a little fun tonight.
