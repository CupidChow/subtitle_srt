1
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,640
A billion, huh?

2
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,680
That price is a rip-off!

3
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,680
I didn't expect Miss Pat and Mr. Tham

4
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,560
to use a nominee business
to buy all the land in that area.

5
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,880
So, I didn't look into it well enough.

6
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,080
If they could come up with this,

7
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,760
there must be a mole

8
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,360
telling them what's going on here.

9
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,440
You can go now.

10
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,840
Yes.

11
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,400
Don't tell me you did this.

12
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,480
Why would I do that?

13
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,120
Who knows?

14
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,720
You might want to stab me in the back.

15
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,120
Do you think I would want to help
Patchanin, the one I hate the most?

16
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,400
I'll buy her land no matter what.

17
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,160
But I'll never lose a billion.

18
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,080
You have to be the one
to negotiate for me.

19
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,880
Why me?

20
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,080
To prove

21
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,040
that you wouldn't betray me

22
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,080
and that you're on my side no matter what.

23
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,840
But you already know

24
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,480
that Patchanin also
hates me more than anything.

25
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,800
There's no way
she would negotiate with me.

26
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,680
I don't care

27
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,000
how you do it.

28
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,160
But if you fail,

29
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,800
I'll send Ava to jail

30
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,920
for murder.

31
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,840
Are you threatening me?

32
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,800
I'm not threatening you.

33
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,960
That's an order!

34
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,720
And you'll have to make it work.

35
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,240
Fine. I'll help you.

36
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,560
But you need to help me too.

37
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,840
What do you want?

38
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,800
If the negotiation
with Patchanin is successful,

39
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,720
you must let me
take Ava to study in the UK.

40
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,600
She's so stressed now
and doesn't want to be here anymore.

41
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,160
Alright. If you can do it,

42
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,680
I'll send Ava there.

43
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,600
Just wait a little longer, Ava.

44
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,920
I'll find a way to send you abroad.

45
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,360
Pat,

46
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,080
I need to talk to you.

47
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,080
You wanted to meet me.

48
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,640
What do you want to talk about?

49
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
Thank you.

50
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
So,

51
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,960
what do you need?

52
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,880
I'm here to negotiate
the price of the land for Rath.

53
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,960
Rath sent you
to talk to me about the land?

54
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,160
He hasn't changed a bit, has he?

55
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,160
Always sends his women to war
whenever he's desperate.

56
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
I think…

57
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,880
You should let Rath
borrow your skirts sometimes.

58
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,200
Let's have a proper talk
regarding the land's price.

59
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,560
I know that you bought that land

60
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,760
just to mess with Rath.

61
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,360
That should be enough.

62
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,080
You must already know that a billion

63
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,920
is too much to be true.

64
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,480
A billion

65
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,080
is far too little

66
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,520
for all the things in my life I've lost.

67
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,080
What if I want to negotiate?

68
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,040
What's in it for me?

69
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,480
I won't lower the price,

70
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,000
not even a single baht.

71
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,480
I know

72
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,760
that you don't actually want that money,

73
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,720
but you want something else back.
Is that correct?

74
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,320
Are you playing a guessing game?

75
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,480
I think I've guessed right.

76
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,280
If you agree to sell the land
according to the cost estimate,

77
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,040
you won't just get the money,

78
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,160
but I'll make Rath

79
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,640
return what was meant
to be your bridal house.

80
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,360
How did it go with Pat?

81
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,200
It went well. Pat also said--

82
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,960
How dare you offer this house like that?!

83
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,960
How do you know that?

84
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,640
Right…

85
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,320
You listened in on us, didn't you?

86
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,320
That's right.

87
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,520
Did you expect me to let you
talk to Pat without knowing anything?

88
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,240
Then you should know as well

89
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,320
that you're being sued for the effects
from the construction of your development.

90
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,039
There's the environment thing as well.

91
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,480
Do you think you have so many choices?

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,160
I'm sure I can handle it.

93
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,640
Really?

94
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,160
You can handle it?

95
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,960
Then why are there rumors about
a shareholder making a secret deal

96
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,400
to remove you as a chairman?

97
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,680
How did you know that?

98
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,960
The things you've talked with legal,

99
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,520
I knew all about it.

100
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,440
That's why I've tried to find
the best solution for you.

101
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,720
You can choose to keep this house

102
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,240
and deal with endless problems,

103
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,280
or you can return it to Patchanin

104
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,760
along with a few hundred million baht,

105
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,400
and put an end to all the legal issues.

106
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,600
Thanks a lot.

107
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,680
Jane just told me

108
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,440
that Taweerath is pulling strings
to kill the lawsuit.

109
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,800
Sounds like the charges won't stick.

110
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,200
People like Rath will do anything.

111
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,920
He's not giving up that easily.

112
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,080
But it's a good thing

113
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,240
you added those extra conditions

114
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
beyond just selling the land.

115
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,720
I'll get my house back, no matter what.

116
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,200
And right now,

117
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,040
Dao must be working to convince him.

118
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,880
When he listened in
on your conversation with Miss Ingdao,

119
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,800
he must be furious.

120
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,480
I already suspected

121
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,360
that a skeptical one like him
wouldn't miss a chance to listen in.

122
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,320
Then, the reason Dao offered your house

123
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,880
in exchange for a lower price…

124
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,640
We agreed on this deal beforehand.

125
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,240
Dao's helping you

126
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,280
because of Pumeth, right?

127
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,600
Yes.

128
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,600
And I do believe

129
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,800
she'll do everything she can to help me.

130
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,920
No matter how much she hates me,

131
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,200
Ava is her weakness

132
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
and so is Pumeth.

133
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,280
If Dao is doing all this to help you,

134
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,000
maybe it's time
to tell her the truth about Pumeth.

135
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,040
I already have.

136
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,480
You told her?

137
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Yes.

138
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,600
I told her before we…

139
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,120
made this deal

140
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,640
that she has to convince Rath

141
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,840
to return the house to me.

142
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,880
Dao must be so upset.

143
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,240
She probably needs time to process it.

144
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,680
But I'm sure she's feeling better now.

145
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,280
She still has Ava to look after.

146
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,520
Then I'm relieved.

147
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,400
Even though Miss Dao
helped Taweerath hurt you,

148
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,080
in the end, she became his victim too.

149
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,200
She's paying for what she did.

150
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,040
I can't bear
any more change in you, Miss Pat.

151
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,800
Why?

152
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,920
Do you think
I'll turn into some evil queen?

153
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,360
I don't believe

154
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,960
you could be like that.

155
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,600
Otherwise,

156
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,040
I wouldn't be able to help you.

157
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,120
How is he doing?

158
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,040
Pretty rough.

159
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,760
But he's being treated

160
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,480
and should recover soon.

161
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,960
Now that you've seen this,
you must feel better

162
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,440
knowing I wasn't lying to you.

163
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,520
Fine.

164
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,800
I'll keep playing along in front of Rath,

165
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,720
like I promised.

166
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,240
Get Ava's things ready.

167
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,360
I've started packing
some of my own things in another bag.

168
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Just put the rest together
and leave them here quickly.

169
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,680
Yes, Ma'am.

170
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,880
You seem like you're in a hurry,

171
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
since you've already
got the luggage packed.

172
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,480
You promised me, didn't you?

173
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,680
If I could negotiate
the land price with Pat,

174
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,400
you would let Ava fly to London.

175
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,800
You're not going back
on your word are you?

176
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,760
I never forget my promises.

177
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,680
But let's see how well you pull this off.

178
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,960
If there's even the slightest change,

179
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,160
the whole deal is off.

180
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,360
And don't even think about
running away with Ava again.

181
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,120
Dressed up and ready to head out?

182
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,440
Good.

183
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,160
I've told my team to set up

184
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,400
an appointment with Pat
to sign the sales contract.

185
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,040
Fancy seeing you
do your own business for once, Rath.

186
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,400
Oh,

187
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,360
you're wearing a man's pants.

188
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,200
Watch your mouth, Pat.

189
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,920
I didn't say anything bad.

190
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,520
No need to get upset.

191
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,560
You two go ahead and finalize the deal.

192
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,840
I'm not involved in this sale anymore.

193
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,920
I'll wait outside.

194
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,560
Finish packing Ava's bag
as soon as you can.

195
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,600
I'm heading back.

196
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,720
You're taking Ava to the UK?

197
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Not your business.

198
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,480
I'd like to help you too.

199
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,200
You? Help me?

200
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,760
I've decided to help myself now.

201
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,560
If someone like Rath

202
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,800
finds out I betrayed him,

203
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,200
he won't let me off the hook.

204
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,600
That's why I'm running away with Ava.

205
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,880
I understand that, with Pumeth gone,

206
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,200
Ava is all you have now.

207
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,120
What did you just say?

208
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,400
Miss Pat told me she already
informed you about Pumeth passing away.

209
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,600
That's why you're doing everything
for your only niece.

210
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,600
Pumeth has passed away?

211
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,360
How could he be gone

212
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,640
when Patchanin told me

213
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,200
he was being treated?

214
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,200
I had my lawyer
draft this contract for us.

215
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,319
Sign it.

216
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,280
Hey.

217
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,040
No.

218
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,720
I'll only sign if

219
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,720
I draft the contract.

220
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,040
Eight hundred million?

221
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,000
Right.

222
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,920
I'll give you 200 million for the house.

223
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,400
The other document

224
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,040
is for transferring the house back to me.

225
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,280
Sign it, Rath.

226
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,560
No way.

227
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,120
I'll only pay the appraised value.

228
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,840
Then there's nothing more to discuss.

229
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,560
I won't sell it to you.

230
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,640
Pat, wait.

231
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,240
Don't touch me. It's gross.

232
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,760
Fine.

233
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,240
But I have a deal to offer.

234
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,200
I guarantee

235
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,720
it will tempt you.

236
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,040
What kind of deal?

237
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,160
I have key evidence

238
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,320
that will make you and Pu

239
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,920
reconcile.

240
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,920
How are you, Ava?

241
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
We haven't seen
each other for a long time.

242
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,880
Has it been long?

243
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,840
When was the last time?

244
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,440
When my brother fell off
the building and died.

245
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,240
Then we might not see each other again,

246
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,040
because Aunt Dao is taking me to the UK.

247
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,120
Ava!

248
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,640
You're going to the UK, Ava?

249
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,680
Why so suddenly?

250
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,920
Is something wrong?

251
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,280
I'm scared.

252
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,040
Why are you scared?

253
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,880
You can tell me.

254
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,760
I'm scared… I'm… I'm scared.

255
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,640
I'm scared…

256
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,760
The evidence about Chat's death?

257
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Yes.

258
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,640
If you have it,

259
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,480
you'll know who the real culprit is.

260
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,640
Then you and Pu

261
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,240
will finally reconcile.

262
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,160
All this in exchange for

263
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,640
the appraised land price,
without the house.

264
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,760
Do you think I'll let myself
take that kind of loss?

265
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
It's up to you, Pat.

266
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,560
If you don't accept,
there's nothing I can do.

267
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,800
But the truth behind
Pu's brother's death will stay buried.

268
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,200
You'll lose the chance
to give him justice.

269
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
People like you

270
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,880
never do anything without your own agenda.

271
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,480
I actually like righteous people

272
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,640
who do everything honestly.

273
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,800
I think they're cool,

274
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,520
but also stupid.

275
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,880
So yeah, not my thing.

276
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Yes or no?

277
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,320
Did Ava say anything we didn't know?

278
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,000
Before she fell asleep,

279
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,840
she said

280
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,360
she saw Chat filming her
and Miss Ingdao while they were talking.

281
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,640
That might have cost Chat his life.

282
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,640
And did you find Chat's phone?

283
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,400
I can't find it.

284
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,920
I searched Miss Dao's room and Ava's room,

285
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,320
but it's not there.

286
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,680
Could Miss Dao have gotten rid of it

287
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,080
to destroy evidence.

288
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,200
No way.

289
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,760
From how scared Ava is

290
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,720
about losing the phone,

291
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,440
I don't think Miss Dao

292
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,840
would dare get rid of it
or even leave it out of her sight.

293
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,200
Then why can't we find it?

294
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,640
Good timing.

295
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,880
We've just signed the contract.

296
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,920
Five hundred million.

297
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,320
Miss Pat sold the land
to you for 500 million?

298
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,320
You! Let go!

299
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,600
Let go!

300
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,200
You lied to me.

301
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,240
You lied to me!

302
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,600
Mr. Pumeth is dead!

303
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,800
He's dead! Do you hear me?

304
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,800
You too…

305
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,240
Did you order him killed?

306
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,240
Did you order him killed?!

307
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,800
Hey! Let go! Get away!

308
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,400
Are you out of your mind, Dao?

309
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,960
Do you have any proof
that I'm the one who had him killed?

310
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,600
The murderer

311
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,040
has to be you, doesn't it?

312
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,760
What are you saying?

313
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,560
The one who caused
Pu's brother to fall off the building

314
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,160
was you, wasn't it?

315
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,000
Is Rath telling the truth?

316
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,560
No.

317
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,680
If the defendant denies the allegation,

318
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,400
then we need to look at the evidence.

319
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,440
The evidence we agreed on,

320
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,280
Chat's phone.

321
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,000
How did you get that phone?

322
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,000
How did you get it?

323
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,080
I just asked Ava

324
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,280
where it was hidden in the house,

325
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,960
and I thanked her with a little something

326
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,480
to make her feel better.

327
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,200
After that, she told me everything.

328
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,400
You just have to look through this phone,

329
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,040
and you'll know who's behind his death.

330
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,480
From the look of your face,

331
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,280
this really is Chat's phone, isn't it?

332
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,360
Dao, just admit it.

333
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Or do you want to get away so much
you have to blame others?

334
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,600
You sold me out

335
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,320
just to avoid paying a billion?

336
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,960
The clever ones
always have a backup plan, Dao.

337
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,680
Whatever helps me lose
the least amount of money,

338
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,560
I'll do it.

339
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,880
You asshole.

340
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,080
Asshole!

341
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,240
Asshole.

342
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,840
Let go of me!

343
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,480
Violence won't change a thing!

344
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,320
That's enough, Dao!
Just admit it's your fault!

345
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,800
What are you doing?

346
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,480
I'm calling the police
to arrest the murderer.

347
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,200
Patchanin.

348
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,440
Then this no longer concerns me.
The deal is done.

349
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,000
Please excuse me, everyone.

350
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,840
Miss Pat, we need to talk.

351
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,000
Let's talk at home.

352
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,160
But I want to talk now.

353
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,840
You lied to Miss Ingdao

354
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,840
that Pumeth is alive.

355
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,440
It was necessary.

356
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,320
And you lied to me

357
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,600
about telling her the truth.

358
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,040
I didn't want to lie to you.

359
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,240
And you sold the land
to your ex-husband for a cheap price.

360
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,680
If I didn't,

361
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,920
how would we get
the evidence about Chat's murder?

362
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,400
Why do you think what I did is so wrong?

363
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,920
Miss Pat.

364
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,760
You're not thinking
about what's right or wrong.

365
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,320
You made up excuses
to do whatever you want,

366
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,840
no different from the people you hate.

367
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,800
Miss Pat.

368
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,040
You're becoming one of them.
Do you realize that?

369
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,600
What's going on, bro?

370
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,920
We just heard about
Miss Ingdao and rushed here.

371
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,600
Ask Mr. Tham what you want to know.

372
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,640
You're so cold-blooded

373
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,440
for killing Chat.

374
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,920
Why?

375
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,160
Did he find out one of your secrets?

376
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,160
Why did you do this to him?

377
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,640
You're not the police

378
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,720
or a judge.

379
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,920
No need to interrogate me.

380
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,720
And don't judge someone like me.

381
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,960
Do you still insist it's not your fault?

382
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,160
Do you realize

383
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,600
that if you don't confess,

384
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,720
how severe the sentence will be?

385
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
You think your life

386
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,520
is so pure,
without any mistakes, don't you?

387
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,560
Someone like you

388
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,400
deserves to be punished
just as much as I do.

389
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,400
You said I killed someone,

390
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,600
but you also took someone's life.

391
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,040
What are you saying?

392
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,240
What do you think happened

393
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,280
when you caused me
to fall down the stairs?

394
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,960
Did you think I was just hurt

395
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,640
and lost the role to you? Is that it?

396
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,520
Yeah.

397
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,600
You weren't hurt that badly.

398
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,160
You recovered

399
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,200
and went on to take even better roles.

400
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,640
Lead roles as usual.

401
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,320
So what?

402
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,960
You always dig this thing up
to pick a fight with me!

403
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
That's what you always think, isn't it?

404
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,240
Patchanin.

405
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
The pure and pristine lead actress.

406
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,840
Fake.

407
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,640
You killed my baby!

408
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,800
My baby is dead because of you!

409
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,880
You're the murderer.

410
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,480
Let go! Let go of me!

411
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
You made me miscarry!

412
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,320
Your father threatened me with everything!

413
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,320
He looked down on me!

414
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,440
He made me give you
the roles to silence the press.

415
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,000
Let's be real.

416
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,520
How talented do you think you were

417
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,880
that I had to give you the roles?

418
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,080
I didn't know.

419
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,640
Know it then.

420
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,000
And stop pretending
to be a goody two-shoes!

421
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,240
You used Pumeth's well-being to trick me,

422
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,040
trick Mr. Tham,

423
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,800
and trick Pu,

424
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,240
all to satisfy your personal vengeance.

425
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,600
And Chat's death

426
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,640
was part of your revenge game too.

427
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,160
You've always said your ex-husband

428
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,560
is wicked and corrupt,

429
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,360
that he's done countless terrible things.

430
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,920
You're following in his footsteps.

431
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Taweerath and you

432
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,760
are cut from the same evil cloth.

433
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,600
Hey. Wait.

434
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,480
What now?

435
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,800
Juicy news.

436
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,440
"Rumor: Someone saw
the top-rated lead actress

437
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,880
currently shooting a drama
with her ex-bestie

438
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,080
getting brought to the police station.
No clue what the charges are.

439
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,280
Let's wait for the inner circle
to spill the tea."

440
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,560
Wait. There's…

441
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,199
Someone commented the initial "I".

442
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,960
Is it "I" for Ingdao?

443
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,639
What? Is it Ingdao, Dada?
Can you check in on her?

444
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,159
Right. Right.

445
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,080
Dao's not picking up, Rati.

446
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,719
What if it's Dao in that scoop?

447
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,000
Find out more about this.

448
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,159
- Quick!
- Let me see.

449
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,960
All the things you and Dao said

450
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,480
were right all along.

451
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,320
I've done so many things

452
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,240
without caring what's right or wrong.

453
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,600
I'm actually no different from Rath.

454
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,720
What did Miss Dao say to you?

455
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,040
She made me realize that

456
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,000
all the bad things that happened to me

457
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,280
were caused by no one but me.

458
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,840
So,

459
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,440
what does that mean?

460
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,000
The emotional whims

461
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,320
that took over reason

462
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,800
made me act recklessly.

463
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,280
But I didn't realize it
until they became the devil in my mind,

464
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,840
whispering for me to create so much chaos.

465
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,520
People on set told me

466
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,760
that kid Ingdao
keeps taking things from you.

467
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,720
Clothes, shoes, bags,
she always takes them.

468
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,560
There's nothing wrong with it, Dad.

469
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
How is that okay?

470
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,760
Ingdao is a nobody.

471
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,880
She became a lead actress by sheer luck.

472
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,600
She tries to steal your spotlight
every chance she gets.

473
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,320
If this keeps happening,
when will you get the lead role?

474
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,520
Fight back for once.

475
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,680
Stop being so kind.

476
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,480
Why do you always
have to be so submissive?

477
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,400
- Opal, switch her heels. We're rolling
- Yes!

478
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,680
Try accepting the truth for once.

479
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,240
What are you doing?! Let go of me!

480
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,080
- Dao!
- Dao!

481
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,760
Dao! Are you okay?

482
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
This pair is for Pat,

483
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,800
and these are for you.

484
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,880
Can I wear this one?
It matches my dress better.

485
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,680
But Tle prepared this pair for you.

486
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,560
It's safer. Those are too high,
you might sprain your ankle.

487
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,320
But I'd like this pair.

488
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,040
Who would have thought
something would happen

489
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,080
because of my petty urge
to get back at Dao.

490
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,120
My need to one-up her,

491
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,920
just like my father wanted me to.

492
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,160
I didn't think it would cause Dao to…

493
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,560
To miscarry.

494
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,960
Dao was humiliated,

495
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,640
lost her roles,

496
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,240
all because of my father.

497
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,360
That was the beginning of all this.

498
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,400
I didn't mean to cause the miscarriage.

499
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,320
You meant to do it but are
too proud to admit it was your fault.

500
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,600
<i>You're just a wannabe good guy.</i>

501
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,480
You told me

502
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,720
<i>that you wanted to stand out from every</i>
<i>one of my girls. I accept the offer now.</i>

503
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,280
<i>Does the rumor about the lead actress</i>
<i>being involved in your brother's death</i>

504
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,920
<i>have any truth to it?</i>

505
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,680
<i>Giving an interview on a baseless story</i>
<i>might end with you being sued, Pu.</i>

506
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,200
Rath must be planning to use Dao again.

507
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,280
<i>If something is useless,</i>
<i>I won't keep it around.</i>

508
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,560
