1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,240
You're a celebrity.

2
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,960
No wonder you just walk around
like you own the place.

3
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,320
You think I made up my profit numbers?

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,400
It brings in great income
because you use low-quality materials.

5
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,360
Why don't you take a picture
of the real queen of TV ratings

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,320
and the new queen of TV ratings,
both of us together?

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,200
Step down from the leading lady role.

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,160
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,720
I'll help cover up
the news of your miscarriage.

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,920
What's going on?

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,280
Hey. Hey!

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,280
What happened?

13
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,280
Suddenly I couldn't brake.

14
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,920
I got so scared.

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,920
A brake fluid leak.
That's why you couldn't brake.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,480
But how?

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,960
I just had my car checked yesterday.

18
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,320
They said everything was fine.

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,840
Then, that means your life's in danger.

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,840
Someone must have tampered with it

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,000
before you left.

22
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,640
Are you trying to scare me?

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,880
Honey.

24
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,800
Rath.

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,280
I'm scared.

26
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,160
What happened?

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,720
I went to see you at the studio,

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
but they said you already left.

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,280
So I was going to find you at home,
but then I saw you here.

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,320
I was so worried.

31
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,600
Are you alright?

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,160
I'm fine.

33
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,160
I just got scared
because suddenly I couldn't brake.

34
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,720
It's just an accident. You can relax now.

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,600
What if it's not?

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,360
What are you on about?

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,040
Quit talking nonsense.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,440
I appreciate you parking here to help me,

39
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,760
but that doesn't mean
I have to believe everything you say.

40
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,920
Let's go home.

41
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,920
Leave your car here. I'll take care of it.

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,040
I've got great news

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,960
about the Star Sea Channel audition.

44
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,560
Didn't I tell you

45
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,960
not to tell anyone about the audition?

46
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,120
If you get in trouble again, I won't help.

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,760
-Not even my mom?
-No.

48
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,800
Even if I did tell her,

49
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,800
she wouldn't care.

50
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,400
Then behave well,

51
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,320
do your best at the audition,

52
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,320
work hard to become famous

53
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,560
so that your mom will love you even more.

54
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,760
Got it?

55
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,360
About your car,

56
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,400
I had Pumeth find a new auto shop for you.

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,320
The old shop did such a poor job.
How could they miss the damage?

58
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,680
If you had been hurt,
I would've sued them.

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,760
At least I'm okay.
Let's just forget about it.

60
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,720
Think of our party today

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,720
as a way to make up for the scare.

62
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
Whatever you want to do,

63
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,920
whoever you want to invite, feel free.

64
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,720
Are you sure?

65
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,160
If you spoil me this much,

66
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,160
don't complain later.

67
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,840
I won't.

68
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,960
I checked with the auto shop for you.

69
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,160
In Mrs. Patchanin's car,

70
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,280
someone definitely drilled the reservoir.

71
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,840
So the brake fluid leaked
and that's why she couldn't brake.

72
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,360
Just like I suspected.

73
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,880
Mr. Taweerath's wife is being targeted.

74
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,720
But by who?

75
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,280
And why?

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,240
You're two minutes late.

77
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,800
Now you mop so I can nap.

78
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,120
But you work a full shift too.

79
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,520
You think because Pop's not here,
you can take a nap?

80
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,960
Think of it as payback for
skipping work to go to your audition.

81
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,640
Here.

82
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,200
Wow, this guy.

83
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,800
Pu!

84
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,520
Mrs. Pat!

85
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,920
The invitations for your party
just came in!

86
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you for helping out, Kiki.

87
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,960
It's a shame I won't be there.
I wanted to get drunk.

88
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,680
-Don't worry, next time.
-Okay.

89
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,520
Here's yours, Dada.

90
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,640
And please give this one to Rati.

91
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,560
Thank you.

92
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,440
How fancy these cards are,

93
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,480
fitting for an upper-class
superstar neighbor like you.

94
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,320
Can I get another one for Dao?

95
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,840
Would she want to come?

96
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,760
Of course she would.

97
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,840
It would be good for
Mr. Taweerath's image if she went.

98
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,560
You're neighbors after all.

99
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,240
If word got out that she didn't go,

100
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,280
what would people think? Right, Dada?

101
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,240
Right, Kiki.

102
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
Here. Please give it to Dao for me.

103
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
Thank you on her behalf.

104
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,720
Oh, you work here?

105
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,400
I work here part-time.

106
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,400
But I just started, so I just found out
it's close to Mrs. Pat's house.

107
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,160
Tell me if you need anything else.

108
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,640
Oh, Pat.

109
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,000
Are you inviting the new neighbors too?

110
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,080
Who are they?

111
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,080
The big house down the road.
I heard he's the CEO of some big company.

112
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,640
You should befriend him.

113
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,160
But I've never even seen his face.

114
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,320
I haven't either.

115
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,960
Talking about me?

116
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,280
It's Mr. Tham?

117
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,240
If you meant the owner
of the big house down the road,

118
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
that would be me.

119
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,799
Oh, great.

120
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,080
We were just talking about inviting you

121
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,919
to the party over at Pat's.

122
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,039
Here's your invitation.

123
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,320
You seem to have a lot of free time.

124
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,920
And though I may not have
a lot of time for nonsense,

125
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,040
I'm happy to make time for this.

126
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,840
My husband and I have a lot of friends,

127
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,280
so naturally we throw parties sometimes.

128
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,200
But those who are bad at making friends

129
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,040
probably wouldn't understand.

130
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,240
They may be bad at making friends

131
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,600
only because their so-called friends

132
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,560
are not as genuine as they think.

133
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,600
Well, those who are
cynical and pessimistic

134
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,080
are likely to never meet anyone genuine.

135
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,800
Bro!

136
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,480
How convenient.

137
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,640
Help me out here. You know how broke I am.

138
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,640
Please?

139
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,880
Just a little?

140
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
Here.

141
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,480
Thank you so much, bro.

142
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,640
You're even nicer to me than Mom is.

143
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,280
Don't be so dramatic.

144
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,040
You're only in this situation

145
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,120
because Mom had you intern here
to straighten you out.

146
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,600
Shh!

147
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,520
Quiet down.

148
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,080
Why?

149
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,360
Afraid people will find out
you're the heir of the owner of

150
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,160
a huge coffee shop franchise like J Cup?

151
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,200
Lord Janepob?

152
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,960
Please, bro, I beg you.

153
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,360
I don't want the people here

154
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,960
to know who I am.

155
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,200
I think you should leave

156
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,720
before everyone hears what you said.

157
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,440
-See ya.
-Wait, you stopped me just for my money?

158
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,400
Ah!

159
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,320
You know Mr. Tham too?

160
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,520
Oh, Mr. Tham?

161
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,200
Yeah, he's helped me out before.
That's how I know him.

162
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,040
You have money problems?

163
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,560
Yes.

164
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,200
Big problems.

165
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,920
Why?

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,360
You wanna lend me some too?

167
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,720
Don't be silly.
I'm barely getting by myself.

168
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,920
I can't afford to help you.

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,320
Go back to work.

170
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,200
Mrs. Pat.

171
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Someone left this in your mailbox, ma'am.

172
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,680
Did you see who left it?

173
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,960
No.

174
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,960
Could you put this in my room for me?

175
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,520
Of course.

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,080
DO NOT OPEN AT HOME

177
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,240
Do not open at home?

178
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Mrs. Pat, someone left this
in your mailbox ma'am.

179
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
Something wrong, honey?

180
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,160
You've been looking anxious all evening.

181
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,440
Got an issue with the party?

182
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,200
Everything's fine.

183
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,840
But you might be seeing someone
you don't like at the party.

184
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,600
Who?

185
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,040
I'm sorry,

186
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,080
I just found out he's our new neighbor.

187
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,160
I had to invite him just to be polite.

188
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,440
He moved all this way
to get close to us, huh?

189
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,240
You're saying that as if he intended to.

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,400
He took away my investor,

191
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,120
stuck close to you
throughout the audition,

192
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,800
and now he moves close to us?

193
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,280
How could I not be suspicious of that?

194
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,360
And why would he do this?

195
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,680
I have no idea.

196
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,000
But I'm worried about you.

197
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,640
You know you're the most important to me.

198
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,440
Sure, take away my work opportunity,

199
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,520
but if you take away my wife,

200
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,640
I won't stand for it.

201
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,160
I want you to wear this necklace

202
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,880
at the party.

203
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,280
I know you're already the prettiest,

204
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,440
but I want my wife
to be the most beautiful at the party.

205
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,600
Thank you.

206
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,800
Just a thank you?

207
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,240
Mrs. Pat!

208
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,520
I found this on the floor.

209
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,920
So you saw it.

210
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,600
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

211
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,760
Let me know if I can help in any way.

212
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,280
Thank you, Pu.

213
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,280
It just arrived today.

214
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,520
I picked your favorite color.

215
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,240
Try holding it.

216
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,320
I know you're already the prettiest,

217
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,400
but I want my wife
to be the most beautiful at the party.

218
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,400
Thank you.

219
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,440
This one's wilting. Let's replace it.

220
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,560
-This one?
-Yes.

221
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,960
What about this one?

222
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,040
Dada, you told me only
Aunt Pat's close friends are invited here.

223
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,840
Judging by her looks,

224
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,560
she's probably not a guest.

225
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm here to help Mrs. Pat out.

226
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,520
Ah,

227
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,040
so Aunt Pat
asked you to help out her servants?

228
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,520
Well, where's Pat?

229
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,560
She's getting dressed.
Make yourself at home.

230
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,760
Don't you think you should ask your guests

231
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,040
if they need anything?

232
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,840
I'll have the staff help you.

233
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,800
No, you do it.

234
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Serve me and my aunt.

235
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,360
You've always worked in customer service.

236
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,400
You should know what to do.

237
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,040
Oh, so this explains why

238
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,280
you keep getting fired from jobs.

239
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,000
If you're unhappy

240
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,720
taking care of the guests here,

241
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,040
then just leave.

242
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
I'll let the host know

243
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,480
that you don't want to serve anyone here.

244
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,760
Let's go.

245
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,640
You said you had a problem with the host.

246
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,000
Then why are you here?

247
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,200
Don't tell me

248
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,080
you came just because they invited you.

249
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,360
I'm only here to find the truth.

250
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,240
What truth?

251
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,120
Why do you care?

252
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,680
Just do your job
as my entourage and chauffeur.

253
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,480
Okay, Boss.

254
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,040
Mr. Tham.

255
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,080
Mr. Taweerath told me you'd come

256
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,800
so he asked me to welcome you.

257
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,240
I thought no one would be here
to welcome me.

258
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,360
Though we didn't get to work together,

259
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
Mr. Taweerath still hopes

260
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,640
that we can collaborate
on another project in the future.

261
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,440
That's why they say,
"In the world of business,

262
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,880
we have no eternal allies,

263
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,760
and we have no perpetual enemies," right?

264
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,280
He's my chauffeur.

265
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,520
I see.

266
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,480
Would you like a drink?
I'll have someone serve you.

267
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,200
No thank you. I'm good.

268
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,400
Alright.

269
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,800
Bro.

270
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,760
I'll go check over there,

271
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,440
see if there's anything.

272
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,880
Here's what you asked for.

273
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,440
Wait.

274
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,200
I asked for orange juice.

275
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,000
This isn't it.

276
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,960
You asked for mineral water,

277
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
no ice.

278
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,720
That was what Aunt Dao asked for, not me.

279
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,600
I wanted orange juice.

280
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,560
You have a really bad memory.

281
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,760
Go get it.

282
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,480
If I'd brought you orange juice,

283
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,880
you'd have said you wanted
something else, right?

284
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,760
And if so,

285
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,200
what are you gonna do?

286
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,520
Then I'll keep in mind

287
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,000
it's not my memory that's bad,

288
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,600
but your personality,
always asking for trouble with others.

289
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
A cheap person like you

290
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,400
would dare to insult me? Huh?

291
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,320
How high do you think you are?

292
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,280
If your attitude and heart are cheap,

293
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,840
you're no better than me.

294
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,120
Damn it, Ava!

295
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,360
Are you crazy?!

296
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,240
-Are you crazy?
-No, you're crazy!

297
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,280
Ava, you're nuts!

298
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,240
You're nuts!

299
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,880
Nuts!

300
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,280
Shoot!

301
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,040
Ava!

302
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,640
Let's go, Pu.

303
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,680
Damn you, Pu!

304
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,760
You made a guest fall in the pool.
Are we screwed?

305
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,240
I'm the one who caused it.
Why do you care?

306
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,480
And why are you here…

307
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,880
all dressed up?

308
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,440
I'm Mr. Tham's chauffeur tonight.

309
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,360
That's why I'm all dressed up.

310
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,320
Thanks for helping me though.

311
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,520
Or I could've fallen in too.

312
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,480
Why did you get into a fight with her?

313
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,280
You know Ava is Ms. Ingdao's niece, right?

314
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,320
I don't want to get into fights,

315
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,840
but I can't just stand there
and let someone pick on me either.

316
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,360
Wow, what a fighter you are.

317
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,760
Yeah, fighting through poverty.

318
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,040
You won't believe how fast
my savings are disappearing these days.

319
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,320
I'll get back to work now.

320
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,520
A girl's golf glove.

321
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,720
Who's the girl in this picture?

322
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,000
We don't have much time.

323
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,240
I don't want anyone suspecting

324
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,120
why we're both missing.

325
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,880
Rath.

326
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,320
What were you doing in the guest bedroom?

327
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,040
Um…

328
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,000
I…

329
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,360
Honey, wait!

330
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,040
Ava.

331
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Thanks to you both

332
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,680
for lending me your clothes.

333
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,640
I would've been so embarrassed.

334
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,320
I was all wet

335
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,200
because of your kid.

336
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,600
What happened?

337
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,400
Ava got into a fight with Pu,

338
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,640
the kid who's helping you.

339
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,040
I let her shower and change here
to avoid a scene.

340
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,200
I'll have your clothes dried for you.

341
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,720
I hope you'll forgive that kid.

342
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,040
Fine.

343
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,160
Just because you asked,
I won't take it any further with her.

344
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,960
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go find Aunt Dao now.

345
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,320
I took care of your kid's issue.

346
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,280
Are you ready?
Everyone's waiting to see the host.

347
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,360
You're so pretty today, honey.

348
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,640
Go on downstairs.

349
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
I'll meet you there later.

350
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,280
Alright then.

351
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,240
Where are they? Rati, have you seen them?

352
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,520
I know, right? I haven't either.

353
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,360
And where the heck is Ava?

354
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,200
There she is.

355
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,920
Where were you? And why did you change?

356
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,360
I spilled my drink, so I changed.

357
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,640
I really appreciate you

358
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,200
inviting me today.

359
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,920
It's all thanks to my wife.

360
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,440
-She organized the party all by herself.
-Right.

361
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,360
Everyone, there's my wife!

362
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,880
Hey!

363
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,040
Honey!

364
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,240
Honey, get up.

365
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,600
Are you okay?

366
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,360
I'm fine.

367
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,920
Sorry, everyone.

368
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,680
I'll take her inside for now.

369
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,920
Pumeth, you take it from here.

370
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,040
It's a good thing no one got hurt.

371
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,840
You must've been so scared.
You can relax now.

372
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,360
But if Mr. Tham hadn't saved me in time,

373
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,080
I would have…

374
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,160
I'll thank him for you.

375
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,800
We should call off the party for now.

376
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,560
After what just happened,
it'll be hard to have fun.

377
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,320
Will you be fine here alone?
I'll go tell the guests first.

378
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,720
Of course.

379
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,000
It's a shame that happened.
The party was going great.

380
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,640
But suddenly there was an accident.

381
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,040
I heard that lately
bad things keep happening to you.

382
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,000
Here,

383
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,520
drink some water,

384
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,480
so you'll feel better.

385
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,440
I'm alright.

386
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,160
What do you really want to say?

387
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,480
I'm just worried about you.

388
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,960
Why do you have to be upset?

389
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,480
We used to be friends after all.

390
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,400
When something like this happens,

391
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,240
of course I'm worried about you.

392
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,800
Want something hot to eat?
I'll go get it for you.

393
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,600
What are you doing?

394
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,720
How did you know bad things
have been happening to me lately?

395
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,400
Tell me,

396
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,600
what do you know?

397
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,200
Or could it be

398
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,000
that you sent me the photos?

399
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Or are you the girl in the photos?

400
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,160
What on earth are you on about?

401
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,880
Pat, calm down.

402
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,560
What's going on?

403
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Every guest needs an invitation.

404
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,680
So you're saying outsiders can't be here?

405
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,000
Correct.

406
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,800
I made sure every guest is on the list.

407
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,280
How could there be an outsider?

408
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,280
I see you're talking to the staff.

409
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,800
Are you suspecting something?

410
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,239
I was just wondering

411
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,280
if someone messed with that thing
and caused it to fall.

412
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,719
You're working hard
for someone who's just a guest.

413
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
At least working hard

414
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,360
is better than being careless

415
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,800
and messing up

416
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,960
to the point
where your host could get hurt.

417
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,960
Looks like the party's over.

418
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,719
You may leave now.

419
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,320
Go ahead, sir.

420
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,360
I saw someone messing with the chandelier.

421
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,000
What are you talking about?

422
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,560
This isn't your job.

423
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,880
She saw something unusual.

424
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,760
Don't you think we should listen?

425
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,000
What did you see Pu?

426
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,520
I've been here helping since noon.

427
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,040
And I saw…

428
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,120
Done. You can bring it back up.

429
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,040
I thought they were just cleaning,
so I didn't think much of it.

430
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,880
If someone really
was sabotaging the chandelier,

431
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,720
then what were the staff doing there?

432
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,920
How surprising.

433
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,640
You probably misunderstood.

434
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,280
I'm just telling you what I saw.

435
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,440
Do you remember what they looked like?

436
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,400
I do.

437
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,840
Are they here?

438
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
There they are!

439
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,000
Go!

440
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,920
You should leave.

441
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,440
About the photo of a girl,

442
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,160
don't tell me

443
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,080
you and Rath are fighting.

444
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,400
Quit speculating.

445
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,280
Mrs. Pat.

446
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,920
Mr. Tham found the suspects
who caused the chandelier to fall.

447
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,040
Why are you looking at me?

448
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,560
Nothing.

449
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,760
Pu told me the culprits were here.

450
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,840
They're the ones who made
the star-shaped chandelier fall?

451
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,080
It's a shame they got away.

452
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,880
Who knows?

453
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,400
Maybe someone set up a scheme

454
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,680
or stirred up a situation

455
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,920
to mess with my wife's party.

456
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,960
Are you saying I set this up

457
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,760
to stir up a situation?

458
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,320
He didn't mention any names.

459
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,720
That's right.

460
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,840
Why do you sound guilty?

461
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,280
Come to think of it,

462
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,600
Pat's had two accidents,

463
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,280
and both times you were there.

464
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,800
I can't help but be suspicious.

465
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,920
Perhaps I got too involved.

466
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,560
I went from a guy with goodwill

467
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,560
to a bad guy.

468
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,760
Jane, where are you?
Hurry up and come out.

469
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,440
I'm going home.

470
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,200
Mr. Tham.

471
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,800
Why follow the mastermind
who stirred up the situation?

472
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,280
Won't your husband worry?

473
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,520
You really do act suspicious though.

474
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:10,200
But I must thank you for saving me.

475
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,760
But what if I'm a bad guy
like your husband said?

476
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,920
That means you're thanking me for nothing.

477
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,040
If you really have bad intentions,

478
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,920
you'll get caught eventually.

479
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,000
If I wanted
to press charges against you then,

480
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,840
I'd still have time.

481
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,560
But,

482
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,240
thank you for today.

483
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,440
You're welcome.

484
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,840
But I must tell you,

485
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,520
stop wasting time suspecting me

486
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,200
because what happened today
was no accident.

487
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,200
Someone is trying to hurt you.

488
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,720
Are you still mad at me

489
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,200
because I took away your chance
to get close to my wife?

490
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,800
Your wife?

491
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,800
Which one?

492
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,960
Ms. Ingdao was on the phone
with a committee member.

493
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,560
She asked them to give Ava
more points than the others.

494
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,200
If you're helping Dao rig the scores,
I won't stand for it.

495
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,800
I saw it,
they were really sabotaging Chompunuch.

496
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,520
You should have told Mrs. Pat.

497
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,120
I won't lose to that couple again.

498
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,520
Those who trample on others

499
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,840
and steal their opportunities,

500
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,960
I hate them the most.

501
