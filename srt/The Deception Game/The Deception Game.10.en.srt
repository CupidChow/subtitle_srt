8

-Here you go.
-Thank you.

9
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm your fan.

10
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,760
-Thank you.
-Can we hug?

11
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,960
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

12
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,360
-Remember to vote for number two.
-Sure.

13
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,440
Pu,

14
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,520
you've gained thousands more followers.

15
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,560
Check it out.

16
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,560
AVA 49%, PU 38%

17
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,800
AVA 54%, PU 49%

18
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,840
AVA 61%, PU 70%

19
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,680
Voting is closed.

20
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,360
How's that possible?

21
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,760
We have our winner now.

22
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,720
Pu, oh, Pu.

23
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,680
Going to work even though
you have an award ceremony?

24
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,959
I saw the ceremony starts this evening,

25
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,399
so I'm helping Jane at work first.

26
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,240
Plus, my manager's not there,

27
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,280
and usually
we get a lot of customers today.

28
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,760
Then I was right
to come pick you up with this van.

29
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,800
Come to think of it,
he's been driving a while,

30
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,520
and we're still nowhere near.

31
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,560
It's like he's driving in circles.

32
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
Can we stop by a gas station?

33
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,120
I need to use the restroom.

34
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,600
Of course.

35
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,400
Is something going on?

36
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,280
Aunt Dao,
am I really losing to that Pu girl?

37
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,560
Well, it's how the votes turned out.

38
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,800
What do you want us to do Ava?

39
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,360
Maybe you won't.

40
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,200
That's right.

41
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
Because if the winner can't make it,

42
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,080
the runner-up will win

43
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,080
instead.

44
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,600
RECORDING FOR TV

45
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,880
We're at a gas station.

46
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
Anyway, I'll make sure they won't make it.

47
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,640
Come on, Pu.

48
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,800
I'll take you there.

49
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,960
Go!

50
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,400
-Hey, you!
-Stop it!

51
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,240
Who hired you to do this?

52
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,920
What are you talking about?

53
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,240
I know you were trying to delay us.

54
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,720
Tell whoever hired you

55
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,960
that you can't stop the winner

56
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,160
by playing outside the rules.

57
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,960
There's no way.

58
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,760
Please get ready now.

59
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
Why?

60
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,920
We're starting sooner.

61
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,720
Why the change?

62
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,480
The higher-ups who are giving the award

63
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,800
need to be somewhere later.

64
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,640
After

65
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,000
your opening speech,

66
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,440
you can go ahead and announce the winner.

67
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,480
But Chompunuch isn't here yet.

68
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,160
She's always been irresponsible.

69
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,640
If she can't make it or she's late,

70
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
we'll have to disqualify her

71
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,920
and let someone else win.

72
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,120
We can do that?

73
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,560
No matter what,
we'll have to announce the winner

74
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,960
in front of the media.

75
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,320
This is the station's contest,

76
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,160
not just some school contest

77
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,200
where you can announce the winner
in their absence.

78
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,760
It will ruin our show's reputation.

79
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,440
You're not the only one

80
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,040
sponsoring our show.

81
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,880
If Chompunuch can't make it,

82
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,720
we'll have to let Ava win, no matter what.

83
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,640
Get inside, Pu.

84
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
What?

85
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,440
You don't have to get inside.

86
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,160
They already changed the winner.

87
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,280
But how?

88
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,920
You can change it just like that?

89
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,520
It's already started?

90
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,800
Yeah.

91
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,280
Come on, Pu!

92
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,200
Stop!

93
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,440
First, we must thank you all

94
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,480
for coming to hear our announcement

95
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,720
of Star Sea's winner today.

96
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
We appreciate all the votes

97
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,880
you have given.

98
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,840
Before we announce our winner,

99
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,840
let's watch the self-introduction videos

100
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,840
of our three finalists one more time.

101
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,280
Let's take a look.

102
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,480
Get back here!

103
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,160
Where on Earth is Pu?

104
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,800
You're not going to make it in time.

105
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Dao, you!

106
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,160
Kiki,

107
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,880
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

108
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,560
Anyway,

109
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,600
deal with it yourself.
I have to get inside now.

110
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,760
Sorry.

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,640
That witch.

112
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
What do I do now?

113
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,040
Kiki, I'm here!

114
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,320
Pu!

115
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,400
Your dress…

116
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,040
And now, I have the winner in my hands.

117
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,200
If the winner can't be on stage in time,

118
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,680
we'll have to change the winner,
according to the rules.

119
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
You're going in that state?

120
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,840
Pu,

121
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,840
do you trust me?

122
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,640
-Yes.
-Then do as I tell you.

123
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,880
Jane,

124
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,360
can I borrow your apron?

125
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,480
Alright, it looks like the time has come.

126
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,320
Please welcome Star Sea's three finalists

127
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,440
up on the stage!

128
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,280
Why are there only two?
Where's the other one?

129
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,720
I'll be announcing the winner now.

130
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,320
One second.

131
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,200
Is she here to deliver coffee?

132
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,200
Chompunuch is here.

133
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,720
Now we can announce
the real winner, right?

134
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,360
You want to do it
with her looking like that?

135
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,640
It'll be so embarrassing.

136
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,360
And the winner is--

137
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Whoever it is,
please wait just a little longer.

138
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Because today we have a special guest.

139
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,680
Although she's not here as a judge
for our final round,

140
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,440
she's come to encourage
our three finalists.

141
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,760
Please welcome Patchanin.

142
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,640
Hello everyone.

143
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,360
First of all, I want to

144
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,760
congratulate our three finalists,

145
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,040
Ava, Captain,

146
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,280
and especially Pu.

147
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,880
The girl is a fighter.

148
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,200
She has her family struggles
to take care of,

149
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,840
yet she won't leave her dreams behind.

150
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,200
Even though today
is an important day for Pu,

151
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,320
she still had to go to work

152
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,400
because that job

153
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,920
is just as important for her.

154
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,360
But due to an accident,

155
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,480
she's wearing this outfit.

156
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,240
I hope that Star Sea

157
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,800
won't overlook
a determined person like her,

158
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,360
and I hope you all

159
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,520
see her effort just as I do.

160
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,000
-Good luck, Pu!
-Good luck, Pu!

161
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,040
Good luck, Pu!

162
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,360
Announce the winner.

163
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,400
Whatever rules you made up,
they don't matter anymore.

164
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,840
And the winner of the Star Sea contest

165
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,440
is…

166
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,480
Pu,

167
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,840
Chompunuch, number two.

168
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,200
Congratulations, Chompunuch.

169
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,840
"I've been there."

170
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,080
"She gave great service,
and she's pretty."

171
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,360
"I'll visit again to ask for a photo."

172
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,680
"The girl's a fighter."

173
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,680
"My vote for her was totally worth it."

174
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,720
And there's more.

175
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,760
"Didn't even have to dress up,
still an absolute win."

176
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,040
"I never judge people
by their clothes anyway."

177
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
"Looking forward to her acting skills."

178
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,680
They're all compliments.

179
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,120
Congrats, Pu.

180
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
Thank you.

181
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,600
You always carry this with you?

182
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,000
I meant to bring it.

183
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,960
Can you hold onto it for now?

184
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,880
I had a goal

185
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,440
to work in the industry

186
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,680
until I can afford a house.

187
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,720
Only then will I put this
somewhere I'll feel the proudest.

188
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,320
Of course.

189
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,800
I'll keep it safe

190
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,080
till the day you want it back.

191
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,880
Thank you, Miss Pat.

192
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,880
You got this.

193
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,800
Is your niece still upset
about losing to Pu?

194
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,760
Ava's never lost to anyone before.

195
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,800
She'll need some time to get over it.

196
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,680
It's not just Pu that people are praising.

197
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,800
Even the video of Pat onstage

198
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,960
is being shared everywhere.

199
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,200
First the star, and now her mentor too.

200
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,040
They're both getting
so much positive attention.

201
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,400
But if a scandal
were to steal the spotlight,

202
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,600
all that positive publicity would vanish.

203
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,800
I really want to know.

204
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,360
What exactly is going on
between you and Pat?

205
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,000
I wouldn't dare tell you.

206
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,760
Dao!

207
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,200
I take such good care of you,

208
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,120
yet you don't trust me?

209
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,960
I don't want to end up on the news.

210
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,599
Just see for yourself.

211
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,359
Oh my god, Dao!

212
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,440
This wasn't just
an accident on set, was it?

213
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,920
Dada, please don't tell anyone.

214
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,920
Pat shot me.

215
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,200
Rati, I've got some tea to spill,

216
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,360
but keep this a secret, okay?

217
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
Apparently, Pat shot Dao.

218
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,520
Poor Dao.

219
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,440
I'll send you the photo.

220
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,560
Don't show it to anyone.

221
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,240
Very soon,

222
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,800
the reporters will hear about this.

223
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,000
Your light won't shine for long, Pat.

224
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,000
I will put it out myself, just wait.

225
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,200
There they are!

226
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,920
What are you doing here?

227
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,040
We'd like to interview Pat.

228
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,000
There's nothing to interview about.

229
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,720
About what? Star Sea's over.

230
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,520
About how you shot Dao.

231
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,960
That's not true!

232
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,240
-Who told you that?
-Look.

233
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,640
There's a photo of Ingdao
in the hospital. Can you see it?

234
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,640
And rumor has it
from insiders that Pat was

235
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,960
a brutally jealous wife,
which is why her husband divorced her.

236
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,200
-Is that true?
-It's not true!

237
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,720
Then tell us the real story.

238
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,040
I'm telling you, it's not true!

239
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,880
If you don't speak up,
we'll assume it is true.

240
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
-No!
-Come with me.

241
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,680
-It's not true!
-Pat!

242
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Where is she going?

243
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,200
-What?
-Pat!

244
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,360
What is it?

245
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,040
You wanted to talk about something
that's not a personal matter, right?

246
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,600
It's business-related.

247
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,680
Business?

248
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,840
My company is launching a new condo.

249
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,240
We would like you
to be our brand ambassador.

250
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,760
If that's what this is about,

251
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,160
you should be talking to my agent, Kiki.

252
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,240
Looks like I skipped a step.

253
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,200
But that's okay,

254
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,080
since you came to talk to me directly,

255
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,920
I'll just give you my answer.

256
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,880
I'm going to have to decline.

257
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,080
Wait.

258
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,880
Can you tell me

259
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,120
why?

260
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,800
Don't you see?

261
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,320
There are so many bad rumors about me.

262
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,560
And you're the CEO.

263
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,160
Who would want to work with me?

264
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,160
I want you to really think this through,

265
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,480
how it will affect your company.

266
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,760
Is there really nothing I can do?

267
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,080
Why are you doing this?

268
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,440
If it's for me,

269
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,280
you don't need to.

270
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,280
So, you finally managed to
escape the reporters.

271
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,320
You did this too, right?

272
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,720
You really enjoy framing me.

273
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,880
Anyway,

274
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,320
let's get to the point.

275
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,400
The reason I wanted to talk to you, Pat,

276
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,840
is that I want you

277
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,600
to give up your shares in the school.

278
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,440
-Give up my shares?
-Yes.

279
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Well, you were the one who said

280
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,200
you wanted to give up your shares,
so I took care of it.

281
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,880
You gave me back the money, and now

282
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
you're telling me to give up my shares

283
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,560
because someone's been helping you, right?

284
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,360
All of this happened

285
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,680
because you forced my hand.

286
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,920
It was only when I had no way out

287
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,840
that I found out who my true friend is.

288
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,600
Thank you so much, Dao,

289
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,400
for becoming the school's new shareholder.

290
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,560
Remember what I once told you?

291
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,440
This is just the start.

292
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,600
Just wait till
the day you lose everything.

293
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Dao! Are you okay?

294
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,880
Hey, Pat!

295
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,000
Wasn't that a bit too barbaric?

296
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,840
She didn't do anything to you.

297
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,760
Why did you have to do that?

298
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
She's someone who's lost so much

299
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,320
and brings trouble upon herself,

300
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
acting like a lunatic all the time,

301
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,760
so I won't mind her.

302
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,440
You play the victim so often
that it's practically in your blood.

303
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,280
Listen,

304
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,400
if you're the villain,

305
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,440
you'll never be the heroine.

306
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,640
Those who do evil

307
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,480
always meet the same fate.

308
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,800
Yes, yes, I understand.

309
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,160
Look forward to
working with you next time.

310
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,120
Yes, yes, thank you.

311
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,320
Kiki.

312
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
Done talking to Jarinya?

313
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,640
Is there something else?

314
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,880
Get this, Pat.

315
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,000
Because of the false rumors,

316
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,040
all the clients
have called off their deals with us.

317
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,880
And Som's drama too.
She wants you to take a break.

318
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,040
I'm on a long break then, right?

319
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,320
Pat, listen to me.

320
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,480
For now, we just need to wait
until the news dies down.

321
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,360
But don't get discouraged.

322
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,480
Just trust me,

323
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,560
I'll keep an eye on the trends
and get you a new deal.

324
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,400
Thank you, Kiki.

325
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,760
You've got this!

326
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,680
I've never had this much free time, Pu.

327
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,080
Even before,
when I didn't have a drama shoot,

328
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,800
I still had

329
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,080
some other shoots or events to attend

330
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,440
or work to do at home.

331
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,160
Think of it as a chance to rest
and try something new.

332
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,000
I guess so,

333
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,000
but too much rest is not good either.

334
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,600
Plus, I don't want to stay idle
and let my mind run wild.

335
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,520
And then there's my income.

336
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,240
I have almost nothing left now.

337
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,800
I can't stay idle for long.
I'll need a job.

338
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,200
And what do you want to do?

339
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,880
If it's in the industry,

340
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,760
no one will hire me at this point.

341
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,080
I'll probably open a small shop of my own

342
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,480
with just a little capital.

343
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,920
But if I sell the stuff myself,

344
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,080
the rumors won't go away.

345
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,960
Then let me help you.

346
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,880
Thank you, Pu.

347
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,840
Thanks to your advice,
I was able to open this shop.

348
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,040
"Begin."

349
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,360
A new beginning.

350
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,800
It's fitting for my life lately.

351
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,680
I wish you a great new beginning.

352
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,120
Don't worry about being on the news.

353
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,840
I'll sell the stuff for you.

354
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,360
Of course, Miss Shop Owner.

355
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,120
And a waitress too.

356
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,880
How, Pu?

357
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,080
You just won Star Sea.

358
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,520
How can you be a waitress?

359
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,760
I just need this,

360
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,560
and no one will remember me.

361
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,480
Then,

362
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,640
I'll have to wear one too.

363
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,640
-Hi.
-Hi.

364
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,280
Did you just open?
I've never seen this shop before.

365
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,120
Yes, it's our first day.

366
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,320
What can I get for you?

367
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,200
-Got any suggestions?
-Oh.

368
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
Here's our menu.

369
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,480
Even with Pu helping her,

370
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,400
will she be okay?

371
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,520
Well, aren't you the one who told me,

372
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,040
"Everyone needs a first step"?

373
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,720
Miss Pat is just taking hers

374
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,760
after her divorce.

375
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,400
Sure, she went through a divorce,

376
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,880
but they took everything from her.

377
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,720
If you're worried about her,

378
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,320
then find a way to help.

379
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,920
I made her an offer,

380
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,200
but she declined.

381
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,120
There are still many other ways.

382
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,760
And I know you can figure it out.

383
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,440
And more importantly,

384
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,440
she's single now.

385
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,520
So, do your best.

386
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,760
Pu, oh, Pu.

387
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,320
You tricked me into delivering here.

388
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,640
Can I pay for my desserts?

389
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Here you go.

390
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,440
If I had known you ordered,

391
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,600
I wouldn't have come.

392
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,600
And that's why

393
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,160
I told Pu not to tell you.

394
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,200
I wanted to help you out.

395
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,440
Do I look that pathetic?

396
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,760
I didn't mean it that way.

397
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,880
If you're friends with someone
and want to support them

398
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,760
by buying from their new shop,
is that so wrong?

399
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,840
It's not,

400
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,640
but it feels different for us.

401
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,280
I won't take your payment.

402
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,120
I didn't want you to,

403
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,160
and I hope you never do this again.

404
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,520
Sorry, Miss Pat.

405
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,960
I just wanted to help our shop earn more.

406
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,320
If I told you the truth,

407
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,480
you probably
wouldn't deliver it to Mr. Tham.

408
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,240
Don't do this again, Pu.

409
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,600
I don't want Mr. Tham to get involved
with me, so we end up in the news again.

410
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,160
You know I've had
enough struggles with the news.

411
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,080
Okay.

412
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,560
I won't accept his orders again.

413
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,360
But you must see it too.

414
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,080
We're selling less than ten cups a day.

415
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,120
If this goes on,

416
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,960
will it really be okay?

417
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,000
You're right.

418
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,960
I think it's time to do some advertising

419
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,360
to attract more customers.

420
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,160
Then what should we do?

421
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,000
Hand out flyers?

422
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,160
Put up a sign
to let people know we're here?

423
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,800
These days,

424
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,120
all you need is a phone.

425
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Hi everyone. It's me, Pu.

426
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,440
Today, I'm introducing you
to a coffee shop named Begin Coffee.

427
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,680
It's a food truck in a garden.
You got this, Miss Barista!

428
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,280
-Is it good?
-It's so good.

429
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,960
Highly recommended.

430
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,160
It's awesome.

431
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,200
I'll drop a pin for you all.

432
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,680
Remember to check in here.

433
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,360
Ava,

434
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,000
what are you watching?

435
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,080
Just Pu's live.

436
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,320
She opened a shop in a garden.

437
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,920
That Pu girl?

438
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,680
Today, I'm introducing you
to a coffee shop named Begin Coffee.

439
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,880
It's a food truck in a garden.
You got this, Miss Barista.

440
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,120
I'll drop a pin for you all.

441
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,640
Remember to check in here.

442
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,320
Can someone like Pu
really open a shop on her own?

443
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,000
Even if it's just a small shop.

444
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,440
Well, it's because someone
asked her to do this on their behalf.

445
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,760
Who?

446
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,640
-Here you go.
-Is this your shop?

447
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,520
-Yes.
-I'll come here often.

448
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,800
Thank you.

449
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,920
What can I get for you?

450
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,880
I guess all you can do
is watch Miss Pat in secret.

451
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,640
Even just to order desserts,

452
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,480
she wouldn't appreciate you.

453
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,280
I'm relieved to see this.

454
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,440
Pu went live, so she has more customers.

455
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,280
Bro,

456
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,200
isn't that Miss Dao?

457
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,880
Why are you here?

458
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,680
It's Ingdao!

459
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,920
I saw you go live
saying you want customers,

460
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,680
so here I am.

461
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,360
At a small shop like this,

462
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,320
you can just buy everything.

463
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,680
Sounds good.

464
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,440
Then, I'll buy everything.

465
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,440
It's my treat today. Order away.

466
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,960
Didn't you hear?

467
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,720
Get desserts for the customers.

468
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Eat however much you want.
It's Ingdao's treat today.

469
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,280
Can I get you anything else?

470
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Hey, won't you thank Ingdao a little?

471
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,120
Thank you.

472
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,320
Why don't you let the actual owner
thank me herself?

473
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
I'm being this generous.

474
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,520
Show some courage.

475
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,040
The actual owner? Who is it, Dao?

476
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Who?

477
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,360
People may not remember you,

478
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
but since I'm your old friend,

479
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,920
I could tell at a glance that it's you,

480
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,800
Patchanin.

481
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,520
Yes.

482
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
Excuse me.

483
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,560
It's me.

484
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
My god.

485
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,200
Pat, so this is your shop?

486
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,520
Such cute decorations,
and the desserts look good. Let me taste.

487
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,240
Oh dear! How unappetizing!

488
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,480
The drink is dirty too!

489
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,760
Look, god knows what fell in there!

490
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,640
So what people say

491
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,080
that you lost your job as a presenter
and with the dramas and events,

492
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,600
I guess it's all true.

493
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,480
So you opened a trashy shop

494
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,520
selling poor quality stuff like this.

495
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,040
Ew! Just take it!

496
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,200
And they say
she got divorced for infidelity

497
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,360
and was left with nothing as a result.

498
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,480
That must be true as well.

499
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,880
Don't. Don't do it.

500
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,480
If you show up now,

501
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,280
it will only make things worse.

502
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,760
You sure do know a lot
about others' business.

503
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,520
But who knows if what you know is true.

504
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,719
Hey! We've been in the industry
for so long.

505
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,120
We know everything,
and we know it for a fact!

506
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,520
Being in the industry for so long,

507
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,840
you should know
what to say and what not to.

508
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,480
You can't just go around saying things

509
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,520
that affects others like this.

510
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,719
That's right.

511
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,920
If you have manners,

512
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,239
you should show it.

513
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,360
Don't just keep it to yourself,

514
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,040
or people will think you have none.

515
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,920
Hey!

516
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,600
Pat, you let your employee
talk to customers like this?

517
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,360
You started it.

518
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,639
Why should she stay quiet?

519
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,840
Actually, we did know

520
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,720
that Pat works here.

521
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,280
But at least we have manners

522
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,120
and know not to disturb her.

523
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,400
She's just doing her job.
Why would you insult her?

524
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,960
So you're not as nice
as you are on screen.

525
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,320
I know, right?

526
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,120
I'll pay for my order.

527
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,160
Don't put it on her tab.

528
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,200
Right, we can pay by ourselves.

529
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,640
Stay strong.

530
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,320
Pay these rude people no mind.

531
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,440
Dao, let's go.

532
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,960
Take your desserts!

533
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
They're good now.

534
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,560
Guess I won't have to
keep it a secret anymore.

535
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,800
You should see it by now,

536
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,680
so many people understand you

537
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
and support you.

538
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,640
In the end,

539
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,560
there are two sides to every story.

540
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,080
The sign has two sides too.

541
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,920
We're closed.

542
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,240
Yes, Pu speaking.

543
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,480
Really? Sure!

544
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,840
I'll come see you tomorrow.

545
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,880
Any good news, Pu?

546
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,480
I'll be playing a drama.

547
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,080
Congrats, Pu!

548
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,760
Leading lady sits.

549
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,000
Villain comes in, and grabs the book.
Have a stare-down.

550
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,000
Talk and slap. Leading man comes in.

551
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,160
Don't slap for real yet.
I'll do several cuts.

552
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,320
Okay?

553
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,240
Ready, let's go.

554
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,280
Whenever you're ready.

555
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,720
Five. Scene three, cut one, take one.

556
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,800
Why did you do that?

557
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,840
Didn't I warn you
not to go anywhere near Akin?

558
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,320
I never did.

559
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
You're just so shameless!

560
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,400
Young lady,

561
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,720
I told you not to slap yet.

562
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,400
Sorry, I got too caught up in it.

563
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,000
We'll edit this part in.

564
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Those at the front, check the script.

565
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,280
Sorry, Pu.

566
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,120
-Camera!
-Speed!

567
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,360
You're just so shameless!

568
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,960
Sorry,

569
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,400
I got caught up in it.

570
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,520
Pu!

571
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,080
What?

572
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,320
Guys, stop them!

573
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,920
You're not the only one who can slap!

574
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,440
Hey! Stop, stop! Cut!

575
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,000
Go take your break and eat,
then we'll continue.

576
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,280
Patchanin,

577
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,680
is this your shop?

578
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,200
Yes. What can I get for you?

579
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,040
We're shooting a show called Ku Match.

580
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,840
We're just a small production.

581
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,960
Today we have an interview
with a guest celebrity,

582
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,760
so we thought we'd film at your shop.

583
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,640
We'll pay you for the trouble

584
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,320
and for the location.

585
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,880
It should take just an hour.

586
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Of course.
We happen to have few customers lately.

587
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,240
So, who are you interviewing?

588
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,400
As your ex-husband,
I just wanted to help you out.

589
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,000
I can help you even more, just ask.

590
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,520
You should have someone by your side.

591
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,920
And if that someone's me…

592
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,680
No matter how good you are,
I don't want to get hurt again.

593
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,800
Stay away from me.

594
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Now everyone thinks that

595
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,440
I only want money.

596
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,880
But I want to give you this.

597
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,120
NEXT EPISODE

598
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,920
I have a surprise for you.

599
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,840
What are you doing?

600
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
I'm ending this once and for all.

601
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,560
