1
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,920
Pat! Pat!

2
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,760
Pat, wait.

3
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,240
I knew it.

4
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,600
A guy like you
could never really feel guilty.

5
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
When you kneeled and begged me,

6
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,280
it was all just an act.

7
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,440
What do you mean?

8
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,800
Pat always knew

9
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,960
you two were scheming something evil.

10
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,080
If you were just insatiable and careless,

11
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,320
I might have believed
you'd really try to change.

12
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,440
But you're far worse than that,
so I didn't buy it.

13
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,920
And you too.

14
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,720
Did you really think
you'd destroy the evidence that easily?

15
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,120
I'm not stupid.

16
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,160
When you got scared by my threat,

17
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
you were pretending?

18
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Yeah.

19
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,240
The phone and the password you got
are just fakes

20
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,360
that Mrs. Pat and I set up for you.

21
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,800
I'll tell you that much.

22
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,760
Thank you, Kiki.

23
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,400
Pu really appreciates it.

24
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,640
Kiki already checked.

25
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,800
Dao's friend owns this place,

26
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,400
so she's definitely up to something.

27
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,200
If you went to work there,

28
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,600
we'd figure out her plans,

29
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,200
but it's too risky for you.

30
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
I'll go.

31
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,480
I can take care of myself.

32
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,920
Thank you, Pu.

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,320
I'll have to count on you.

34
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,480
But I promise
I won't let you get in danger.

35
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,520
And it went just as I thought it would.

36
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,880
My phone's still here.

37
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,720
You idiot.

38
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,760
You really think
you'd be safe helping her?

39
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,360
Of course she'd be fine.

40
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,920
I can tell you,

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,520
all those people you sent to threaten her,

42
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400
they can't be your witnesses anymore.

43
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,880
Can't reach them, huh?
Whatever you tried to use against her,

44
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,320
I'm telling you, it won't work.

45
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,000
And I would never betray Mrs. Pat.

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
You can say that now

47
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
because you're still useful to her.

48
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
But once you stop being useful,

49
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,640
she'll never help you again.

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,320
Not everyone's like you Ms. Dao.

51
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
And when it comes to having a good heart,

52
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,800
you've got a lot less of that
compared to her.

53
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,320
Pu!

54
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't you mess with Pu again.

55
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,880
And you too.

56
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,000
Pack your things and leave by tonight!

57
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,000
Pat, you can't do this to me!

58
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,880
Why not?

59
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,800
We're no longer husband and wife.

60
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,400
Now we can talk
about the divorce for real.

61
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,000
You think I'll let you
divorce me that easily?

62
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,840
Well, see me in court.

63
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
Bye.

64
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,200
Pu.

65
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,960
Don't worry about your brother's bail.

66
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,000
My lawyer will take care of it.

67
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,240
Thank you.

68
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,120
Tonight, I'll pack up
and stay somewhere else for a while

69
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,880
until the divorce is settled.

70
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,080
That would be good.

71
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,600
I'm worried Dao and Rath might hurt you.

72
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,200
Once you're settled in the new place,

73
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,440
give me a call.

74
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,200
Sure.

75
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,600
Grab her.

76
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,040
Where are you going?

77
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,560
Let go.

78
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,120
Let go!

79
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,280
What now?

80
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,480
I'll leave it to you guys.

81
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,560
For real?

82
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Let go!

83
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,880
Let me pleasure you.

84
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,720
Let go!

85
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,240
Ow!

86
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,760
Let me go!

87
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,280
Ow!

88
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,480
Don't let her go! What the hell?

89
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,240
Hi, Jane.

90
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,640
What's that? You can't reach Pu?

91
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,480
But I just dropped her off
at her apartment.

92
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,160
Pu?

93
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,360
Pu!

94
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,200
Where's Pu?

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,320
The door was open when I got here.

96
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
She must be in danger.

97
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,679
What do we do now?

98
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,320
You two just split up. She can't be far.

99
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,800
Jane, keep trying to contact her.

100
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
-Jane!
-Wait! You come with me.

101
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
Wha…

102
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,840
Let go! Let go of me!

103
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,480
-Ow! Ow!
-Come here!

104
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,480
Ugh, you!

105
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,800
-Let go!
-Quite a fighter aren't you?

106
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
Let go of me!

107
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
What are you doing?

108
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,800
Stop it!

109
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,280
Hurry Pu.

110
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,440
Ugh!

111
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,200
A gun! Hurry!

112
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,840
Where did she go?

113
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,000
She got away.

114
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,600
I know that!

115
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,720
The police are here. Go!

116
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,840
Okay.

117
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,320
Is Pu there with you?

118
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,040
Take good care of her.

119
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,400
Wait, where are you going?

120
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,200
I'm going to see Pu.

121
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,800
Pu's safe now. You should stay here.

122
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,760
You told me to wait here
until we hear from Janepob,

123
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,560
but we already found Pu,
so why should I stay?

124
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,040
For both your safety and Pu's.

125
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,720
You saw how dangerous your husband is.

126
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,520
If you go out to see Pu,

127
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,320
you might be followed.

128
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,840
And if you go back home now,

129
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,600
do you think it'll be safe?

130
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,680
You'd better stay away from home
until the divorce is finalized.

131
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,240
And you think I should stay here?

132
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,720
Just for tonight.

133
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,880
I'll stay at my uncle's.

134
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,920
You can stay here.

135
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,720
We'll talk tomorrow. You should rest.

136
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,360
You know,

137
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,240
you didn't have to do all this for me.

138
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,760
You told me yourself

139
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,280
that you'd let me
take revenge on your husband.

140
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,800
Me helping you

141
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,760
is also a form of revenge.

142
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Thank god you saved me in time,

143
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,240
or who knows what would've happened to me.

144
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,720
Are you sure you're okay now?

145
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
Yes.

146
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,760
That guy is more than evil.

147
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,920
You should stay
somewhere safe for a while.

148
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,120
At first I thought that too,

149
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,960
but then he found me.

150
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,640
How's Pat doing?

151
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,160
Pat has Tham taking care of her.

152
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,200
Just focus on yourself for now.

153
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,640
What are you looking for?

154
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,080
My phone's gone.

155
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,040
Even I never thought
he could be this horrible.

156
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,680
You must be so disappointed, right Fah?

157
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,960
And you…

158
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,880
You must feel sad too,
don't you Mr. Tham?

159
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,840
What's wrong Mr. Tham?

160
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,000
I just wanted to make sure

161
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,520
you're still in my room,
not somewhere outside.

162
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,280
Where could I go?
You didn't leave me your keycard.

163
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,000
If I left,
I wouldn't be able to come back.

164
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,200
Plus, I'm already exhausted.

165
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,320
I'm not going anywhere.

166
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,680
Why are you laughing?

167
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,720
I didn't expect you to wear my pajamas.

168
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,280
Um,

169
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,000
is there anything else?
If not, I'm going to get some sleep.

170
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,040
Then you should rest.

171
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,000
I just wanted to make sure you're safe,
or else I can't sleep.

172
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,880
Good night.

173
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,040
Good night.

174
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Pu!

175
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,000
Tham wanted Pu to stay here with you.

176
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
Pu,

177
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
I'm sorry I put you through all of this.

178
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,760
I owe you, after all.

179
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,080
I'll leave you and Pu to rest.

180
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,400
Tomorrow, Tham and I will come by.

181
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,200
If you need anything, just call me.
I'll bring it over tomorrow.

182
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,760
Thank you.

183
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,800
The important thing you asked for.

184
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,640
I may have lost my phone,
but I already backed up the data on here.

185
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,520
I'll keep it.

186
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,120
Thank you so much, Pu.

187
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,280
What do we do next?

188
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,800
I've already contacted my lawyer.

189
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,920
We just have to gather all the evidence
and leave the rest to him.

190
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes, Kiki? What's up?

191
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,200
What video?

192
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,480
The video's just been posted,
but it has nearly 100,000 views.

193
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,160
Everyone's commenting,
saying Pat must be having an affair.

194
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,960
Like I said,

195
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,360
as long as we act first,

196
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,400
we have the upper hand.

197
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,080
Before she tries to mess with us,

198
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,640
we'll strike first.

199
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,840
I was right to choose you.

200
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,200
Since you chose me,

201
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,400
I'll make sure we both win.

202
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,640
How did this happen, Pat?

203
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,280
I'm telling you,

204
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,119
there's no truth in that news whatsoever.

205
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,160
But with those clear photos and videos,

206
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,200
even with your face covered,
anyone can tell it's you.

207
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,280
I'll hold a press conference.

208
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,440
Pat, how are you going to do that?

209
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,200
Just denying it won't be enough.

210
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,480
I've got witnesses and evidence.

211
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,600
And in that condo,

212
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,000
it wasn't just me and Mr. Tham together.

213
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,520
Pu was there too.

214
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,800
And when I went to that bar,

215
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,960
I was looking for Rath.

216
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,120
Okay, okay.

217
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,400
If you have witnesses, I'm relieved.

218
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,360
But where will you hold it?

219
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,800
I'll help,
but make sure you've prepared it all.

220
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,840
Don't embarrass me.

221
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,360
I'll make sure.

222
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,640
So, the press conference

223
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,880
will be at my school.

224
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,720
Why are you filming?

225
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,920
You trying to play journalist?

226
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,320
Kiki…

227
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,080
The only news you'll be reporting
is how you got sued!

228
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,280
Kiki, calm down.

229
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,440
Ugh.

230
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,400
What a day!

231
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,720
-Eek!
-What's up, Kiki?

232
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,200
Jarinya's having
a press conference today too.

233
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,840
Jarinya?

234
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,040
About what?

235
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,360
Ugh,

236
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,680
I'm losing my mind.

237
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,880
This is proof of
my multi-million investment in the school

238
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,320
up until now.

239
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,880
I'll distribute the documents
to each of you.

240
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,760
And these are the checks I wrote

241
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,200
for the company,
only to be withdrawn by Pat.

242
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,120
She claimed she needed
more money for renovations.

243
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,920
She contacted the contractors herself

244
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,840
and took out the money upfront,

245
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,160
but nothing ever got done.

246
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,160
Then the school's reputation took a hit,

247
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,000
and its income plummeted.

248
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,760
She also claimed

249
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,480
she needed more funds
for the school's capital

250
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,480
just until the news would die down.

251
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,000
But suddenly,

252
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,160
all the money disappeared.

253
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,680
Eventually,

254
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,200
I found out that the missing money

255
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,680
had been transferred to Pat.

256
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,040
Ugh, I'm going crazy!

257
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,560
How could Jarinya frame you
for embezzling the school's money?

258
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,880
I know, right?

259
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,680
Because she did it, not me.

260
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,760
And she had a press conference before us.

261
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,440
Now there's news about an affair
and embezzling. What do we do?

262
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,480
Ugh!

263
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,520
I won't just let her frame me.

264
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,400
I'll tell the reporters the whole truth.

265
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,840
I won't let her talk alone.

266
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,160
Good, let's go then.

267
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,480
It's locked!

268
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,920
What do we do now, Pat?

269
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,320
Pat?

270
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,080
Where did you go Pat? What now?

271
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,920
Mrs. Pat.

272
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,680
Where's the press conference?

273
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,400
It already finished.

274
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,720
What about Jarinya?

275
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,760
She already left too.

276
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,840
She said she wouldn't return
to the school for a while,

277
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,400
and the reporters are going back.

278
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,160
In a rush to see the reporters, huh?

279
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,880
I bet the videos
are already viral on social media by now.

280
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,520
You know how competitive
reporters are these days.

281
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,040
You and Rath did this, right?

282
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,560
Spreading rumors about me and Mr. Tham,

283
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,320
and now saying
I embezzled from the school?

284
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,160
How could you blame anyone?

285
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,120
You did it all yourself.

286
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,800
You threatened me, told me to die.

287
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,760
You had an affair
and scammed people out of money.

288
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,320
What's left for you?

289
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,880
Give me some time to think

290
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,880
about what your next case should be.

291
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,840
Sure, you want me to catch a case?

292
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,360
How about assault?

293
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,720
Why did you slap me?

294
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,920
Did you catch that?

295
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,320
I got it in HD, Aunt Dao.

296
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,040
Oh no, she hit Ingdao too?

297
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,200
She's terrible!

298
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,160
And here I thought

299
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,440
she'd be kind and gentle
like she is in her roles.

300
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,200
Good afternoon.

301
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,560
Go!

302
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,200
Did you see the recent video?

303
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,200
What video this time?

304
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,960
Here.

305
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,080
Mrs. Pat assaulted Ms. Dao, it's so clear.

306
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,120
And then there's the news

307
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,400
about her embezzling
from her acting school.

308
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,720
And the news about you and her.

309
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,960
Just for the divorce,

310
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,240
those two would go this far to hurt Pat?

311
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,960
If she sued for divorce,
it would be unfavorable for Taweerath.

312
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,280
So they did it this way
to gain the upper hand.

313
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,920
I guess so.

314
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,720
He won't just lose the marriage license,

315
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,440
but also all the great benefits.

316
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,200
That guy wouldn't want to lose them.

317
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,160
And there's another thing.

318
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,680
-What now?
-Kobsak.

319
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,280
Mrs. Pat's father.

320
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,840
He contacted you.

321
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,440
Do you know what you've done, Pat?

322
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,840
Both your reputation

323
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,440
and mine are almost at their worst now.

324
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,880
But none of the news is true, Dad.

325
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,040
That's good,
you won't have to get divorced.

326
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,800
But Rath had an affair!

327
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Not only did he have another girl,

328
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
he also deceived me.

329
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,720
But he already talked to me about it.

330
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,440
He said it's not true!

331
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,120
I saw it with my own eyes.

332
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,480
I have proof.

333
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,200
That's why I was confident
about the divorce.

334
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,000
Isn't this
embarrassing enough already, Pat?

335
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,200
Or do you want people to talk

336
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,680
about how my only child

337
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,360
has caused me so much pain to death?

338
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,520
Is that what you want, Pat?!

339
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,840
I came as you asked, sir.

340
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,640
You…

341
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,200
It's great that you came

342
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,160
so I can talk to you both at once.

343
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,920
Please go ahead.

344
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
My daughter told me

345
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,280
the news about her and you

346
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,920
isn't true.

347
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,760
And I believe so.

348
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,480
Thank you

349
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,280
for trusting that your daughter

350
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,560
would never do something so disgraceful.

351
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,960
Of course I'd trust my daughter
whom I've raised well.

352
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,320
And I trust that my daughter

353
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,040
wouldn't disappoint her father.

354
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,920
To prevent things from getting any worse,

355
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,880
to save her reputation, and also yours,

356
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,040
I demand that
you stop talking to or meeting with her.

357
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,360
Do not ever contact Pat again.

358
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,440
Because otherwise,

359
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,920
it might even damage your company.

360
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,360
That damage you speak of,

361
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,120
would come from someone powerful?

362
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
I can't say for sure.

363
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,040
Maybe the damage will come from yourself,

364
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,360
from someone else,

365
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,400
or even from me.

366
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,120
Everything's possible.

367
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,520
I hope you understand.

368
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,800
You don't look like you'd have a hard time
understanding things,

369
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,160
isn't that right, Tham?

370
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,280
Sorry

371
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,120
for getting you in trouble too.

372
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,880
He only does this
because he cares about you.

373
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,800
I'm still getting a divorce.

374
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,640
But my dad, he…

375
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,840
He probably hasn't seen
Taweerath's true nature.

376
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,880
That's why he doesn't want you to do it.

377
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,520
I'll find a way to help you.

378
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,320
You shouldn't.

379
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,880
So you don't want me to help you anymore.

380
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,600
I just don't want to trouble you anymore.

381
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,280
You know,

382
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,480
my reputation can't get any worse.

383
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,400
I don't want to drag you
into this mess I'm facing.

384
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,760
Mrs. Pat--

385
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,880
And even if you want to help me,

386
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,480
to hold my hand, or cheer me up,

387
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,680
but in the eyes of those
who believe the news,

388
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,640
even just to see us holding hands,

389
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,240
they'll think we're having an affair.

390
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,440
If it's so hard for them

391
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,440
to face their Karma,

392
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,080
I'll find a way
to gently negotiate with Rath.

393
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,160
Just to get myself out of it.

394
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,920
I don't want to.

395
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,720
Hmm?

396
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,080
I don't want to anymore.

397
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,720
Why?

398
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,040
You need to practice,

399
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,600
so when you go out with me,
you'll feel familiar with it.

400
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,360
Fine, then.

401
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,160
If you want me to practice,

402
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,600
then I will, honey.

403
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,800
Hey!

404
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,680
If you want to enjoy each other,
do it somewhere else.

405
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,920
Not in my house!

406
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,000
This is my house too.

407
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,560
What nerve.

408
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,080
My dad bought this house for our marriage.

409
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,640
Once we get divorced,
you'll have no rights.

410
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,480
Pat,

411
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,400
do you really think I'd get divorced

412
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,520
without taking something?

413
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,960
Yeah.

414
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,000
You probably can't sue for divorce
against us so easily anymore.

415
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,080
Come to think of it,
you two are perfect for each other.

416
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,080
You're equally shameless,

417
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,400
so much that I'm starting to wonder

418
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,000
how a human can be this shameless,

419
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,840
or if you're even human to begin with!

420
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,840
You--

421
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,200
Come on then!

422
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,240
Let her blabber, Dao.

423
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,440
Because now,

424
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,760
she's already completely cornered.

425
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,400
Yeah.

426
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,840
You drove me into a corner,

427
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,440
so I'll give you and Dao
just what you gave me.

428
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,680
I'll show everyone the proof
of what I've been dealing with!

429
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,560
Pat.

430
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,680
You really think you have any proof left?

431
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,080
Oh,

432
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,240
are you talking about the proof

433
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,840
that's in here?

434
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,160
Pu's phone?

435
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,960
Yes.

436
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,560
If the proof you're talking about
is in here, I just have to burn it,

437
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,360
and then it's over.

438
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,120
Rath! Rath! Rath!

439
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,680
Rath! Rath!

440
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,920
Stop it, Rath!

441
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,320
Rath!

442
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
I told you to stop! Rath!

443
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,560
Let go of me!

444
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,080
Let go! Rath! Rath! Let go of me!

445
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,680
Let go! Rath, don't you do it!

446
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,240
And that's it. Now there's nothing left.

447
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,320
You really believe

448
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,640
I have proof only on the phone?

449
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,400
Even if you burn it,

450
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,360
I had it backed up somewhere else.

451
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,800
Right. If you hadn't told me,
I would've completely forgotten.

452
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,920
Pumeth.

453
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,040
You backed it up in here too, right?

454
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,680
I saw it all.

455
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,480
Where did you find the hard drive? Rath!

456
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,960
Pumeth got it from Pu's room.

457
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,240
Pu, why is there nothing in here?

458
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,000
How is that possible?

459
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,760
Do you have any other backups?

460
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,480
It all got erased.

461
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,280
Bro, something else happened.

462
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
You probably didn't think

463
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,800
everything would work
in my favor this well.

464
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,440
Why do you have to help
a horrible guy like him?

465
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,560
-Huh, Pumeth?
-He's my guy.

466
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,520
Of course he works for me.

467
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,200
Since we already burned the phone,

468
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,159
why don't we burn the rest too?

469
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,600
No.

470
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,320
No!

471
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,800
Don't! Let go of me!

472
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,639
Let go of me! Don't, don't!

473
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,719
Let go!

474
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,640
What are you doing?

475
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Scared?

476
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,280
When you were doing
all those horrible things,

477
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,200
why weren't you scared?

478
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,920
Don't be crazy.

479
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,200
Yeah.

480
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,200
I've gone crazy already!

481
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,680
Do you have any idea

482
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
how disgusted I am

483
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,520
with you and Rath right now?

484
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,240
I can't even bear
living in the same world as you anymore!

485
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,960
Before,

486
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,080
I just wanted you and Rath
to get what you deserve.

487
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,600
But now,

488
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,600
I've changed my mind.

489
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,520
Only this damn gun

490
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,880
would do for a scumbag like you.

491
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,160
I've got nothing to lose!

492
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,160
Let go! Let go!

493
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,200
I told you to let go!

494
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,120
Let go of me!

495
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,720
Stop!

496
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,600
You really want to kill me?

497
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,040
Okay, then.

498
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,440
I'll let you be the murderer
you so desperately want to be.

499
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,800
Dao.

500
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,120
Dao!

501
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,960
Dao! Dao! Dao!

502
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,960
Pat!

503
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,760
Why did you shoot her?

504
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,120
No, I didn't do it! She shot herself!

505
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,480
If you don't believe me,
check the residue on her!

506
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,960
I didn't shoot her.

507
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,440
I didn't shoot her.

508
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,480
I didn't.

509
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,560
I didn't shoot her. I didn't.

510
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,800
I didn't do it.

511
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,480
I didn't do it. I--

512
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Pumeth!

513
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,280
Call an ambulance!

514
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,720
Pat!

515
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,880
Why did you shoot her?

516
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,040
Pumeth! Call an ambulance!

517
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,200
Dao, Dao!

518
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,480
What happened?

519
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,120
Pat shot Dao,

520
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,400
and she passed out.

521
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,520
Mrs. Pat.

522
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,320
Dao.

523
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,000
It seems they're using
the fact that Mrs. Pat shot Ms. Dao

524
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,200
to force Mrs. Pat to sign an agreement
giving all of her assets to Taweerath.

525
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,000
I have a witness who can confirm
that Mrs. Pat didn't shoot Ms. Dao.

526
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,440
Mrs. Pat, if you need any help,

527
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,520
let me know anytime.

528
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,200
I'm ready to help you with anything.

529
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,120
You must be Pat's servant,
carrying her things. Take it.

530
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,280
And you two must be reptiles
building a nest in somebody's house.

531

NEXT EPISODE

532
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,400
Don't make me go insane again.
