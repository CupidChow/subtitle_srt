1
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,240
Let's go, Pat.

2
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,720
What's this?

3
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,040
"Liar Leading Lady."

4
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,880
Who are they talking about, Aunt Dao?

5
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,800
Hey.

6
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,600
LIAR LEADING LADY

7
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,320
This doesn't concern you.

8
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,440
But maybe it does your aunt.

9
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,720
That's nonsense.

10
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,240
What does she have to do with it?

11
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
It's fine, Ava.

12
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,360
I didn't come here to argue.

13
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,760
Pat, I have something for you.

14
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,960
Since you've invited me
to your parties a lot,

15
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,080
I wanted to invite you to one of mine too.

16
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,760
Rath had me plan a small party
at his house

17
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,880
and told me to invite special guests

18
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,800
and close friends,
just like you used to do.

19
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Sure.

20
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,680
If you'd really invite me,

21
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,720
I'd go.

22
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,200
I'll be waiting.

23
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
Tham,

24
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,960
remember what you told me?

25
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,960
Do you plan to do the same?

26
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,160
If so, I've decided,

27
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,080
I accept your offer.

28
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
Wow.

29
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,560
I thought you'd like
what I prepared for you.

30
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,080
They're all so pretty.

31
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,920
My jewelry matches all of them too.

32
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,040
I knew you'd like them.

33
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
You sure do

34
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,760
know me the best.

35
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,360
At the party,

36
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,760
I'll look good for your sake.

37
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,840
I'll be the prettiest

38
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,360
for everyone to see.

39
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,360
I don't believe you.

40
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,240
You have to wear it in front of me first.

41
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Right now?

42
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,000
Does…

43
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,840
a tea party have to be this fancy?

44
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,160
- How do you like it?
- Hey,

45
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,200
the vibe feels familiar,
like the party Pat used to host.

46
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,600
There's Aunt Dao!

47
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,800
Thank you all

48
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
for coming to my party today.

49
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,840
Ingdao, you invited us
and you even asked us to take pictures.

50
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Are you revealing the good news
that you two are in a relationship?

51
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,840
That's not it.

52
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,040
We just wanted to invite you all for tea.

53
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,600
And we wanted to announce
Rath's new project.

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,840
Yes,

55
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,080
I'm announcing a villa project soon,

56
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,640
so I was hoping
you could help spread the news

57
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,200
before the actual event.

58
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,000
Today's guests are celebrities

59
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,760
and the project's shareholders.

60
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,120
And there's yet another important guest,

61
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,600
but I don't know if she changed her mind.

62
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,800
- Who?
- Who?

63
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,440
Dao,

64
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,400
who'd you invite?

65
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,680
Patchanin's here too!

66
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,440
Well,

67
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,640
Dao invited me.

68
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
So I invited Tham too.

69
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,560
You're here together,

70
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,680
are you here to clarify the scandal?

71
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

72
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,360
So, I should tell you all now

73
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,400
about our relationship.

74
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,760
Ugh,

75
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,120
they'd dare to announce their affair here?

76
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,920
Just how shameless are they?

77
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Dao probably wants
to humiliate me at her party.

78
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,640
What are you going to do?

79
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,880
Can you come with me?

80
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,040
Let's announce about us there.

81
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,560
The two of us

82
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,920
are just colleagues

83
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,520
because Pat is the brand ambassador

84
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,680
and a public relations consultant
of my company.

85
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,840
So that may have caused misunderstandings.

86
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,160
What about that video
where you were carrying her?

87
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,840
That's right.

88
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,720
What's that about?

89
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,240
Our brand ambassador was injured.
Of course I had to take care of her.

90
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,440
- Aw.
- Aw.

91
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,680
If you don't believe me,

92
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,640
just ask Ingdao. She was there too.

93
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,360
Why didn't you tell me

94
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,520
Pat's coming?

95
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,680
Yes, there really was an accident.

96
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
Well,

97
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
if the horrible news about me was true,

98
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,760
Dao and my ex-husband

99
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,840
wouldn't have invited me

100
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to show my face with Tham today.

101
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,800
You're saying Dao hosted the party

102
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
to help you deny the allegations?

103
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,400
And guys,

104
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,240
about Rath and I getting divorced,

105
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,400
we actually ended on good terms.

106
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,480
The allegations on the news are false.

107
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,520
Thanks, Dao.

108
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,200
You wanted to hurt me,

109
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,920
so I got to deny the allegations today.

110
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,880
Do you want a scandal

111
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
at your very first party?

112
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,680
Guys, notice the vibe in this party?

113
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200
See,

114
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,480
For the party's vibe today,

115
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,720
Dao planned it
very similarly to how I did.

116
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,360
Maybe she wants to remind me of

117
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,760
the good old vibes we used to share.

118
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,240
Even her dress and jewelry too.

119
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,960
They're my favorite brand.

120
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,880
Dao really

121
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
never thinks for herself.

122
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,920
Oh, sorry.

123
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,560
I mean,

124
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,440
she never thinks about herself.

125
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,200
She's always thinking about me.

126
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,280
Is she insinuating

127
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,840
that Aunt Dao copies her?

128
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,440
Dao sure is so good to Pat.

129
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,920
Yes,

130
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,600
so good that I want to
pay her back totally.

131
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,280
Then,

132
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,000
can we take a picture of you together
to capture your tight friendship?

133
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

134
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,760
Can we?

135
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,600
Can they, Dao?

136
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,960
Of course.

137
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,480
Quit it, Dao.

138
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,840
It's because of you.

139
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,760
All this stuff!

140
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,920
The dress and the jewelry too!

141
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,720
You helped your ex humiliate me!

142
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, I didn't know

143
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,560
you invited Pat.

144
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,880
You're in charge of everything here, Dao.

145
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
And you were the one who liked the dress

146
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,480
and the stuff I ordered.
And about her denying the news,

147
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,480
you were the one who gave her that chance.

148
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,040
The reporters
and the other guests already left.

149
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,000
Do you still want to host
the dinner party?

150
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,800
Yes.

151
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,920
I'll do everything as planned.

152
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,880
Go tell Pat and Tham

153
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,880
I invited them to dinner.

154
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,520
Okay.

155
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,640
What are you planning?

156
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,840
I hope you didn't invite me

157
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,440
to just sit here.

158
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,480
That'd be impolite of me, Pat.

159
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,600
Dinner's ready, Aunt Dao.

160
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,840
A special dish just for you.

161
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,360
Fish soup, your favorite.

162
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,200
But we don't have many fish.

163
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,200
So I could only make one for you.

164
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,720
Koi fish soup.

165
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,920
Try it.

166
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,360
Thank you for letting me have these fish.

167
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
of course I'd let you

168
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,160
do what you like.

169
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,000
Pat.

170
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,200
What's the matter, Pat?

171
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,400
Why'd you do this to me?

172
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,600
I thought you'd miss

173
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,320
or regret losing
what you once had in this house,

174
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,640
especially your pet fish.

175
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,240
But this one happened to die,

176
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,280
so I made it into soup for you to eat

177
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,520
so you'd miss it a little less.

178
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,880
But if you still miss it,
you can take it home.

179
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,040
Some of its remains
are still in the kitchen.

180
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll have it boxed for you to take home.

181
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,160
Dao.

182
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,920
Because either way,

183
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,520
I didn't want to keep it.

184
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,120
It's so useless.

185
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,200
Actually, a lot of people eat koi fish.

186
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,800
I heard its meat tastes great too.
Right, Rati?

187
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,720
Oh, right! Its meat's really tasty.

188
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,120
Look, Pat. If you won't eat it, I will.

189
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,920
Oops, guess I won't, then.

190
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
It's just fish.

191
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,640
Don't make a big deal of it, Pat.

192
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,040
But I think Ingdao went too far.

193
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,360
Dao's probably

194
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,120
used to competing with someone this way.

195
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,680
Today she gets rid of a fish

196
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,640
the moment it stops being useful.

197
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Someday,

198
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,760
she'll probably get rid of
the people around her

199
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,520
the moment they stop being useful.

200
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,520
Come to think of it, Dao and Rath

201
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,720
both only care about their personal gain.

202
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
I'm no fortune teller,

203
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,880
but I can predict

204
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
that as soon as these two
stop being useful to each other,

205
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,680
they'll probably start killing each other.

206
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,320
Pat!

207
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,280
Aunt Dao!

208
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,280
Aunt Dao!

209
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,240
Hey!

210
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,520
Tham,

211
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,360
let's go.

212
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,760
But before we leave,

213
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,600
Let's stop somewhere
I can make merit for my fish.

214
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,600
Hey, Dao.

215
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,960
Let go of me. I'm going after them!

216
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,280
Quit it, Dao!

217
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,400
Isn't this humiliating enough already?

218
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,760
Hey.

219
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,920
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

220
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
What is this, Pu?

221
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,240
Congrats on your new job, Pat.

222
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,240
Congrats to
Nile Real Estate's brand ambassador.

223
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,440
Don't tell me

224
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,760
you planned this,

225
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,920
convincing me
a thief broke into Pat's house.

226
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,360
Sorry. I just wanted to surprise her,

227
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,320
so Jane came to help.

228
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,040
I prepared food for you too.

229
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,400
Thank God

230
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,000
there's no fish soup.

231
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,320
What?

232
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,400
Nothing, Pu.

233
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,160
Don't mind him.

234
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,360
Let's see, what do I have here?

235
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,560
I didn't get to eat at the party.

236
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,800
I'm getting hungry.

237
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,480
Maybe your little action scene today
got you tired.

238
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,560
What are you saying?

239
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,080
Pat, we'll go get you some ice.

240
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,320
Come here.

241
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,680
You know,

242
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,240
when I get to do big projects,

243
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,000
whether it's a drama or a commercial,

244
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,680
my dad would always prepare food for me
just like this.

245
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,720
He'd have food all over the table
and we'd celebrate.

246
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,480
All that time I'd think

247
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm his only daughter,

248
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,160
so I must make sure
I do my best with everything

249
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,360
so he can be proud of me.

250
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,520
But now,

251
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,000
I only do things that humiliate him.

252
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,160
He must be so disappointed in me

253
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,320
that he never wants to see me again.

254
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,320
The two of us are just colleagues

255
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,920
because Pat is the brand ambassador

256
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and a public relations consultant
of my company.

257
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,000
MR. KOBSAK

258
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,240
All that time I'd think

259
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,240
I'm his only daughter,

260
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,240
so I must make sure
I do my best with everything

261
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,400
so he can be proud of me.

262
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,560
But now,

263
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,400
I only do things that humiliate him.

264
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,160
He must be so disappointed in me

265
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,800
that he never wants to see me again.

266
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,080
If it were up to me,

267
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,400
I'd want him to believe what I say

268
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,040
and trust me just once more.

269
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,200
But there's nothing I can do

270
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,960
except hope that someday

271
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,840
he learns the truth

272
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,680
and forgives me.

273
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,960
Pat…

274
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,880
And how could I be sure

275
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,000
that renting a room
costing ten millions would be worth it?

276
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,000
That's a really high price.

277
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,480
But the high price comes with
a high quality and standard.

278
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Also, the condo
has a really good location.

279
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,560
It's definitely worth investing.

280
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,520
You sure are both beautiful

281
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,520
and capable.

282
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,440
Could I see the brochure?

283
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,640
Sure.

284
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,080
If I wanted to prepurchase
two penthouse rooms,

285
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,240
could you come to dinner with me

286
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,720
to discuss the details?

287
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,720
Anyway, may I have your phone number?

288
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,080
For our important customer,

289
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,040
of course Pat and I

290
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,880
would be happy to give further details.

291
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,480
Here.

292
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,520
Then I'll have to think about it.

293
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,360
Why'd you do that?

294
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,240
I don't want to keep having to deny
the news about us.

295
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,360
I just wanted to help.

296
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,280
Help the customers run away from me?

297
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,120
Two penthouse rooms.
That's tens of millions.

298
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,600
If I can't close the deal,
it's because of you.

299
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,600
I won't blame you.

300
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,400
And my policy doesn't support you
working off-site.

301
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,880
Also, you closed the deal
on many rooms already.

302
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,680
Tham. Pat.

303
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,680
You have a guest.

304
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,480
I didn't think

305
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,760
you'd come to
your rival's condo presale event.

306
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,240
What rival?

307
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,200
Dao and I,

308
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,120
we're here as customers.

309
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,040
Too bad your project
doesn't include a super penthouse.

310
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,800
I would've been
the first to prepurchase it.

311
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,480
But if it's this penthouse,
we'll have to see.

312
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,040
I really want it and I'm so interested.

313
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,680
I want a salesperson
who can explain the details,

314
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,920
but we want someone who's fitting

315
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,440
for VIP customers like us.

316
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,720
Two brand ambassadors taking care of me.

317
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,080
Really makes me feel like a VIP customer.

318
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,640
Are you really interested
in buying our penthouse?

319
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,240
Hmm.

320
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,080
You think I can't afford it?

321
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,960
My new ring.

322
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,440
Rath had it made for me.

323
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,840
It's even more colorless

324
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,640
and more expensive
than the wedding ring you used to flaunt.

325
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,720
So I guess

326
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,920
he probably knows already

327
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,400
who's a real gem

328
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,600
and who's not.

329
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,200
Are you really sure

330
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,320
the diamond ring you're wearing

331
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,120
is actually real?

332
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,120
I think…

333
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,000
by the time you find out

334
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,160
the guy you stole from me

335
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,800
is just a low-grade diamond,

336
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,640
you might already be in jail

337
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,680
for being an accessory to his crime.

338
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,000
You must be really embarrassed

339
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,960
about losing Rath,

340
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,480
so you keep messing with me.

341
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,440
Just talk straight.

342
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,240
You came all this way.

343
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,680
What do you want?

344
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,280
I'll help you buy the penthouse,

345
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,080
but you have to back out
from your drama role.

346
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,840
Am I that desperate
that I'd need your help?

347
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,680
If you don't back out,

348
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,440
you're going to have a hard time.

349
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,400
Even if you could cover up the news,

350
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,880
there will be more and more news

351
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,600
if you keep showing your face
to me and Rath.

352
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,280
Wanna move to another country?

353
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,760
Just give up.

354
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,120
There won't be news about you
for four or five years.

355
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,280
People will forget about you permanently.

356
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,120
Then, it'll be over between us.

357
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,680
Dao,

358
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,360
these days,

359
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,520
we don't just give up and let go.

360
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,200
The only way we can survive
against evil people

361
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,160
is to stomp on them hard,

362
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,480
make sure they can't come back

363
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,080
to hurt us again.

364
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,400
That's when

365
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
it's really over between us.

366
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,120
Don't touch her!

367
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,080
I wouldn't hurt her.

368
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,160
She's the one who hurt me.

369
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,800
Help me! Help!

370
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,440
Someone help me!

371
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,040
Help! Help!

372
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,400
Somebody help!

373
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,960
Help! Help!

374
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,400
Hey! Stop it!

375
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,520
How dare you do this to her?

376
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,960
I was trying to help her.

377
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,760
Help her my ass.

378
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,960
I saw you hurting her.

379
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,640
This is all a big misunderstanding.

380
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,800
I was just trying to get

381
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,280
this

382
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,280
out of her hair.

383
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,200
- Ah.
- Ah.

384
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,240
I don't know how it got here,

385
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,080
but she must've got so scared.

386
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,160
I feel bad for her.

387
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,320
She got so scared
her hair's all messed up.

388
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,440
Anyway, I'll ask the janitors

389
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,280
to take better care of this place

390
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,840
so that there won't be any insects
or unwanted animals

391
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,200
in here again.

392
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,320
Guys, there's nothing else to see here,

393
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,560
so let's go outside
to discuss more details on the project.

394
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,880
- Let's go.
- Okay.

395
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,160
Alright.

396
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,960
Thank you.

397
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,320
That was clever, Pu.

398
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,360
I was lucky
the beetle happened to be there.

399
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,960
Help me! Help!

400
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,760
Someone help me!

401
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,480
Help! Somebody help!

402
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,920
Let's drink to Pu's genius

403
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,320
and our penthouse sales
of over 50 percent on the first day.

404
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,160
Kiki's calling me.

405
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,160
Sorry, I have to take this call.

406
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
Why'd you call me?

407
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,560
Just say what you want to say.

408
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,800
If Dao gets back,

409
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,960
you'll be in trouble.

410
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,240
I booked us separate rooms.

411
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,000
Dao's afraid we'll get on the news.

412
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,320
Don't worry.

413
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,560
Pat,

414
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,000
I never forgot

415
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
what you like and what you don't.

416
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,560
Just hurry and say it.

417
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,360
I'm so tired of dealing with Dao.

418
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,480
I'm starting to get tired of her too.

419
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,880
Did I hear that right?

420
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,160
She's really moody, unlike you.

421
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
Did you know?

422
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,520
You're the one who makes me the happiest.

423
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,440
I miss you.

424
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,080
It's too late now.

425
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Pat,

426
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,000
nothing's ever too late.

427
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,920
Everyone can start again. Especially me,

428
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
who still loves you.

429
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,400
You love me?

430
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,480
If Dao heard you say that,

431
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,800
she must be sad.

432
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,880
There's just the two of us now.

433
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,280
Let's not mention any names, Pat.

434
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,680
So you're playing hard to get?

435
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,360
Fine. Whatever you want, just tell me.

436
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,560
I'll compensate you with anything
if you just ask.

437
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,440
You really think

438
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,240
someone would still believe
a scumbag like you?

439
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,840
Did you hear everything, Dao?

440
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The scumbag's words behind your back.

441
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Pat!

442
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,640
You agreed to see me
because you were planning this?!

443
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,280
You think I'd still have feelings for you?

444
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,920
I was just enduring the disgust

445
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,440
waiting to see you fall to pieces.

446
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,160
Pat.

447
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,080
- Pat!
- No!

448
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,440
Pat,

449
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,640
you think you can destroy me? Forget it.

450
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,480
Rath!

451
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,760
COME QUICK.

452
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,000
I'M IN ROOM 2722.

453
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,360
Go ahead.

454
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,400
Hey, how could you let Tham hurt Rath?!

455
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,920
You too.

456
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,159
Who do you think you are?

457
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,960
You think you can hurt anyone?

458
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,199
Or are you so in love with her

459
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,280
you'd do anything she says?

460
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,000
I don't think I need anyone to tell me

461
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,080
to help a woman who's being assaulted.

462
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,840
Assaulted?

463
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,639
Or is she just begging for attention?

464
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,560
What you heard just now,

465
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,240
did it not help you see the light at all?

466
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,440
Dao,

467
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,400
she tricked me.

468
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,360
Don't listen to her.

469
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,560
You don't have to tell me.

470
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,040
I know someone faked a situation

471
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,400
to make us fight.

472
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,360
You think seducing Rath

473
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,880
and competing with me

474
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,640
can win him back?

475
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,320
I'm not stupid enough

476
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,840
to not keep up with your games.

477
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Let's go.

478
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,040
Fools who don't know they're foolish

479
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,040
cannot be helped.

480
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,920
Thank you so much for trusting me.

481
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,080
It's my fault I got tricked by her

482
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,840
that you almost misunderstood me.

483
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,440
Really?

484
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,520
You got tricked?

485
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,560
Ow! Dao!

486
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,760
Easy, it hurts!

487
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Listen, Rath.

488
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,480
Sometimes

489
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,320
women act stupid

490
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,000
just to maintain their relationship.

491
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,120
It's not that they believe
every word their man says.

492
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,520
I was just

493
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,160
trying to get back at her for you.

494
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,000
I didn't mean a word I said to her.

495
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,840
I love you only, Dao.

496
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,520
I can't believe Dao heard all that
but would still trust Rath.

497
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,160
You used to be like her too.

498
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,600
Also,

499
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,640
maybe she doesn't trust him.

500
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,960
She only said that
because she doesn't want to lose to you,

501
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,360
just like how you want to win
against them so much

502
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,720
you act without thinking.

503
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,160
I act without thinking?

504
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,720
You followed your ex to his room.

505
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,840
You knew what he wanted.

506
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,400
That's acting without thinking.

507
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,800
But I already texted you where I was,

508
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
and I wouldn't let him do anything easily.

509
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,440
But it's still too risky.

510
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,320
What if I didn't get there in time?

511
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,360
Do you know

512
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,480
how worried I was

513
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,800
when you texted me?

514
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,920
I rushed to that room.

515
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,760
I was afraid if I got there
a second too late,

516
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,400
something would happen to you.

517
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,400
You care about me that much?

518
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,920
So much you can't imagine.

519
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,520
If you ask anyone,

520
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,840
they'd say you and I

521
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,600
are boss and employee.

522
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,560
But what if I ask you?

523
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,000
What are we?

524
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,560
NEXT EPISODE

525
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,160
And about the case, did you handle it yet?

526
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,600
If I get in trouble,
someone needs to take responsibility.

527
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,640
This is a photo of me
when I was a waitress at a bar.

528
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,880
Won't it damage the public image

529
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,480
of our new condo?

530
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,480
I suggest that we find a new presenter.

531
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Won't you hear what an important person
in the project thinks first?

532
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,720
