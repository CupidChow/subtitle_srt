1
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
What's up?

2
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,360
Aren't we discussing my plan?

3
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Start talking then.

4
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,600
Let's go outside and talk properly.

5
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,920
I'd rather we talk here.

6
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Or,

7
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,320
we can talk after we're done.

8
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
Mr. Rath, uh--

9
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,760
Wait, Mr. Rath!

10
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,240
Don't!

11
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,520
Miss Dao!

12
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
Dao!

13
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,640
How did you get here?

14
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,720
Don't you ask

15
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,760
how I got here.

16
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,800
It's not what you think.

17
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,520
You don't need to explain anything.

18
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,800
It's obvious already.

19
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,760
I had no idea

20
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
I brought a snake right into my house.

21
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,240
Do you know

22
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,120
how it usually ends

23
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
for betrayers like you?

24
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,800
Mr. Rath, help me.

25
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
You said you'd protect me.

26
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,280
You said you're not afraid of Miss Dao.

27
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,760
Hey, hey, Dao.

28
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,200
Calm down, Dao.

29
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,959
Let's talk first.

30
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,040
If people stab me in the back,

31
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,600
I'll stab them in the front.

32
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,480
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let go!

33
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,120
Let go of me!

34
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,320
Stop acting crazy!

35
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,400
Why are you making
such a big deal out of this?

36
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,040
Go ahead.

37
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840
Shoot me.

38
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,200
If you dare to hurt my feelings,

39
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,400
getting in bed with her behind my back,

40
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,800
then kill me!

41
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,760
- How did you get here?
- I bet you wanted no one to know

42
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,560
you were alone with Taweerath in the room.

43
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,120
None of your business.

44
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,120
I'm not letting you walk away
like last time.

45
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,240
- Let go.
- Why?

46
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,000
Are you going back in there

47
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,480
to continue discussing your price?

48
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,440
Last time I slapped you because I had to.

49
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,960
But this time, I'm slapping you for real,

50
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,720
so maybe you'll realize.

51
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,520
I'll tell you something.

52
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,120
What you saw, it's not what you think.

53
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,400
Bro. Miss Pat.

54
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,640
I got it.

55
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,280
Thanks, Pu.

56
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,840
What's going on here?

57
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,600
You'll see.

58
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
Dao,

59
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,400
it was nothing.

60
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
You're overreacting!

61
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,560
That kid is just a toy
for me to kill time with.

62
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,280
I'm not staying with someone
who's making me feel lower and lower.

63
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,480
Whoever hurts me,

64
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,800
I'll hurt them even more!

65
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,080
Prepare yourself.

66
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,840
Dao.

67
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,160
What?

68
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,800
Are you scared

69
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,960
that I'll expose your secrets

70
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,880
and your bad deeds?

71
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,600
Dao,

72
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,800
let's not blow this out of proportion.

73
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,240
To you,

74
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,240
women only exist for your pleasure.

75
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,600
But to me,

76
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,160
it destroyed all my dignity,

77
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,000
my love,

78
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,880
my loyalty, and my trust, Rath.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,600
Just wait, you'll get what you deserve.

80
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
Then just you wait.

81
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,080
You and Ava will get what you deserve.

82
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,320
<i>I'm talking about Pu's brother.</i>

83
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,880
<i>What do you mean?</i>

84
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,200
<i>The police already concluded</i>

85
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Ava and I had nothing to do with it.

86
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,240
You think I don't know

87
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
what went down that night?

88
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,040
Ava didn't have a headache,

89
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,720
nor did she leave

90
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,040
during the time you told the police.

91
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,360
What time you really went to see Ava

92
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,800
and what really went happened,

93
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,240
I know all of it.

94
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,240
If you hurt me,

95
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll hurt you and Ava
until you're left with nothing.

96
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,280
The beautiful future
you dreamed of having with her?

97
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,200
It will end in jail for you.

98
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,159
They must have left the room.

99
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,440
Ava and Miss Dao
are forging all kinds of evidence.

100
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,080
Chat must have died because of them.

101
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,000
I know all of this,
yet I can do nothing about them.

102
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,640
Even if we can't do anything yet,

103
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,160
we've got to learn the truth
about your brother.

104
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
All that's left is Mr. Kobsak's case,

105
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,720
but they haven't let anything slip yet.

106
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,360
For now, try not to make them
suspect either of you.

107
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,120
I can wait.
I'll wait till I know the truth.

108
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,880
So, the two of you fighting

109
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,600
was just part of your plan?

110
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,520
I admit,

111
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,320
I was conflicted about Chat.

112
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,760
But I should thank
Mr. Tham for warning me.

113
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
If you want your award back,

114
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,480
I'll give it to you.

115
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,560
But before you leave,

116
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,000
I want you to really think.

117
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,040
How can you be sure
the phone you found was really Chat's?

118
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,760
It's a new phone.

119
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,440
It hasn't been used yet.

120
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,040
The SIM card is new too.

121
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,280
Then it was probably Ingdao's doing.

122
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,080
Miss Dao was probably trying to get me
to suspect you both.

123
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,040
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,240
Then,

125
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,280
let's humor her a little, shall we?

126
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,880
So it was all just an act.

127
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,080
Thank you for agreeing to do this.

128
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,360
No, I should be thanking you

129
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,200
for helping me learn about Chat

130
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,160
and not falling for Miss Dao's trick.

131
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
Miss Ingdao and Taweerath are fighting.

132
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,200
This should be a good chance for us.

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,160
How so?

134
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Miss Dao is conflicted.
We can take advantage of that.

135
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Miss Pat, now it's your job

136
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,000
to open her eyes.

137
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Hi, another bottle
for the VIP table please.

138
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,400
It's Ingdao!

139
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,840
She's even prettier than on TV.

140
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Oh, oh.

141
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,560
Let me help you.

142
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Stay away!

143
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,040
You're too drunk.

144
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,520
Just let me help you.

145
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
I can take you home.

146
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,400
You want to be on the news?

147
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,520
Huh?

148
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,680
Fine.

149
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,920
- I'll help you.
- Let go!

150
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,440
- Let go!
- Hey!

151
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,840
Trying to hurt a girl?

152
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,600
Patchanin.

153
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,360
I wasn't hurting her.

154
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,960
I was just helping her.
You see how drunk she is.

155
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,280
You don't have to. I can help my friend.

156
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,400
What can a girl do to help her?

157
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,520
I have someone else too.

158
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,800
Dao.

159
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,920
Stay away from me.

160
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,280
What do you want from me now?

161
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,160
Please help me take her to the car.

162
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,040
Up already?

163
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,320
Do you have a headache?

164
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,840
How did I get here?

165
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,120
You were so drunk last night

166
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,960
that you were passing out,
so I brought you here to rest.

167
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,680
What are you planning?

168
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,320
I made this for you.
Eat it. You'll feel better.

169
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,400
- You can keep it.
- Are you scared

170
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,400
that I put something in it?

171
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,680
I'll have some so you can see.

172
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,440
Okay?

173
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,520
I'm not so pathetic

174
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
that I have to eat something you made.

175
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,080
You'll look even more pathetic

176
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,000
if you don't hear what I'm about to say.

177
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,920
You think a guy like Rath

178
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,400
would have Pu as his only toy?

179
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,920
What are you saying?

180
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,520
Why did you get yourself
so drunk last night?

181
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,160
How a woman feels when she is betrayed

182
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,120
by the man she loves
and trusts with her life,

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,560
how painful it feels,

184
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,640
can you feel it now?

185
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,120
I was disappointed and upset,

186
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,840
but just for one night.

187
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,440
Because no matter what,

188
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,760
Rath would choose me anyway.

189
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,520
You're just comforting yourself.

190
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,720
Because in the end,
he won't settle for just you.

191
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,520
If you're trying to get me angry

192
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,520
to make me fall out with Rath,

193
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,440
just forget it.

194
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,000
And why do you think

195
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,280
Mr. Tham sees Rath as his enemy?

196
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,360
It's because his sister
fell victim to Rath before.

197
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,880
Then it was my turn,

198
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,160
and now it's your turn.

199
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,320
I'll tell you this just to be kind.

200
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,960
Right now,

201
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,040
there's another girl
Rath is taking care of.

202
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,960
Who is she?

203
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,760
She's around Pu's age.

204
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,080
But you're smart.
You'll figure it out easily.

205
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,560
I'll give you a hint.

206
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,120
She's pretty close to you.

207
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,720
<i>I'll tell you this just to be kind.</i>

208
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,040
<i>Right now, there's another girl</i>
<i>Rath is taking care of.</i>

209
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,240
Who is she?

210
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,440
You think I don't know

211
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,160
what went down that night?

212
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,040
Ava didn't have a headache,

213
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,760
nor did she leave

214
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,040
during the time you told the police.

215
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,920
What really happened,

216
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,080
I know all of it.

217
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,240
The only person who knows
I went to pick up Ava that night…

218
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,120
- I'm going now.
- Okay.

219
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Bye-bye.

220
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,119
Oh,

221
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,240
it's Mr. Rath's tie.

222
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
Mr. Rath, you forgot--

223
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,960
Why did you come to see me?

224
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,520
Since when?

225
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,400
Tell me, since when?

226
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

227
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,880
I already saw Rath walk out of this room.

228
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,280
And this tie,

229
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,840
I bought it for him.

230
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,480
Dao…

231
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,320
Stop acting dumb

232
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,320
and answer me!

233
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,720
Since the contest ended.

234
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,760
He bought this condo for me.

235
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,440
I didn't make the first move.
Please don't hurt me.

236
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,360
What else did you tell him?

237
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,800
Please let me go first.

238
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,520
I'll tell you everything.

239
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,640
Tell me then.

240
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,920
I'm waiting.

241
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,960
You'd better not lie to me.

242
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,200
He got me this condo.
He gives me money every month,

243
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,480
and he said he'd support
my career in show business

244
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,280
as long as I stay here quietly.
So I did everything

245
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,640
as he asked.

246
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,840
Then he asked about you and Ava,

247
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,080
so I only told him what I know.

248
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,080
About that night too, right?

249
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,560
Yes. He asked me to…

250
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,880
That's it.

251
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,480
You said you wouldn't lie.

252
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,760
What else?

253
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,200
He told me to give Ava the drug.

254
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,160
What did you say?

255
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,640
I was just doing what he told me to do.

256
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,080
He just wanted Ava to use his drugs.

257
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,920
I don't know anything else. Not at all.

258
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,040
Dao, please don't hurt me.

259
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,760
I'll pretend I didn't find out
about you and Rath.

260
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,760
But if you

261
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,000
tell Rath that I came to see you today,

262
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,040
the knife that's in the pillow…

263
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,520
I'll stick it somewhere else!

264
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,800
Got it?

265
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,400
Yes.

266
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,320
- Water for you.
- Thank you.

267
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,760
Where did everyone go?

268
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,400
I asked for water. What's taking so long?!

269
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,240
Why are you here?

270
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,840
Aunt Dao said you wouldn't be here again.

271
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,920
And why can't I be here?

272
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,720
Are you scared of me or something, Ava?

273
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,920
Why would I be scared?

274
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,320
Right.

275
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,120
If we haven't done
something terribly wrong to each other,

276
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,920
there's no need to be scared.

277
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,840
What nerve, showing your face here again.

278
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,360
Ava, go to your room.

279
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,400
I wanted to apologize, Miss Dao.

280
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,320
There's no one else here. No press either.

281
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,720
You don't have to call me Miss.

282
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,400
I really wanted to apologize.

283
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,080
I was scared of Mr. Rath,
so I didn't dare say no.

284
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,360
But I promise I won't do it again.

285
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,840
And the reason I came here

286
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,760
is because I need your advice.

287
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,400
I really don't know
who to rely on anymore.

288
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,360
Advice about what?

289
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,840
Chat's death.

290
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,160
Someone sent me a text

291
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,000
saying they found Chat's phone

292
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,640
and wanted me to go get it.

293
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,680
But I'm afraid it will just be Miss Pat

294
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,200
sending someone to fool me.

295
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,000
And they even confirmed

296
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
that they saw Ava on the rooftop.

297
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,320
Who?

298
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,720
Who would dare lie to you like that?

299
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,640
I know, right?

300
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,440
That's why I wanted your advice.

301
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,280
Ava.

302
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,000
Ava has acted this way twice.

303
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,440
Especially this time,
when she heard about Chat's phone,

304
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,400
she was visibly panicking.

305
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,040
Then Dao probably has Chat's phone.

306
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,760
But why would she keep it?

307
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,280
The phone must have something on it.

308
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,120
That's why Ava is so scared
someone will find it.

309
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,720
So Miss Ingdao kept it,

310
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,120
to make sure no one would find it.

311
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,320
Once things quiet down,

312
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,920
she will get rid of it.

313
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,560
Then I'm going to her house

314
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,800
to find Chat's phone.

315
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,400
You don't need to, Pu.

316
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,120
There's another way.

317
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,600
How?

318
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,520
I didn't think you'd get here first.

319
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,760
I'm the one who asked to see you.
Of course, I'd be on time.

320
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,920
Is that so?

321
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,120
Or were you scared someone would see us
if you came some other time?

322
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,120
Don't change the subject.

323
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,280
I wanted to talk to you

324
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,120
about Rath.

325
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,400
Go ahead then. What is it?

326
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,720
You want to take everything back
from Rath, right?

327
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,520
Yeah.

328
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,080
I want him to get his Karma
as soon as possible.

329
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,400
But I probably can't do much alone.

330
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,560
And what would I get

331
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,000
if I helped you?

332
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,480
I know the person you care about the most

333
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,240
is Ava.

334
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,520
I'll help send her to work
with an agency in the US.

335
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,920
She would meet new people
and get to grow up there.

336
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,640
The rest is up to her capability.

337
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,000
And how can I trust you?

338
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,400
That's up to you.

339
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,800
Do you want to trust me,

340
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,640
or do you want to keep wasting time?

341
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,680
Do you really think

342
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Ava will be safe from Rath?

343
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,960
Didn't think I'd see you here alone.

344
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,680
I guess today really is my unlucky day.

345
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,640
I was going to head home and relax.

346
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,480
I guess

347
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,280
I'll have to stop at a temple first.

348
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,640
No holy water can help you now.

349
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,160
I'll keep haunting you always.

350
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,240
I should be the one saying that.

351
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,120
And it's probably not just me

352
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,040
who has a grudge against you
and wants revenge.

353
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,280
Besides the unlucky ones who died,

354
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
there are those
who are still alive, like me.

355
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Soon,

356
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,960
there will probably be Dao and Ava too.

357
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,320
There's no way they would hurt me.

358
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,120
Quit trying to mess with my head.

359
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,560
You seem so confident.

360
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,680
Do you think

361
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,280
Dao and Ava will let everything slide

362
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,160
after all you did to hurt them?

363
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,920
I bet you know

364
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,360
I'm good at controlling people.

365
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,120
You used to be my good girl too, remember?

366
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,440
Or…

367
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,560
Do you want to join the dead ones?

368
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,360
If I must join them,

369
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,000
you're the one

370
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,280
who will join them first.

371
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,160
Let go!

372
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,400
Rath!

373
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,640
Damn it, Tham!

374
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,560
Don't make me call the cops on you

375
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,520
for starting a fight in my café, Mr. Rath.

376
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,840
You'll lose your reputation.

377
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
A shameless guy like him

378
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,920
wouldn't care anyway.

379
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,280
Remember, Mr. Taweerath.

380
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,360
You're a businessman,

381
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,080
not some thug who can just steal or kill.

382
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Please be polite.

383
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,160
Or maybe

384
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,240
you are just a thug.

385
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,240
I'll really call them.

386
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,320
Please leave.

387
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,520
You can come out now.

388
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Does it hurt?

389
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,520
It's nothing compared to
how I got hurt before.

390
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,640
You shouldn't have kept arguing with him

391
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,160
till you got hurt.

392
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,520
Well, you got him back for me.

393
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
But I think it wasn't enough.

394
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,280
I wish Jane hadn't stopped me.

395
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,120
A guy like Rath

396
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,880
doesn't deserve happiness.
Not even for one second.

397
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,280
I provoked him so many times.

398
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,040
Now he's probably so mad at me

399
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,520
that he wants to kill me.

400
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,200
I'd never let him do that to you.

401
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,360
If he wants to,

402
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,240
he will have to fight me first.

403
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,480
If it weren't for you,

404
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,240
I wouldn't have the power
to fight for myself.

405
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,520
Stay strong.

406
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,920
I'll tell myself that too.

407
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,200
Fighting a scumbag like Taweerath is hard.

408
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,440
But no matter how hard it is,

409
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,160
I'll always be right by your side.

410
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,800
I never took you

411
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,400
for an ungrateful guy.

412
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,880
Got any excuses?

413
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,040
Fine.

414
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,960
I bet you already know

415
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,720
how it ends up for people

416
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,400
who try to betray me.

417
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,360
Traitor!

418
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,320
Get him out of here…

419
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,240
before his blood stains my room more.

420
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Get up!

421
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,000
Quick!

422
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,440
- I said get up!
- Let's go!

423
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,840
Rath,

424
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
what is this about?

425
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,520
Why did you have to do all this?

426
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,120
You don't need to know.

427
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,480
Let's talk about our issue.

428
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,360
Where are you taking me?

429
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,440
Rath, what are you doing?

430
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Are you scared?

431
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I prepared a gift for you.

432
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,000
Open it.

433
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,480
I know how much you love Ava,

434
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,520
so I thought

435
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,040
the three of us

436
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,560
could be a happy family.

437
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,280
I want you and Ava

438
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,080
to move here with me,

439
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,880
so we could be

440
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,440
a perfect family.

441
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,040
I love you, Dao.

442
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,239
But no matter how much I love you,

443
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,239
if you're ungrateful to me,

444
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,400
I'll get rid of you.

445
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,080
Let's practice our lines.

446
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,719
Okay.

447
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,000
Where's the stuff?

448
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,040
Rath keeps all his important documents
in his office.

449
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,200
I want the document.

450
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,880
You know how to get it for me, right?

451
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,800
If I do that--

452
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,760
Right now,

453
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,360
Rath is like a chain that's leashing you.

454
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,240
If you don't cut off the chain,

455
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,800
you'll have to go along
wherever he drags you.

456
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,160
Even if the chain strangles you to death,

457
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,960
you'll have to let it.

458
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,760
You want to be in that state?

459
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,000
I got it.

460
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,480
But how can I be sure
you're not fooling me?

461
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,680
Hi, everyone.

462
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,360
How's it going?

463
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,320
So you're free today, Mr. Taweerath?

464
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,080
- I'm free today…
- I like this one.

465
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,000
Okay.

466
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,480
So I wanted to come here to encourage Dao.

467
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,480
Guys, come here.

468
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,160
I edited the script.

469
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,160
Don't get your cues wrong again.

470
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,840
Play the scene as you're briefed.

471
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

472
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,560
Let's go guys. Let's get to work.

473
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,960
Ready,

474
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,880
action!

475
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,760
How's life treating you?

476
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,000
Well, as you can see,

477
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,160
my life is

478
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,800
ten times better than yours now.

479
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,480
But I can tell from your eyes.

480
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,000
You don't look happy at all.

481
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,920
It's not too late to turn back, Kem.

482
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,360
Going off script?

483
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,800
Going off script, huh?

484
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,080
Wait, wait!

485
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,440
Dear, oh dear!

486
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,080
Calm down, Dao.

487
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,520
- What's this about?
- What happened?

488
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,360
I heard the staff saying

489
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,920
you didn't get your cue wrong,

490
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,520
but you're just getting Pat back
for hurting you last time.

491
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,640
That's right.

492
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,720
Last time I got hurt. So this time,

493
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,000
she has to get hurt too.

494
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,320
If you keep this up,
it might affect the shoot.

495
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,680
You think I care?

496
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,080
As long as I can get back at her,

497
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,000
I couldn't care less.

498
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,880
Looks like

499
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,760
there's no way
for you and Pat to make up now.

500
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,360
Did you think that could happen?

501
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,040
Hold on,

502
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,000
did you come here

503
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,240
to check up on me?

504
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,000
I just wanted to be sure

505
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,240
you really hate her to the bone,

506
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,160
so I don't have to suspect

507
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,680
whether someone is going behind my back.

508
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,360
<i>What are you asking Dao to do?</i>

509
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,720
<i>Don't think I don't see</i>

510
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,120
how you've been trying
to get close to her.

511
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,960
<i>The person who tried to help me</i>

512
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,400
<i>got in trouble.</i>

513
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,840
Who knows what happened to him.

514
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,720
Dao probably sees Rath's true colors now.

515
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,880
<i>She won't stay with a guy like him.</i>

516
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,840
<i>What's that?</i>

517
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,440
The vitamins Mr. Rath's giving her.

518
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,920
<i>He said to make sure</i>
<i>she takes them on time.</i>

519
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,320
<i>I'll take back what's mine,</i>

520
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,040
<i>and what was my father's, from Rath first.</i>

521
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,480
<i>Then,</i>

522
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,840
<i>I'll send him to rot in jail,</i>

523
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,320
<i>when he's got nothing left.</i>

524
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,560
