1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,800
Okay. Okay.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,720
Have some noodles.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,400
The noodles are cold. How can we eat them?

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,160
Honey.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,120
Tell me how to eat.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,000
You jinx.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,520
Why didn't you die with your mother back then?

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:21,800
Stop crying.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,400
Cry.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,200
Honey.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,080
It's all my fault.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,720
Cry again.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,960
It's all my fault.

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,280
I was wrong.

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,600
Why are you here?

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,360
Honey, wake up.

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,160
Give it to me.

18
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,160
Die!

19
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:35,800
Come back.

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,560
Honey.

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,160
Honey!

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,920
Honey!

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,400
Honey!

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,200
Honey!

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,720
Wake up, honey!

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:53,920
Mom.

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
Don't give me sugar.

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,160
Mom! Honey!

29
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,040
Mom! Honey!

30
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,520
Mom, wake up!

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:04,920
Honey.

32
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,040
Mom.

33
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,280
You're awake, honey.

34
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,360
Mom.

35
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,880
Mom!

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,680
Wake up!

37
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,920
Mom!

38
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,480
Mom.

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,640
Mom!

40
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,440
Wake up!

41
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Mom!

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,800
Mom!

43
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,400
Wake up!

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,320
Mom!

45
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,320
Mom.

46
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,000
Honey.

47
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,800
You're awake.

48
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:30,680
Honey.

49
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,080
Are you okay?

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,720
I'm fine.

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,120
It's okay.

52
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,680
Xiaotang.

53
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,039
I'm fine.

54
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,200
I'm fine.

55
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,800
He Luning.

56
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,479
You saved me.

57
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,000
Nonsense.

58
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
Don't even think about leaving Blackrock.

59
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,480
You got the list of Shirogane.

60
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,640
I told you.

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,560
Only you can do this.

62
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,680
You promised me.

63
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,480
Once you get the list,

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
unlock the necklace immediately.

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,120
and give me and my family freedom.

66
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
To be honest,

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
The key to the necklace

68
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,280
was destroyed eight years ago.

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
Unless someone can break it.

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,520
Otherwise,

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
no one can open it now.

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,920
So from the beginning,

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
from the beginning.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,040
It's half true.

75
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,720
I didn't mean to kill you.

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,040
but I didn't want you to leave.

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,040
Cai Yun.

78
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,200
is the way I gave you.

79
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,520
The person I admire the most

80
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,280
is you.

81
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,520
From the first time I saw you,

82
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,440
we are the same person.

83
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,880
Kid.

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,160
I heard you killed your father.

85
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,160
Don't feel guilty.

86
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,400
That's what he should do.

87
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,200
I don't feel guilty.

88
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,079
He deserves it.

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,920
What's your name?

90
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,320
Nam Chae-yun.

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,640
I've seen your true self,

92
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,160
but they can't see

93
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,800
the shiniest part of you.

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,400
So no one is more suitable

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,760
than you.

96
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,680
Okay.

97
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,640
Let Xiaotang and handsome face go.

98
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,760
and set them free.

99
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,840
I said I can't open the necklace.

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,040
Then I won't.

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Turn off the necklace

102
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,640
Stay away from their lives.

103
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,279
It's off.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
Your promise is worthless.

105
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,399
I just want you to remember

106
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,920
if you dare to hurt them,

107
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,480
I won't let you go.

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,400
I didn't expect

109
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,680
that you could

110
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,480
for love.

111
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,080
I've always valued feelings.

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,159
You're wrong.

113
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,120
Do you really think of you as a family of three?

114
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,880
Honey.

115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Honey!

116
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,920
Honey!

117
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,000
Sugar.

118
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
Honey.

119
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,280
Honey!

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,640
Xiaotang.

121
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,800
Xiaotang.

122
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,200
Sugar.

123
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,520
Honey.

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,120
Honey.

125
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,200
Mom.

126
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,840
I told you dad was going to wake up.

127
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,560
Look.

128
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Am I right?

129
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,280
You're right.

130
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,200
You won.

131
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,080
But...

132
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,680
what is the first thing to do when you go home?

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,200
Mom, I'm going to wash my hands.

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,200
Where did you go?

135
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,120
You scared me.

136
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
Why is everything in the house packed?

137
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,960
We're moving.

138
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,960
Jason said

139
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,240
to let us leave.

140
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,080
Then why didn't you ask me to pack up?

141
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,080
You didn't wake up after I called you.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
Xiaotang is in a hurry to buy cake at the supermarket.

143
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,320
Besides,

144
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,600
I don't want to wake you up.

145
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,640
You always cook.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,640
Today,

147
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,600
I'll do it.

148
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,960
Since when

149
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,720
cook?

150
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,880
Actually, I can't.

151
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,240
But

152
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,240
I want to make it for you today.

153
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,480
What's wrong?

154
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,680
Is it a formal confession?

155
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,040
No.

156
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,800
I just want to thank you.

157
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
for helping me

158
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,160
in the Gu family.

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,400
It's easy to thank me.

160
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,200
Thank me?

161
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,080
Kiss me.

162
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,520
Don't bother.

163
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,320
Let's eat first.

164
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,920
Let's eat.

165
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,440
Sit down.

166
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,360
Just wait.

167
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,159
It'll be ready soon.

168
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,440
Time to eat.

169
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,840
Is it good?

170
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,400
Yes.

171
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,360
It's so delicious.

172
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,120
No.

173
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,320
It's really delicious.

174
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,360
It's the best noodles I've ever had.

175
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,200
Really?

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,480
Let me try.

177
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,679
Honey.

178
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,880
One is not enough.

179
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,159
Two is perfect.

180
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,919
Give me this.

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,440
Honey.

182
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,039
Let me try it.

183
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,640
Oh.

184
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll make one for you later.

185
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,799
Let go.

186
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,840
It's not cooked at all.

187
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
It's actually quite delicious.

188
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,040
Right?

189
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,160
Sorry.

190
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,920
Actually, I didn't cook well since I was a kid.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,680
This is my highest level.

192
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,600
No wonder my dad always says

193
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
So it's true.

194
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,160
It must be your dad's fault.

195
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
You've cooked for him.

196
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,760
but he's still picky.

197
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,520
If Xiaotang cooks for us,

198
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,160
I will eat it clean.

199
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,680
After all, she's our precious daughter.

200
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,400
She cooked for me.

201
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,000
right?

202
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,800
Dad.

203
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,840
Cheers.

204
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,200
Thank you for making me happy.

205
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,520
Honey.

206
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
What's wrong with you today?

207
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,760
Why do you keep saying thank you today?

208
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,240
Mom.

209
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,120
Why am I so sleepy?

210
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,040
How can I be sleepy after eating?

211
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,720
Honey.

212
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,640
Why did you do that?

213
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,520
Take your daughter

214
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,480
and start over.

215
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,640
Forget me.

216
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,880
Let's go.

217
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,520
Chae-yun.

218
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,120
Welcome home.

219
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,800
Bai Haoqing.

220
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,880
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
