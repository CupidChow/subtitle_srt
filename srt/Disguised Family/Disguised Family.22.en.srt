1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,480
Let him go!

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,000
Tell your men not to chase my daughter.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,760
I’ll let him go.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,200
Mr. Gu.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,480
The little girl ran away.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,160
Go after her.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,720
Mr. Gu.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,360
Don’t chase them.

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,160
The young master is still in their hands.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,800
He must have put the list

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,880
on his daughter.

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,320
Go after her.

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,000
But...

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,840
No buts.

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,320
I'll take care of the rest.

16
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,040
Let me remind you.

17
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,840
If anything happens to my daughter,

18
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,760
I can do anything.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,520
Sniper.

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,280
Peng.

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,360
It's okay.

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,840
Get them!

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,000
and think of Confucianism.

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
My son is downstairs.

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,080
What if you miss?

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,280
He's also my son.

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,680
How could I let him get hurt?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,920
It was an anesthesia.

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,000
I know you were in a hurry.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,560
It's not your fault.

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,759
Then tell me.

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,880
Nam Chae-yun is from Black Rock.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,920
Why did you lie to me that you don't know her?

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
There are so many people in Hei Shi.

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,000
How could I remember them all?

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,520
But it's my fault.

38
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,400
for not finding out who she is.

39
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
Swear.

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,039
you never lied to me.

41
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,840
I swear.

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,720
if I lied to you,

43
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll die a horrible death.

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,600
I'll bet one last time.

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,760
I won't let you lose this time.

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,440
Four years ago,

47
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,280
[White Water Security]

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,680
[There's a trend that surpasses Black Rock.]

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,440
After a car accident,

50
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,920
my dad and I were kidnapped by Hei Shi.

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,440
When I woke up,

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I was locked in a room like this.

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,960
Don’t be nervous.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
Miss Gu,

55
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,040
Let’s play a game.

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,560
This is the remote control of the electric chair.

57
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,880
One for you.

58
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,360
and your father.

59
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,560
The electric chair that controls your father.

60
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,800
Your father's remote control

61
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,920
control you.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Life and death

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,840
It's up to you.

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,800
Game starts.

65
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,960
You gave up the right to choose.

66
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,840
Don't blame me.

67
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,400
Handsome.

68
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,800
Stop!

69
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Stop it quickly.

70
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,080
I was wrong.

71
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,600
Let it stop.

72
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,720
I beg you.

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,840
I beg you.

74
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,320
Stop!

75
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,520
Stop it.

76
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,080
Please stop it.

77
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,280
Don't shock him.

78
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
You electrocuted me.

79
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,800
Young-joon.

80
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,280
Your wife has given up

81
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,760
to choose life and death.

82
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,159
But you still have

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,200
You have to choose

84
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,920
Press one.

85
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,400
Push it up.

86
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
It's electric.

87
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,840
Push down.

88
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,000
It's electric.

89
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,280
If you give up,

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,720
you'll choose to electrocute her.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,560
No.

92
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,000
Handsome face.

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,200
Don't try to be a hero.

94
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,920
Ask her to call me.

95
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,320
I'll die anyway.

96
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,160
Both of us...

97
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,040
won't let go of any of us.

98
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,400
Yes.

99
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,280
It's death anyway.

100
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,360
But you can make death

101
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
a little later.

102
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,480
And

103
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,160
not that painful.

104
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,320
Tell her to call me.

105
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,520
Young-joon.

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,120
Don't electrocute yourself.

107
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Don't electric yourself.

108
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,440
No.

109
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,280
Honey.

110
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,880
Honey.

111
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,520
Turn your head.

112
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,520
No.

113
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,159
No.

114
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,360
You won't look handsome later.

115
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
No!

116
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,600
No!

117
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,600
Young-joon.

118
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,200
Young-joon!

119
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,960
Stop!

120
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,600
Stop!

121
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,680
Please.

122
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,600
Stop!

123
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,760
Madam Gu, please.

124
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,920
Let him stop.

125
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,400
I'll take his place.

126
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,000
Let him electrocute me.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll take his place.

128
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,600
Honey.

129
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,680
Honey.

130
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,600
Why did he choose to electrocute himself?

131
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,800
Boring.

132
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,600
Steward Bai.

133
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,760
Take him out.

134
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,520
Don't let anyone die at home.

135
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,159
Wait.

136
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,799
Mrs. Gu,

137
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,760
You copied the room back then.

138
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,320
and made us repeat your past.

139
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,320
not just for revenge, right?

140
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,240
How did your father

141
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,360
choose back then?

142
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,480
Game starts.

143
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
It seems your father

144
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,400
doesn't love you that much.

145
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,720
Then I'll kill him for you.

146
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,480
I'm going to kill everyone in Hei Shi.

147
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,120
Then I'll kill you.

148
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm going to kill Blackrock.

149
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,480
Honey!

150
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,760
Honey.

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,560
Mrs. Gu.

152
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,400
Honey.

153
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,680
Mrs. Gu.

154
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,640
Are you okay?

155
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,360
Are you okay?

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,800
I...

157
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,920
I want...

158
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,440
Kill them all!

159
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,000
Everyone in Hei Shi.

160
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,840
He didn't choose me.

161
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,800
I convinced myself.

162
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,840
In that situation,

163
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,880
in such a situation?

164
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,160
It's human nature.

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,240
You may say that,

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,200
but in your heart,

167
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,640
in your heart.

168
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,480
You just decorated

169
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,200
the same room as before.

170
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,800
Let me and my husband be your experimental subject.

171
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,720
Unfortunately,

172
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
this is not what you want.

173
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,920
You have to admit that

174
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,520
your father

175
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,240
doesn't love you that much.

176
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,080
Shut up.

177
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,520
Of course my dad loves me.

178
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,040
Without that accident,

179
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
I could live in my dad's love forever.

180
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,680
Blackrock Company

181
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,240
and Jason's fault.

182
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,320
You and I

183
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,400
I hate Blackrock too.

184
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,400
Don't leave yourself alone.

185
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
Didn't you lie to me and my son?

186
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,240
Peng Peng treats Tangtang as his only best friend.

187
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,920
I respect you so much.

188
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,560
But all you think about is stealing from my house.

189
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,720
Xiaotang really treats Peng Peng as her friend.

190
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,120
She knows nothing.

191
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,840
If Hei Shi hadn't forced me,

192
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,880
I wouldn't have done that.

193
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,600
Enough.

194
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,760
Even if you're being used,

195
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,880
you're the same.

196
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,520
As for the rest,

197
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
explain to my dad.

198
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,640
Do it.

199
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Take care of them.

200
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,480
Wait.

201
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,240
Mr. Gu.

202
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,000
This is Madam's order.

203
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,040
Jason took Xiaotang away.

204
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
I lost the list.

205
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,880
I have something to ask them.

206
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,560
But...

207
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,640
I'm giving you too much face, aren't I?

208
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Are you the master of the Gu family or me?

209
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,560
Look at the people you're managing.

210
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,360
For so long,

211
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,520
for such a long time.

212
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,560
I lost the list.

213
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,840
you should be punished the most.

214
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,320
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

215
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
It’s my fault that I didn’t manage my men well.

216
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,400
But you should know

217
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,360
there's nothing wrong with the Gu family.

218
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,160
I only heard

219
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,080
Mrs. Gu.

220
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,320
Alone?

221
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,560
You are really her good dog.

222
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,200
Just stay here and watch.

223
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,800
After I ask,

224
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,640
you should be thrown into the river.

225
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,240
OK?

226
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,560
Mr. Gu.

227
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,560
Please.

228
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
Where's Heirock's headquarters?

229
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,800
Tell me.

230
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,720
your daughter was taken away by Jason.

231
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,960
He has the list.

232
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,960
Do you know how many people will die?

233
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,920
Tell me where Hei Shi is.

234
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
You are Kevin.

235
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,840
I am.

236
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,400
What happened eight years ago?

237
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,280
Eight years ago,

238
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,000
I wanted to leave Heirock.

239
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,080
But the company found out.

240
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,800
and treated me as a traitor.

241
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,920
So he sent Jason to kill me.

242
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,320
I was saved by the Gu family after I escaped from death.

243
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,440
From then on,

244
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,480
I've been thinking about Confucians.

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,520
I live only to defeat Black Rock.

246
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,440
Cai Yun.

247
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,440
I have no choice.

248
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
I really can't.

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,080
Tell me where Black Rock is.

250
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
I'll let you go.

251
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,320
Kevin.

252
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,120
Four years ago,

253
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
you brought the people of White Water

254
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,560
into the Black Rock to save people.

255
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
Since then,

256
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,440
there's no fixed position in the HQ.

257
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,240
Then you're useless.

258
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,440
Kevin, when did you

259
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,000
become this shameless?

260
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,760
If you want to live, be shameless.

261
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,119
Bai Haoqing.

262
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,200
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
