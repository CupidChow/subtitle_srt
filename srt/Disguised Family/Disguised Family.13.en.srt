1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,880
Please have a seat.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,800
Our boss will be here soon.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,680
Thank you.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,560
Don't move.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,280
Ms. Sara.

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,960
What do you mean?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
Mrs. Smith.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
Why don't you tell me

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,920
Who are you?

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Answer me.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,920
Who are you?

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,840
You're not good at disguising your identity.

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,640
If you can't think of a way,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,560
Honey.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,600
Learn from me.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,360
A flamboyant and confident acting.

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,480
My name

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,920
Nam Chae-yun.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,520
A personal bodyguard.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,320
Your father paid me to protect you.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,400
Nonsense.

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,840
My father passed away five years ago.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,039
Your father was gone five years ago.

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,880
But he paid me ten years in one go.

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,160
And I...

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,759
Don't move.

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,920
And I'm a bodyguard with principles.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,600
Even if the employer is dead,

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,200
I will keep my promise

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,520
and finish my job.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,880
Do you think

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,840
I would believe you?

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,800
That bastard who prioritizes men over women

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,200
doesn't care about my life at all.

35
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,520
or spend money.

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,360
to hire a bodyguard for me.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,920
Shut up!

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
You ignorant brat.

39
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,000
How could you say that about your father?

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,600
You know nothing about him.

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,520
He told me

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,480
the most regretful thing

43
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,800
in his life

44
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,880
that I didn't tell you

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,920
he loves you.

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,520
He values men over daughters.

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,919
But do you know

48
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,759
Among all his children,

49
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,120
among all his children.

50
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,800
Boss.

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,000
I can't stand it anymore.

52
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,280
Can you wait until I finish?

53
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,840
I have no idea.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,640
Of course,

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,320
he once said something very despicable.

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,280
He said

57
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,960
it would be great if Sara was a son.

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
He doesn't dare to face you.

59
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
He doesn't even dare to let you know

60
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,440
he hired a bodyguard

61
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,840
to protect you.

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,120
I shouldn't have told you this.

64
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,480
Boss.

65
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,720
Don't listen to her.

66
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,040
She approached you

67
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,079
to approach you.

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,280
How dare you say that?

69
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,400
Let me ask you.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,600
Yesterday,

71
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,360
Sara was unconscious in the hotel.

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,640
and was almost assassinated.

73
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,600
Where were you?

74
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,480
How did she know I was assassinated last night?

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,360
Let me ask you again.

76
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,360
When Sara was poisoned

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
and almost died,

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,200
where were you?

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,040
Say something.

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
Do you think

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,800
because of this loser?

82
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,079
Without me,

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,920
you would have died 800 times.

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
Useless thing.

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you waiting for?

86
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,160
Sit down.

87
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,800
Don't you want to buy me dinner?

88
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,880
I misunderstood you

90
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,760
wrong about you.

91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Nam Chae-yun.

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,000
What a nice name.

93
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Better than Smith.

94
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,480
than Smith.

95
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,160
Actually,

96
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,240
I did something wrong too.

97
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,320
Can you

98
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,960
tell me more

99
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,880
about my father?

100
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,080
No hurry.

101
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,400
I'll tell you later.

102
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,520
What I'm curious about now is

103
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,120
how you know who I am.

104
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,160
I saw you

105
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,240
I saw you.

106
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,200
Xiaorou is my daughter.

107
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,880
She just transferred to your daughter's class.

108
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,080
Xiao Rou is your daughter.

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,960
Aren't you my bodyguard?

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,080
You don't even know that?

111
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,840
I'm only responsible for your personal safety.

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,680
I'm not interested in anything else.

113
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,440
Besides,

114
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,040
you know I'm a burden.

115
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,800
I'm not staring at you 24 hours a day.

116
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,320
Bodyguards have their own lives.

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
Since we've made it clear,

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,720
you don't have to protect me in secret anymore.

119
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,560
You...

120
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,000
to be my personal bodyguard.

121
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,280
I'll pay you.

122
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,440
To be honest,

123
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,280
I quite like you.

124
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
Being with you

125
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,800
is much more comfortable

126
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,720
with those stinky men.

127
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,240
You did a good job.

128
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,200
Now,

129
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,720
Sara's bodyguard.

130
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,400
We're one step closer

131
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,000
to the Gu family.

132
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,720
It's not that easy.

133
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,480
Sara still doesn't trust me.

134
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,680
Being your personal bodyguard

135
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,520
to be your personal bodyguard.

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,440
But I have a few conditions.

137
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,200
Anything.

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,480
To ensure your safety,

139
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,920
I need to investigate your work

140
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,760
and the environment

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,920
in your life,

142
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,680
including

143
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,040
the backyard of Yin Yue House.

144
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
Not there.

145
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,400
In that case,

146
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,680
I can't work.

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,760
You know what?

148
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,720
What is the most important thing

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,200
What's the most important thing

150
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,680
It's trust.

151
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,000
No trust.

152
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,160
I can't work.

153
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,160
Except this,

154
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,120
I can promise you

155
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,000
anything.

156
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,720
I won't force you.

157
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,920
But there's one thing

158
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,800
I have to know.

159
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,480
is your personal relationship.

160
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,440
You were murdered twice in a row.

161
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,920
I found out that your husband hired a murderer.

162
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Don't worry.

163
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
My husband

164
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,400
has been officially arrested today.

165
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,800
He won't

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,760
have a chance.

167
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,800
But according to my investigation,

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
this matter

169
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
has something to do

170
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,480
with the Gu family.

171
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,320
You know about the Gu family?

172
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,000
She still doesn't allow me to enter the backyard.

173
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,400
And whenever I mention the Gu family,

174
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,800
she would end the topic.

175
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,600
My family and the Gu family

176
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,600
are friends for generations.

177
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,120
Don't worry about that.

178
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,280
The Gu family doesn't like to show up in public.

179
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,200
So let's stop talking about

180
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,800
is over.

181
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,800
It means

182
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,760
about me.

183
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,640
Walk step by step.

184
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,840
We have to take it step by step.

185
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,400
Now we have

186
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,320
a good start.

187
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,920
Let's celebrate.

188
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,000
But

189
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,520
I found something else.

190
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Sara seems to have some serious disease.

191
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,600
Disease?

192
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
And strangely,

193
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
the backyard of Yin Yue House

194
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
is the most secured place.

195
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,760
Go back first.

196
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,120
Come to me tomorrow.

197
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,520
But I saw it there.

198
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Rou.

199
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,280
However,

200
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,880
Xiao Rou is her daughter after all.

201
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,080
It's not strange

202
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,120
It's not strange.

203
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,280
Forget it.

204
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,080
Let's drink.

205
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,160
Bye.

206
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,960
Actually, drinking

207
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,400
not just drinking.

208
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,480
but

209
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,320
together.

210
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,680
Stay longer.

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,520
Thank you.

212
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,440
Gosh.

213
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,360
Red is gone.

214
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,200
Rou.

215
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,520
Rou!

216
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,360
Rou!

217
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,080
Rou.

218
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,880
Honey.

219
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,520
Mrs. Gu's butler.

220
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,240
There must be something important

221
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,560
in his black box.

222
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,360
I'll go meet him.

223
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,800
Nam Chae-yun.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
Let me introduce.

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,880
This is my husband.

226
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
My daughter, Xiaotang.

227
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,040
I heard that

228
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,240
Xiaorou is sick.

229
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,360
She's worried.

230
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,480
So I came to see you.

231
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,240
Auntie.

232
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,000
Where is Xiaorou?

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,920
Is she okay?

234
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,640
Xiaorou is resting.

235
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
She's fine.

236
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,800
It's just malnutrition.

237
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,160
Auntie.

238
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,880
Can I visit Xiao Rou?

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,320
I brought her flowers.

240
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,120
Thank you.

241
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,520
It's not convenient today.

242
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll tell Xiao Rou

243
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,920
you came to see her.

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,480
Okay?

245
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,560
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,720
I have an appointment today.

247
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
I can't entertain you.

248
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,120
Let's make an appointment

249
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,080
next time.

250
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,400
By then,

251
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,200
get to know this gentleman.

252
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,320
Please leave today.

253
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,440
Okay.

254
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,720
Send them off for me.

255
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,040
Didn't you say she was seriously ill yesterday?

256
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,600
Why are you acting like nothing happened today?

257
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm confused too.

258
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,720
Xiao Rou's illness is too sudden.

259
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,520
Xiaorou.

260
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,600
I need you.

261
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,680
Please help me.

262
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,560
Okay?

263
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,480
Xiaorou.

264
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,320
Will you be my daughter?

265
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,000
Bai Haoqing.

266
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,080
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
