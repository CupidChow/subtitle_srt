00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,800
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,280
My name is Nanxiao Tang.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,680
I'm six years old.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,240
I'm the luckiest girl

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,680
in the world.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,480
Because my parents

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,360
Superman.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,800
My mom

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,880
I have a lot to do every day.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,840
Mop the floor.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,120
Laundry.

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,000
and grocery shopping.

13
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,120
She can always

14
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,320
in order.

15
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,760
At night,

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,040
she would tell me bedtime stories.

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,720
She's like a superman.

18
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,280
She has endless stamina.

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,960
endless patience.

20
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,440
But most importantly,

21
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,920
she's good at shooting.

22
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,680
Spear?

23
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,960
Nice shot.

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,480
My mom is a superman.

25
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,560
My dad is Iron Man.

26
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,560
My dad is still a pig.

27
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,440
Stop laughing, guys.

28
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,920
Okay.

29
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,840
Stop laughing.

30
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,640
It's okay to add some fantasies to your composition.

31
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,760
But sir,

32
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm not writing about fantasy.

33
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,240
Sir.

34
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,800
I know.

35
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,400
She has heard too many stories before she goes to bed.

36
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,000
She's still daydreaming.

37
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm not lying.

38
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,000
Who are you?

39
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,920
I called security.

40
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,840
Get Nanxiao Tang.

41
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,200
Guys.

42
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,880
Run!

43
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,080
Let go of me!

44
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,200
Mom!

45
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,200
Let go of me!

46
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,240
Xiaotang.

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,760
Hide.

48
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,960
My superman Mama is here!

49
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,960
Mom.

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,600
Xiaotang, I'm sorry.

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,440
I'm late.

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,120
Mom is the best.

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,240
Here.

54
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,520
Nam Chae-yun!

55
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,880
Come out.

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,440
Mom.

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,040
Don't be afraid.

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,280
I'll protect you.

59
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,000
Xiaotang.

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,960
We can go home now.

61
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,160
Go find Dad.

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,840
Dad.

63
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,720
Baby.

64
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,680
Is dad handsome?

65
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,440
Honey.

66
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
Their backup unit is coming.

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,480
Let's call it a day.

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,120
Let's go on the swing.

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,200
Okay.

70
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,160
Xiao Tang.

71
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,680
Are you ready?

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,680
I'm flying!

73
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,400
Darn it.

74
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,400
They got away.

75
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
This is my superman parents.

76
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,079
They're amazing.

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,760
They love me so much.

78
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,000
But actually,

79
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,520
the three of us

80
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,240
just met.

81
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,880
Our story

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,840
will start

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,520
when I came to Mantae.

84
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,440
Sugar.

85
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,200
Nam Chae-yun.

86
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,280
Peter.

87
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,240
It's me.

88
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,920
Carry out.

89
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,200
Dad.

90
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,640
Where are we going?

91
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,600
To a new country.

92
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,560
Xiao Tang.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,360
Our new life

94
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
is about to begin.

95
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,480
Dad! Dad!

96
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,120
Slow down.

97
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,560
The teacher asked me to buy crayons.

98
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,560
50 yuan.

99
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,160
Take it.

100
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,800
Buy the best.

101
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,640
Thank you, Dad.

102
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,560
I'm going to school.

103
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,480
Dad! Dad!

104
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,120
Dad.

105
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,280
Why do you

106
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,880
the same newspaper every day?

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,880
Uh.

108
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,720
Review the old and learn the new.

109
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,720
Dad.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,920
The teacher asked me to buy it.

111
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,480
Jump rope.

112
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,800
100 yuan.

113
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,720
Take it.

114
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,280
Buy the best.

115
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560
Thank you, Dad.

116
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,280
I'm going to school.

117
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,040
Dad! Dad!

118
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,400
Dad.

119
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,880
The teacher asked me to buy rubber mud.

120
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,520
100 yuan.

121
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,440
100 yuan for the dictionary.

122
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,840
Buy the best one.

123
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,600
100 ruler.

124
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,000
Buy the best one.

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,440
Ten pencil bags.

126
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,800
Buy the best one.

127
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,560
50 bookmarks.

128
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,120
Buy the best.

129
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,159
Buy the best

130
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,280
Buy the best

131
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,880
My teacher asked me to buy homework books.

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,680
100 yuan.

133
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,240
I've bought your homework book.

134
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,280
What else do you want to buy?

135
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,880
Dad, mom, bye.

136
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,960
I'm going to school.

137
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,960
The experts said

138
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
you should care about your child.

139
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,080
not doting on her.

140
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,760
You know she wants pocket money.

141
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,640
but you still spoil her.

142
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,520
Goodness.

143
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,840
A rich daughter and a poor child.

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,600
Don't worry.

145
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,800
I know what to do.

146
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
If you do,

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,520
why did you give sugar to my wallet?

148
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,080
I'm addicted to smoking.

149
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,040
Go out and smoke.

150
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,920
Got it.

151
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,520
Okay.

152
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,480
Yes.

153
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,960
Two.

154
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,720
Try to lean to the window.

155
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,600
The seat should be next to it.

156
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,800
economy class.

157
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,680
Tell me the flight number.

158
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,159
Okay.

159
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,520
What's wrong, honey?

160
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,720
Where are you going?

161
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,280
Xiaotang wants to go hiking.

162
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,320
I plan to take her to the mountain for a few days.

163
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,400
I remember you were busy.

164
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,400
so I didn't arrange for you.

165
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,160
Go ahead.

166
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,960
Oh, right.

167
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,520
Be careful.

168
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,680
Okay.

169
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,560
Young-joon.

170
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,920
Do you remember me?

171
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,200
Can you stop snatching my wine every time you come?

172
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,560
Then tell me.

173
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,800
Do you remember Yan Young-joon?

174
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,080
I didn't say I wouldn't tell you.

175
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,040
I've only seen him once in Blackrock.

176
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,680
He's handsome.

177
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,640
You're glib-tongued.

178
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,640
Happy?

179
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,560
Give me the wine.

180
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,160
Body.

181
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,760
Body?

182
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,200
What's so special about you?

183
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Am I your servant?

184
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,160
30,000 won.

185
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,760
You're so generous.

186
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,039
He's tall.

187
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,960
180 cm tall.

188
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,799
He likes to play stocks.

189
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,360
He has a briefcase.

190
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,559
He said it was a weapon.

191
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,760
Nice equipment.

192
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,080
I don't think it works as well as a knife.

193
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,160
Got it.

194
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,520
Make it quick next time.

195
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,160
I remember.

196
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,240
He's good at playing guitar.

197
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,480
What a pity.

198
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,520
What do you mean?

199
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,960
Hey.

200
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,640
He's dead.

201
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,160
You're still young.

202
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,800
at such a young age.

203
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,280
Honey, I'm home.

204
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,680
Are you playing the guitar?

205
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
Xiaotang wants to learn guitar.

206
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
She kept pestering me last night.

207
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,760
I can't play either.

208
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,240
She has no music at all.

209
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,280
Why don't you teach her?

210
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
I don't want to spend money to hire a teacher.

211
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,360
I don't know how to play guitar.

212
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,920
Doraemon is trembling.

213
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
I can't even tell

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,320
Who are you?

215
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,720
You're not handsome.

216
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,680
The real face Young-joon is already dead.

217
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Why did you

218
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,720
to get close to me?

219
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,840
Put the gun down.

220
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,640
Listen to me.

221
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,920
It's just a code name.

222
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,480
What's so important about my name?

223
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,880
Just like Nam Chae-yun.

224
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,000
It's just a code name.

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,600
Isn't it?

226
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,440
I don't care what your real name is.

227
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,240
But I know

228
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,480
I care about you.

229
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,880
I trusted you so much this year.

230
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,080
How dare you lie to me?

231
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Why would I lie to you?

232
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,560
Do you trust me?

233
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,160
What is this?

234
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,240
Trust.

235
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,000
Trust

236
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,320
Trust.

237
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,800
There's more.

238
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,480
In order not to hurt your pride,

239
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,600
I've tolerated it.

240
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,080
This...

241
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,080
is your so-called trust.

242
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,920
Same to you.

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,520
You're not much better.

244
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,240
This is so awkward.

245
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,480
Honey, listen to me.

246
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,680
This morning,

247
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,960
Who were you talking to?

248
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,760
Jason.

249
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,160
I'm sorry for lying to you.

250
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
I wanted to explain to you.

251
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,480
Don't move.

252
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,640
Listen to me, honey.

253
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,240
Indeed.

254
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,320
I'm Jason's spy.

255
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,080
But I regret it now.

256
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,000
Jason is coming.

257
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,840
Boqing.

258
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,920
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
