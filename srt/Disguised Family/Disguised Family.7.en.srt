1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:22,880
Pei.

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,600
How is she?

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,640
Doctor.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,200
Mistake.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,080
Vocal cords will be damaged forever.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,240
I can't talk anymore.

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,360
What's the attitude of the hospital and school?

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,320
Tomorrow,

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,800
the person responsible for the accident.

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,360
After so many years,

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,160
they haven't changed at all.

12
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,360
You're not the one who should be punished.

13
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,480
But the one who should be punished

14
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,720
will not be punished.

15
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,800
You'll know tomorrow.

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,560
Mr. Director.

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,120
Peppi can't go to Vienna

18
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
because of an accident.

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,120
Babymonster is very talented

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,640
For now, she is a more suitable candidate.

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,480
Good girl.

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,320
That's her then.

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,079
What a pity.

24
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,360
Hello, everyone from the media.

25
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,600
After investigation,

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,240
The chef of the school cafeteria.

27
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,800
Bo-rae.

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,920
Because of his mistake,

29
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,240
there was a fish thorn in the food

30
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,040
and Pei's throat got stuck.

31
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,240
So our school decided

32
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,480
to fire the chef, Bo Lai.

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,520
and never be hired.

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,560
I'm deeply sorry

35
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,560
for my mistake.

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,800
I accept any punishment from the school.

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,760
Because of my personal mistake,

38
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,400
because of my mistake.

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,280
First, I want to apologize

40
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,160
and her family.

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,040
I'm willing to bear all the compensation and compensation.

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,880
Also,

43
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,160
due to my personal reasons,

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,079
due to my personal reasons.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,280
So I decided

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,720
take the blame and resign.

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,040
Liar!

48
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,200
All liars!

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,640
All liars!

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,320
I failed to protect you.

51
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,840
You not only lost your dream,

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,160
but also ruined your life.

53
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,720
Hello, Aunt Pei.

54
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,279
Hello, Aunt Pei.

55
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,320
Hello.

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,320
Who is it?

57
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,600
I want you to tell the truth

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,000
in front of the media.

59
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,640
Otherwise,

60
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,120
I'll set the school on fire.

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,120
Sergeant! Sergeant!

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,200
You're finally here.

63
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,120
Her parents are crazy.

64
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,560
She...

65
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,600
She kidnapped a student.

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,320
Sergeant.

67
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,600
Excuse me.

68
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Excuse me.

69
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,320
Sergeant, don't delay any longer.

70
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
Shoot her.

71
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,480
What if she goes crazy and lights the fire?

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,960
There are five students inside.

73
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,720
That's five lives!

74
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,320
Stay away!

75
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,640
Don't come over!

76
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Calm down.

77
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,520
We'll help you to the end.

78
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,160
How will you help me?

79
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,720
Shoot me.

80
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,840
It'll be too late if you don't shoot.

81
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,640
Quiet!

82
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,240
Shut up!

83
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,600
PePei's mom is not that kind of person.

84
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,760
Don't shoot.

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,800
My daughter is in there too.

86
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,720
And I know her.

87
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,920
Let me go in and talk to her.

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,720
Talk about what?

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
He's crazy.

90
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,200
Sergeant.

91
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,520
We have to kill her to save the students.

92
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,240
Five minutes.

93
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,520
Give me five minutes.

94
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,960
Okay.

95
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,080
I'll give you five minutes.

96
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,720
Go.

97
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Okay, thank you.

98
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,120
Mom.

99
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,800
Don't come over!

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,640
PePei's mom.

101
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,720
I know you want the truth now.

102
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,000
But if you do this,

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,040
not only will you fail to get the truth,

104
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,040
but also get yourself involved.

105
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,840
Who cares about our lives?

106
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,880
I do.

107
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,320
We all care.

108
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,000
Just stay out of this.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,600
Trust me.

110
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,440
I can really help you.

111
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,640
They're all monsters who eat humans.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,640
And I can only be trampled by them like ants.

113
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,840
I compromised step by step

114
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,160
in exchange for more harm.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,120
They won't even spare a six-year-old child.

116
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,720
I just want everyone to see the truth

117
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,640
and bring justice to Pei.

118
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,160
That's five students.

119
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,640
Sergeant!

120
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,800
Shoot! What are you waiting for?

121
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,320
Don't shoot.

122
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,840
Ah!

123
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,120
Fire, Sergeant!

124
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,200
Don't shoot!

125
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
Bullets can generate fire.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,200
The whole classroom will be on fire.

127
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,760
Sergeant.

128
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,520
Shoot.

129
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,880
Ms. Lena and I

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,640
know their background.

131
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,560
Amanda.

132
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,800
Principal.

133
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,440
Chef.

134
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,800
And those doctors who had surgery.

135
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,520
None of them can escape.

136
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,120
They are all in cahoots.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,440
What can you do with them?

138
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,760
Sniper, get ready.

139
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,240
The sniper is in position.

140
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,560
Once the criminals are overreacted,

141
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,200
shoot immediately.

142
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,120
Shoot!

143
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,800
Shoot her!

144
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,960
Sergeant.

145
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,760
If she gets hurt, I'll kill her.

146
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,720
Can you be quiet?

147
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,520
If you want the students to be fine,

148
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,480
don't provoke criminals.

149
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,760
Just shoot.

150
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Amanda is very powerful.

151
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,920
Who can afford to offend him?

152
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,600
I can.

153
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,880
I'll pull them out.

154
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,960
and make them pay.

155
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,200
Trust me.

156
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,240
I'm not like them.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,720
Listen to me.

158
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,320
Give me the lighter.

159
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,280
Don't let go.

160
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,560
If you let go, everyone will die.

161
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,240
The criminals have no intention to surrender.

162
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,400
Shoot.

163
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,000
Team A, go!

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,960
Why are there two gunshots?

165
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,039
Let's go.

166
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,920
Come here.

167
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,360
Honey.

168
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,440
I'm safe here.

169
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,040
Luckily, I didn't make a big mistake.

170
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,480
But don't worry.

171
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,680
I will make them pay.

172
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,240
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,120
You still have a long way to go.

174
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,440
Live a good life with Pei.

175
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,120
I'll get you a lawyer.

176
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,560
It'll be fine.

177
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,120
Pei has sent her away.

178
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,880
My ex-husband

179
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,760
took her back to the countryside.

180
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,680
I'm not a good mother.

181
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,200
Don't say that.

182
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,800
You're a good mother.

183
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,920
Let's go out first.

184
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Listen, everyone inside.

185
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,320
Raise your hands.

186
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,040
Leave the classroom one by one.

187
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,120
I'll explain it for you.

188
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,560
Wait for me.

189
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,840
Xiaotang's mom.

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
Thank you so much

191
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,760
and Ms. Lena.

192
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
Thank you for

193
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,400
Thank you.

194
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,440
Bye.

195
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,160
