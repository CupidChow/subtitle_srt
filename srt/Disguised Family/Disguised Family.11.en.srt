1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,920
Why are you here?

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,320
I knew you would take this order.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,960
Of course.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,880
After all, at the auction,

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,080
at the auction.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,680
He deliberately hung me out

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,120
just to mock me.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,760
I won't take it, right?

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,880
This is Hei Shi's biggest order.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,880
I don't believe you won't make money.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,160
After all,

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
it's worth it.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,520
Let's go.

14
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,760
It's her.

15
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,200
Why did you kill her?

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,920
Chapter 1 of the Black Rock Assassin Manual.

17
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,800
Don't ask why.

18
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,400
Why?

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,640
I just don't understand.

20
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,200
Can't you do it by yourselves?

21
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,320
Why did you call me?

22
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,360
The client requested a suicide.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,840
and write a suicide note in her name.

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,960
Write it down.

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,560
You're the best copycat in Black Rock.

26
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,720
If I don't look for you,

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
who else can I find?

28
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,160
Let's make it clear.

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,480
I'm only responsible for fabricating the will.

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,440
I can't

31
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,040
I can't do it.

32
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,240
What?

33
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,600
You've been with Nam Chae-yun for a long time.

34
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,160
You're acting like a good person now.

35
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,680
Release your nature.

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,920
Chapter 3, Part 1.

37
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,880
The traces of suicide.

38
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,360
The wrist cutting needs to be scratched repeatedly.

39
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200
Don't kill him with one stab.

40
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,760
to simulate the hesitant psychological activity.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,240
60% of fear.

42
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,360
40%.

43
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,000
Wait a minute.

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
What's wrong?

45
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
She wrote with her left hand.

46
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,000
Are you sure?

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,120
Yes.

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,440
She's left-handed.

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
I'm Sara.

50
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,720
I killed many innocent children

51
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,399
I killed many innocent children.

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,720
and made many mistakes.

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,520
Self-death is mine.

54
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,800
It's my way.

55
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,160
After I die,

56
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,560
to my husband after I die.

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,840
Chapter 2, Part 1.

58
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
You can't cut your wrist with one stab.

59
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,240
You need to cut it repeatedly.

60
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,720
to simulate the hesitant psychological activity.

61
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,280
60% of fear.

62
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,000
40%.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,720
Wait.

64
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,320
What now?

65
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,560
The person who tried to kill her

66
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,480
is her husband.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,120
So what?

68
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,240
You're so nosy.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,640
Listen to me.

70
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,000
Her husband wanted to kill his wife.

71
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,720
It could be

72
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
to take the blame.

73
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,240
The will says

74
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,200
Sara killed many innocent children.

75
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,760
Then push it backwards.

76
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,120
those innocent children

77
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,000
are likely

78
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,000
her husband killed her. So?

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,120
So?

80
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,600
So I can't do this.

81
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,280
Don't forget what you promised me.

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,520
If you want money,

83
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,600
do what you should do.

84
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,159
By the way,

85
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,480
I remember seeing

86
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,920
This...

87
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,320
Could it be...

88
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,080
she's from Yin Yue House?

89
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,800
Then she's from the Gu family.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
You two know her identity.

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,080
and asked me to forge her will.

92
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,040
Are you purposely making me against the Gu family?

93
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,680
You're so poor.

94
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,400
You don't deserve Cai Yun.

95
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,320
It's not up to you to decide.

96
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,760
Don't look at me like that.

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,560
Do you think everyone listens to you

98
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
like Ko Rang?

99
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,120
Did I let you go?

100
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,400
You're not only poor,

101
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,640
but also very bad.

102
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,360
It's even worse.

103
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,080
What are you two doing?

104
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,840
Don't move.

105
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,560
The police will be here in one minute.

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,320
He Luning.

107
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,600
I advise you not to bother me.

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,520
Remember,

109
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,360
He's mine.

110
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,760
Don't bully him.

111
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,720
Bye.

112
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,440
She said he works for her.

113
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,440
Stop laughing.

114
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,080
Are you following me?

115
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,760
Can't I?

116
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
You went to work behind my back.

117
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,520
I had no choice.

118
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
What about 20 million?

119
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Don't take it next time.

120
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,040
I'll support you.

121
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,600
Honey,

122
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,080
Aren't you afraid I'll lie to you?

123
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,600
Between couples,

124
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
is the relationship

125
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,600
and lie to you?

126
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,960
By the way, honey.

127
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Sara

128
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,040
has something to do with Yin Yue House.

129
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,600
Let's go to Yin Yue House

130
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,520
to find Sara.

131
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,600
We can do it together.

132
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,760
We can do it.

133
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,560
This is the location of Yin Yue House.

134
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,600
The phone was made from here.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,880
Yinyue Restaurant

136
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,240
is a private high-end restaurant club.

137
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,280
According to the sources,

138
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,280
it also runs art and antiques trade.

139
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,600
The equity behind this

140
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,640
is very complicated.

141
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,160
It also involves the departing capital.

142
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
We don't have much information.

143
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,840
It sounds like the Gu family's style.

144
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
Let's go to Yin Yue House tomorrow

145
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,080
and copy the background of the Gu family.

146
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,920
But the security of Yin Yue House is very tight.

147
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,000
And it's an appointment.

148
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,520
Even if we make an appointment now,

149
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,760
we'll have to wait half a year at the earliest.

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,960
Do you want to make an appointment now?

151
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,760
Don't worry.

152
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,440
Someone has booked lunch for us tomorrow.

153
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,440
Ah.

154
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,400
Hold on.

155
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,160
You mean

156
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,160
the appointment at 11:30 pm?

157
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,560
But I found that

158
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,360
the reservation is

159
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,560
named Smith.

160
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,400
And they made an appointment six months ago.

161
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,040
That's right.

162
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,120
This time, it's "Smith and his wife". It's "Smith".

163
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,600
Smith couple.

164
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,200
We'll take care of the real Smith couple.

165
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,400
You'll implant our identity information to the backstage.

166
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,640
to verify it.

167
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,000
This pair of glasses has a photograph function.

168
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,000
Tomorrow,

169
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,040
Chae-yun will find a way to enter their office.

170
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,560
If there's a lot of paper materials in her office,

171
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,280
in her office,

172
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,920
can be scan.

173
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,520
You two have been verified.

174
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,120
Please.

175
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,440
Their computer must have been encrypted.

176
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,840
The security level must be high.

177
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,840
Take this USB.

178
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,280
If you put it on the computer,

179
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,920
I can crack it from afar.

180
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,720
Thank you.

181
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,640
Tomorrow,

182
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,600
we'll check this place out.

183
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Yin Yue House.

184
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
Greetings, my lords.

185
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,040
Greetings, my lords.

186
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,320
Are you exaggerating?

187
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,600
Rise.

188
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,760
Mr. Smith.

189
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,000
Mrs. Smith.

190
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,440
Welcome to

191
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,520
We're from Singapore.

192
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,360
