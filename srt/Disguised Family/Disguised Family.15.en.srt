1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,320
The estimated arrival time

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,760
30 minutes left.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,600
After my mom adopted me,

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,160
she often drew my blood

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,760
to herself.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,960
Mom said

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,080
she won't get old.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,800
Let me see.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,520
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,880
I didn't save you earlier.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,040
Auntie.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,920
It's not your fault.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,160
I was afraid.

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,400
I didn't dare to tell anyone.

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,200
I want my mom to love me.

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,520
My blood will make her happy.

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,360
Mom will love me more.

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,160
Xiaorou.

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,200
This is not love.

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
The person who truly loves you

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,240
won't hurt you.

22
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,600
Auntie.

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,880
I know

24
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,200
my mom doesn't love me.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,840
She only loves my blood.

26
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,240
But I couldn't say no.

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,520
Because I'm more afraid of going back to the orphanage.

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,000
When I was an orphan.

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,200
Ma'am.

30
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,400
Can you help me?

31
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,440
I don't want any more injections.

32
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,000
It hurts.

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,920
It's okay.

34
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm here.

35
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,560
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

36
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,240
I'll protect you, okay?

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,480
How is it?

38
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,640
The goods I brought are good, right?

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
Invitation.

40
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,520
I'll send it to you.

41
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,600
I'm relieved to hear that.

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,320
Boss.

43
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,039
Xiaorou ran away.

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,240
Useless!

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,080
Go find her now.

46
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,640
I can help you find Xiao Rou.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,400
No need.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,960
There's Xiaorou's location.

49
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,520
It's no use just knowing the location.

50
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,640
You still don't know who your opponent is.

51
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,960
What are you trying to say?

52
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,640
Xiaorou.

53
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,400
She's heading to Happiness Villa.

54
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,040
How did you know?

55
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,640
Not only that,

56
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,840
I also know

57
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,480
Nam Chae-yun took her.

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,480
No way.

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,640
Nam Chae-yun is my bodyguard.

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,000
She saved my life.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And more than once.

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
She has no reason to do that.

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
She can sneak into Yinyue House silently.

64
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,200
and take people away,

65
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,280
and things.

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
can only be Nam Chae-yun.

67
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,880
If you don't believe me,

68
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,640
make a call.

69
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,760
If Nam Chae Yun

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,360
Nam Chae-yun,

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
I don't think she's home yet.

72
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,800
The estimated arrival time

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,520
26 minutes left.

74
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,040
It's from Sara.

75
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,880
It's okay.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,880
She called at this time

77
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,800
I think she's suspecting me.

78
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,960
Honey.

79
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,680
Answer it for me.

80
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,600
Show me

81
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
your talent for lying.

82
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,920
What are you talking about?

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,120
Be quiet.

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
The estimated arrival time

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
24 minutes left.

86
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,160
Hello, Sara.

87
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,840
Why are you calling at this hour?

88
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,720
Is Nam Chae-yun home?

89
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,280
Chae-yun?

90
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,320
She's taking a shower.

91
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,440
What's up?

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,680
When she's done,

93
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,440
I'll ask her to call you back.

94
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,160
Tell him.

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,720
Xiaorou wants to talk to Xiaotang.

96
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Let Xiaotang answer it.

97
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,120
Xiaorou wants to talk to Xiaotang.

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,880
Let Xiaotang pick her up.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,480
Kids sleep early.

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Tomorrow.

101
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
I'll tell Xiaotang tomorrow.

102
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,880
Okay.

103
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Tomorrow then.

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,520
I'll leave you to rest.

105
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,240
Okay.

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
We have to go home now.

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,200
Sit tight.

108
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,160
Ms. Sara.

109
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,840
If you trust me,

110
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,960
you can go to Nam Chae Yun's house with me.

111
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
I promise I'll find Xiao Rou for you.

112
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,320
If you're fast enough,

113
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,160
maybe

114
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,640
we might be able to stop him at the door.

115
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,200
We have avoided the accident.

116
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,000
The best route is expected to take 20 minutes.

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,640
The estimated arrival time

118
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,120
15 minutes left.

119
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
15 minutes

120
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,720
to the destination.

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,240
You've exceeded the speed.

122
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,880
Please slow down.

123
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,120
The road ahead is under construction.

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,120
We will re-plan the route for you.

125
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,200
Five more minutes for the new route.

126
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,920
It's estimated to be 20 minutes.

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,280
It's too late.

128
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,200
Nam Chae-yun saved my life.

129
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,240
Before we find out the truth,

130
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
before the truth is out.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,280
So be nice to her.

132
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,800
Don't embarrass my face.

133
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,520
You said you were still taking a shower.

134
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,000
There's no one now.

135
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,480
Am I right?

136
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,920
Ms. Sara.

137
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,159
Who is it at this hour?

138
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,600
Looking for...

139
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,400
Xiaorou's mom.

140
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,960
Ho-ho's mom.

141
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,360
And that person.

142
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,360
Why are you here?

143
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,200
What did you call me?

144
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
I can't remember.

145
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,400
Isn't it someone?

146
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,880
Say that again.

147
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,240
Honey.

148
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,560
Why are you here?

149
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,600
Nothing.

150
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,360
Get some rest.

151
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,120
Chae-yun.

152
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,120
You've improved a lot.

153
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,080
But you can't fool me.

154
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,440
The teddy bear is not far from here.

155
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,520
Let's go over there.

156
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,400
[Backing up, please be alert.]

157
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,880
[Backing up, please be alert.]

158
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,800
What are you doing?

159
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,000
Fine.

160
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,600
Oh no.

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,799
They found the location in the teddy bear toy.

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,600
What should we do?

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,600
What if Xiaorou says it?

164
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,559
Go back now.

165
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,280
Take all the rooms

166
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,799
Record.

167
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,400
Tools.

168
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,120
Wipe it clean.

169
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,520
and make a statement with your doctor.

170
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,720
Tell him

171
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,600
Kids are born with malnutrition.

172
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,720
The needle on his arm

173
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,960
was left by IV treatment.

174
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,320
For tomorrow's charity dinner,

175
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,520
you must donate in a grand manner.

176
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,880
real gold and silver.

177
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,960
Don't feel sorry for the money.

178
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,480
The more you donate,

179
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,040
the better the public opinion is for you.

180
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,800
I'll leave Xiaorou alone.

181
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,680
Leave this to us.

182
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,160
Tomorrow noon,

183
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,840
tomorrow noon.

184
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,600
Rou.

185
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,960
Stay at my house for the next few days.

186
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,120
Don't go anywhere.

187
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,680
Okay.

188
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,760
If anyone asks where she is at school,

189
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,440
you have to say you don't know.

190
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,080
Okay.

191
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:30,960
Come.

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,040
Let's hug Xiao Rou.

193
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,760
Okay.

194
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,800
It's okay.

195
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,320
Ho-ho.

196
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,640
Do you remember

197
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,480
Do you remember?

198
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,720
Yes, mom.

199
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,480
Your crybaby deskmate is here.

200
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,000
You cried

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,440
and cried in the toilet.

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,800
Xiaorou.

203
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,680
Rou.

204
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,400
I see.

205
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,280
a white water security company.

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,800
That means

207
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,560
the only one who can help us

208
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,640
who can help us unlock this necklace.

209
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Actually we can

210
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,680
find someone to crack it.

211
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,040
If it explodes,

212
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,160
no one will die.

213
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,000
If the research is done,

214
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,320
the three of us

215
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,040
will be free.

216
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,360
Uncle, auntie.

217
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,280
Good morning.

218
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,800
Good morning.

219
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,320
Have breakfast.

220
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
What do you want to eat?

221
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,000
Come and sit.

222
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,560
I'll pour you a drink.

223
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,200
Be good and eat.

224
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,120
Here.

225
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,320
Eat this.

226
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,320
Honey.

227
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,840
Are you worried about Xiao Rou?

228
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,640
Of course I am.

229
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,240
We don't have any solid evidence.

230
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,080
Only Xiaorou's testimony

231
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,720
can't convict Sara.

232
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,080
And she must

233
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,280
must have destroyed

234
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,960
has been destroyed.

235
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,680
I know you want to help her.

236
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,320
But don't worry.

237
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,400
There will be a way.

238
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,440
I don't want

239
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,320
happen to Pei.

240
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,440
happened to Xiao Rou again.

241
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,920
In this way,

242
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,680
I can never forgive myself.

243
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,640
I just need one word from you.

244
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,960
I'll kill Sara for you.

245
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,080
It's clean.

246
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,920
It's all over.

247
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,000
Hello?

248
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,760
Sara.

249
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,720
Xiaotang.

250
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,240
I know Xiaorou is sick.

251
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,360
and skipped class alone.

252
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,480
to visit Xiaorou.

253
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,280
What did you do to my daughter?

254
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't worry.

255
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,560
Didn't Xiaorou get lost yesterday?

256
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,840
She hasn't come back yet.

257
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,680
What should we do?

258
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,480
Xiao Tang came all the way to see her best friend.

259
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,680
but her best friend isn't home.

260
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,840
If the person who took Xiao Rou away

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
would send her back,

262
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,520
to send her back.

263
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,280
Otherwise, Xiaotang

264
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,840
will cry very sadly.

265
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,080
Sara.

266
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,560
The first mistake you made

267
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,600
you shouldn't have hurt my daughter.

268
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,600
You stole my daughter first.

269
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,280
This is...

270
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,840
He Luning used this trick for you?

271
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,440
Sara.

272
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,960
The second mistake you made

273
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,680
you shouldn't have listened to He Luning.

274
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,440
If she's with you now,

275
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,200
turn on the speaker and let her answer the phone.

276
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,800
Sure.

277
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,600
He Luning.

278
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,800
Stop dreaming.

279
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,840
I won't go back to Black Rock with you.

280
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,840
Cut the crap.

281
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,440
Within an hour,

282
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,920
in an hour.

283
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,760
Otherwise,

284
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,240
I'll drain

285
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,320
your daughter's blood.

286
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,720
Bai Haoqing.

287
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,800
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.

288
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:30,880
Chengdu song is Swan Lake Resort.
