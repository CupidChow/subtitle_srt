1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,640
I'm sure he'll be at school. I'm sure he'll be at school. Okay.

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,960
will stay at school

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,200
at school.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Stop pretending.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,920
You're here to make trouble.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,000
I didn't say

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,280
Really?

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,840
Sure.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,440
Since they can complete the mission,

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,320
we're useless.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,520
Why don't you untie the necklace

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,520
Let us go.

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,400
Cai Yun.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,720
Have you forgotten

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,560
Have you forgotten?

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,200
My request

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,120
is to complete the mission as soon as possible.

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,920
I don't care

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,480
I don't care.

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,840
If Ning and Ko Rang

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,280
finish the mission before you,

22
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,560
The necklace will explode.

23
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,480
It's not Jason.

24
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,000
Are you playing with us?

25
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,440
It's fun.

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,320
How interesting.

27
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,480
Funny my ass.

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,400
Jason.

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,360
Don't go too far.

30
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,880
Don't you play stocks?

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,160
You should know that.

32
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,400
This is called a risk collision.

33
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,120
Any objections?

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,039
No.

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,000
Cheer up, Chae-yun.

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,800
From now on,

37
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,240
we can go back to Black Rock.

38
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,640
Blue sky

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,160
White clouds

40
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,640
Carrying my bag

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,520
Flowers bloom

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,920
Birds are barking

43
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,520
Grandpa Sun smiles

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
Brush your teeth diligently.

45
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,720
Take a shower frequently.

46
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,280
I'm a good baby.

47
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,920
Love Mommy.

48
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,320
I love you.

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,800
I want to grow taller quickly.

50
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,240
Hurry.

51
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:07,800
Go forward.

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,079
Ning, don't be afraid.

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,600
I'll always be with you.

54
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,120
What's wrong?

55
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,600
Nothing.

56
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,400
I was thinking about the past.

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,720
Oh.

58
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,640
It's all in the past.

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,240
Don't think too much.

60
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,520
You make it sound so simple.

61
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,440
Humans are not machines.

62
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,280
You can press the delete button.

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
Then drink.

64
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,480
What about alcohol?

65
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,480
is the delete button of life.

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,240
Don't lie to yourself.

67
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm sober.

68
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,200
I have to face it.

69
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,760
Even if you have to forget that moment,

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,720
That's good.

71
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,560
Nam Chae-yun.

72
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,440
Cheers!

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,120
Happy birthday to you

74
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,760
Thank you.

75
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,920
Thank you for coming to celebrate Anki's birthday

76
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
Kids, come and cut the cake!

77
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,400
Honey.

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,200
Take this opportunity to send a gift.

79
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,040
Get closer.

80
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,360
Go.

81
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,880
Here.

82
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,680
Amanda

83
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,440
Happy birthday to Babymonster An.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,320
Happy birthday.

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,480
Young man,

86
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,320
You're not moral.

87
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,520
He even imitates me when buying gifts and choosing brands.

88
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,720
Most importantly,

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,320
more than us.

90
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,840
Xiao Tang.

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,159
Xiaotang.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,960
What took you so long?

93
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,280
Come and eat the cake.

94
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,280
Why are you here?

95
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,960
I didn't invite you.

96
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,360
Your mom asked us to come.

97
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,000
Mom.

98
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,320
Why is she here?

99
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,080
I didn't invite her to my birthday party.

100
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,240
Leave.

101
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,360
I don't welcome you.

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,120
Pei.

103
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,800
Pei.

104
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,400
Let's take a look.

105
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,080
Let's go find them.

106
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,840
Stop!

107
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,560
Pei's mom.

108
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,840
Wait.

109
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,760
I...

110
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,080
I'll be frank with you.

111
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,440
What's wrong?

112
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,800
Two little princesses.

113
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,360
Why are you suddenly unhappy?

114
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,320
What happened?

115
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,920
Tell Guard Yan.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,400
OK?

117
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,560
Many things are not that simple, you know?

118
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
You don't want a million, do you?

119
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,000
Come on.

120
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,280
Let's have a drink.

121
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,880
Pei.

122
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go back.

123
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,280
Pei's mom.

124
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,600
Did anything happen just now?

125
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,680
Xiaotang's mom.

126
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,000
We'll go back first.

127
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,960
Have fun.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,600
Cheers.

129
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,560
Mom.

130
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,760
Pei has left.

131
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,800
I don't want to eat cake anymore.

132
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,280
I want to go home too.

133
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,159
Xiaotang.

134
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,280
Do you know why Peppi left as soon as she came?

135
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,920
She said she doesn't like her.

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,640
I didn't invite her to celebrate her birthday.

137
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,280
Anki's mom asked them to come

138
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,560
to tell her mom something.

139
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,120
Since Xiaotang doesn't want to play anymore,

140
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,200
let's go home first.

141
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,800
Okay?

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,320
Yes.

143
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,080
Pei is my best friend.

144
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,680
I just want to play with Pei.

145
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,440
I don't want cake.

146
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,240
Dad!

147
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,960
Mom.

148
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Let's go home.

149
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,640
Let's tell her before we go.

150
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
But there are so many people who want to join the board meeting.

151
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,760
I don't think we can make it today.

152
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,640
Let's meet Amanda alone next time.

153
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,360
No.

154
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,480
We failed.

155
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,040
or let them suffer.

156
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,200
Honey.

157
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,400
Watch my performance.

158
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,480
Mr. Hao.

159
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,960
There are so many kids today.

160
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,720
How about

161
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,080
let's play Eagle and Chicken,

162
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,880
Okay?

163
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,200
Okay.

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,640
Get ready.

165
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,920
Do you want to play?

166
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,640
Mr. Hao.

167
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,159
Come on.

168
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,360
Come on.

169
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,000
Let go.

170
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,480
I have something important to do.

171
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,880
Why the long face?

172
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,160
Hey.

173
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,640
Let me tell you

174
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,320
a secret.

175
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,120
Last night,

176
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,640
He Luning.

177
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,120
She came to see me.

178
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,640
Why did she come to you?

179
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,240
Why is she looking for me?

180
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,400
It's just a matter between men and women.

181
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,960
You're still young.

182
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,200
It's understandable that you don't know about adults.

183
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,560
You don't know.

184
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,440
She took the initiative so suddenly.

185
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,920
I respect you for being a man.

186
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,760
What's wrong?

187
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,240
Ho-ho's dad hit me.

188
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,600
Ko Rang.

189
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,560
You are really my 2nd Senior Brother.

190
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
Stop it!

191
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,240
It's okay.

192
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,680
Ronghao's dad hit me.

193
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,880
Stop fighting!

194
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,200
I'll break you.

195
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,240
Enough.

196
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,000
Ko Rang.

197
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,200
What are you doing?

198
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,840
Today is my daughter's birthday.

199
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,200
You hit her in front of her.

200
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,360
That's too much.

201
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,360
Get out!

202
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,000
Amanda.

203
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,600
Let me explain.

204
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,040
Security!

205
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,159
Take him out.

206
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,040
It's okay.

207
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,720
It's okay.

208
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,520
Don't cry.

209
00:07:59,560 --> 00:07:59,880
It's okay.

210
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,200
There are plenty of cakes, baby.

211
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,200
How is it?

212
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:02,960
Honey.

213
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,040
He's good.

214
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,240
Dad.

215
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,640
Does your face still hurt?

216
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,480
I'm fine.

217
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,080
It's nothing for me.

218
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,840
If your face doesn't hurt anymore,

219
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,040
can you give me the popsicle?

220
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,960
Tangtang.

221
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,640
Do you want to care about me

222
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,680
or ice cream?

223
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,520
You care about your dad.

224
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,000
I want to

225
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,240
Have some ice cream.

226
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,480
Little glutton.

227
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,320
You can only eat half.

228
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,960
I have a stomachache.

229
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:33,799
Honey.

230
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,880
After what happened today,

231
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,159
I'm sure

232
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,159
I'm sure it won't work.

233
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,720
It's probably us

234
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,799
is us.

235
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,039
I don't think so.

236
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,280
Armanda won't agree so easily.

237
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,480
Unless...

238
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,800
we give her a big gift.

239
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,760
Oh.

240
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,880
What should I give him?

241
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,840
Armanda is so rich.

242
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,920
She doesn't care

243
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,080
anything related to money.

244
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,040
I checked.

245
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,760
She used to be a professional pianist.

246
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,600
She never performed ever since she got married.

247
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
I happen to have a good gift

248
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,320
for her.

249
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,920
Xiaotang's mom.

250
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,680
What a coincidence.

251
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,840
You're here for afternoon tea too?

252
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,160
Actually,

253
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,480
I'm here for you.

254
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,880
I'll cut to the chase.

255
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,320
I have a video.

256
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,680
I think

257
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,680
you would be very interested.

258
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,320
What do you mean?

259
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
So nervous.

260
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,280
Her reaction contains a lot of information.

261
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,840
Don't get me wrong.

262
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,480
Let's watch the video first.

263
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,640
It took me a long time to find it.

264
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,720
This is me.

265
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,000
Where did you find it?

266
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,240
I found it from the school history library.

267
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,080
I heard that 20 years ago,

268
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,880
you also studied in Mantai International Elementary School.

269
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,760
Back then,

270
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,680
you were chosen

271
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,480
because you played this song

272
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
and became the chief.

273
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,560
Yes.

274
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,960
The highlight of life.

275
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,000
Because of this performance,

276
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,760
I have the chance

277
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,960
to Vienna.

278
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,720
Then I became a pianist

279
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,760
This video is so precious.

280
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,280
Hurry up.

281
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,240
Send it to me.

282
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,720
I'll show my daughter

283
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,880
how excellent her mom was.

284
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,600
Anki was excellent too.

285
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,400
Like mother, like daughter.

286
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,600
I heard

287
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,640
she's joining

288
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,440
the Vienna Children Band selection.

289
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,480
Tomorrow

290
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,400
The director of the band will come to school

291
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,360
Lead vocalist

292
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,800
must be Angie.

293
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,840
This is...

294
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,200
It's time to go through the plot.

295
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,520
Speaking of which,

296
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,600
I need your help.

297
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,280
I know.

298
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,960
you did all this

299
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,440
to join the board meeting.

300
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,640
But in our industry,

301
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,360
is about interests exchange.

302
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:14,880
How about this?

303
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,720
help me accomplish one thing.

304
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,840
I promise I'll drag you into the circle.

305
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,760
Then...

306
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,280
If I get into the circle,

307
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,760
if you enter the circle?

308
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,600
You mean Mrs. Gu?

309
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,080
Those who want to join the board

310
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,960
just to get along with Mrs. Gu.

311
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,480
It's not easy

312
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,840
is not easy.

313
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,800
But

314
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
as long as you help me with this,

315
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,920
I’ll introduce Mrs. Gu to you.

316
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,600
What do you want me to do?

317
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,640
Make sure it's flawless.

318
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,160
Don't leave any evidence.

319
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,600
Mom.

320
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,680
PePei is going to the singing contest tomorrow.

321
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,960
Really?

322
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,120
It's not a competition.

323
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,680
It's the band selection.

324
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,400
Mom.

325
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,760
If Peppi is chosen,

326
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,040
I have to go to school far away from the band.

327
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,640
There's a scholarship too.

328
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,760
Wow.

329
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,880
What's that place called?

330
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,720
I forgot.

331
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,760
Vienna

332
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
Pei is amazing.

333
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,120
In Anki's class,

334
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,040
a little girl named Pei

335
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,560
will participate in the band selection tomorrow.

336
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,160
To be honest

337
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,760
Babymonster's voice is not as good as hers.

338
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,240
So as long as she's here,

339
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,000
as long as she's here,

340
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,680
to be the lead vocalist.

341
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,480
Tonight

342
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,600
let Pei eat this.

343
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,760
It won't kill anyone.

344
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,800
will make her throat stop singing.

345
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,840
This medicine

346
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,120
won't work immediately.

347
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,520
So I have to feed her tonight.

348
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,120
Think carefully.

349
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
If you help me,

350
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,760
I'll help you.

351
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,920
to Mrs. Gu.

352
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,520
Pei.

353
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,560
Why didn't anyone pick you up today?

354
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,000
My mom is still cleaning at school.

355
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,680
She told me to go home first.

356
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,840
Do you want to come to my house today?

357
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,240
I'll tell your mom.

358
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,840
I'll send it back after dinner.

359
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,320
Mom.

360
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,440
Really? Really?

361
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,080
All right!

362
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,160
All right!

363
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,120
Thank you.

364
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,200
Mom.

365
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,160
We're having fried chicken tonight.

366
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,760
Hamburger

367
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,520
Wow!

368
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,560
Bai Haoqing.

369
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,640
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
