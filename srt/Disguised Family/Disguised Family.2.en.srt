1
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,880
It's your brother.

2
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,120
What happened?

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,520
(Did you find Nam Chae-yun?)

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,800
Stop it.

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,280
I found Nam Chae-yun.

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,160
Meet me as soon as possible.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,840
Go get Nam Chae-yun.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,080
Did you get the ransom?

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
I don't need it.

10
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,240
Nam Chae-yun.

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm here.

12
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,400
Mom.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,640
Where are we going?

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,000
Mommy will take you on a trip.

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,480
Aren't you going?

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,200
I'm busy.

17
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,600
I'm late again.

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,120
Xiaotang.

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,000
Wait for me here.

20
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,800
I have something to do.

21
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,720
Give me two new passports.

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,520
Two tickets to leave the shore tonight.

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,840
Now!

24
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,680
Which country do you want this time?

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,440
Dominica.

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,600
Okay.

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,360
You can use the magnetic.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,200
The third drawer.

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
Hei Shi came to me.

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,000
They

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,760
more than you.

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,360
Chae-yun.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,440
Wake up.

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,440
Wake up!

35
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,040
Ning.

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Long time no see.

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,079
Surprised?

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,040
We sisters reunited in this way.

39
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,120
Surprise?

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,560
Yes.

41
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,360
I'll give you a surprise too.

42
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,280
[Laughing]

43
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,720
Eat your lollipop.

44
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,240
I'll do it myself.

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,720
Ning.

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I told you

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,760
it's not safe to tie a grenade to your waist.

48
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,720
I won't listen.

49
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,880
That's you.

50
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,040
Chae-yun.

51
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,240
Let's go.

52
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,120
Xiao Tang.

53
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,640
We...

54
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,600
Where is my daughter?

55
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,600
Don't worry.

56
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,000
I've sent her back to school.

57
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,159
Do you know how sad I was

58
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,240
when you suddenly disappeared?

59
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,200
You're the best agent of Hei Shi.

60
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,600
I can't live without you.

61
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,840
I told you.

62
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,280
I won't do anything to an innocent person.

63
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,160
or touch the child.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
You broke the rules first.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
You made Hei Shi like this.

66
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,840
There's no innocent person in this world.

67
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,920
We're just in different positions.

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
As for children,

69
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,560
do kids have to be kind?

70
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,680
They just haven't grown up yet.

71
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,440
Since they didn't kill you,

72
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,880
I have a mission for you.

73
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,040
Aren't you afraid that I'll run away again?

74
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,440
Do you remember

75
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,400
what the first lesson of Agent Hei Shi's training is?

76
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,800
Agents can't have weaknesses.

77
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,480
You want to threaten me with my daughter?

78
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,360
Don't worry.

79
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,200
I will ensure your daughter's safety.

80
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,840
Because this time,

81
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,840
will participate in the mission.

82
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,640
Jason.

83
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,800
Please let me go.

84
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,920
Do you like the necklace?

85
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,640
I told you.

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,440
no one can escape from Black Rock without my permission.

87
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,720
It'll explode if you pull off the necklace.

88
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,240
So don't even think about taking it off.

89
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,240
You'd better blow me up now.

90
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,440
You're not afraid of death.

91
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,440
But your daughter...

92
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
Think about it.

93
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,200
When I asked Young-joon to take you here to settle down,

94
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,840
and sent your daughter

95
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,760
to Mantai International Elementary School.

96
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,880
This is all for you.

97
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,320
for your next mission.

98
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,360
I won't do anything for Hei Shi.

99
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm not asking you to kill people this time.

100
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,120
I'm asking you

101
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,600
to get close to someone who cares about Confucianism.

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,040
This scholar is well-hidden.

103
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,800
His security is so tight

104
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,920
that no one has seen him.

105
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,720
So,

106
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,280
I don't have any information about him.

107
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,600
The only way to approach a scholar

108
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,160
is through his wife,

109
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,880
and his son.

110
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,920
Gu Peng Peng.

111
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,160
That's right.

112
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,960
The young master of the Gu family

113
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,840
in your daughter's class.

114
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,720
So,

115
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,200
A year ago,

116
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,960
when Young-joon approached me,

117
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,440
you've been setting this up.

118
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,680
I hate Hei Shi.

119
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,680
I just want to leave Hei Shi.

120
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
As long as you complete the mission,

121
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll take your necklace

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,960
and give you freedom.

123
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,480
Including your daughter.

124
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,960
and the Confucianism.

125
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,480
Who is he?

126
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,440
Shirogui.

127
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,960
The ring from the security company.

128
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,960
That's right.

129
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,800
I suspect

130
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,520
someone leaked the organization secret of Hei Shi.

131
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,880
And Gu Nian Con

132
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,280
is the founder of White Water Security.

133
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,280
I asked you to get the list of senior staff

134
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,080
and the key to the core system.

135
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,800
Yan Young-joon, you can continue to be your husband.

136
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,560
You have to continue to play this loving couple.

137
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Yan Young-joon is dead.

138
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
You're underestimating him.

139
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,040
I know.

140
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,760
you don't trust him now.

141
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,400
But let me remind you.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,760
this mission

143
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,559
this task alone.

144
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,400
Mom.

145
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,760
Mom.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,640
Mom.

147
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,320
Sugar.

148
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,919
Are you okay?

149
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,360
Mom.

150
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,520
Why did you leave me alone in the car?

151
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
I don't care.

152
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,400
A lady who knows you

153
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,840
sent me back to school.

154
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,720
Xiao Tang.

155
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,280
Who put it on you?

156
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,400
The lady at the door gave it to me.

157
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,640
Hello.

158
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,320
Kid.

159
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,600
Hello, uncle.

160
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Good boy.

161
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,480
This necklace is so pretty.

162
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,840
Don't take it off.

163
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,440
Mom.

164
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,200
Where's Dad?

165
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,720
Dad.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,680
Dad!

167
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,440
Xiaotang.

168
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,680
Go to the study downstairs and do your homework.

169
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,960
I'll call Dad.

170
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,640
Okay.

171
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,200
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
