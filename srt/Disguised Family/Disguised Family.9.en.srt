1
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,680
Next,

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,640
I will perform

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,800
with my daughter Anju.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,840
Beethoven.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,000
Moonlight Music.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,480
Hope you like it.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,680
Amanda.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,159
Long time no see.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
I have a little gift for you.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,640
It's in your piano.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,560
Do you want to look for it?

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,640
Mom.

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,600
What's going on?

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,720
Who are you?

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,840
I quit.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,200
Don't panic.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,040
It doesn't matter who I am.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,840
But I advise you not to stop the show.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,720
or the bomb will explode.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,320
Are you

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,160
take the risk

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,400
with your daughter's life.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,960
Mom.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,840
So you can only listen to me now.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,039
Sit down.

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,320
What do you want?

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,600
I don't want to do anything.

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,880
I just want to see you play the piano.

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,759
But let me tell you,

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,920
as long as you play one wrong note,

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,120
I'll deduct one minute.

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,280
As long as you play it right,

33
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
I'll let you go.

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,920
How much do you want?

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,960
I'll give it to you.

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,320
Save your money.

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,880
You can't buy

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,840
You can't buy it with money.

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,520
Hurry up and play.

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Pianist.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,080
Time waits for no one.

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,920
If you don't play,

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,320
I'll speed up.

44
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,440
Don't speed up.

45
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,360
I'll play it right away.

46
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,760
Amanda.

47
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,480
I've always wanted to ask you a question.

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
When you did those bad things,

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,079
Have you thought about karma?

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,079
Have you ever thought about

51
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,960
will pay you back?

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,120
Ah.

53
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,840
The pitch is wrong.

54
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,200
Points deducted.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
Have you ever thought that

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
will be ruined

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,960
in the future.

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,560
Mr Peng.

59
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,520
Where is my homework book?

60
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,800
In that drawer.

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,360
What family?

62
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,200
Why must you compete with Amanda?

63
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,400
Amanda.

64
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,200
You and your daughter

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,480
were taken by others.

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,200
Every step you take today

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,160
you're stepping on others' blood and life.

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,079
If everyone

69
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,880
knows about this,

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,240
What do you think will happen?

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,720
There's a bomb.

72
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,240
Madam!

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,080
Are you okay?

74
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,960
Madam.

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,160
This is just a toy.

76
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,120
It's not dangerous.

77
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,279
I was tricked.

78
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,840
I was fooled.

79
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,400
Madam.

80
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,000
Are you okay?

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
What do you mean?

82
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,760
I was threatened

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,400
and made such a fool of myself.

84
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
What are you doing?

85
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,159
Who did this?

86
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,560
Slow down.

87
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,760
Madam.

88
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,280
There's a letter for you.

89
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,920
You may leave.

90
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,720
Mom

91
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,680
Angel

92
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,640
Mom

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,720
Mom

94
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,280
Angel

95
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,680
Mom

96
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,640
Angel

97
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,120
Mom

98
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,480
Mom.

99
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,760
Mom.

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,840
Mom.

101
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,640
What's wrong?

102
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,720
Mom.

103
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,320
What's wrong?

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,840
What are you doing?

105
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,120
Ah!

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,760
Madam.

107
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,840
We want to celebrate

108
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
your performance with Miss.

109
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,240
You're all fired.

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,600
Get out!

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,960
Get out!

112
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,080
Let me put it on you.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,800
I hurt my hand.

114
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,880
Don't catch a cold.

115
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,080
No.

116
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,040
I'm not cold.

117
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,280
I just saw her suffer.

118
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
I'm excited.

119
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,480
Let me help you.

120
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,760
No, I can do it myself.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,840
Twenty years ago,

122
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,520
After that incident,

123
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,920
I hated music.

124
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,720
I hope she can live like me.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,960
I can no longer feel the beauty of music.

126
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,320
So...

127
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,120
So the gift I gave her

128
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,480
is not a bomb.

129
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,600
It's fear.

130
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,080
I want her to spend the rest of her life

131
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,040
in fear.

132
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,000
This is Good Night Friends.

133
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,200
What song would you like to order?

134
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,120
Hello.

135
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,200
I want to order a song

136
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,880
for my old friend.

137
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Beethoven's

138
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,520
Moonlight Music.

139
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,280
Good luck.

140
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Stop ringing.

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Stop ringing.

142
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,800
Stop ringing.

143
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,800
Stop ringing.

144
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,000
Stop ringing.

145
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,600
Stop ringing.

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,880
Chae-yun.

147
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,360
I think it's enough.

148
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
The only thing I'm worried about now is Pei.

149
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,640
she's just a child.

150
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,680
I haven't decided

151
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,000
if I should tell her this.

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,320
Maybe forgetting hatred

153
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,680
to truly be free.

154
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,640
and start

155
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,800
a new life.

156
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,880
But Pei has the right to know the truth.

157
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,680
You're right.

158
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,800
I'll leave

159
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,960
to the child.

160
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,880
Leave the future

161
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,640
the future.

162
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's go.

163
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,960
I'll take you home.

164
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,320
Sure.

165
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,080
It's finally quiet.

166
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,880
Bai Haoqing.

167
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,960
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
