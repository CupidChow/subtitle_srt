1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,640
I'm in charge of water security.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,280
Consider Confucianism.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,080
This is an emergency announcement.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,680
Important information of Baekshui Security was stolen.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,520
including your personal information.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,120
Your situation is very dangerous.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,560
You may be exposed anytime.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,880
Please stop your work now.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,280
Find a safe zone.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,360
Try your best to protect yourself.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,600
Water Security.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,640
Good luck.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,840
From now on,

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,480
there's no white water

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,320
There's no water.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,440
I finally avenged my revenge four years ago.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,160
Cai Yun.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,640
It's all thanks to you.

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,720
You and Ah Ning

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
in the future.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,880
Chae-yun.

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,480
I think we're back to the old days.

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,240
Nothing seems to have changed.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,000
Water security information was leaked.

25
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,039
and was severely injured.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,600
Hei Shi

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,440
will be the best choice

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,280
in the future.

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,640
Okay.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,880
Then

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,039
trust you one more time.

32
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,320
Chae-yun.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,280
What are you looking for?

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,000
Do I need to report to you?

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
You still want to leave?

36
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,160
I never thought of staying.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,640
We agreed

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,360
we won't part.

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Can you stop me?

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,040
Let's try.

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,000
Ning.

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't want to hurt you.

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,840
You hurt me the most.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,240
You stole Jason's control.

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,400
Then we can be together forever.

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,560
This is fake.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,400
Bosses,

48
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,640
Wish us a smooth cooperation.

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,200
Bosses,

50
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm just concerned about Confucianism.

51
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,120
I heard

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,040
someone sent a message about White Water.

53
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,240
This is a huge misunderstanding.

54
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
The leaked list

55
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,560
is just a list of traitors who betrayed Shirogui.

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,480
What's going on?

57
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,040
Who are you going to steal Black Rock's information to?

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,000
Ning.

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,520
Come with me.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,840
Leave Hei Shi together.

61
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,320
I can't leave Hei Shi.

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,160
Hei Shi is my home.

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
You're also my family.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,920
I don't understand.

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,360
why I have to leave Hei Shi.

66
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,800
Why can't you stay here?

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,040
Because Hei Shi is killing people.

68
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,800
and doing evil.

69
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,760
Ning.

70
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,960
Where's your family?

71
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Where is your home?

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,800
The question I asked eight years ago.

73
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,080
I'll ask you again.

74
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,240
Will you come with me?

75
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,880
Do you really regard me as your family?

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,240
Of course.

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,760
You're my family.

78
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,840
You used Jason's computer.

79
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,920
When the alarm rings,

80
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,040
the door will close.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,080
Before they come,

82
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,920
leave now.

83
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,080
Let's go together.

84
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm not leaving.

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,560
I'm different from you.

86
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
I can't live a normal life anymore.

87
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,240
JHC BL ACK STONE

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,720
Black SpONE

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,760
But this is my choice.

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
It wasn't eight years ago.

91
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,760
Let's go.

92
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,000
Ning!

93
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,000
Get her!

94
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,680
Go!

95
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,240
It's okay.

96
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,200
It's okay.

97
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,800
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm late.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,440
Let's go.

100
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,600
Hello?

101
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,200
You're a scholar.

102
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,680
I got what you wanted.

103
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,640
I'll wait for you at the place we promised.

104
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,120
Kevin, when did you become

105
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,360
become so shameless?

106
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,240
If you want to live, be shameless.

107
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,800
Eight years ago, I wanted to leave Hei Shi

108
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
And Jason was wearing the necklace.

109
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,520
So I tried my best to find the key.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,280
I can open it for you.

111
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,960
your husband and your daughter.

112
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,560
As long as you help me find the list of Black Rock,

113
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
If you're willing to help me, nod.

114
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,440
You must live.

115
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,520
Stop pretending.

116
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
She's gone.

117
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Lena.

118
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,800
Good job.

119
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,880
Come back to save Xiaotang.

120
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,000
Take her back to Singapore.

121
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,680
so that we can let go of our hands and feet

122
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,080
to deal with Jason.

123
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,560
Promise me.

124
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,400
Take care of Chae-yun.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wait for our good news.

126
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,000
Hurry!

127
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,800
Catch up!

128
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,840
Be alert.

129
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:08,760
Chuncheon G 8R582.

130
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,840
Stop.

131
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,160
Get ready.

132
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,840
Jason.

133
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,039
I knew it was you.

134
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,000
You lured me here to see the Confucian.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,880
What do you want?

136
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,600
Kevin is a scholar.

137
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,400
He took the key to the necklace.

138
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,720
If you bring it back,

139
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,680
I'll return the information on Hei Shi to you.

140
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,480
Nam Chae-yun.

141
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,640
Hello?

142
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,360
Kevin.

143
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,120
I have a huge grudge against Jason.

144
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,040
He will definitely hunt me down.

145
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,200
You take care of Jason.

146
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,280
I'll give you the information.

147
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,120
Nam Chae-yun.

148
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,600
How cunning.

149
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,520
You taught me well.

150
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,120
Kevin.

151
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,320
Didn’t you plan to

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,880
to kill me

153
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,920
you'll kill me?

154
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,760
Action.

155
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,400
Yes.

156
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,840
Let's go.

157
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,080
Give it to them.

158
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,720
The key.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,040
I also found it for you.

160
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,240
Now,

161
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,560
Can you give me

162
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,920
Can I have it now?

163
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,040
I look forward to working with you.

164
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,880
I know you and my husband

165
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,120
with my husband.

166
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,520
He can't hide it from me.

167
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Are you here to catch the adulterer?

168
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,640
No.

169
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
I'm here to win you over.

170
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,920
Eight years ago,

171
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,760
My father was in charge of the water.

172
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,080
Back then, Shirogui only worked as security.

173
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,480
The business was not big,

174
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,480
but very stable.

175
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,600
Later,

176
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,200
I brought the seriously injured Mr. Koo home.

177
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
and saved his life.

178
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,760
My father knew he was with Hei Shi.

179
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,360
I wanted to kick him out,

180
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,280
But he proposed

181
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,400
to help Shirogane

182
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,320
and surpass Black Rock.

183
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,640
My father believed him.

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,640
and

185
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,000
to be his trusted subordinate.

186
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,960
Then,

187
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,440
married me to him.

188
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,160
Since then,

189
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,920
the way of Confucianism

190
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,760
to manage the water.

191
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,880
Water.

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,520
From doing security work,

193
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,960
to anything.

194
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,280
Make it bigger and bigger.

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,920
But at the same time,

196
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,360
it also caught Black Rock's attention.

197
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,000
Four years ago,

198
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,560
Hei Shi planned a car accident.

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,600
took me

200
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,160
and my father.

201
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,320
My dad

202
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,280
died in Black Rock.

203
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,560
I was saved

204
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,480
and saved me.

205
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,600
Honey.

206
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,280
But later,

207
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,240
I found out

208
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,880
the accident

209
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,240
Someone leaked the whereabouts

210
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,240
because someone leaked his whereabouts.

211
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,000
is the younger brother who cares about Confucianism.

212
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,560
He became the boss

213
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,360
and became the boss of water.

214
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,080
So...

215
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,160
If you want revenge,

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,880
I want to take back what belongs to me.

217
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,480
Let the water

218
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,400
back to my childhood.

219
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,520
I've made up my mind.

220
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,080
But I...

221
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,400
need your cooperation.

222
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,280
I have a key

223
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,240
to unlock the necklace on my neck.

224
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,880
If you help me get the key,

225
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,800
I'll help you.

226
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,920
Deal.

227
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,640
What are you going to do next?

228
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,200
The law will judge them for me.

229
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,480
My name is Nam Sugar.

230
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,640
I'm seven years old.

231
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,960
My parents opened a flower shop.

232
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,320
He's handsome.

233
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,000
I told you.

234
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
the flowers should be placed in color.

235
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,040
Actually I think

236
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
splitting is also pretty.

237
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,320
Honey.

238
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,840
We run a flower shop.

239
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,800
If there are many colors,

240
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,080
to look romantic.

241
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,240
It's not a display of arms.

242
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,960
I'll count to three.

243
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
So beautiful.

244
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,040
What about the future?

245
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,840
I'll do as you say on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

246
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,560
What about 246?

247
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,880
Just do as I say.

248
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,600
This weekend,

249
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,760
we'll take our baby

250
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,400
with our baby.

251
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:40,920
Okay?

252
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,520
Okay.

253
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,360
Except my parents,

254
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
my dearest family

255
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,280
is my aunt.

256
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,080
She used to be a teacher.

257
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,120
Now,

258
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,120
is pursuing her music dream.

259
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,120
My aunt can write songs on her computer.

260
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,360
She's amazing.

261
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,040
My aunt's daughter

262
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,600
is my best friend.

263
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,600
Rou.

264
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,480
We're sisters who don't look alike at all.

265
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,720
I have an online friend.

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,320
We're far away.

267
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,080
We can only video chat.

268
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,280
This netizen's family is very rich.

269
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,840
His mother is the biggest.

270
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,400
the biggest security company.

271
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,440
If you need a security job,

272
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,800
you can introduce them to me.

273
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,640
These are my most important people.

274
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,080
I want to be with them forever.

275
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
and be the happiest child in the world.

276
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,680
I hope you too.

277
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,680
Look at the camera.

278
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,800
Wait.

Hurry up.

Hurry up, Ms. Lena.

283
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,400

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,240
Wait.

Ready.

298
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,080
