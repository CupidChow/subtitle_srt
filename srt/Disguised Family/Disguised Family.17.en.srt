1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,400
I fainted because I was sick.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,120
No wonder it got dark

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,240
when I entered the bathroom.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:12,920
Mom.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,520
I fainted for a few days.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,520
I felt like I slept for a long time.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,000
Just one day.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,600
If I faint for a few days,

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
we'll be scared to death.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,600
Xiao Tang.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,720
Don't scare me again.

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,320
One more bite.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,280
Xiaotang.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,640
Xiaorou.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,080
Xiaotang.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,160
Are you feeling better?

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,040
I slept for a long time.

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,720
I even dreamed of you.

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,200
What did you dream about?

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
I dreamed

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,000
there was a mountain

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,960
There was a temple in the mountain.

23
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,280
An old monk is telling stories in the temple.

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,240
What is he talking about?

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,520
Once upon a time there was a mountain

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,720
There was a temple in the mountain.

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,800
An old monk is telling stories in the temple.

28
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,200
What is he talking about?

29
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,920
Once upon a time there was a mountain

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,520
There was a temple in the mountain.

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,200
An old monk is telling stories in the temple.

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,640
I don't want Xiao Rou to go back to the orphanage.

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
She has suffered so much psychological trauma.

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,960
She really needs a mother

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,680
who loves her so much to heal slowly.

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,280
Like me.

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,600
It's you.

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,600
But you have to think carefully.

39
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,080
It's not easy to be a mother.

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,520
Besides, it's not easy

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,039
to find a boyfriend.

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,720
No.

43
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,440
Who said that?

44
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,039
I'm just looking for a husband

45
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,880
with a child.

46
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,080
Don't listen to him.

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,160
Lena.

48
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,400
I believe you can do it.

49
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,080
And

50
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,800
you'll be a good mother.

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,200
I'm going to kill her.

52
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,160
This isn't the time to talk about this.

53
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,039
Let me show you something.

54
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,520
Can you be more creative?

55
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,520
Is there a lot of things in Black Rock?

56
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Yes.

57
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,080
But don't forget,

58
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,440
Black Rock's bomb necklaces are shipped.

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,080
And every year,

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,920
every year.

61
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,720
But this one...

62
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,960
Look carefully.

63
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,040
One is black rock.

64
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,640
and the other is imitated.

65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,480
Who gave you

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,160
Who gave them to you?

67
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,040
I found it at Nam Chae Hoon's house.

68
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,760
No.

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,200
I saw them wearing a necklace.

70
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,440
According to Black Rock,

71
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,880
there are identity chips in the necklace.

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,880
As long as we take the necklace back to Black Rock to read the chip,

73
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,200
we'll know

74
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,920
Who is it?

75
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,400
Maybe

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,000
we can dig into the water

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
through this line.

78
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,720
Take it back to Jason.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,520
OK.

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,360
I'll go down and have a look.

81
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,400
Let's go.

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,840
Let's go.

83
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Run, Ning!

84
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,040
Run!

85
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,800
Run!

86
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,600
Ning.

87
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,000
Ko Rang.

88
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,600
Let's go.

89
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,800
Ning.

90
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,480
Ko Rang.

91
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,320
Let's go.

92
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,159
It's Ko Rang.

93
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,320
[Ko Rang took the necklace.]

94
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,400
He didn't put a bug

95
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,960
in our house.

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
He just took the necklace.

97
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,200
Since Ko Rang took it,

98
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,920
he will tell Jason

99
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,040
With Jason's personality,

100
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
he must have started to suspect us.

101
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,600
Find someone to break the necklace.

102
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,360
Did he contact you?

103
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,640
No.

104
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,120
He didn't contact me either.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,760
Ms. Nam Chae-yun.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,600
Reporter.

107
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,960
Ms. Nam Chae-yun.

108
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,080
How did you find out

109
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,600
Sara has been

110
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,800
in the way of adopting orphans?

111
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Why did you choose to reveal Sara's crime

112
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,960
at the charity dinner

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,159
instead of calling the police?

114
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,880
Why didn't you call the police?

115
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,600
Rumor has it that you're a personal bodyguard hired by Sara's father.

116
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,360
Is that true?

117
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,440
Mr. YUN Young-joon.

118
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,440
Do you know

119
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,560
your wife is a personal bodyguard?

120
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,320
I’d like to make a public answer

121
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,840
I'll make a public answer.

122
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,000
I didn't expose

123
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,640
not out of personal grudges,

124
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,280
It's just a citizen's duty.

125
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,040
The reason why

126
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,840
at the charity dinner

127
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,280
is to use the power of public opinion

128
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,360
so Sara can't operate in secret

129
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,200
to clear her name.

130
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,840
As far as I know,

131
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,200
Sara and the Gu family

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,640
They're very close. They're very close. They're very close.

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,440
Gu House?

134
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,680
What is the relationship between Sara and the Gu family?

135
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,840
Please explain the background of the Gu family in detail.

136
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,720
What is your source of information?

137
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,720
Ms. Nam Chae-yun.

138
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,640
Can you explain the family background?

139
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,720
Ms. Nam Chae-yun.

140
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,440
Nam Chae-yun!

141
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,520
Nam Chae-yun!

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,920
Nam Chae-yun!

143
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,040
What are you doing?

144
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
You openly challenged the Gu family.

145
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,520
We finally got here.

146
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,600
After what you did,

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,560
It's all over.

148
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,640
Can you use your brain?

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,080
Do you think if I don't say that,

150
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,920
the Gu family won't notice us?

151
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,000
We sent Sala to court.

152
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,200
Sara is a family friend.

153
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,800
The Gu family will let us go.

154
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Instead of waiting for death,

155
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,120
we should take the initiative

156
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,400
and force the Gu family

157
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,480
to make a public statement.

158
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,000
Tall.

159
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,320
My wife is taller.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,200
You mean...

161
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,520
dragging the Gu family into this?

162
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,560
If they still want to protect Sala,

163
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,800
it's hard.

164
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,520
I can only draw a line with Sara.

165
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,080
Maybe

166
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,400
he'll be able to be friendly to us.

167
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,880
I hope so.

168
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,800
The Gu family

169
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,240
is mysterious and unpredictable.

170
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,320
No one knows what they will do next.

171
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,919
The news tomorrow morning

172
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,799
tomorrow morning.

173
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,240
Hello.

174
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,240
Jason.

175
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,720
Got it.

176
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,120
What?

177
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,520
Ko Rang is dead.

178
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Dead?

179
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,000
Two hours ago,

180
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,920
two hours ago.

181
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,160
So

182
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,480
our identity is exposed too?

183
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,360
Not yet.

184
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,880
Ko Rang died because of those two necklaces.

185
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,720
He almost killed He Luning.

186
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,200
So

187
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,200
Ko Rang took those two necklaces.

188
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,200
If he doesn't take them,

189
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,120
the dead

190
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,920
is...

191
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,960
Bai Haoqing.

192
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,040
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
