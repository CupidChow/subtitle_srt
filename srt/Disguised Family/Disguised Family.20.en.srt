1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,400
Happy birthday to you

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,120
Happy birthday to you

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,440
Happy birthday to you

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,040
Happy birthday to you

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,720
Happy birthday.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,320
Peng.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,400
Happy birthday.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,440
Mom.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,920
I want to play a game.

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,200
Sure, Peng.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
Today is your birthday.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,640
Anything you want.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,720
Tell mom

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,920
What game do you want to play?

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,320
I want...

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,520
How about

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,560
we play

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,720
hide-and-seek.

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,600
OK?

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,040
This is a good suggestion.

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,720
Your house is so big.

22
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,920
It must be suitable.

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,080
Yes.

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,360
It really suits you.

25
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,240
Okay.

26
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,800
Have fun.

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
I'm not feeling well.

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,760
Go back and take a rest.

29
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,760
Bai.

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,040
Stay with them.

31
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,280
Mom, bye.

32
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,000
Bye.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,560
Peng Peng.

34
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,000
Dad.

35
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,840
Who will be the ghost?

36
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,800
Who will be the ghost?

37
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,840
It must be a boy.

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,600
Right?

39
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,360
Yes.

40
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,000
But

41
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
today is your birthday.

42
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,960
What about you?

43
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,600
Do you want me to be a ghost

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,640
Or do you want me to be a ghost?

45
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,440
Or

46
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,840
want Steward Bai to be the ghost?

47
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,200
Uncle Bai.

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,160
Then you do it.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,080
Then I'll be the ghost.

50
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,039
Let me tell you the rules of the game.

51
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,680
Ten minutes later,

52
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,840
I'm looking for someone.

53
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,320
The whistle is ringing.

54
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,320
Game over.

55
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,840
Game

56
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,440
starts now.

57
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
We'll get going then.

58
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,680
Xiao Tang.

59
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,120
Peng.

60
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,160
Oh.

61
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,160
Slow down.

62
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,680
Wait, wait.

63
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,840
Wait.

64
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,600
Xiaotang.

65
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,960
When you play this game,

66
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,919
you follow Peng.

67
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,960
Got it?

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,040
Okay, Dad.

69
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,760
Peng Peng.

70
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,400
What about you?

71
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,760
a young man.

72
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,280
Can you help me

73
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,760
protect Xiao Tang?

74
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,200
I promise.

75
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,840
This is a promise between men.

76
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't tell mom and dad.

77
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,680
okay?

78
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,600
Okay.

79
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,079
My goodness.

80
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,600
Ding Dong

81
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,040
Let's go

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,079
Listen to me.

83
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,520
Don't break into the study.

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,040
Just get some information.

85
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,400
I know what to do.

86
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,640
Don't worry.

87
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,400
Go.

88
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,560
Go find your ex.

89
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,080
Why do you care?

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,760
What's going on?

91
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,880
How could Kevin get hurt

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,120
How could Kevin get hurt?

93
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
It’s my fault.

94
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,800
Kevin took the bullet for me.

95
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,320
How's his hand?

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,320
His right hand.

97
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,520
I can't use my strength anymore.

98
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,480
What a coincidence.

99
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,400
Mr. Gu,

100
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,200
I choose to hide here.

101
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,600
Would you like to have a drink with me?

102
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,760
Mr. Gu is born left-handed.

103
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,600
or your right arm?

104
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,040
I knew it.

105
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,560
This woman came to our House

106
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,120
to seduce Mr. Gu.

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I knew it.

108
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,440
Worried?

109
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,920
Testing

110
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,480
It's just an excuse.

111
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
This is a gunshot wound.

112
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,080
How?

113
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,680
For my wife.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,680
You know that.

115
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,920
The Gu family

116
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,880
has a big family.

117
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,440
Many people

118
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,360
want to kill us.

119
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,320
I see.

120
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,840
Ms. Nam.

121
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
You're so curious about me.

122
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,760
just because you think I look like

123
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,080
a male star?

124
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,440
In fact, you are like

125
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,360
very important to me.

126
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,000
He was my first love.

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,080
We loved each other.

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,200
But...

129
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,360
He's dead.

130
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,800
Oh.

131
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
What a pity.

132
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,880
It's a pity indeed.

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,840
But it's all in the past.

134
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,680
Time can wash away everything

135
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,520
including love.

136
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,600
But why do I feel

137
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,280
you haven't forgotten him.

138
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,280
If you really forget him,

139
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,920
how could you think of him when you see me?

140
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
I didn't forget.

141
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,880
but I've let it go.

142
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,880
The past

143
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,480
There's no need to worry.

144
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,480
People

145
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,120
the most important thing is

146
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
to live in the present.

147
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,480
Of course.

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,520
Mr. Gu.

149
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,240
Have a candy.

150
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,200
This is for you.

151
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,120
Pink usually

152
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,160
Yellow

153
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,200
When you get caught,

154
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,240
when you get caught.

155
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,640
Don't eat it wrong.

156
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,040
It's just a candy.

157
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,640
Okay.

158
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,280
Thank you.

159
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,200
Excuse me.

160
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,799
Mr. Gu.

161
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,720
The candy has expired.

162
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,520
I'll throw it away.

163
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,920
07

164
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,480
71.

165
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,440
The last one is...

166
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,680
Let's go.

167
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
What's going on?

168
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,000
Boss.

169
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,920
Fix it in half an hour.

170
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,800
Wait.

171
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,600
Did you see anything

172
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,760
before you fell asleep?

173
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,080
Nam Chae-yun.

174
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
I saw Nam Chae-yun drinking with Mr. Gu.

175
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,680
I knew

176
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,240
to seduce Mr. Gu.

177
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,840
How did you know I was in the surveillance room?

178
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,120
You want to leave Ms. Baek behind?

179
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,200
I knew you were going to check the CCTV.

180
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,760
930712.

181
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,200
Thinking about the password to Confucianism's room.

182
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,040
What about you?

183
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,960
How did it go?

184
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,840
Are you Kevin?

185
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,120
This box of candy

186
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,360
was given by Kevin.

187
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,800
He doesn't know the yellow candy is poisonous.

188
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,760
He's not Kevin.

189
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,760
He ate it.

190
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,440
I stopped him.

191
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,000
We haven't got the information yet.

192
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,040
If he dies,

193
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,680
both of us will be in trouble.

194
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,200
Oh.

195
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
He gave them all.

196
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,880
I kept them at home.

197
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,000
It faded

198
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,040
It's still there.

199
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,400
What's there to argue with a dead person?

200
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,320
Oh.

201
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,520
What do you know?

202
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,440
Death is scary.

203
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,560
I told you

204
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,440
I only have Xiaotang

205
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,080
with you.

206
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,560
Let's get down to business.

207
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,200
We still have half an hour to fix the CCTV.

208
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,520
Within this time,

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,360
we need to find all the information.

210
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,000
The game of hide-and-seek has just begun.

211
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,560
The action of a scholar is limited.

212
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,280
I don't think he'll come near the study.

213
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,080
This is the best time for us to move.

214
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:42,920
Let's go.

215
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,640
I'm handsome.

216
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,520
Come in.

217
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,040
Madam.

218
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,040
Aren't you a ghost?

219
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Why are you back?

220
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,880
We can catch him later.

221
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,920
I have some important news

222
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,960
to report to you.

223
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,120
It's...

224
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,440
Mr. Gu.

225
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,360
I found that

226
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,880
Nam Chae-yun might know

227
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,800
Mr. Gu.

228
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,040
Kevin is dead.

229
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,040
The one who survived

230
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,680
is thinking about Confucianism.

231
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,240
Bai Haoqing.

232
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,320
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
