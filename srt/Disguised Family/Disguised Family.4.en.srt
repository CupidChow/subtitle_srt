1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,680
Have you heard of

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,240
Black Rock?

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,880
It's a ring from the White Water Security Company.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,600
How much do you know about the water security company?

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,000
I only know that

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is similar to Black Rock.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
Its main job is security service.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,280
I know nothing else.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,480
Hei Shi?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,760
Yes.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,680
You found the right person.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,320
I have a friend

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,000
who specializes in this in Iceland.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,960
Just say that.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,560
the black stone.

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,360
Black.

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,480
It's so big and wide.

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,240
It's decorated in the furniture.

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,440
That’s awesome.

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,560
I didn’t expect Mr. Yan to know this.

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,560
Aren’t you in stock business?

22
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,400
Steward Bai.

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,800
In our business,

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,280
in our business.

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,960
I see.

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,560
Mr. Yan is really professional.

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,640
In that case,

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,360
can you tell us

29
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,600
what stocks you bought recently?

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,040
Let me follow you.

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,720
and make some money.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,800
I bought it.

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,320
Which stock?

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,039
Oh.

35
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,400
The one I bought

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,560
That one

37
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,400
What was it again?

38
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,640
Forget it.

39
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
Let me tell you.

40
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,240
006171.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,280
I’m very optimistic about this stock recently.

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,160
and bought a lot.

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,280
How much

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,520
this stock?

45
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,960
Mr. Yan, don’t you remember?

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,680
It can’t be.

47
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,400
As a professional stock analyst,

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,120
you should remember

49
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,520
the stock price clearly.

50
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,520
Sorry.

51
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,240
I'll tell you

52
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,800
Let me tell you.

53
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,160
Today's

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,240
stock price

55
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,000
231 dollars.

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,760
That's a lot different.

57
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,760
Mr. Yan.

58
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,360
Are you really a stock analyst?

59
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,360
Or...

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,040
you're lying to me?

61
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,720
Forget it.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,800
Just do it.

63
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,280
Steward Bai.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't worry.

65
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,280
I have a habit.

66
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,840
It starts at 9:30.

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,920
I mean

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,120
the price today.

69
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,720
Check your phone.

70
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,840
Oh.

71
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,680
You're back.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,720
How did it go?

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,120
Ms. Lena.

74
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,680
We're done talking.

75
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,320
I'll tell Mrs. Gu and Mr. Gu

76
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,000
to Mrs. Gu and Mr. Gu.

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,120
But...

78
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,200
Xiao Tang.

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,000
doesn't match our young master's personality,

80
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,720
we don't have to be friends anymore.

81
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,840
in case

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,600
cause unnecessary trouble again.

83
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,600
Ms. Lena.

84
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,520
Okay.

85
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,480
Thank you

86
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,600
Thank you.

87
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,720
Okay.

88
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,560
Xiao Tang's parents.

89
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,440
Goodbye.

90
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Have some coffee.

91
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,160
Thanks.

92
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,840
You're welcome.

93
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,920
Have some coffee.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,520
Coffee.

95
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,160
Episode 4

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,920
Why doesn't Gu Peng Peng like to be friends with me?

97
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,800
Does he hate me that much?

98
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,080
Xiao Tang.

99
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,600
In our life,

100
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,079
meet many people.

101
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,800
But not everyone likes us.

102
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,000
If Gu Peng Peng says he doesn't like you,

103
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,280
then forget it.

104
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
I hope you can be friends

105
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,320
and someone who likes you.

106
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Thank you, Mom.

107
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,400
Sleep.

108
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,120
Baby.

109
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,159
Come on, give me a kiss.

110
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,640
Kiss, baby.

111
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,880
Good night.

112
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,120
Xiao Tang said

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
Gu Peng Peng doesn't want to be friends with her.

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,680
Forget it then.

115
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,240
Judging from what Steward Bai said today,

116
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,040
he wants to use Gu Peng Peng to approach the Gu family.

117
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,640
It won't work.

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,960
Looks like we have to figure out a way

119
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,960
to join the elite parent board meeting that Mrs. Gu manages.

120
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
What about Mrs. Gu?

121
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,480
Although she is the Honorary Chairman,

122
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,080
but he rarely participates.

123
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,520
the management of the board.

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
[The actual manager is someone else.]

125
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,840
The other parent.

126
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,440
Amanda.

127
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,960
That piano star.

128
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,000
is handsome.

129
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,040
Go get close to her.

130
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,280
Why me?

131
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
You can try.

132
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
if you can use a handsome trick.

133
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,360
Honey.

134
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,800
Although I'm

135
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,240
very charming,

136
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,080
But

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
I'm a wife now.

138
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,320
I can't take any more handsome tasks.

139
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,760
Do you know that?

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,000
Go to sleep.

141
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,880
I've investigated everything.

142
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,880
Amanda not only likes music,

143
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,280
but also has other hobbies.

144
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,560
sports car.

145
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,040
racing,

146
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,800
she likes them all.

147
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,360
She likes it.

148
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,440
Armanda is in the garage.

149
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,360
Look at me.

150
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,800
Performance.

151
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,880
What do you think?

152
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,120
Isn't it cool?

153
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,720
Is this okay?

154
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,600
Is it too oily?

155
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,840
It's okay.

156
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,159
As long as it works.

157
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,800
Oh.

158
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,280
What a coincidence.

159
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,240
Ms. Amanda.

160
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,240
I didn't expect

161
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,560
we are in the same team.

162
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,360
You are...

163
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,200
It's me.

164
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,360
Mr. Sugar.

165
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,480
We met before.

166
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,680
At school.

167
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,480
Why are you taking a ride today?

168
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,400
Nice car.

169
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,800
It's just for fun.

170
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,040
Your car is cool too.

171
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,280
It's well modified.

172
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,080
It took some effort.

173
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,240
Oh.

174
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,200
Ms. Amanda.

175
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,800
I didn't put in a lot of effort.

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
Young-joon, keep it for me.

177
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,480
Let me see.

178
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,320
Oh.

179
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,080
The whole flow structure

180
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,520
Amanda's car engine has been modified.

181
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,040
The turbo increase can reach up to four sides.

182
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,920
or even higher.

183
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,240
I think your turbo increase

184
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,680
your turbo pressure.

185
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,480
Tsubaka!

186
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,280
Oh Ba!

187
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,720
Amazing.

188
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,760
Young-joon, you already installed it.

189
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,200
She used carbon fiber.

190
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Carbon fiber material?

191
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,320
Although it's expensive,

192
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,440
but weight loss.

193
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,960
You ran fast.

194
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,880
It's okay.

195
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,720
It's not expensive.

196
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,640
She also changed the exhaust system.

197
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,000
You also used 4-2-1 joules.

198
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,800
and demolished the three-yuan irrigation.

199
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
and the voice cooler at the back of the exhaust tube?

200
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,040
You...

201
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,200
Moto can smell it.

202
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,240
It's done

203
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,800
It’s not smell.

204
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,320
Mr. Yan.

205
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,280
It really opened my eyes.

206
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,120
I didn't expect

207
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,160
love cars so much.

208
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,560
Amanda.

209
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,240
To be honest,

210
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,440
there are

211
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,800
in my garage.

212
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,720
Do you want to

213
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,520
take a look?

214
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,600
My pleasure.

215
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,080
Success.

216
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,920
Let's follow the plan.

217
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,320
Ta-da.

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,600
Of course.

219
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,320
Ms. Amanda.

220
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
This garage

221
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,720
is just a part of my collection.

222
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,680
There's one on the second floor too.

223
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,720
I'm sorry.

224
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,400
Mr. Sugar.

225
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,800
Too modest.

226
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:32,760
LOE

227
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,320
LOE.

228
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,080
The lines are smooth.

229
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,120
The height is low.

230
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,799
The stability and curve must be very good.

231
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,600
Wow.

232
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,200
limited edition.

233
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,840
Pick any one you like.

234
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,080
Which one do you like?

235
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,840
Take it.

236
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,200
Are you crazy, handsome?

237
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,680
I borrowed all these.

238
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Don't make stupid promises.

239
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,280
That's too kind of you.

240
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,640
How can I

241
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,760
such a big favor?

242
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,160
Oh.

243
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,640
Speaking of which,

244
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,920
I do have a small thing

245
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,440
that you can help me.

246
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,640
What is it?

247
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,320
just tell me.

248
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,200
Oh.

249
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,640
Thank you.

250
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,520
Actually, my wife and I

251
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,920
want to join our parent board meeting.

252
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,120
I'm sorry.

253
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,160
It's too noisy.

254
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,840
What did you say?

255
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,400
I said I'll say it again.

256
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,160
Actually my wife and I

257
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,120
want to join.

258
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,120
It's too loud.

259
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,120
What did you say?

260
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,680
I'll speak louder.

261
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,400
My wife and I

262
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,960
want to join our parent board meeting.

263
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,400
Actually, my wife and I...

264
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,520
What are you doing?

265
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,560
Who is it?

266
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,120
Ko Rang.

267
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,960
How dare you copy me?

268
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,920
Ko Rang.

269
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,400
Good timing.

270
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,240
You said

271
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,840
you wanted to join the parent board meeting.

272
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,720
I've made up my mind.

273
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,680
Wait.

274
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,560
Ms. Amanda.

275
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,960
Why did you join the parent board meeting?

276
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,680
You're not even a parent.

277
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,480
Let me introduce.

278
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,600
Mr. Ko's child

279
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,800
just transferred to our school.

280
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,480
Ah.

281
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,280
Sister.

282
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,840
Let's talk about the parents' board meeting.

283
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,760
Last time...

284
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,160
Sister.

285
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,760
Actually...

286
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,040
Actually...

287
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,720
I know.

288
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,920
Blow it.

289
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,800
Blow it.

290
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,760
Actually, my wife and I

291
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,160
want to join the parent board meeting.

292
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm finally done.

293
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,000
You want to join the parent board meeting too?

294
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,400
This is hard.

295
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,920
There's only one spot for the parent board meeting.

296
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,960
Please wait.

297
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,320
After my daughter's birthday tomorrow,

298
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,480
after my daughter's birthday tomorrow.

299
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,240
Sister.

300
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,120
Sister.

301
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,960
There's nothing wrong with me.

302
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,640
I don't know what your dad thinks.

303
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,760
I'm fine with it

304
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,520
Let's have a battle.

305
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,200
What do you mean, Jason?

306
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,720
Don't you need an explanation?

307
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,520
Jason.

308
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,080
This is our mission.

309
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,640
What's wrong with them?

310
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,040
You two can pretend to be a family of three.

311
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,600
Me and Ko Rang.

312
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
Isn't it easy to find a kid?

313
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,320
Why are you making a fuss?

314
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,240
Hello.

315
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm the new transfer student.

316
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,000
My name is Ko Ho.

317
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,920
And my Hao Hao

318
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,800
is a good boy.

319
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,680
I'll keep an eye on Xiaotang at school.

320
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,720
Stop pretending.

321
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,400
You're here to make trouble.

322
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,520
I didn't say

323
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,600
to help you.

324
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,000
Bai Haoqing.

325
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,080
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
