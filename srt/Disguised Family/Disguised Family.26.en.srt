1
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,480
Where is he?

2
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,120
Where did he go?

3
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,760
Senior.

4
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,680
You showed up

5
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,080
to protect her?

6
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
Xiao Tang.

7
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,600
She went to the next hospital.

8
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,440
I'll go after her.

9
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,920
Keep an eye on Nam Chae-yun.

10
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,479
Copy that.

11
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,240
Nurse.

12
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,960
Help me.

13
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,440
What's wrong?

14
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,840
Mom.

15
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,120
Mom.

16
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,840
Mom.

17
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,800
Mom.

18
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,480
Why are you here?

19
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm cold, Mom.

20
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,000
Why are you here?

21
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,720
I told you to watch Nam Chae-yun.

22
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,360
Why are you...

23
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,159
Don't just focus on new equipment.

24
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,360
This kind of old equipment is the best thing to save your life.

25
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,600
If you can't pay me back by tonight,

26
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,480
don't take this.

27
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,160
I will.

28
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,520
I will.

29
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,640
Neighbor.

30
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,080
My child is sick.

31
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,960
She has a fever at home.

32
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm worried about her alone.

33
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,400
Can you take care of her for me?

34
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,000
Neighbor.

35
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,360
Please.

36
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,960
You can't escape.

37
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,440
Only the dead

38
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,159
can leave Black Rock.

39
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,200
One stroke.

40
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,720
Two fingers.

41
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,360
Here.

42
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,200
No.

43
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,480
It should be

44
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,000
Here.

45
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,400
Let's do it first.

46
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,920
You can't even find the location and you still do this dirty work?

47
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,000
My waist is here.

48
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Who are you?

49
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,360
Hey.

50
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,200
Look!

51
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,159
Someone is making trouble.

52
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,200
Just do it.

53
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,280
Your brother's men are not easy to deal with.

54
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,800
Just follow me from now on.

55
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,360
Stinky woman.

56
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,640
Do you want to die?

57
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,720
The money has been transferred to you.

58
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,440
Please find a good owner for it.

59
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,680
No problem.

60
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,240
I told you not to be so clingy.

61
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,400
You're so clingy.

62
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,200
I dare not keep you by my side.

63
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,440
Start the navigation.

64
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,360
The destination ahead.

65
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,160
ChaPan Orphanage.

66
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,920
Auntie.

67
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,520
I don't want to go to the orphanage.

68
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,360
Can you not send me there?

69
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,960
I can't take you with me.

70
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,200
Attention.

71
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,680
Turn right at the green light.

72
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,320
I won't be so clingy.

73
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,840
I'll do anything you want me to do.

74
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,240
I can be good.

75
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,360
I won't hold you back.

76
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,000
Aunt,

77
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,160
Can you give me a chance?

78
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,600
If you still hate me,

79
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,120
you can abandon me.

80
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,400
Please, not now.

81
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,840
Mom.

82
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,600
Don't leave me, Mom.

83
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,480
Don't leave me.

84
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,320
Mom.

85
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
The navigation is over.

86
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,480
Have a good life.

87
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,080
Have some candy.

88
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,080
Sister

89
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,480
Welcome

90
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,720
We have many kinds now.

91
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,120
We have everything we want.

92
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,760
I like younger puppies.

93
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,160
A top student in school.

94
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,600
I'll arrange it for you.

95
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,240
I like youngsters.

96
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,760
The uniform is tempting.

97
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,320
Arrange it for me.

98
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,240
Is it safe?

99
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,080
Yes.

100
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,480
100 safety.

101
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,000
They've all done physical checkups.

102
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,160
Boss.

103
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,040
Miss,

104
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,320
What can I do for you?

105
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,160
Which one do you like?

106
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,280
I want to pick you.

107
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,240
Me?

108
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,080
You have good taste.

109
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,760
But unfortunately,

110
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,040
I'm the dad here.

111
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,760
How about this?

112
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,720
I'll arrange the top shopkeeper for you.

113
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,200
What do you think?

114
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,440
I'll order you.

115
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,240
It's not much.

116
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,280
93,1.

117
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,360
Please come in.

118
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,800
93,1.

119
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,000
Black Rock's code.

120
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,200
You're from Heirock?

121
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,240
Get to the point.

122
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,520
My name is Yeo Young-joon.

123
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,520
Tell me.

124
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,120
What's the matter?

125
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,680
During the two years I escaped,

126
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,960
no matter where I go,

127
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,120
I'll always be found by Black Rock.

128
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,000
I suspect

129
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
I have a black rock monitor in my body.

130
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,800
Don't doubt it.

131
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,120
You should be sure.

132
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,480
you have a tracker.

133
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,760
So

134
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,040
you have a way to retrieve the GPS.

135
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
What is it?

136
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,240
Of course.

137
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,760
But it's a bit troublesome.

138
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,120
You need to pay more.

139
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,000
Money is not a problem.

140
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,040
Just do it.

141
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,200
Actually I didn't finish.

142
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,360
You can do it without taking it off.

143
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,360
Oh, right.

144
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,440
There's no metal

145
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,080
on the clothes.

146
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll go get the tools.

147
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,920
Work needs.

148
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,920
Every agents of Hei Shi

149
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,560
has been implanted.

150
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,200
Metal buckle.

151
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,680
Excuse me.

152
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,040
Go on.

153
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,440
I got hurt by accident before.

154
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,840
When the doctor was giving me surgery,

155
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,200
on my back,

156
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,200
on my back.

157
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,040
Excuse me.

158
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,880
If not,

159
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,320
in my life.

160
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,880
Everyone's parts

161
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,400
is different.

162
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,600
Don't move.

163
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,880
Right here.

164
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,680
It might hurt.

165
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,280
Hang in there.

166
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,800
No problem.

167
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,040
Let's start.

168
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,480
Don't move.

169
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,360
Check the rooms.

170
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,320
Someone reported that you have illegal deals here.

171
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,280
Really?

172
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,320
It's a misunderstanding.

173
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,560
Sir.

174
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,720
I'm your dad.

175
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,920
This place is legitimate.

176
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,840
Where's your ID?

177
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,960
Here.

178
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,680
What about yours?

179
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,720
What about your ID?

180
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,600
Sir.

181
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,040
My wife

182
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,480
She doesn't know the rules

183
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,480
doesn't know the rules.

184
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,760
What are you waiting for?

185
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,880
Are you stupid?

186
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,440
The ID is in the box.

187
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,840
The password is 07231456.

188
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,400
I forgot.

189
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,000
Turn left and turn right.

190
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,680
Hurry up.

191
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,880
Stop dawdling.

192
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,600
You're from the countryside.

193
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,840
They don't know the rules.

194
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,560
Please forgive me.

195
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,640
Come on.

196
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,680
Stop dawdling.

197
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,240
It's nothing.

198
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,760
Done.

199
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,520
Senior.

200
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,080
Black Rock's men will be here soon.

201
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,080
You have to get out of here as soon as possible.

202
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,120
Well...

203
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,720
Do you like your daughter?

204
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,320
What?

205
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
I need to take care of a kid.

206
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,920
You're good at pretending.

207
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,440
With you.

208
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,000
Child.

209
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,080
will be safer.

210
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,880
You mean

211
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,440
you want to marry me?

212
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,480
You can say that.

213
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,320
Of course.

214
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,040
It's in name.

215
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,000
That's boring.

216
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,560
I can pay more.

217
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,160
As much as you want.

218
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,720
What are you waiting for, honey?

219
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,120
Where is our precious daughter?

220
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,720
Bai Haoqing.

221
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,360
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
