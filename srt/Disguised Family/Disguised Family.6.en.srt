1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,240
I knew Armanda would make a deal with me.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,320
But I didn't expect it to be so vicious.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,160
Armanda has already hated Pei and his family.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,080
I'm afraid

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,160
even if we don't do it,

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,720
Armanda won't let Peppi off.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,480
The best thing is

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,720
is to let Pei's mother give up on it.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,960
Pei's family is poor.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,920
Entering Vienna is her only choice.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,360
Her mom won't give up.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,320
What should we do?

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,160
If we don't do as Amanda says,

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,680
we'll never be able to enter the Gu family.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,200
Honey, don't forget

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,440
we still have this on our necks.

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,080
Actually,

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,360
I prepared another medicine.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,840
This medicine can make people pretend to be silent.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,640
I plan to

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,480
let Pei

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,840
miss the selection

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,280
and transfer her to another school.

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,320
and send her abroad.

25
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,120
Look.

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,520
Like this.

27
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,920
I've contacted Julia Music Academy.

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,519
Its strength and status

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,600
and the Vienna Band.

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,640
In that case...

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,680
Pei.

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,800
she doesn't have to give up her music dream.

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,320
Awesome.

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,160
Hello Madam

35
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,760
Here's your chicken.

36
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,080
Enjoy your meal.

37
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,680
Thank you.

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Chicken is here

39
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,800
Come and eat fried chicken

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,880
Coming.

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,640
Pei, look.

42
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,440
And bear.

43
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,640
What should we do before eating fried chicken

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,240
Wash your hands first

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,720
Put the bear down.

46
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,160
Let's go, Pei.

47
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,840
I'll set up the fried chicken first.

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,080
Honey.

49
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,920
Here's the chicken.

50
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,880
Okay.

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,720
Honey.

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,200
Honey.

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,120
He Luning.

54
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,600
Are you done?

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,320
Ms. Lena.

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,840
Amanda sent you?

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,440
So what?

58
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,640
So what?

59
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,640
Pei, give it to me.

60
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,360
If Amanda asked you to come,

61
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,960
I can't give Pei to you.

62
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,160
Go back and tell Amanda

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
I'll find a way to make her the lead singer.

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,240
There's no need to ruin a child.

65
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,840
In order to cling to the rich,

66
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,160
you were willing to be Amanda's lackey.

67
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
You even poisoned a child.

68
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,120
Stop pretending to be nice.

69
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,360
How did she know?

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,120
Ask her now.

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Punish her if you can't.

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,640
Can you be a human?

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,920
How did you know

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,520
Amanda wanted to poison Peppi?

75
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,400
Who are you?

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,880
I'm nobody.

77
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm just an ordinary teacher.

78
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,400
But I will never allow

79
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,480
any of my students

80
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,200
was murdered by people like you.

81
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,680
So I advise you to hand over Pei immediately.

82
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,079
or I'll call the police.

83
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,840
Let go of this.

84
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,040
Where are you taking me?

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Answer my question.

86
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,320
I'll let you go.

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
I have nothing to say to you.

88
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,960
You said you're not Amanda's man.

89
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,160
How did you know

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,440
she asked me to drug Pei?

91
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,600
I don't understand.

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,880
Stop the car.

93
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,600
Put me down!

94
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,200
Let go!

95
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,280
Do you want to die?

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,920
Stop pretending.

97
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,320
I didn't push at all.

98
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,640
I'll count to three.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,720
I'm really dizzy.

100
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,840
I've seen crispy

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,760
I've never seen such crispy ones.

102
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,640
I'm not from the underworld.

103
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,360
Ah.

104
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,880
What are you talking about?

105
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,120
I don't understand.

106
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,000
You're an ordinary person.

107
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,920
You don't even fight.

108
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,920
Don't act tough.

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Why are you taking the steering wheel?

110
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,240
Please.

111
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,000
If I didn't grab the steering wheel,

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,320
who knows what you're doing to me?

113
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,680
And why do you have a gun?

114
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,000
Who are you?

115
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
I said I'm a killer.

116
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,560
Do you believe me?

117
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,680
Nonsense.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,040
Like a needle.

119
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,280
Okay, don't change the subject.

120
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,480
Tell me.

121
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,200
you don't work for Armanda.

122
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,040
How did you know

123
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,760
she wanted to poison Pei?

124
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,920
I hacked Armanda's tablet.

125
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,600
So that tablet

126
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,080
is my monitor now.

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,400
You're a teacher.

128
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,840
hacking her tablet?

129
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,360
This is my personal matter.

130
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,040
It has nothing to do with you.

131
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,280
It has nothing to do with me?

132
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,000
You pretended to be a delivery man

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
and watched my house with a pinhole camera.

134
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,880
He knocked me and my husband out.

135
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,520
and broke the door and trespassed.

136
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,120
How many years do you think

137
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,760
how many years do you think you can get?

138
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,280
I have nothing

139
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
about this.

140
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,040
But everything I did

141
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,600
for Pei.

142
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,200
Pei.

143
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,480
You mean

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,280
you broke the law

145
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,800
because of the sense of justice of a teacher.

146
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,000
to protect Pei Pei.

147
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,120
Half right.

148
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
Which part is wrong?

149
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,240
I did this

150
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,840
not because of the relationship between teachers and students.

151
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,400
I just don't want Pei

152
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,159
to be the second me.

153
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Our family donated the piano room to the school.

154
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,760
Who are you to use it?

155
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,159
Don't use the piano.

156
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,000
Armanda and I are alumni.

157
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,280
We were also rivals in the piano competition.

158
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,440
I beat Armanda

159
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,680
I beat Amanda.

160
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,600
I naively thought

161
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,720
I could be selected

162
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,080
with my efforts and talent.

163
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,400
But I didn't expect that

164
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,400
my head teacher

165
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,560
I accidentally

166
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
used the drawer

167
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,920
with a drawer.

168
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,000
That's why I missed the selection.

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,200
I could only watch my Amanda

170
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,000
went to Vienna

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,880
and stole my life.

172
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,040
PENG QI.

173
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,560
Armanda's parents

174
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
used money and power

175
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
with money and power.

176
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,440
Now she wants to do it again for her own benefit.

177
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
They ruined a person's life.

178
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,240
as easy as stepping on an ant.

179
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,400
Easy and easy.

180
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,320
without any guilt.

181
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,360
I have a child too.

182
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,400
I won't hurt Pei.

183
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,480
But you didn't refuse Armanda

184
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,280
you didn't reject Amanda.

185
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,400
I have my reasons.

186
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,320
But...

187
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,200
I won't poison her.

188
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,640
The selection is tomorrow.

189
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,640
What else can you do?

190
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,400
I'm going to transfer her to Julia Music School.

191
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,960
You major in music too?

192
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,640
You know the value there better than I do.

193
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,720
I won't let her give up her dream so easily.

194
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,200
Thank you.

195
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,240
Pei's mom.

196
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,880
I understand your frustration with Peppi.

197
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,679
But

198
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,960
if Pei Pei surpasses Angel in the competition today,

199
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,000
Mama Angie won't give up easily.

200
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,720
Julia is a good school.

201
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,560
I can.

202
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,600
I promise you with my profession

203
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
it's worth it.

204
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,920
Xiaotang's mom

205
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,640
with Xiaotang's mom.

206
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,360
Besides, Pei

207
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,520
is an excellent girl.

208
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,000
With her talent, she'll get into school.

209
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,560
I know Julia.

210
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,000
But that school...

211
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,280
is too expensive.

212
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,880
We can't afford it.

213
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,120
Pei's mom, don't worry.

214
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
As for the tuition fee,

215
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,480
Mr. Sugar.

216
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,040
will be fully sponsored.

217
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,520
and living expenses.

218
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,560
I'll take full responsibility.

219
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,200
How can you do that?

220
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,560
Why not?

221
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,840
Pei's mom.

222
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
We don't want to see a pearl in dust.

223
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,240
Pei is such a good potential.

224
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,000
It's a waste

225
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,280
it'll be a waste.

226
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,440
Mr. Director.

227
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,160
Anki

228
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
is the most rare

229
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,520
in Mantai.

230
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,600
the best children's voice.

231
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,080
It's basically

232
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,760
a beautiful voice.

233
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,800
You can say that.

234
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,080
Pei's mom.

235
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,040
education should be fair and just.

236
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,000
A poor family can't have a son.

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,480
shouldn't have happened to us.

238
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,200
So,

239
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,520
I really hope you can give me a chance

240
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
to do something for you.

241
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,520
Thank you.

242
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,720
Thank you, Ms. Lena.

243
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,240
You're welcome.

244
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,160
Thank Xiaotang's mom for me.

245
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,440
I understand your feelings.

246
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,880
Don't worry.

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,720
I'll explain it to Pei.

248
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,400
to hand in her withdrawal form.

249
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,120
Drawal.

250
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,960
Mr. Director,

251
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,120
I think this time

252
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,320
must be Angie.

253
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
She's really good.

254
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,960
Did you hear that?

255
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,720
The lead vocal

256
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,680
is me.

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If I sing,

258
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,000
it won't be yours.

259
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm confident I can sing better than you.

260
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,160
So what?

261
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,280
My mom said

262
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,640
people like you

263
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,560
Good job.

264
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,320
So what?

265
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,080
You still have to make way for me.

266
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
But don't worry

267
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,680
When I go to Vienna to sing,

268
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,160
I'll introduce you to clean the floor

269
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,960
What are you looking at?

270
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,480
I'm talking about you.

271
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,400
Has everyone finished?

272
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:12,920
Yes.

273
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,520
That's all for today

274
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,760
If we can’t,

275
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,760
we can only do it according to the withdrawal.

276
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,120
Well,

277
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,080
Let's call it a day.

278
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,520
Okay.

279
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,560
Okay.

280
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,240
Sorry, sir.

281
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,320
I'm late.

282
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,800
Sir, my name is Pei.

283
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,520
I'm on the list of candidates.

284
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,000
What's going on?

285
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,480
Why don't you let him sing?

286
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,760
Here's the thing.

287
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,840
Mr. Director,

288
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
Our competition is over.

289
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,960
We can't let this

290
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,160
because of this.

291
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
broke the rules of the game.

292
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,240
right?

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,640
Gentlemen,

294
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,640
Get it straight.

295
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,800
I'm the one selecting.

296
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,320
I haven't finished yet.

297
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,000
Of course we should let all the students sing.

298
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
It's a fair competition.

299
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,720
Your throat is hoarse.

300
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,520
Let's see how you make a fool of yourself.

301
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,240
Fair competition.

302
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,440
Next, let's welcome

303
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,920
Peppi to sing.

304
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
I'm going to pull the switch.

305
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,120
It's not too late to stop the show.

306
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,600
Make your decision.

307
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,960
Forget it.

308
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,440
Let her finish first.

309
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,600
There's another way for our mission.

310
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,640
But Amanda...

311
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,080
Armanda won't let her go.

312
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,520
So now,

313
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,200
only we can protect her.

314
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,080
I thought you were a smart person.

315
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,080
Sorry.

316
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,880
There are things

317
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,080
can't be done.

318
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,760
As the saying goes,

319
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,960
Kindness is evil.

320
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,920
Kindness is heartless.

321
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,440
You think you're helping them?

322
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,960
Don't get yourself into trouble.

323
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
At least I won't hurt others

324
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,480
for my own benefit.

325
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,840
You're going against me

326
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,000
Nam Chae-yun.

327
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,840
Do you know you're on the wrong side?

328
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,200
With your attitude,

329
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,440
with your attitude?

330
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,560
Let me tell you.

331
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,640
You messed with the wrong person.

332
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,160
Amanda.

333
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,160
I hope you can accept this result.

334
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,120
Don't make it hard for Peppi and his family.

335
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,160
Otherwise,

336
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,200
bad things will happen.

337
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,320
Did I hear it right?

338
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,120
Are you threatening me?

339
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,880
No.

340
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,880
It's a kind reminder.

341
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,960
Pei, you're great!

342
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,760
Sorry, mom.

343
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,120
I still sang

344
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,440
Just sing.

345
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,280
I'll protect you.

346
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,160
To Petty-san's

347
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,720
Cheers!

348
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Thank you

349
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,040
When you go to Vienna

350
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,600
call me every day.

351
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,680
When are you leaving?

352
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,120
The director said

353
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,000
the visa has been rushed.

354
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
We can leave tomorrow.

355
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,400
Pei.

356
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,800
Pei, what's wrong?

357
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,560
Pei.

358
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,080
Spit it out.

359
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,880
Sir.

360
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,240
Pei is stuck.

361
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,240
Pei.

362
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,840
Pei, spit it out.

363
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,880
Spit it out.

364
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,640
Send him to the hospital.

365
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,240
Hurry up.

366
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,560
Send him to the best hospital.

367
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,400
Pei, don't be afraid.

368
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,400
Mommy is here.

369
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,360
Come on

370
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,440
Excuse me.

371
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,280
Hurry up.

372
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,360
Excuse me.

373
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,560
Thank you.

374
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,440
Hurry.

375
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,200
Come in.

376
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,120
Hurry up.

377
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,560
Sorry.

378
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,240
You can't go in here.

379
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,240
Hey.

380
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,120
Pei's mom. Pei'ai's mom.

381
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,200
Why did you enter the operating room directly?

382
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,760
Shouldn't he be sent to the ER?

383
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,360
It's just a fishbone stuck.

384
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,560
There's no need for surgery.

385
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,520
No, Pei's mom.

386
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,080
Listen to me.

387
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,160
Pei's voice is not a normal voice.

388
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,600
That's the vocalist's voice.

389
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,400
The best doctor has to take care of it.

390
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,480
As for the money,

391
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,400
Don't worry.

392
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,359
The school will pay.

393
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,800
Take a rest here.

394
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,319
I'll send someone to pay the bill.

395
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:09,880
Oh.

396
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,079
I'm counting on you.

397
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,240
Make it clean.

398
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,400
Bai Haoqing.

399
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,480
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
