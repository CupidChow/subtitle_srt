1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,600
Oh.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,520
Just take a nap.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,520
I'll watch.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,480
I can't sleep.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,080
Coffee.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,880
Thank you.

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:37,960
What's wrong?

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,080
Young-joon.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
I've been wanting to ask you a question.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,440
Yes.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,480
Do you remember

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,720
the first time we met?

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,520
The order you received

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,680
was to kill me.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,200
But you...

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,240
didn't kill me?

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,120
Not only did you not kill me,

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,320
you accepted the proposal

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
with me.

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,000
You even treat Xiaotang as your own.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,760
Actually, you vouched with your life.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,480
Please spare my life.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,280
So,

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,600
he temporarily adjusted your task

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,600
and let you stay with me

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,840
as an undercover.

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,360
and brought me to Mantai City to settle down.

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,759
But he said

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,440
if you kill me,

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,800
he will set you free

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,440
and let you leave Black Rock.

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,440
Why did you give up freedom

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
and save me?

34
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,280
You also wanted to leave Hei Shi.

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,120
I also wanted to leave Heirock.

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,200
It means we are the same kind of people.

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,000
But...

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,440
in order to get my own freedom,

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,240
I want to take someone else's life.

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,680
I can't do that.

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,760
I can't.

42
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,400
I can't.

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,480
Thank you.

44
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,240
Actually, I have something

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,360
to ask you.

46
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,600
In this living room,

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,920
You shot me

48
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,640
without hesitation.

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,440
I just want to know

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,079
Do you really want to kill me?

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,520
No way.

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Of course I know you're wearing a bulletproof vest.

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,560
I knew you wouldn't kill me.

54
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,400
Don't shout.

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,640
Okay, I won't lie to you.

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,640
I didn't know you were wearing a bulletproof vest.

57
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,360
I really wanted to...

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,880
kill you.

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,360
Gosh.

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,560
Don't do this.

61
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
I shouldn't have told you the truth.

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,280
What are you doing?

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,200
I'll ask you one last time.

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,120
Back then...

65
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,960
Did you really want to kill me?

66
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,480
I...

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,880
You lied to me just now

68
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,760
when I was wearing a bulletproof vest,

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,320
I felt

70
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,800
How...

71
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Here.

72
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,200
You could have lied to me.

73
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,440
Even if you lied to me for the rest of your life.

74
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,360
Why did you tell me the truth?

75
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Because I don't want to lie to you anymore.

76
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,840
Have you ever thought

77
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,120
if I didn't wear a bulletproof vest that day?

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,440
Ah.

79
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,200
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,840
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Young-joon.

82
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,000
A surprise for you.

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,240
Go to hell!

84
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,920
Young-joon.

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,760
Dear media friends,

86
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,440
Good morning.

87
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,160
There were some doubts last night.

88
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,000
the orphan blood collection case

89
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,600
with the Gu family.

90
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,760
So,

91
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,440
the Gu family asked me

92
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,240
to attend today's press conference.

93
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,720
First of all,

94
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
the Gu family

95
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,400
in the form of adopting orphans

96
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,560
in the form of adopting orphans.

97
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,640
He didn't know anything.

98
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,000
nor

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,800
providing any form of cooperation and shelter.

100
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,159
What's the relationship between the Gu family and Nam Chae-yun?

101
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,520
between the Gu family and Nam Chae-yun?

102
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,800
One thing is for sure.

103
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,159
the Gu family and Nam Chae Yun

104
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,600
with Nam Chae-yun.

105
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,040
We don't know each other.

106
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,240
But the Gu family

107
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,760
admire them very much.

108
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,840
In this case,

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,840
in this case.

110
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,840
The Gu family said

111
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
if there's a chance,

112
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,120
to thank them in person

113
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,920
for saving and protecting the victims.

114
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,040
Of course.

115
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,480
All these years, the Gu family

116
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,640
They even thanked him in person.

117
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,000
It's just a coincidence.

118
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,680
It's a good thing.

119
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,240
You say thank you in person.

120
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,920
I don't know if he's threatening me face to face.

121
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,720
Don't be happy too soon.

122
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,960
Look at you.

123
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,000
You died like this.

124
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,480
Not tragic

125
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,480
nor emotional.

126
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,560
Should I call you a joke

127
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,880
or pitiful?

128
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,159
No family came to see you even after you died.

129
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,880
Not even a friend.

130
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,720
No wonder you're always around me.

131
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,200
It seems that in this world,

132
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
only I care about you.

133
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,120
I thought

134
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,040
I only cared about Nam Chae-yun.

135
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,560
But now I realize

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
there was you.

137
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,840
Tell me.

138
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
When I die,

139
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,480
when I die?

140
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,280
Who?

141
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,200
Nam Chae-yun.

142
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,680
I thought of her as the most important person to me.

143
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,720
But she never loves me.

144
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,600
A random person

145
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,920
can be her friend.

146
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,360
Ms. Lena.

147
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,760
I'll show her

148
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,160
how it feels to lose a friend.

149
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,960
A student's parent was looking for you.

150
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,920
waiting for you in the office.

151
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,280
Oh.

152
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,640
Okay.

153
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,520
I'll be right there.

154
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,920
Lena.

155
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,640
Fortunately, someone informed me in advance.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
He Luning wants to kill you.

157
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,520
Hello, Cai Yun. What's wrong?

158
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,080
Come out no matter where you are.

159
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,080
Someone is trying to kill you.

160
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,120
One minute later,

161
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,280
I'll pick you up at the school gate.

162
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,560
I'll take care of this.

163
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,760
But I must ensure your safety first.

164
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
Take Xiao Rou and leave here.

165
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,800
I've arranged everything else.

166
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,760
Don't come back.

167
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
I'll come to you.

168
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,880
I will always wait for you.

169
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,680
If I hadn't arrived in time,

170
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,800
would you have killed someone in school?

171
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,080
If something happens to Mantai International,

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,880
do you think the Gu family will let Gu Peng

173
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,080
to continue studying there?

174
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,000
I was so stupid.

175
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,440
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,360
I was impulsive.

177
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,960
I can quit the mission of the Gu family.

178
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,480
But I...

179
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,240
You have no chance.

180
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,840
To me,

181
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,080
you are no different

182
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,040
the dead Go Rang.

183
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,880
Before I want to kill you,

184
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,960
hide for a while.

185
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,080
Maybe

186
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,560
in the future.

187
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,040
But...

188
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,720
Take her away.

189
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,880
Hurry up!

190
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,360
Gu Peng Peng.

191
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,120
Good morning.

192
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,960
Why are you ignoring me?

193
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,960
Do you want to get beaten again?

194
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm just kidding.

195
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,080
I won't hit you.

196
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,760
We are good friends.

197
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,120
You are good friends with everyone.

198
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
Good friends are different.

199
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,640
All good friends are special.

200
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,440
So am I.

201
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,240
Of course.

202
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,520
It's my birthday this Sunday.

203
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,480
Do you want

204
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,800
come to my place for a cake?

205
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,840
Sure.

206
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,680
I want to go.

207
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,240
This is an invitation from my mom.

208
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,000
She asked me to give it to my best friend.

209
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,640
Then I'll

210
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,760
invite your parents

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,640
to my house.

212
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,520
Where do you live?

213
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,240
I don't know.

214
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,520
I always take a car when I go out.

215
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,080
I take a car when I go home.

216
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,360
Sometimes,

217
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,360
take a helicopter.

218
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,400
I don't know where my home is.

219
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,920
Anyway,

220
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,800
in a forest.

221
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,360
and

222
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,400
several tunnels.

223
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,720
How can I find you at your house?

224
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,160
My housekeeper will come to you.

225
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,760
Okay.

226
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,640
I'll leave it to my mom.

227
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,200
Hello, Jason.

228
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,440
We got an invitation from the Gu family.

229
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,880
Sunday.

230
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,080
Let's go visit Gu House.

231
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,720
Good.

232
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,960
Get the list of water as soon as possible.

233
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,120
The mission is over after you get it.

234
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,920
Honey.

235
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,760
I'll see the legendary Koo tomorrow.

236
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,560
Why am I not happy at all?

237
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,400
Me too.

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,200
Let's have a toast.

239
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,520
Let's press the delete button together.

240
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,960
After this mission is completed,

241
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,520
Tell me.

242
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,280
our fake family

243
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,520
will be disbanded?

244
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,320
Xiao Tang

245
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,520
is always my daughter.

246
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,840
and my daughter.

247
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,520
I'm going to get changed.

248
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,680
Bai Haoqing.

249
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,760
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
