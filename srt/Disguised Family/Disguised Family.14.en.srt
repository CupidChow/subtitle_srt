1
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,160
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,480
Don't be afraid.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,120
I'll buy you the best nutrition.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,760
You'll be fine.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,440
Ah.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,800
Boss.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,040
Someone is looking for you downstairs.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,640
Who is it?

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,760
It's a woman.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,000
She said

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,280
what you want.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,080
Okay.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
Don't keep me guessing.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,440
I'm busy.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,080
Introduce yourself.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,640
You don't have to.

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,360
It doesn't matter who I am.

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,720
What matters is

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,680
what I can give you,

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,320
and what I want.

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,120
Do you know who you're talking to?

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,000
How dare you laugh?

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,840
Nam Chae-yun was right.

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,240
You won't live long

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,120
you won't live long.

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,039
Who are you?

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,600
Ms. Sara.

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,640
I have no hostility.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,680
I'm here to make friends.

30
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,160
How about

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,600
take a look at my gift first?

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,960
What do you know?

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Xiao Rou is so weak now.

34
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,920
She won't be able to draw blood frequently soon.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,800
I can help you find a perfect replacement.

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,760
My blood type is special.

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,840
Xiaorou is a perfect match

38
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,960
to find a perfect match.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,840
You keep saying

40
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,079
you can find a replacement for me.

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,160
Why should I believe that?

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,800
It's not hard to find your blood type.

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,000
It's just that you're too kind.

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
You can't find a perfect blood type

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,440
we can't find a perfect blood type.

46
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,160
What else can we do

47
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,600
What else can I do?

48
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,520
He's not an orphan.

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,440
I can help you turn him into an orphan.

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
This is what you need me for.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,240
What do you want?

52
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,000
You're having a charity dinner tomorrow, right?

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,240
Yes.

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,760
I need an invitation for a charity dinner.

55
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,960
VIP gift?

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,520
What do you mean?

57
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,520
I don't understand.

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,560
You worked so hard

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,840
just to get an invitation?

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,560
I'm not done yet.

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,280
What you need to do

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
is to invite Mr. Gu and Mrs. Gu

63
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,880
to attend the charity dinner.

64
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,840
and introduce me to them

65
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,560
to introduce me to them.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,360
No.

67
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,840
If you're here for the Gu family,

68
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,680
I advise you to give up as soon as possible.

69
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,360
Because the Gu family

70
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,640
won't easily befriend

71
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,520
who comes from unknown origins.

72
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,640
You can be my background.

73
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,400
I can't take the responsibility.

74
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,160
If you have

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,240
to the Gu family,

76
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,079
I'm going to die because of you.

77
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,720
Aren't you afraid of the news tomorrow?

78
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,920
All these years,

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,160
you adopted many cute little girls.

80
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
Why are they so strange?

81
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,720
Miss Sara.

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,040
Don't you think it's a coincidence?

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,079
How did you know?

84
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,440
I've got the title for you.

85
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,560
The beauty tips of vampire Demoness Sara

86
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,840
is to exchange blood with a girl.

87
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,120
behind the orphan masks

88
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,640
[behind the orphan charity mask.]

89
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,200
Are you threatening me?

90
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,159
Think from another perspective.

91
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
I'm helping you.

92
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,600
Think about it.

93
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,080
If your secret is exposed,

94
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,240
will the Gu family help you as soon as possible?

95
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,800
or will they disown you as soon as possible?

96
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,280
Think for yourself.

97
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,400
We don't have friends forever.

98
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,000
Only the current interests.

99
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,440
Honey.

100
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,680
What are you doing at this hour?

101
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,040
Why didn't you tell your husband?

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,920
Go to Yin Yue House.

103
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,400
Yin Yue House is so mysterious.

104
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,360
I have to go.

105
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,680
I have to go with you.

106
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,760
Butler Bai went to the backyard today.

107
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,040
That means the Gu family's property

108
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,920
might be hidden in the backyard.

109
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,640
This is a good chance to get information about the Gu family.

110
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,360
No need.

111
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Stay at home.

112
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,080
and look after the baby.

113
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,520
Lena will help me in the dark.

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,600
She called me.

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,440
You didn't even wake me up.

116
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,159
If I get caught,

117
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm Sara's personal bodyguard.

118
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,440
What if you get caught?

119
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,760
That makes sense.

120
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,360
Okay.

121
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,520
Take care.

122
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,520
Go back.

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,040
Take care of the baby.

124
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,720
Wait.

125
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,320
I'm ready.

126
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,600
I'm waiting for your orders.

127
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,760
This morning handsome

128
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,640
I put a micro camera near the backyard.

129
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,520
There's a interferer in this micro camera.

130
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,240
It can affect the network system around it

131
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,200
and affect the surveillance.

132
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,240
But it hasn't been long.

133
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,160
Maybe five minutes.

134
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,080
Chae-yun.

135
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,200
what do you need me to do for you?

136
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,520
I'll sneak into the backyard now.

137
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,400
Once someone comes in,

138
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,080
tell me.

139
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,240
No problem.

140
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,840
Lena.

141
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,160
Start the interferer.

142
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,280
I'm on my way.

143
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,640
The interferer is activated.

144
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,600
It's coming in.

145
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,720
I saw two security guards there.

146
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,760
I'll try to distract them.

147
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,440
It's okay.

148
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Let me help you.

149
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,880
Aren't you at home looking after the kids?

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,840
Why are you here?

151
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
You're clingy.

152
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,800
I can't leave you for a second.

153
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,400
Gosh.

154
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,920
Forget it.

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,480
Since you're here,

156
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,640
After you go in with me,

157
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,760
don't act on your own.

158
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,920
Listen to me.

159
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,840
We have to distract them.

160
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,360
Young-joon.

161
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,800
Hey!

162
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,800
Stop!

163
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,320
Stop!

164
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,120
Lena.

165
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm ready.

166
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,600
Okay.

167
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,240
Hold on.

168
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,040
You can go in now.

169
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,840
Mr. Gu.

170
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,520
There must be something important

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
in his black box.

172
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,000
It's empty.

173
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,800
Chae-yun.

174
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,120
Two more guards are at the back door.

175
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,920
Get out of here.

176
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,040
They're opening the backyard door.

177
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,320
Okay.

178
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

179
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,480
How much time do I have?

180
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,560
Two minutes at most.

181
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,120
Check the left side.

182
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,960
I'll check the right side.

183
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,560
Chae-yun.

184
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,760
They're here for the rehearsal.

185
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,480
Hurry up.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,520
I'll be quick.

187
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,400
One of the security guards in the backyard died.

188
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,120
Search!

189
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,200
If anything happens,

190
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,000
we will all die.

191
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,760
Hurry up.

192
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,640
Cai Yun.

193
