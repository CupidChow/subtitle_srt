1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,360
Ko Rang.

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,720
Surprise.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,840
Xiaotang.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,520
Xiaotang.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,040
Sugar.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:24,960
Mom.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,840
Uncle Jason is reading with me.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,520
Xiaotang, be good.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,440
Listen to me.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,200
I'll take you to your room.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,440
Where's mom?

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,240
Stay here

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:36,960
to talk with them.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,640
OK?

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,560
Uncle Jason.

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,520
Come and play with Xiaotang next time.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,800
Sugar.

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,520
Come here.

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,040
What are you doing here?

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,280
Jason.

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,000
I advise you not to create more troubles.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,320
Do your job.

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,280
A killer in black.

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,680
Don't always think about being a saint.

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,160
My patience is limited.

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,319
Don't force me to detonate the bomb on your neck.

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,240
Are you okay?

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,520
There's an auction tomorrow.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,560
The Gu family will take a famous painting

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
Jackson Polok.

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,760
What?

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,400
The Confucianism Association went to the auction.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
How could he go?

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,440
But he will send his agent.

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,520
remote control and command bidding.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,760
You mean...

37
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,680
Track the location of the phone

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,800
we can find the location of Gu couple.

39
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,360
That's right.

40
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,840
Tomorrow's auction is an invitation system.

41
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,560
I found you a new identity.

42
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,640
They're a couple from Korea.

43
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,440
They're new members,

44
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,440
So

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,080
I'm not familiar with other guests.

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,000
But as punishment,

47
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,920
I want you to share all the information

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,160
to Ning and Ko Rang.

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,039
I'll wait for your good news.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
To put it bluntly,

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,520
is to track

52
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,720
the phones signal of Confucian.

53
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,120
So we need to find a computer master

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,160
to do the outside.

55
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,040
Ask Rena for help.

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,120
Are you serious?

57
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,600
Of course.

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,760
You've seen her hacking skills.

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,880
And we know her very well.

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,800
She's the most suitable candidate.

61
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Chae-yun.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,160
I'm ready.

63
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,720
As soon as the phone is connected,

64
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,680
I can start tracking him.

65
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,960
But

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,280
it will take some time to lock the signal.

67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
Make sure

68
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,800
as long as you can.

69
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,520
Got it.

70
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,800
Honey.

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,440
That is

72
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
the agent of the Gu family.

73
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,360
After the auction,

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,400
extend the auction as much as possible.

75
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,120
Don't let her hang up so soon.

76
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,720
Then we'll keep

77
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,520
bidding with the Gu family

78
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,600
extend time.

79
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,880
Honey.

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,520
Will Jason refuse to reimburse?

81
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,400
Are you stupid?

82
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,680
It's not our money.

83
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,320
We're helping Siemda auction.

84
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,040
They

85
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,800
They are rich.

86
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,560
Where are Chairman Lee Min-joon and his wife?

87
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,040
Table 10.

88
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,920
What's going on?

89
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,680
Something is wrong.

90
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,760
Didn't you say no one knows those two Koreans?

91
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,760
Be flexible.

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,640
We'll see.

93
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,200
Jason is unreliable.

94
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,480
He'll kill me sooner or later.

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,720
Hello.

96
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,240
Hello.

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,760
I'm Cho Soon-reum from Daegu Electronics Group.

98
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,720
This is

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,680
my wife, Yoon Suzhen.

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,760
Lena.

101
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,160
Emergency.

102
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,240
Translate it.

103
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,160
I...

104
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,960
I...

105
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm translating.

106
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,440
Can I buy you a drink

107
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,840
after this?

108
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,160
Right away.

109
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,040
I translated it right away.

110
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,040
Lena.

111
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,640
They don't seem to understand us.

112
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,960
The translation software is stuck.

113
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,400
Are they speaking Korean Mandarin?

114
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,800
Are you really Chairman Lee?

115
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,640
Hurry up.

116
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,120
We can't hold on any longer.

117
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,880
Chae-yun.

118
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,000
Even if I translate it out,

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,720
you can't answer even if you can't speak Korean.

120
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Then tell me what to do

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Call for help.

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,480
Police!

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,200
He's already suspecting us.

124
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,080
I have an idea.

125
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,640
Wait.

126
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,880
Xiaotang's dad is good at imitating.

127
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Just follow this line.

128
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,000
Repeat this.

129
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,840
Say it out loud.

130
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,440
Police!

131
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,120
Are you done?

132
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,120
Are you done?

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,000
Excuse me.

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,880
Can you leave me alone for a while?

135
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,960
What a jerk.

136
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,200
Excuse me.

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm sorry.

138
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Lena.

139
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,400
I got a call.

140
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,320
Got it.

141
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,960
I got the signal.

142
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,960
Disassembling frequency.

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,680
American abstract expression master

144
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,159
Jackson Polok

145
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,120
from 1946 to 1947.

146
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,480
The starting price

147
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,920
US$20 million.

148
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,080
Now the auction begins.

149
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,920
22 million US dollars.

150
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,800
24 million US dollars.

151
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,680
26 million US dollars.

152
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
Now it's 26 million US dollars

153
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,520
Do you want to add 28 million US dollars?

154
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,480
30 million.

155
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,920
We have buyers now.

156
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,400
We have 30 million.

157
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,760
Anything else?

158
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,200
32 million.

159
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,600
Lena.

160
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,280
What happened?

161
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,000
Chae-yun.

162
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,480
Give her two more minutes.

163
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,120
The range is locked in two areas.

164
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,440
30 million once.

165
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,400
Anything else?

166
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,600
32 million.

167
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,720
Now someone offers 32 million.

168
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,920
32 million once.

169
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,480
Hurry up, Lena.

170
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,920
It'll be over if no one raise the price.

171
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,920
Almost.

172
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,880
Hang in there.

173
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,040
It's locked in Dongsha District.

174
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,760
32 million twice.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,120
32 million.

176
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,640
Forty million.

177
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,600
40 million already.

178
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,160
US$40 million

179
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,680
So much now.

180
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,600
It's hard for us to drag.

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,520
Lena.

182
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,000
Hurry.

183
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,960
Give me two more minutes.

184
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,800
Just two minutes.

185
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,280
42 million.

186
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
45 million.

187
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,680
Wow.

188
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,880
45 million

189
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,160
Hello.

190
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,600
We speak Chinese.

191
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,360
Sorry.

192
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,680
Your money is not enough.

193
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,840
This is the way you pay deducted money.

194
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,520
So you have 30 million yuan.

195
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,960
If you want to sell

196
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,600
more than 42 million collection,

197
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,520
At least

198
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,880
I have to save 20 million.

199
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
20 million.

200
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,520
US dollars.

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,080
So are you going to continue to add funds

202
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,880
or you want to quit the auction?

203
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,520
45 million once.

204
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,120
Let's discuss.

205
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,640
Let's talk.

206
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,320
Hurry up, Lena.

207
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,200
One minute.

208
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,040
Last minute.

209
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

210
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
Just a little longer.

211
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,280
Are you kidding me?

212
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
If she hung up now,

213
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
all our efforts

214
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,080
all our efforts were wasted.

215
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,680
Where did you get the money?

216
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,320
How can I get money?

217
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,400
Don't you have a small vault?

218
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,960
Nam Chae-yun.

219
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,360
Don't try to steal my little vault.

220
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,120
Excuse me.

221
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,680
45 million twice.

222
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,400
Please hurry.

223
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,080
Hurry.

224
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,840
This way, please.

225
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,240
47 million.

226
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,560
Still adding?

227
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,080
How much do we need?

228
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,800
Just a little more.

229
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,760
One percent.

230
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,480
Where am I?

231
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,919
Who are you?

232
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,280
But honey...

233
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,559
Are you really going to row?

234
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,440
It's okay.

235
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,760
You won't buy it even if you pay.

236
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,640
It's all for the mission.

237
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,400
If we don't keep bidding,

238
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
how can we find the Gu family?

239
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,000
Sir.

240
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,120
I'll pay 20 million.

241
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,480
Sir.

242
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,000
Sir.

243
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,240
SERVICE.

244
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,280
Do you have fingerprint or password?

245
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,560
I have a question.

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
if this painting

247
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,120
doesn't succeed,

248
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:08,960
Okay.

249
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,480
Retreat?

250
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,920
Of course.

251
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,720
We can retreat now.

252
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,280
Congratulations, sir.

253
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,160
Mr. Gu doesn't want that painting anymore.

254
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,760
Your wife has taken

255
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,360
The 20 million you just added

256
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
is enough to pay.

257
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,880
You don't have to pay.

258
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,360
Let's get high.

259
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,040
Guys.

260
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,800
Cheer up.

261
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,840
Don't be upset.

262
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,560
Although the process

263
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,280
is a little rough,

264
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
But it doesn't affect the result.

265
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,040
I've found out

266
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,880
where Gu's phone signal was sent.

267
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,640
is in Yinyue Tower.

268
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,120
I'll send you

269
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,800
I'll send it to you.

270
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,160
Thank you.

271
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,160
You're welcome.

272
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:11,960
Cheers.

273
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,320
Chae-yun.

274
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,040
Your painting...

275
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,640
What?

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,320
It looks exactly the same

277
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,360
the one you took back.

278
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,640
Well...

279
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,760
Stop it.

280
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,880
Why?

281
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,600
That painting

282
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,840
belongs to Xiao Tang.

283
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
for Xiaotang.

284
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,120
Sugar.

285
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,000
Young-joon.

286
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,960
I bought it

287
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,280
I can't return the money.

288
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,560
Don't be sad.

289
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,480
Ah.

290
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,720
I spent 20 million.

291
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
US dollars.

292
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,920
to buy

293
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,280
of my daughter's painting homework.

294
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,760
All gone.

295
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,320
To buy this painting,

296
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,600
to buy this painting.

297
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,640
US dollars?

298
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,720
Do you know

299
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,440
how painful I felt?

300
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,640
These are the memories

301
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,120
I earned

302
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,200
to make money.

303
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,000
Xiaoyi Xiaotao Xiaolan

304
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,960
Your dad

305
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,680
I'm sorry.

306
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,200
It's okay.

307
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,040
It's almost time.

308
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,800
I'm going back to school.

309
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,720
Let me give you a ride.

310
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,480
No need.

311
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,320
I can't live like this anymore.

312
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,400
Bye.

313
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,920
She's a guest.

314
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,760
I should give her a ride.

315
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,600
You don't love me anymore?

316
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,480
The money is gone.

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,280
and he left.

318
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,960
All right.

319
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,120
No one really cares about me.

320
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,080
I'm so tired

321
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,560
So tired.

322
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,600
I need a hug too.

323
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,680
I'm so tired.

324
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,040
Xiaotang, slow down.

325
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,040
Don't fall down.

326
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,800
No one really cares about me.

327
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,520
I need a hug too.

328
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,360
Hello.

329
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,520
I'll take this order.

330
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,120
Send me the meeting location.

331
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,800
Bai Haoqing.

332
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,880
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.
