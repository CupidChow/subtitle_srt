00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,600
Episode 3

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,800
Honey.

3
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,840
The bath salt is so comfortable.

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,800
Saffron and Himalayas bath salt.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,439
Don't move.

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,160
Gosh.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,920
I told you to stay still.

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,120
Honey.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,000
I know you're mad at me.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,280
Let's start over.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,000
Next life.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,960
I won't hide.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,640
I won't kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

14
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,720
If you want to kill me,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,080
I can avoid today.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,560
I can't avoid tomorrow.

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,720
Besides, I've died once.

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,240
It doesn't matter.

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,840
You're a spy by my side.

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,080
Why did you tell me

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
tell me to go.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,440
Because...

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,840
Because you and Xiaotang

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,680
Bullshit!

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,600
Hey, Xiao Tang.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,320
Honey, trust me.

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,360
It's really for you and Xiaotang.

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,039
Liar.

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,800
You're full of lies.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,840
Just kill me.

31
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,039
Jason is threatening us with Xiaotang's life.

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,240
If we fail,

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,640
Xiaotang and we will both die.

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,160
Gosh.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,039
I knew my wife

36
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,039
You're a couple for a hundred days.

37
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,840
You still have feelings for me, right?

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Death penalty is exempted.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,920
You'll be sentenced to death.

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,480
Honey.

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,520
Let me explain.

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,360
Hey, Xiao Tang.

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,040
Handsome.

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,720
I'll kill you.

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,440
There are only zero and countless times of domestic violence.

46
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,360
I hate it when people lie to me.

47
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,520
You lied to me for a year.

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,680
Calm down.

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,560
Take a break.

50
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,000
Nam Chae-yun.

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,840
Don't push me.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,120
I'll fight you.

53
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,720
Nam Chae-yun!

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,880
Don't go too far.

55
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,960
You made me and Xiaotang fall into Jason's hands.

56
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,440
And you're wearing this.

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,000
How dare you say that?

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,720
You forced me to marry you.

59
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,840
I'm not in a hurry.

60
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,480
Speaking of which,

61
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,800
Okay.

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,280
Let me ask you.

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,760
What was the mission Jason gave you?

64
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,720
Tell me.

65
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,240
The mission is you.

66
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,160
Speak.

67
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
Speak.

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,760
The mission is to get close to you

69
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,480
and take you away with me.

70
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,160
to this beautiful Mantai City.

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,160
and send our lovely daughter

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,120
to this beautiful Mantai International Elementary School.

73
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,840
That's what happened.

74
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,240
Watch out for the fruit knife.

75
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,720
No.

76
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,480
You're not telling the truth.

77
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
There's something wrong.

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,040
What's the problem?

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,880
Stop.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
How did you know

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,880
I asked you to disguise my identity

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,120
and form a family of three.

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,200
to avoid Hei Shi.

84
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,360
What if I didn't go to you?

85
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,760
I saw it.

86
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,520
Black Rock's mission list.

87
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,640
Since Hei Shi has given us a mission,

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,160
you can't fail.

89
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,520
Even if you didn't approach me,

90
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,840
someone else will approach you.

91
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,640
Scum!

92
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Dad, mom.

93
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,800
Dad, I'm hungry.

94
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,920
What do you want for dinner?

95
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,560
You...

96
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,320
Are you hungry?

97
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,240
Xiao Tang.

98
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,240
I'll peel an apple for you.

99
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,760
Okay?

100
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,440
Mom

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,720
I'll make you your favorite.

102
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,600
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

103
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,480
Okay?

104
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, honey.

105
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,320
Xiao Tang.

106
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,840
Go do your homework.

107
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,040
The meal will be ready soon.

108
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,680
Okay.

109
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,320
I came here

110
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,600
to leave Blackrock.

111
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,000
My purpose

112
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,040
is the same as you.

113
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,000
We all want to leave Blackrock.

114
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,320
Think about this.

115
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,959
What are we now?

116
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,880
We share the same destiny.

117
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,560
have a common goal.

118
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,720
Think about the child.

119
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,080
We

120
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,640
are on the same boat now.

121
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,960
So

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,240
the same.

123
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,640
To the public,

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,840
I can continue to work with you.

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
But I won't trust you anymore.

126
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,000
From now on,

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,360
I have the final say in this family.

128
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,840
If you lie to me again,

129
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,680
I will tell Xiaotang

130
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,800
her father

131
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,200
had a car accident.

132
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,520
and died.

133
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,400
I can do that.

134
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,840
Go cook.

135
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,080
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

136
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,400
Don't forget.

137
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,120
Honey.

138
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,600
All the dishes are here.

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,240
Xiao Tang.

140
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,280
Eat less vegetables and meat.

141
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Eat meat and grow taller.

142
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,720
Eat more vegetables.

143
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,920
I guarantee vitamins.

144
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,520
How is Xiaotang doing at school today?

145
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,280
Is she a good girl?

146
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,200
Ban didn't come to school today.

147
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,600
Ms. Rona said he's transferring.

148
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
His father got hurt and was hospitalized.

149
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
so he's moving to another place.

150
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,520
That's great.

151
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,320
Pan always bullies you.

152
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,240
Now,

153
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
no one dares to bully Xiaotang.

154
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,040
Ryusei-sensei didn't come to school today either.

155
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,520
Ms. Lena said

156
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
Ryusei-sensei got hurt too.

157
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,800
He said he would never be a teacher again.

158
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,720
Really?

159
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,000
Isn't that a good thing?

160
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,360
Mr. Long guess

161
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,120
hasn't been very friendly to you?

162
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,280
He won't bother you anymore.

163
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,320
Is there a bug?

164
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,720
What are you looking at?

165
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,560
Mom.

166
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,520
Do you think there is really a deity in the sky?

167
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,040
A deity?

168
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,800
Because my wish has come true.

169
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,440
After class,

170
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,040
after class

171
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,480
Then

172
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,760
they all left.

173
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,640
So,

174
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,440
the deities in the sky will surely hear my wish.

175
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,920
Do you know why?

176
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Because you are an angel.

177
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,440
So deities in the sky

178
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,760
will bless you.

179
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,400
Okay.

180
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,360
I'm full.

181
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,440
I'm going to watch TV.

182
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,720
Honey.

183
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,680
Pan.

184
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,920
Honey.

185
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,480
Did you do it?

186
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,760
Long guess.

187
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,800
You did it?

188
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,840
Honey, don't be angry.

189
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,000
Do we have to live a good life?

190
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,640
As long as you're not angry,

191
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,640
I'll do anything.

192
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,240
Really?

193
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,520
Honey.

194
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,360
I didn't know we lived together for a year.

195
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,000
you have such a fetish.

196
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,200
I used to pretend

197
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,760
I've restrained myself.

198
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,880
Now I'll show you

199
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,000
the real me.

200
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,400
No.

201
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,720
Honey.

202
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,000
What are you doing?

203
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,400
You want to break my necklace?

204
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,920
Stop it.

205
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,200
This is no joke.

206
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,360
You can't remove the Black Rock necklace.

207
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
How do you know if I don't try?

208
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,760
If you're done,

209
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,840
I'll be gone.

210
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,200
That's fine.

211
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,800
Maybe I can find another

212
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,000
a handsome husband.

213
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
Hey.

214
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,800
Don't...

215
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,760
Don't act tough.

216
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,520
I've seen someone unwrap this before.

217
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,320
It was blown to death.

218
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,200
You saw it.

219
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,560
My head is blown up.

220
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,800
Don't worry.

221
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,720
I'll collect your body.

222
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,520
I'll make the funeral look decent.

223
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,000
No!

224
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,080
No!

225
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,760
Xiaotang.

226
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Stop watching cartoons.

227
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,800
Save...

228
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,160
If you shout again, I'll cut it off.

229
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,160
Carbon fiber entangles titanium alloy.

230
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
One form.

231
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,880
Fiction.

232
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
The current is closing.

233
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,760
High-density explosives.

234
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,960
It's a bit troublesome.

235
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,640
Nam Chae-yun.

236
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,800
I'm going to explode.

237
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,680
Let's talk, okay?

238
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,520
Don't come over.

239
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,720
Let's talk.

240
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,680
Mission comes first.

241
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,840
Finish the mission.

242
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,600
The priority now

243
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,960
Xiaotang.

244
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,320
Xiaotang.

245
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,360
Somebody help me

246
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,240
Somebody help you

247
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,680
Phone.

248
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,120
Hello?

249
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,680
Hello?

250
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,920
Ms. Lena.

251
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,240
What?

252
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,960
Excuse me.

253
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,640
Thank you.

254
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,440
See you tomorrow.

255
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,600
Okay.

256
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,960
Bye.

257
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,840
Honey.

258
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,040
What's wrong?

259
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,440
You care about Confucianism.

260
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,440
How much do you know?

261
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,720
I know

262
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,160
is not much better than you.

263
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,800
He has never shown up in public.

264
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,920
Mrs. Gu.

265
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,800
I heard she is the president of the elite parent board.

266
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,120
This board meeting

267
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,480
is basically

268
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,040
the top ladies' social circle.

269
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,000
Looks like we have to

270
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,040
to get into this small circle.

271
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,080
There's actually

272
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,200
other ways.

273
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,240
Say it.

274
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,960
Honey.

275
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,560
Next month is Gu Peng Peng's birthday.

276
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,320
If Xiao Tang and Gu Peng Peng

277
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
become good friends,

278
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,400
we might get the birthday invitation.

279
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,080
By then...

280
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,760
Don't think about it.

281
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,840
It won't work.

282
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,920
If you don't try,

283
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,320
How do you know if you don't try?

284
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,120
Honey.

285
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,920
Honey.

286
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,960
What if it works?

287
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,720
Children may look young,

288
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,120
adults always listen to children.

289
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,040
No.

290
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,720
The head teacher called me just now.

291
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Xiao Tang called Gu Peng Peng at school today.

292
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,920
We became enemies before we met.

293
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,320
So you mean

294
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,000
we need to go to school?

295
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,480
Gu Peng's parents

296
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,440
going to school too?

297
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,080
Right.

298
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,840
Peng.

299
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,480
I'll beat you up!

300
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,640
Gu Peng!

301
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,560
Gu Peng Peng.

302
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,840
We became enemies before we met.

303
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,320
Is our mission over?

304
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,520
I think it's possible.

305
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,120
What is it?

306
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,920
I watched a vertical screen short play.

307
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,920
Let me tell you.

308
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,400
people like Gu Peng

309
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,680
who is spoiled

310
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,440
a spoiled boss

311
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,720
who likes to bully him.

312
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,120
The beginning of this group

313
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,800
we must get sick of each other

314
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,920
until you chase me

315
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,160
You find me to hide

316
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,920
In the end,

317
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,880
[must have met again]

318
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,320
meet again.

319
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,120
Peng.

320
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,320
Why don't you take the lift?

321
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,520
I won't hit you.

322
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,400
Don't come near me.

323
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,200
The plot after we met

324
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,920
is to turn enemies into friends.

325
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm here to apologize.

326
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,320
I'm sorry.

327
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,360
It was my fault for hitting you yesterday.

328
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,720
I'm glad you know.

329
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,200
But

330
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,600
you can't occupy the volleyball court anymore.

331
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
I'm not occupying the volleyball court.

332
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,160
They don't like playing. They don't want to play.

333
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,080
It has nothing to do

334
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,320
with me?

335
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,360
It's because everyone is afraid of you.

336
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,840
They don't dare to play with you.

337
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,840
A bunch of cowards.

338
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,360
I don't want to play with them either.

339
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,880
In the future,

340
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,800
Let's play.

341
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,200
we'll be good friends.

342
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,840
At this moment,

343
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,360
boys will accept girls' kindness

344
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,640
and say happily.

345
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,360
I don't need any good friends.

346
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,640
Again?

347
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
From then on,

348
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,800
The story is back on track.

349
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,160
They love each other every day.

350
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,960
and never leave each other.

351
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,920
Unable to part

352
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,360
When I don't see you for a day, I'll miss you so much.

353
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,360
I didn't know this is the legendary

354
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,720
Meet at the corner.

355
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,880
Ah.

356
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,840
What a headache.

357
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,800
Not to mention being friends with Gu Nian Con,

358
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,520
even if I become in-laws,

359
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,720
it's not impossible.

360
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,000
Are you crazy?

361
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,920
Yesterday,

362
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,320
there was a small conflict between the kids.

363
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,360
So I asked you to come today

364
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,760
to negotiate and solve it.

365
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,680
Xiao Tang's parents.

366
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
This is Gu Peng Peng's parent.

367
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Hello, Mr Gu.

368
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,760
Sorry.

369
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Mr. Tang.

370
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm not Mr. Gu.

371
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,160
I’m Mrs. Gu’s butler.

372
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,120
Where is your wife?

373
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,760
I'll take care of Young Master.

374
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,040
You can call me.

375
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,920
Steward Bai.

376
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,120
I'm sorry.

377
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,360
It's my fault.

378
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,520
I didn't explain it to you in advance.

379
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,520
Because the identity of the Gu family is special,

380
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,040
So Gu Peng's parents

381
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,280
has always been

382
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,360
Mr. Baek.

383
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,160
Oh.

384
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,960
I see

385
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,760
Yes.

386
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,040
What does the Gu family mean?

387
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,760
Since

388
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,120
Gu Peng Peng is not hurt,

389
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,920
It's just a child's fight.

390
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,640
Then the House of Gu...

391
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
will not be held accountable.

392
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,760
The school

393
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,400
to the school.

394
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,240
Yes.

395
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,720
But my kid hit me first.

396
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,000
I feel so bad.

397
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,320
So,

398
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,520
we still hope to visit Mrs. Gu

399
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,520
and apologize to her face to face.

400
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,360
Thank you.

401
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,400
But don't bother.

402
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,520
Where is Mrs. Gu?

403
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,920
She’s resting.

404
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,760
It's inconvenient to see visitors.

405
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,040
Please forgive me.

406
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,120
Well,

407
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,440
Mr. Gu, do you have some time

408
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,360
to have a cup of coffee?

409
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,000
If it’s not convenient for you,

410
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,600
can you do me a favor?

411
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,560
give us a chance

412
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
to express

413
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,160
the sincerity of apology.

414
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,040
Yes.

415
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,120
How about now?

417
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,880
Could you

418
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,160
buy us a cup of coffee?

419
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,880
No problem.

420
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,960
I'll go now.

421
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,920
Have a good chat.

422
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,840
Take your time.

423
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,400
This is too social.

424
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,200
Don't stand there.

425
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,520
Sit down and talk.
