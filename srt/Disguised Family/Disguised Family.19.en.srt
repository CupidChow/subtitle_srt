1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,120
Wow!

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,800
Sugar

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,200
Good job.

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,320
Mum.

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,120
Gu Peng Peng.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,400
like the painting I gave him?

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,880
Of course.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,440
I don't know if he will

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm surprised.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:39,880
And

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,560
I think I did it quite well.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,800
What do you think I look like, mom?

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,400
Sugar.

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Oh.

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,920
Okay.

16
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,840
Wait.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,280
The card in your pocket.

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,880
Take it out and have a look.

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,120
It's my washing card.

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,280
Should I check it?

21
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,160
It's okay.

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,560
The three of you,

23
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
Follow me.

24
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,440
Ms. Baek.

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,040
What do you mean?

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,920
A blood test.

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,079
Check if you have infectious diseases.

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,760
No need for Xiaotang.

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,600
We've received

30
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,480
from the school.

31
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,920
That's ridiculous.

32
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,520
Is this how you treat guests?

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,040
This is the rule of the Gu family.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Every guest who enters the Gu family

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,400
will have a physical examination.

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,760
If you don't want to,

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,920
I can

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,720
send you back now.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,560
No.

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,560
Forget it, honey.

41
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,360
Let's go for a checkup.

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,880
Since you're here,

43
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,600
We agree.

44
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,440
That's good.

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,360
I don't want you two

46
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,600
come here for nothing.

47
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,000
We’re leaving.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,600
Mr. Yan.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,800
Please wait.

50
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,520
My husband and I

51
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,000
Why did you do it separately?

52
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,960
Ms. Nam.

53
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,840
If I'm right,

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,320
you must have other purposes coming to the House of Gu.

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,640
Since you want something,

56
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,040
you have to show your attitude.

57
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Don't ask

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,480
Don't ask.

59
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,240
This is also

60
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,160
of checking.

61
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,600
Add some medicine.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,920
To check

63
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,520
Customers' sincerity

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,080
Tell me.

65
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,880
Who are you?

66
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Nam Chae-yun.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,880
Why are you here?

68
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,960
I...

69
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,920
I'm...

70
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,360
Heim Group.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,520
Class A Agent.

72
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,760
Nam Chae-yun.

73
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,280
I...

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
get close.

75
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,440
Mrs. Gu.

76
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,440
The first time I saw you,

77
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,120
I knew something was wrong with you.

78
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,120
Where are my husband and children?

79
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,400
No hurry.

80
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,440
I'll take you

81
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,040
take you to see them now.

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,840
What did you do to them?

83
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,840
Stop acting.

84
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,480
You and your husband

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,600
just confessed.

86
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,520
Tell me.

87
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,280
What's the purpose

88
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,880
sent you here?

89
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,240
I...

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

91
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,040
I'm really a housewife.

92
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,080
I'm Nam Chae-yun.

93
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,040
Homewife.

94
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,120
You don't know anything.

95
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,400
Trust me.

96
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,480
What are you doing?

97
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,440
My child.

98
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,159
My husband.

99
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,280
Congratulations.

100
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,640
You passed.

101
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,160
My name is Nam Chae-yun.

102
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,080
I'm just a housewife.

103
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,560
Ms. Nan.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,320
Welcome to Gu House.

105
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,480
Honey.

106
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,440
Are you okay?

107
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,120
That's good.

108
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,520
Xiaotang.

109
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,720
Peng Peng.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
This is my gift for you.

111
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,200
Wow.

112
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,520
Ms. Nam.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,480
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,560
It's all for safety.

115
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,360
Nice to meet you.

116
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,960
I'm just thinking about Confucianism.

117
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,720
For safety.

118
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,760
It's understandable.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Honey,

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,200
If you keep looking at Mr. Gu,

121
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,159
I’ll be jealous.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,720
Sorry.

123
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,520
Mr. Gu.

124
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,760
He looks like

125
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,320
a male star I like.

126
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,360
It's okay.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,640
Steward Bai.

128
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,000
Take them to the room to have a rest.

129
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,560
We'll meet after dinner.

130
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,360
Mom.

131
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,040
I'll play with Xiaotang.

132
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,880
Go.

133
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,640
Let's go.

134
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,080
Excuse me.

135
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,200
This way, please.

136
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,960
My house

137
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,800
is huge.

138
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
Let me show you outside.

139
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,680
Okay.

140
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,000
See you later.

141
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,640
Okay.

142
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,080
Honey.

143
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,120
Do you know Gu Nian Confucian?

144
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,560
Hush.

145
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,640
He looks like someone I used to know.

146
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,520
He does look different,

147
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,960
But that scar

148
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,040
the same spot.

149
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,000
Who is he?

150
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Who?

151
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,000
He's a senior

152
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,720
Senior.

153
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,360
He died in an accident eight years ago.

154
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,800
You mean

155
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,560
a Agent of Black Rock

156
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,480
changed

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,040
and became the son-in-law of the Gu family.

158
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,360
and the boss of Shirogui.

159
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,480
This is ridiculous.

160
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,120
I'm not sure.

161
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,320
Although we passed the test,

162
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,240
the Gu family's doubts about us

163
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,520
has not been completely erased.

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,280
What we should do now

165
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,800
is to find the study

166
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,760
and find the information.

167
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,560
We can't stay here any longer. We can't leave.

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,520
Wait.

169
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,280
His current identity

170
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,120
is still a variable.

171
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,360
I still want to confirm

172
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,680
if he is my senior.

173
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,600
I don't think so.

174
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,480
You just met.

175
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,200
Your appearance

176
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,840
compared to before.

177
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,840
If he really is your senior,

178
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,440
why didn't he tell you?

179
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,160
Because he's Shirogui's director now.

180
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,080
From the perspective,

181
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,160
we're rivals.

182
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,200
If you think of Confucianism as your senior,

183
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,000
we've already made a mistake.

184
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
Why didn't he arrest us directly?

185
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,400
Maybe because

186
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,400
we did nothing.

187
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,440
Maybe

188
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,280
Maybe it's because

189
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,160
our relationship.

190
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,960
Our old relationship?

191
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,800
Nam Chae-yun.

192
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,720
You're not in a good state.

193
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
You care so much about him.

194
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,520
Is he really your senior?

195
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,160
Not exactly.

196
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,320
He's also my ex.

197
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,040
I know him very well.

198
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,880
Ex.

199
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,600
Ex, right?

200
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,760
You're in such a hurry to find out who he is.

201
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,360
because...

202
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,720
because he's your ex.

203
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,800
Oh.

204
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,840
I'm talking to you about something serious.

205
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,640
Can you

206
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,080
Stop being jealous.

207
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,040
I'm not jealous.

208
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,920
Everyone has an ex these days.

209
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,120
Ridiculous.

210
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
I'm being unreasonable?

211
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,920
Time is running out.

212
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,560
The mission is heavy.

213
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,560
I'm only one step away from completing the mission.

214
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,000
I want to do what I do.

215
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,040
What do you want to do?

216
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,920
I won't stop you.

217
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't stop me either.

218
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,280
Bai Haoqing.

219
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,360
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu. Resort? Yes.
