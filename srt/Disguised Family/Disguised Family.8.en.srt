1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,680
who killed Pei and her daughter.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,440
Amanda.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,080
Participants.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,600
Principal.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,440
Chef.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,120
Doctor.

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,400
None of them can escape.

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,200
According to my investigation,

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,920
the principal hired the chef.

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,160
He's a paid person

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,240
It's easier.

12
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,040
We can go to him directly.

13
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,120
Let him tell us first.

14
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,120
The principal has worked for Amanda for so many years.

15
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,360
He has earned both fame and fortune.

16
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,520
The principal cares about his son the most.

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,200
Peng Cha.

18
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,119
Peng Cha

19
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,920
is a gentle person.

20
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,160
But once he gets involved with his own interests,

21
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,920
he's more vicious than his father.

22
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,640
And Peng Cha's wife

23
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,080
is the head nurse of Mantai Hospital.

24
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,400
We found that

25
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,320
Peng Cha's wife

26
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,440
and the doctor

27
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,600
with Pei Pei.

28
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,000
After this operation,

29
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,320
in return,

30
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
he was promoted to vice president.

31
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,960
Longbang and Peng Cha's wife

32
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,600
often had an affair in the hospital office.

33
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,320
If Peng Cha finds out,

34
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,840
with Peng Cha's mania,

35
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,920
he

36
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
will be in danger.

37
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,400
Honey.

38
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,440
Let's start with Peng Cha who is emotional.

39
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,319
Start with the easiest chef.

40
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,440
Break them one by one.

41
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,600
Amanda!

42
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,440
The game has started.

43
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,880
If the principal hadn't asked for help,

44
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,680
how could I

45
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,960
in this restaurant?

46
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,480
Oh

47
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,640
It's my duty.

48
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,520
This time,

49
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,440
you've helped a lot.

50
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,960
Other than me,

51
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,720
except me.

52
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,560
Oh.

53
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,680
In order to make sure she eats the fish bones,

54
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,520
I added

55
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,200
And the fish bones are very small.

56
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,160
It's not easy to find

57
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,840
The tail is split.

58
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,479
It gets stuck in the throat the most easily.

59
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,840
Oh

60
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:39,920
Thank you

61
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,759
Thank you.

62
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,800
It's my treat.

63
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll treat you well.

64
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,479
Thank you.

65
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:44,960
You're welcome.

66
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,760
What does it mean?

67
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,080
It means

68
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,360
Eat up.

69
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,680
Don't move.

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,680
If you cut your throat,

71
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,040
the blood in the tracheotomy flows into the mouth,

72
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,080
Then I won't even have a chance to say my last words.

73
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,400
I didn't do anything evil.

74
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,880
I just put a few fish bones.

75
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,120
Seriously?

76
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,480
Do you know that girl

77
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,720
is a special musician?

78
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,720
Listen.

79
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,320
You ruined her voice.

80
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,720
How will she sing in the future?

81
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
What's the point of telling him so much?

82
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,200
Do you think

83
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,520
have conscience?

84
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:33,960
I promise.

85
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,640
I won't do it again.

86
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,920
You know you're wrong.

87
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,079
You're just afraid.

88
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,480
But if you do something wrong,

89
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,320
you have to pay the price.

90
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
Two choices.

91
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,320
Eat up.

92
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,360
Second,

93
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,880
Die.

94
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,600
Eat.

95
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,960
Hurry up.

96
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
You're so slow.

97
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,720
Didn't you

98
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,600
to hurt her.

99
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,760
Eat it all.

100
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,880
Just some fish bones.

101
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,680
It's nothing.

102
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,280
Please let me go.

103
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,800
I'll do anything you want me to do.

104
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,600
Thank you.

105
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,760
for giving me

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,880
to me.

107
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Thank you.

108
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,079
Well,

109
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,800
I became a teacher after graduation.

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,080
It's been

111
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
30 years.

112
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,600
For the past 30 years,

113
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,280
for the past 30 years.

114
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,440
I have a clear conscience.

115
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,120
My name is Bo Lai.

116
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,680
a chef from Mantai International Elementary School.

117
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,200
I was threatened by the principal

118
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,880
by the principal of Mantai International Elementary School.

119
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,920
In the food

120
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,080
Pei's food

121
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,800
in the dish.

122
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,040
in exchange.

123
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,680
he arranged me

124
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,480
the chef of Mantai International Hotel

125
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,360
of Mantai International Hotel.

126
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,280
Peng Cha.

127
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,280
I regret it.

128
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,080
Peng Cha.

129
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,680
Say hello to everyone.

130
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,400
Cheer up.

131
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,560
Don't embarrass me.

132
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,520
You're still young.

133
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,360
I'm a little nervous.

134
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,800
I hope you can support me

135
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,760
in the future.

136
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,720
Please forgive me.

137
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,560
Thank you.

138
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,680
Thank you.

139
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,520
He's so handsome.

140
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,280
Yes.

141
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,760
I was too nervous today.

142
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,400
It tastes good.

143
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:19,960
Okay.

144
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,760
Honey.

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Do you think

146
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,720
would really kill his father?

147
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,400
Didn't you notice?

148
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,440
Both of them are the same.

149
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,680
They're people who do whatever it takes to benefit.

150
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,760
Hey.

151
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,880
Did you put shrimp in the soup?

152
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,400
You taught me when I was young.

153
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,520
that people should be responsible

154
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,360
you have to be responsible.

155
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,680
What are you talking about?

156
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,480
So you made a mistake.

157
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,720
Don't get me involved.

158
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm new here.

159
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,920
I will be the principal

160
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,560
like you.

161
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,680
It's okay.

162
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,200
Peng Cha.

163
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,880
It's okay.

164
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,680
I'll fix it for you.

165
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,960
Now.

166
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Go get my asthma medicine.

167
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,280
It's no use, Dad.

168
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,240
They have evidence.

169
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Son, hurry.

170
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,400
Where is my medicine?

171
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,840
Go.

172
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,320
Get me the medicine.

173
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,640
Go.

174
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,880
Hang in there.

175
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,600
In the eyes of others,

176
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,800
you are a good principal.

177
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,760
But the principal killed the students.

178
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,120
will be despised.

179
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,320
Please help me for the last time.

180
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,360
I will make sure you leave with dignity.

181
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,600
Hurry.

182
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,720
Look.

183
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,080
The principal's retribution is coming.

184
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,680
Dad.

185
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,960
Dad.

186
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,160
I'm sorry.

187
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,400
Why did the principal suddenly die?

188
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,240
How did the patient die?

189
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,280
Asthma.

190
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,400
He didn't get treated in time.

191
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,880
It seems to be an accident.

192
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,800
What did you say?

193
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,360
Oh.

194
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,960
Nothing.

195
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,800
Hey.

196
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,800
Call your head nurse

197
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,880
to my office later.

198
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,960
I have something to ask her.

199
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,000
Dad is gone.

200
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,120
Dad is gone.

201
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Don't be sad.

202
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,560
Longbang, what are you doing?

203
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,080
I'll be promoted to vice president this afternoon.

204
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,480
You loser.

205
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,560
Without his father,

206
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,480
he's nothing.

207
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,960
Kick him as soon as possible.

208
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,160
so that he won't suffer.

209
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Not yet.

210
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,520
My father-in-law just died.

211
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,480
How can I do this?

212
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,080
That old man did something bad.

213
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
He deserves it.

214
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,800
Longbang.

215
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,760
Don’t forget

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,720
you did the little girl's surgery.

217
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,080
You've done

218
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,120
a lot.

219
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,440
I'm fine.

220
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,640
I sent someone to perform a ritual.

221
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,080
and donated a lot of money.

222
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,679
And...

223
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,480
even if I didn't do that surgery,

224
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,800
someone else will do it.

225
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,960
If someone wants her to die,

226
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,160
her vocal cords are doomed to be ruined.

227
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,160
It's not my fault.

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,360
Please sign here.

229
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,280
We can take him to the cremation in the afternoon.

230
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,280
Thank you.

231
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,080
Thank you.

232
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,400
I'm very honored to be the vice president of my hospital.

233
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,520
What's next?

234
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,440
I'll give you a detailed report

235
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,640
after my resignation.

236
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,640
This is a data

237
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
in recent years.

238
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,360
Next,

239
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,120
This is...

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
You two...

241
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,160
What's going on?

242
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,600
How could this happen?

243
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,200
I've trained you for so many years.

244
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:27,920
Useless!

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,680
Turn off your phone.

246
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,120
I want you

247
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,600
I want you.

248
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,160
This is awesome.

249
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,600
That old man did something bad.

250
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,680
He deserves it.

251
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,240
Longbang.

252
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,520
Don’t forget

253
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,520
you did the little girl's surgery.

254
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,680
You've done a lot of bad things.

255
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,520
Aren't you ashamed of having an affair behind your husband's back?

256
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,120
Who did this?

257
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,040
That loser.

258
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,840
He's nothing without his father.

259
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,280
I'm the vice president of our hospital now.

260
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,640
Kick the one at your house.

261
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,520
Follow me.

262
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,480
Not yet.

263
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
My husband is sad

264
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,120
My husband is sad.

265
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,320
That loser.

266
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,400
Without his father,

267
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,520
I can't do anything in my life.

268
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,160
Kick him off as soon as possible.

269
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,800
so that you won't suffer.

270
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,800
You can do it.

271
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,880
I said do it!

272
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,680
I said do it!

273
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,120
Hurry up.

274
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,520
Stop it.

275
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,200
Longbang.

276
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,440
He has a knife.

277
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,880
Call security.

278
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,640
Hurry up!

279
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,360
Bastard!

280
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,680
You're not getting away either!

281
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
I'll castrate you today.

282
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,880
Next,

283
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,640
my daughter Anki

284
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,400
with my daughter Anju.

285
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,240
Hope you like it.

286
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,480
Here's the key.

287
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,880
But I've made up my mind.

288
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,160
If you want to stop,

289
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,040
You still have a chance.

290
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,680
Open the door.

291
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,480
Open the door!

292
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,760
He deserves it.

293
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,280
Help!

294
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,440
Help!

295
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,040
Let me explain.

296
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Listen to me.

297
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,760
The gift for Amanda is ready.

298
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,680
Let's go.

299
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,360
Bai Haoqing.

300
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,440
Chengdu Swan Lake Resort.
