1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,680
You're back.

2
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,200
Yeah.

3
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
Peter.

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,440
Good boy.

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,880
I bought you something delicious

6
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,519
Come here.

7
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,200
It's not good to be so clingy.

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,960
What a stupid place.

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,039
It's so hard to find.

10
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,880
What are you doing?

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
This is...

12
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:32,600
Open the door.

13
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,000
Open the door!

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,200
Brother!

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,640
Brother.

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,479
It's you again.

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:40,880
Brother.

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,680
Do you think boss is easy to talk to?

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,920
My daughter has a fever.

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,520
No one takes care of her at home.

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,640
Listen to me first.

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,920
Boss said

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,960
if you can't pay the money by tonight,

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,600
don't take this.

25
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,640
I'll pay it back.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Give me one more day.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,640
What?

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,000
You should talk to the boss.

29
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,720
Wait.

30
00:01:59,039 --> 00:01:59,960
Give me one minute.

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,960
Give me one minute.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,000
Please.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,480
Can you give me one more minute?

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,800
Just one minute.

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,720
Neighbor.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,160
My child is sick.

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,079
She has a fever at home.

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm worried about her alone.

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,560
Can you take care of her for me?

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,280
Neighbor.

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,000
I beg you.

42
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,000
Are you acting?

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,320
Is anyone in this room?

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,400
Stop wasting time.

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,960
I beg you.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't waste time.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,520
The boss is waiting for you.

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,600
Let's go, Young Lady Zhen Zhu.

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,800
I beg you.

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,200
Xiaotang.

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,760
Don't be afraid.

52
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,360
I'm Chae-yun.

53
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,040
Sugar.

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,480
I heard you're sick.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,040
Your mom asked me to take care of you.

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,440
Come here.

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,120
Sugar.

58
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,400
Did the bad guys catch Mom again?

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,000
Why did they

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
come to catch my mom every day?

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,400
Don't worry.

62
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000
Your mom will be back.

63
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
The bear's stomach is screaming.

64
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,000
Really?

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
Then the bear...

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,920
Does the teddy bear like instant noodles?

67
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,320
I'll make one for you.

68
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,000
Auntie.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,440
Is Mom home?

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,280
Stay in the bedroom for a while.

71
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,200
Don't come out

72
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,840
don't come out.

73
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,800
Also,

74
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,840
if someone knocks,

75
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,800
call you Xiaotang,

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,840
you should hide.

77
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,280
When will my mom come back?

78
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,400
Don't worry.

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,920
She'll be back soon.

80
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,080
Nam Chae-yun has escaped.

81
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,080
Nam Chae-yun is next door.

82
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,040
Let's go.

83
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,320
Ko Rang.

84
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,760
How did you know I was here?

85
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,600
Of course Hei Shi has his own way.

86
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,400
Senior.

87
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,440
Fighting with you is the best.

88
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,800
Do you like to work so hard for Hei Shi?

89
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,760
Jason said

90
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,800
if you go back alone,

91
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,080
you're still the minister.

92
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,600
If you get caught,

93
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,320
you know what will happen.

94
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,760
Let me see.

95
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,560
how much you've improved

96
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,480
how much have you improved?

97
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Still not good.

98
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,800
You haven't changed either.

99
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,720
You're still so soft-hearted.

100
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
You don't know, right?

101
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,320
Our equipment has been upgraded.

102
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
The gas

103
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,679
His limbs are stiff after inhaling.

104
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,919
We've injected antibodies. It won't affect us.

105
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,600
Senior.

106
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,640
But you're different.

107
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,320
Come up and look at Nam Chae-yun.

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll check the next room.

109
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,720
Xiao Tang.

110
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,960
Bai Haoqing.

111
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,040
Chengdu Swan Lake Resort.
