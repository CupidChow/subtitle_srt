1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,600
Master, you're back.

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,680
Then I

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,040
will go prepare some dishes for you.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,800
There must be something important

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,840
in the backyard.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,400
But

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,940
it's not easy to get in.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:29,820
Master,

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,840
here's our appetizer.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:33,840
Double

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,560
Pride.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,400
And this dish.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,160
This dish is called

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,560
Silver Threads.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,210
Silver Threads.

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,560
Isn't this just plain noodles?

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,640
I waited six months for this.

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,040
It's definitely all show and no substance.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,960
We have more

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,200
dishes coming.

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,920
Slow down.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,560
This dish

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,480
is called

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,160
Ear

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,400
Si

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,000
Mo.

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,050
And this one.

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,760
This dish.

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,520
May you be blessed with children soon.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,680
Ah.

31
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,890
You two masters,

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,440
please enjoy these dishes first.

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,300
I'll go prepare

34
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,840
the most important dish.

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,010
Shady business.

36
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,640
I'll go to the backyard to find Sara in a moment.

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,039
Then I'll do everything I can

38
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,800
to stall

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,039
Xiao Suzi.

40
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,000
Master.

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
This is

42
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,880
our final dish today.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,880
This is too abrupt.

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,010
How does this match?

45
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,000
It matches.

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,360
This is a perfect match.

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,240
This is Mr. Smith's surprise

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,960
for Mrs. Smith.

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,600
When Mrs. Smith was in her prime,

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,680
she chose him.

51
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,240
They've been through thick and thin together all these years.

52
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,840
But

53
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,240
they have one regret.

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
Mr. Smith owes Mrs. Smith

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,520
a proper

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,560
proposal.

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,880
Today.

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,840
Will you marry me today?

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,160
I do.

60
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,040
Kiss her!

61
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,360
Give her a kiss!

62
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,360
Kiss!

63
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,040
Louder!

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,320
Kiss!

65
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
Kiss her!

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,680
This is so embarrassing.

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,079
There are so many people here.

68
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,600
Boss,

69
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,540
wasn't this your request?

70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,700
You insisted on having this part.

71
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,200
Kiss her!

72
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,180
Give her a kiss.

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,560
But the girl has to

74
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,370
agree first.

75
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,940
I'm going to the restroom.

76
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,970
You're an outsider looking in.

77
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,440
The way she just kissed me twice,

78
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,420
do you think she has real feelings for me?

79
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,240
Sir,

80
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,760
what's between you two

81
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,040
how would I know?

82
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,330
Madam hasn't come back yet.

83
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,640
You've never been in love, have you?

84
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,880
Girls put on makeup.

85
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,680
It takes patience.

86
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,080
The usual.

87
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,520
Excuse me.

88
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,650
Sorry to bother you.

89
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,420
Come in.

90
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,600
May I ask

91
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,010
what can I do for you?

92
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,520
I just saw the waiter

93
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
put something in your drink.

94
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,610
I wanted to warn you.

95
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,840
Which waiter?

96
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,360
The one who

97
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,890
just served you your drink.

98
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,160
Are you sure

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
you saw him put something in my drink?

100
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,210
I'm certain.

101
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,980
You can check it yourself.

102
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,040
David.

103
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,840
Boss.

104
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,960
Get that waiter in here.

105
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,770
Yes, sir.

106
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,080
May I ask your name?

107
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,560
Jenny Smith.

108
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,320
Oh.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,360
You must be the one who reserved a private room today.

110
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,280
Mrs. Smith.

111
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,240
Nice to meet you.

112
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,560
Let me explain this to you.

113
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,240
If a girl gets angry,

114
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,680
No.

115
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,280
Bro.

116
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,840
I'm still at work.

117
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,680
Let me ask you.

118
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,159
If people with no feelings kiss,

119
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,409
will she feel anything?

120
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,370
We're not right for each other.

121
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,720
Go in.

122
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,040
Mrs. Smith,

123
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,040
is that him?

124
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,000
It's him.

125
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,800
Excuse me.

126
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,560
I have some personal matters to attend to.

127
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,220
Could you wait for me outside?

128
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,840
You put something in my drink.

129
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,650
Then this glass of wine,

130
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,880
you can drink it.

131
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,330
Take him away first.

132
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,760
Hello,

133
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,640
Mrs. Gu.

134
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,080
Last month's bills have all been completed.

135
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,010
I was just about to send them to you.

136
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,960
Don't worry.

137
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,960
Clean and tidy.

138
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,640
Thank you.

139
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,920
It's just a small misunderstanding.

140
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
The waiter added grapefruit juice.

141
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,080
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,360
I was being presumptuous.

143
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,620
There have been so many

144
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,080
news stories about girls getting drugged lately.

145
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,960
I was overthinking.

146
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,880
Sorry about that.

147
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,200
Please don't say that.

148
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,120
I should be the one thanking you.

149
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,840
As women,

150
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,680
we definitely need to look out for each other.

151
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm glad everything's fine.

152
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,320
Hello,

153
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,340
my name is Sara.

154
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,120
Jenny Smith.

155
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,760
To show my appreciation,

156
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,680
all expenses for you and your husband today

157
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,610
are on the house.

158
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,080
That's too kind.

159
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,440
Tonight,

160
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,980
may I invite you to dinner?

161
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,160
Um,

162
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,920
I should check my husband's schedule first.

163
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,160
I'd like to invite just you.

164
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,040
Ladies only.

165
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,410
A dinner between women.

166
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,920
Then I'll gladly accept.

167
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
See you tonight then.

168
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,960
See you tonight.

169
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,480
Bye-bye.

170
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,000
Bye.

171
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,480
This Sara can help Mrs. Gu manage the accounts.

172
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,400
Their relationship is indeed quite unusual.

173
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,160
I'm thinking

174
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,320
if we could investigate

175
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
that office area in their backyard.

176
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,880
We should be able to

177
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,210
find out what the Gu family is really up to.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,060
What are you doing?

179
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,400
Oh.

180
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,040
I'm thinking

181
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,520
the security system upstairs

182
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
is a bit too tight.

183
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,600
It's really

184
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,980
hard to break through.

185
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Then let me try

186
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,640
to get close to Sara.

187
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,280
Gain her trust

188
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,800
and see if you can

189
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,570
get any information out of her.

190
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,680
Hey.

191
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,160
That kiss today

192
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,600
was purely for work.

193
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,740
Don't take it personally.

194
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,250
Was it really just for work?

195
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,840
I knew it.

196
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,610
Stop fooling yourself.

197
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,360
You were so into it.

198
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,000
You think I couldn't tell?

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,800
Shut up.

200
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,360
But honey,

201
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,760
tonight

202
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,480
when you have dinner with Sara,

203
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:55,920
I

204
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
won't go with you.

205
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,490
Can you handle it alone?

206
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,800
To be honest,

207
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,840
it's a bit tricky.

208
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,400
My identity in front of her

209
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,530
is still Mrs. Smith.

210
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,360
I don't know how long this fake identity will hold up.

211
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,920
True.

212
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,960
You're not good at disguising your identity.

213
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,090
If you really can't think of anything,

214
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,680
honey,

215
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,480
think of me

216
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,060
and use my methods.

217
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,960
Ms. Lena.

218
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,920
Caiyun, something terrible happened.

219
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
Xiaotang is in trouble.

220
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,450
What happened to Xiaotang?

221
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,640
Oh my God.

222
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,360
Why do you have to pick on someone every day?

223
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
You keep targeting Gu Pengpeng.

224
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,080
Are you trying to make things difficult for me?

225
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,560
Pengpeng.

226
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,960
Let me apologize on behalf of Xiaotang.

227
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,890
If you're really upset,

228
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,880
here's what we'll do.

229
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,680
You can hit me.

230
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,880
I'll let you hit you however you want.

231
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,280
You don't have to do that.

232
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,680
Xiaotang didn't hit me.

233
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,840
I accidentally bumped into something myself.

234
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,920
Right, Xiaotang?

235
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,880
Hello, classmate.

236
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,720
I'm your new desk mate.

237
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,960
My name is Xiaorou.

238
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,520
Xiaorou,

239
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,560
you're so pretty.

240
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,520
Just call me Xiaotang.

241
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,540
We'll be good friends from now on.

242
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,420
Move aside.

243
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,680
Don't block the way.

244
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,720
Crybaby.

245
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,080
Haohao,

246
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
why are you so mean?

247
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,520
You're the real crybaby.

248
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,160
No,

249
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,540
you're just annoying.

250
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,640
I wasn't wrong.

251
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,040
She was in the class next door before,

252
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,900
always crying.

253
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,640
Just because she's adopted,

254
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,920
she's too fragile.

255
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,440
I know why she cries.

256
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,800
It's because of annoying people like you

257
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,080
always talking bad about her.

258
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,680
Whatever.

259
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,600
Don't you walk away.

260
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,730
You're so annoying.

261
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm going to beat you up today.

262
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,880
Stop fighting.

263
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,320
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,660
I hit the wrong person.

265
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,400
Are you okay?

266
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm fine.

267
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,360
So that's it.

268
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,460
In class today,

269
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,940
nothing happened.

270
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,880
I won't tell Butler Bai.

271
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,800
Thank you for your hard work.

272
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,220
Does it still hurt?

273
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,570
I'm not in pain anymore.

274
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,720
Really?

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,040
Really, it doesn't hurt at all.

276
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,040
Xiaotang.

277
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,760
Protecting your classmates is good.

278
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,840
But hitting people is wrong.

279
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,900
Do you understand?

280
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,860
Especially not Pengpeng.

281
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,040
I understand.

282
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,920
So if this happens again in the future,

283
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,760
what should you do?

284
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,120
Tell Teacher Laina.

285
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,360
That's right.

286
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,760
Xiaorou.

287
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,800
Where's your mom?

288
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,260
Has she come to pick you up?

289
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,920
She has.

290
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,400
That's my mom's car.

291
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,360
Xiaotang,

292
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,120
thank you for being my friend.

293
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,040
I'm going home now.

294
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,240
Goodbye, Xiaorou.

295
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,480
Goodbye, Xiaotang.

296
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,840
Goodbye, sir and ma'am.

297
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,480
Xiaorou,

298
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,360
that little girl who came out with you just now,

299
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,620
is she your classmate?

300
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,240
And those two people next to her,

301
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,480
are they her parents?

302
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,840
Yes.

303
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,120
What are her parents' names?

304
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,080
Do you know?

305
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,960
I don't know.

306
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,320
Hello.

307
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,290
Help me look up someone.

308
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,600
A student's parent.
