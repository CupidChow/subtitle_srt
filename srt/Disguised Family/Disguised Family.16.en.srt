1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,360
Within an hour,

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,640
in an hour.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,320
Otherwise,

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,520
I'll drain

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,680
your daughter's blood.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,320
Uncle, auntie.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,400
I'm full.

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,280
What are you doing?

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,480
Don't scare her.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,600
What do you think?

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,480
Take her to exchange daughters.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,280
Listen to me first.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,480
Let's take Xiaorou there first.

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,160
and pretend to be hostages.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,520
If Xiaotang is safe,

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
we'll fight back.

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,760
and bring back

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
back safely.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,840
It's too dangerous.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,280
We've seen

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,280
We've all seen them.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,200
It's not a threat to us.

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,400
What if you hurt the child?

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:01,880
No.

25
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,360
This is not the time to evaluate the risks.

26
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,440
We have no choice.

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,280
I know you can't

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,240
to Xiaorou.

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,560
It's okay.

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,600
I'll be the bad guy.

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,680
I'm sorry, Xiao Rou.

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,000
Uncle, auntie.

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,400
I have to send you home.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:51,840
Madam one.

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,640
She's here.

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,000
Xiaotang.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,360
Don't move.

38
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,320
Sara!

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,120
Give my daughter back to me.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,200
Don't worry.

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,240
Let Nam Chae-yun go.

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,880
Sugar.

43
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,600
Xiaotang.

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,840
Don't move.

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,240
Don't move.

46
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,640
I knew it.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,880
I know her best.

48
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,240
Do you really think

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,080
a stupid woman.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,240
If I were that stupid,

51
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
how could I

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,520
a family

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,080
to this day.

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,280
My brothers and brothers

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,880
died in an accident.

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,440
Do you really think it was an accident?

57
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,720
According to our agreement,

58
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,640
I’ll take care of them.

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,760
Do whatever you want with her.

60
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,520
Xiaorou, leave it to me.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,280
I can't keep

62
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,120
can't be kept.

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,240
But we have to

64
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,360
make good use of it.

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,840
You owe me another life.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
I don't care if you admit it or not.

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,600
I saved

68
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,680
was saved by me.

69
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,520
After I've taken care of the Gu family,

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,400
and complete the mission for you,

71
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,240
we can go back to Black Rock's days.

72
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,720
I can't live without you.

73
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,520
I can't live without you.

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,920
I'm going to see Mrs. Gu now.

75
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,840
Wait for me.

76
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,760
Madam.

77
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,920
Clean it up.

78
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,800
Don't waste a single drop.

79
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
It's enough for me to spend some time.

80
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,240
After I've drawn it into the sea,

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,120
Make it clean.

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,320
Okay.

83
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,520
You lost.

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,680
Mr. Gu and Mrs. Gu have arrived.

85
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,520
They are waiting for you in the room.

86
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,960
Are Mr. and Mrs. Gu here?

87
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,360
I just entered the room.

88
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,920
I've prepared the gift.

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,720
When are you taking me there?

90
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,440
No hurry.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,920
I have my own plan.

92
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,400
There's no time to lose.

93
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,600
What if they leave?

94
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
They just arrived.

95
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,960
I haven't even sat on my butt yet.

96
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,480
You're in a hurry to visit him.

97
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,440
It's too obvious.

98
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,960
It's annoying.

99
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,680
I'm just worried that something might go wrong.

100
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Which room are they in?

101
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,400
The world

102
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,200
is not as simple as you think.

103
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,120
This place is full of doors.

104
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,000
Listen to me.

105
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,760
Don't act on your own.

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,840
Ladies and gentlemen,

107
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,200
Welcome to

108
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,800
the charity dinner.

109
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,520
Next,

110
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,360
let’s give a big round of applause

111
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,000
to welcome the initiator of this dinner.

112
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,880
Miss Sala.

113
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,240
Welcome.

114
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,200
Hello, everyone.

115
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,440
I'm Sala.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,520
Actually,

117
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,920
I don't like to use charity.

118
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,760
Because charity

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,080
is always

120
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,000
high up

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It means charity.

122
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,280
If I have to name it again,

123
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,360
I'd rather call tonight's party

124
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,080
called

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,120
Love Gala.

126
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,440
Because the passing of love

127
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,520
is equal.

128
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,280
To improve the education

129
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,440
and orphans,

130
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,400
and medical environment.

131
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,320
I've decided

132
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,240
donate 10 million yuan

133
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,160
to Mantai Children's Fund

134
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,480
and education worth five million won.

135
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,760
and medical supplies.

136
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,559
You're so kind.

137
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,799
Kind?

138
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,880
Good people will be rewarded.

139
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,520
Thank you.

140
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,240
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

141
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,039
So kind.

142
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,720
Next,

143
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,200
let's watch

144
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,400
Ms. Sara.

145
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,000
[Video Video]

146
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,800
[Video]

147
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,280
Please.

148
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,840
My brothers and brothers

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,080
died in an accident.

150
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,520
Do you really think it was an accident?

151
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,520
Clean it up.

152
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't waste a single drop.

153
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,400
After draining it into the sea,

154
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,520
Make it clean.

155
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,160
So evil.

156
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,800
No way.

157
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,520
Stop filming.

158
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,440
Why are you so bad?

159
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

160
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,960
Stop filming.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

162
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,400
Calm down.

163
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,080
Stop filming!

164
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,680
Stop filming!

165
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,200
Stop filming.

166
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,000
Stop filming.

167
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,320
You're so cruel.

168
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
How dare you

169
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,040
How dare you show up here?

170
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,080
Don't you have a child?

171
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you have any humanity?

172
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,960
So evil.

173
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,360
Dear guests,

174
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,920
Stop filming.

175
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,680
We had an accident.

176
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,200
Stop filming.

177
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,680
Stop filming!

178
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Stop filming!

179
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,040
Stop filming!

180
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,240
Catch her.

181
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,640
Doesn't she need justice?

182
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,280
Sara.

183
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,800
You're under arrest for intentional murder.

184
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,640
Please come with us for investigation.

185
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,280
Detective.

186
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,880
I'm going to report Sara with my real name.

187
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,040
I want to be a stain witness.

188
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,200
You...

189
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,080
Take him away!

190
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,040
Stay away!

191
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,760
Stay away!

192
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,920
Let go of me!

193
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,880
Let go of me!

194
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,280
Let go of me!

195
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,240
Let go!

196
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,600
How did you...

197
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,280
We won't let your plan succeed.

198
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm sorry, Xiao Rou.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,760
Uncle, auntie.

200
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,120
I have to send you home.

201
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,240
Rou.

202
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,160
Rou.

203
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,440
You can't

204
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,000
you can't bring Sara to justice.

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,320
I have a good idea.

206
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,840
Here.

207
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,080
Rou.

208
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,400
It's not that your parents don't care about you.

209
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
but we need you.

210
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,480
to help us save Xiaotang.

211
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,200
Can you help us?

212
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,320
Come on.

213
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,880
Put this on.

214
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,600
Do you really think

215
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,160
a stupid woman.

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,360
My brothers and brothers

217
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,840
died in an accident.

218
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,560
Do you really think it was an accident?

219
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,720
Clean it up.

220
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,680
Don't waste a single drop.

221
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,840
It's enough for me to use for a while.

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,680
Okay.

223
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,040
After the smoke,

224
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,520
Make it clean.

225
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,560
Yes.

226
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,600
Xiaotang.

227
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,400
Xiaotang.

228
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,960
You planned this.

229
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,440
It's just a piece of cake.

230
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,800
You calculated yourself.

231
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,200
Nam Chae-yun.

232
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,600
Ms. Lena.

233
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,560
It's you.

234
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,000
Bai Haoqing.

235
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,080
The Swan Lake on the right side of Chengdu.

236
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,160
