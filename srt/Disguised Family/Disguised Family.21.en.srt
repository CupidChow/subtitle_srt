1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,360
Blackrock.

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,000
A-level bodyguard.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,720
Kevin.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,280
You're lucky.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,040
You're dying.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,240
My daughter found out

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
and survived.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,600
But

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,440
you're unfortunate.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,160
Because...

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,080
I'm Shirogui's boss.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,360
As you know,

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,480
Shirogane...

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,120
and Blackrock are enemies.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,600
Tell me.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,240
What should I do with you?

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,200
Blackrock wants to kill me.

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,080
And you saved my life.

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,040
From now on,

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,040
Kevin is gone.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,880
I am your man.

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,240
I'll do my best

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
to help Shirogane.

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,640
Surpass the rocks!

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:05,600
THE OF ART

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,800
Hello, honey.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,000
Honey.

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,240
Do you remember how my dad died?

29
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,960
It was just an accident.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,680
He trusted you

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,000
and put you in an important position.

32
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,320
In order to surpass Black Rock,

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,960
to surpass Black Rock.

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,039
Can I trust you again?

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,039
We are husband and wife.

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,880
Of course you can trust me.

37
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,600
Fine.

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,600
Let me tell you.

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,479
From the day my dad passed away,

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,720
I've hated Hei Shi so much.

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,280
Tell me.

42
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,120
Nam Chae-yun.

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,039
Is she from Hei Shi?

44
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,080
She's not.

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
I tried her.

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,800
She approached me

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,520
to fawn on our family.

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,400
Really?

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,400
Could it be your ex-lover?

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,440
[your old lover?]

51
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,240
Honey.

52
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,560
You know.

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,200
I hate Heirock as you do.

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,960
I won't let anyone

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,800
I won't let anyone off.

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,880
That's the best.

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,240
I don't want Peng to lose

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,160
whom I finally made.

59
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,280
Do you think

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,200
can I trust him again?

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,920
Madam.

62
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,960
Don't gamble on people's hearts.

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,280
You're right.

64
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,160
We can't let our guard down.

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,320
Keep an eye on Nam Chae-yun.

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,560
She made the kids

67
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,680
play hide-and-seek.

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,000
If she really works for Hei Shi,

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,880
she would take this opportunity

70
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,360
to do something.

71
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,280
Don't worry, Madam.

72
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,440
They want me to be a ghost.

73
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,160
I will

74
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,160
let them down.

75
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,320
The wrinkles of the door open are wrong.

76
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,000
The self-destruction procedure has been activated.

77
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,880
Don't.

78
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,800
No.

79
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,120
Honey.

80
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,400
Is something wrong?

81
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,640
Why isn't she replying?

82
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,280
Ms. Nan.

83
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,600
I got you.

84
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,320
Game.

85
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,240
Over.

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Mr. Baek.

87
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,440
Goodness.

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,120
I shouldn't have hidden it somewhere else.

89
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I lost the game.

90
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,360
there's no problem.

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,520
But fortunately,

92
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,640
you didn't hide in that room.

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,720
This house is special.

94
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,480
Except Mr. Gu and Mrs. Gu,

95
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,120
no one can

96
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,159
come out alive.

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,320
Those who go in

98
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,080
will be locked in the room.

99
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,760
As the temperature rises,

100
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,320
as the temperature rises.

101
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,000
Gosh.

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Ms. Nan.

103
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,120
Do you know

104
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,360
how long a person can live

105
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,480
in the temperature of 100 degrees?

106
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,680
How long?

107
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,320
At most.

108
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,080
eight minutes.

109
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,240
Ms. Nan.

110
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,680
Let's go.

111
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,400
Well,

112
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,960
I'll go back to the dinner hall by myself.

113
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,520
I won't hold you up from catching others.

114
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,640
The others

115
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,880
have been caught.

116
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,880
Did you catch my husband too?

117
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,600
He's inside.

118
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,480
I'm just kidding.

119
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,960
I'm afraid

120
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,760
to joke about this.

121
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,800
Don't worry.

122
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,280
This house

123
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,480
has a password.

124
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,360
Ordinary people can't get in.

125
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,520
If someone has to go in,

126
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,800
you're looking for death.

127
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,840
I thought too much.

128
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,080
Let's go, Ms. Nan.

129
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
I'm a ghost.

130
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,280
I abide by the rules of the game.

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,159
I will catch

132
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,080
I have to

133
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,159
in person.

134
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,080
Okay.

135
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,760
Lead the way.

136
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,440
Ms. Nan.

137
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,120
Please.

138
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,600
You're not cruel enough.

139
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,240
A housewife

140
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,160
doesn't prepare tools for murder.

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,720
Why not?

142
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,400
What grade are you in Hei Shi?

143
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,560
You can deal with the Gu family.

144
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,480
and White Water.

145
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,760
at least an A.

146
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,560
That's because the highest standard

147
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,480
Only A

148
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,440
Young-joon

149
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Young-joon

150
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Young-joon

151
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,400
Young-joon!

152
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,920
Wake up.

153
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,680
You can't die.

154
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,240
You can't leave me alone.

155
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,000
You promised me

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,200
you would retire with me.

157
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,280
and raise sugar together.

158
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,240
Are you crying?

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,320
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

160
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,320
I thought you were dead.

161
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,440
Soon.

162
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,480
Almost.

163
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,200
I saw the Bridge of Helpless.

164
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
You called me back.

165
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,720
Let's go.

166
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,400
I told Hei Shi to pick us up.

167
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,960
Jason asked us to go to the side door.

168
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,160
Honey.

169
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,760
Xiaotang.

170
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,680
You forgot about Xiaotang.

171
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,400
Of course.

172
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,720
I have her watch location.

173
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,720
Don't let Butler Bai find out.

174
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,200
Don't worry, Peng Peng.

175
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
We hide here.

176
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,160
the adults would never expect

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,840
It's been half an hour.

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,160
How long do we have to wait to win?

179
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Don't worry.

180
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,320
Wait for the whistle

181
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,120
we'll win.

182
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,560
Go over there.

183
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,160
Find him.

184
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,400
Let's go.

185
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,280
Xiaotang.

186
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,920
Hush.

187
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,840
Mom.

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,640
Xiao Tang.

189
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,600
Now the game has been upgraded.

190
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,080
not only to avoid Steward Bai,

191
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,280
but also leave this yard.

192
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,440
Can you do it?

193
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,200
Uncle.

194
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,800
Auntie.

195
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,600
Are you leaving my house?

196
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,600
Yes.

197
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,560
Sorry, Peng.

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,800
Because this game

199
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,600
is assigned to the three of us.

200
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,440
So,

201
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,360
we can't take you away.

202
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,400
It's okay.

203
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,960
I just want to tell you

204
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,400
I have a way to leave.

205
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,960
Where?

206
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,160
Over there.

207
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,000
Take us there.

208
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,160
Let's go.

209
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:43,840
Yes.

210
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,440
This is it.

211
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,480
Can it reach outside?

212
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,120
I crawled out.

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,600
But...

214
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,200
The size of this hole

215
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,560
is enough for Xiaotang to go out alone.

216
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,920
It's too late.

217
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,760
Xiaotang.

218
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,600
You go out first.

219
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,320
What about your parents?

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,400
Xiaotang.

221
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,840
Go out and hide.

222
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,760
Your friends will come to pick you up.

223
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,280
No.

224
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,120
I want to be with my parents.

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,560
Xiaotang.

226
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,960
Listen to me.

227
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,640
If all three of us get caught,

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
this game is over.

229
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,360
You crawl out first.

230
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,360
In this way,

231
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,040
my mom and I have a chance

232
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,760
right?

233
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,200
Xiaotang is the bravest.

234
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,480
You can do it alone.

235
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,200
right?

236
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,160
Yes.

237
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,280
As long as you promise not to abandon me,

238
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,520
I can do it.

239
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,800
Okay.

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,760
We promise you.

241
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,800
Uncle.

242
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,360
Auntie.

243
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,360
How about I go out with Xiaotang?

244
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,160
Honey.

245
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,800
No.

246
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,200
People outside don't like Peng Peng.

247
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,840
The child is innocent.

248
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,200
You're right.

249
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,120
Over there.

250
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,440
Sugar.

251
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,600
Take it.

252
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Xiaotang, don't be afraid.

253
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,400
Squat down.

254
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,000
Don't be afraid.

255
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,280
Slow down.

256
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,480
Slow down.

257
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,680
Peng.

258
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,720
Let me hug you, okay?

259
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,520
Don't touch him.

260
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,680
My daughter is safe.

261
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,800
I'll let him go.

262
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,400
The Class A of Blackrock

263
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,720
That's all.

264
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,720
Steward Bai.

265
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,920
Same to you.

266
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,000
Mr. Gu.

267
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,600
The little girl ran away.

268
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,400
Go after her.

269
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,600
Mr. Gu.

270
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,600
Don’t chase them.

271
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,200
The young master is still in their hands.

272
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,600
He must have put the list

273
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,920
on his daughter.

274
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,960
Go after her.

275
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,840
Let me remind you.

276
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,640
If anything happens to my daughter,

277
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,440
I can do anything.

278
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,720
Sniper.

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,360
Nam Chae-yun.

280
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,560
