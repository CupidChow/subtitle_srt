1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,880
Thailand

2
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,040
Hit me harder!

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,040
Here comes your

4
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,600
YoUгу

5
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,180
Where's my money?

6
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,920
Not true

7
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,040
There has been no twenties

8
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,980
I'm a seducer

9
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,980
I'm a seducer

10
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,580
I'm a severe capacities

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Come on, baby.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Zuo Han, be careful with your bike.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I got you.

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What are you doing?

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is my color pen.

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I didn't say that I was going to use it.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I put it here last time.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll take it back to my room.

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Get out.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Those toys are mine.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What are you doing?

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll give you all the toys.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You and I will ride the bike.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't bother me.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Just open it.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Please.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Open it.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let go of me.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll give it back to you.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Brother.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Why are you saying goodbye?

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I told Xiao Jie that

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
she should cherish every time she sees you.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Xiao Jie is so good.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Xiao Jie, good luck.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Thank you.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Can you bring your earphones?

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't have them.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Jiano, have you eaten?

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm so hungry.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Where is the kid?

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't know. I saw him.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Look, he's getting up slowly.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,020
You should go to the

48
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,020
restaurant and eat.

49
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,020
You're so handsome.

50
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,020
I don't want to be a bad kid.

51
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,020
Don't be so stubborn.

52
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,020
I'm just scared of you.

53
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,020
I don't want to be a bad kid.

54
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,020
I don't want to be a bad kid.

55
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,020
I'm just a kid.

56
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,020
I'm just a kid.

57
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,020
Okay, you can open the door.

58
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,020
Open the door.

59
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,020
You don't have to open the door.

60
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,040
What are you doing?

61
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Are you getting bigger?

62
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Are you sure?

63
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Are you sure?

64
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Oh, I see.

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,040
I'm a little tired.

66
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Xiao Heng.

67
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Luo Heng.

68
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Xiao Heng.

69
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Uncle, did you see Xiao Heng?

70
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
No.

71
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Your son is three years old.

72
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Everyone is missing.

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
He's getting older.

74
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,060
Xiao Heng.

75
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,060
Dad.

76
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
What are you doing?

77
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,060
You're not going to find your husband.

78
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,060
Come and eat.

79
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,060
Dad, I'll take you.

80
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,060
Take me?

81
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,060
You're going to take off my shirt?

82
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,060
Come on, take this.

83
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,060
You're so naughty.

84
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,060
Dr. Wen, Mom told me to buy your lunch.

85
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
You want chicken drumsticks?

86
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,060
Whatever.

87
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
Dr. Wen,

88
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
can you play Santa Claus on Christmas?

89
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
No.

90
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
But Dr. Wang plays it every year.

91
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
If you don't want it,

92
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,080
there won't be Santa Claus this year.

93
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
No.

94
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
Why did he stop playing for so long?

95
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
I don't know.

96
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Hello?

97
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Mom, where are you?

98
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
I'm so hungry.

99
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Okay.

100
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
Okay.

101
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Jiao Luo.

102
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Okay, bye.

103
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
It's hot.

104
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
It's hot.

105
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Come here.

106
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Jiao Luo, are you okay?

107
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
I'm fine.

108
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
I'm fine.

109
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
I'm fine.

110
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
I'm fine.

111
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm fine.

112
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
I'm fine.

113
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Your dad is so funny.

114
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
He always hugs you.

115
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,100
We made a deal.

116
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
We hug each other every time we meet.

117
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
You can tell me when you're done.

118
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Li Jia Nong.

119
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,100
Your attending doctor, Dr. Wang,

120
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
passed away last week.

121
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,100
You should know that.

122
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,100
I'm your attending doctor.

123
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
Jia Nong.

124
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Jia Nong.

125
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Jia Nong.

126
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Sorry.

127
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
The price of Dr. Wang and him is better than mine.

128
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Give him some more time.

129
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
Jia Nong.

130
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Let go.

131
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Let go.

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Let go.

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
You're so annoying.

134
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
I didn't remember you were so angry.

135
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
You shouldn't be so annoying.

136
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
You're so annoying.

137
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
I'm not.

138
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
I'm not.

139
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
Thank you.

140
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
Don't play.

141
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
Hurry up.

142
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,140
Take a shower.

143
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,140
Hey, girl.

144
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
What?

145
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,140
You brought the old man back.

146
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,140
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,140
Don't be sorry.

148
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,140
The vegetable soup is so sorry.

149
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,140
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,140
Look at him.

151
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,140
Hurry up.

152
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,140
You have to eat it even if you have a sore throat.

153
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,140
I've already bought porridge for you downstairs.

154
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,140
I bought it.

155
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,140
It's convenient to buy it.

156
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,140
I'll feed you.

157
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
Hurry up.

158
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,140
Siyuan, eat up.

159
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
I'll buy you porridge after you finish eating.

160
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
Don't blame him.

161
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
He's been playing with the chicken breast.

162
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Is he going to tell his mother-in-law?

163
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Don't bother.

164
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
You can just watch the chicken breast.

165
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
It's a fire.

166
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
It's not a fire.

167
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Siyuan, come here.

168
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,180
Come on.

169
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,180
You're going to take the toy car?

170
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,180
Why did you bring your bag?

171
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,180
Are you done?

172
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,180
Your name is Xia Wen Nuan?

173
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,180
Cool.

174
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,180
It's warm.

175
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,180
Cool is the first thing that makes you cold.

176
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,180
It's not that cold.

177
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,180
Doctor, you're still here?

178
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,180
Jiang Nong is fine.

179
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,180
He said he couldn't eat.

180
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,180
He'll come back later.

181
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,180
You're called Wen Nuan?

182
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,180
So cool, man.

183
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,180
Doctor, eat it yourself.

184
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,180
I'm waiting for his family.

185
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,180
Are you waiting for my mom?

186
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,180
Just tell me if you need anything.

187
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,180
I'll tell her.

188
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,180
You're only 16 years older than her.

189
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,180
Tell your mom that I'm...

190
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,180
Don't be so angry.

192
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,180
Are you hungry?

193
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,180
I'll go get you some food.

194
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,180
Wen Nuan.

195
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,180
Wen Nuan is looking for you.

196
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,180
I'm her doctor now.

197
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,180
If you ever...

198
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,180
Wen Nuan.

199
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,180
What kind of bento are you buying?

200
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,180
Why do you smell like poop?

201
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,180
Nothing.

202
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,180
I work in the zoo.

203
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
So I can't smell it.

204
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,180
I'm sorry. I have disinfectant.

205
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,180
Mom.

206
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,180
That bag.

207
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,180
It's really poop.

208
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,180
I'll go wash it.

209
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,180
I'm going to pee.

210
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,180
Here, I'll get the medicine.

211
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,180
Hold on.

212
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,180
Hello, Jiao Peng.

213
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Mom.

214
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,180
Your little chicken is out.

215
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,180
What's up?

216
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,180
Mom, Dad.

217
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,180
Someone's going to love you.

218
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,180
Mom, I can't hold you.

219
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,180
You're holding me like this.

220
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,180
Let me hold you.

221
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,180
It's dangerous.

222
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,180
You can't hold me.

223
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Come on.

224
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Help me hold this.

225
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Let's eat.

226
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Mom, look.

227
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm already practicing.

228
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
This is the video the teacher sent me this morning.

229
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Brother.

230
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Let's eat first.

232
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
You're not in the competition for a while.

233
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Why do you have to practice now?

234
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
But I feel very uncomfortable after a while.

235
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I can't practice.

236
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Then you have to work hard.

237
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,220
Mom, when is sister going to have a baby?

238
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,220
At the end of the month.

239
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,220
But mom will take care of her.

240
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,220
A-Kong will be very busy.

241
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,220
But I'll come every day.

242
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,220
And I'll sleep with you at night.

243
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,220
Don't worry about me.

244
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,220
Take care of sister.

245
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Don't rush to come.

246
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,220
No.

247
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,220
I'll worry about you.

248
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,220
I just want to take care of you.

249
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,220
Why are you calling me mom?

250
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,220
I'm your mom.

251
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,220
You're so young to be a romantic.

252
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,220
I'm 38 years old.

253
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,220
I'm 51 years old.

254
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
I'm a double-double.

255
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,220
What is a double-double?

256
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,220
I have two children at once.

257
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,220
Jialong is my sister.

258
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,220
And I have a twin brother.

259
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,220
When did we first come in?

260
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,220
And we saw that little boy.

261
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,220
He's very handsome.

262
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,220
No.

263
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220
It's a legend.

264
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,220
We had a band at once.

265
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,220
I'm a little horn player.

266
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
Mom is a violin player.

267
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
Brother is a drum player.

268
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,220
Jialong is a guitar player.

269
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
He can play any instrument.

270
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
You can change it.

271
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
No problem.

272
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
So great.

273
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Is this that?

274
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Show us.

275
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Uncle.

276
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Stop it.

277
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Uncle is not a guitar player.

278
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Uncle.

279
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
We need money to perform.

280
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
You're so mean.

281
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
You can't say that.

282
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
You should take the guitar back.

283
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,260
I won't touch it anyway.

284
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Don't say that.

285
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
This is a hospital.

286
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,260
You're not the only patient here.

287
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,260
It's okay.

288
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
It's okay.

289
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,260
Mom, I'll live with all my strength.

290
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,260
I'll live with all my strength.

291
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,260
Mom.

292
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,260
You don't want to smoke?

293
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Give me one.

294
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,260
I'll do it.

295
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Chocolate flavor?

296
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,260
Great.

297
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,260
You're not ugly when you smoke.

298
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
Mom.

299
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,260
That kid wants to live.

300
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,260
He wants to die.

301
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
That's great.

302
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
People are all here.

303
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,260
Boy,

304
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,260
here's your favorite chicken rice noodle for lunch.

305
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,240
We need ice cream tomorrow for lunch.

306
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Come on in!

307
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Welcome!

308
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Nice!

309
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
You can order now!

310
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Come on in!

311
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Come on in!

312
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Come on in!

313
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
It's like an audio!

314
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Come on!

315
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Come on!

316
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Come on!

317
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
Come on!

318
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Come on!

319
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
The piano is right next to you.

320
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
You can play it if you want.

321
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,240
I found it when I was sorting out Dr. Wang's seat.

322
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
This is the last one.

323
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Thank you.

324
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
Listen,

325
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
if you have no temperature in your mouth,

326
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,240
you only have a phone in your pocket.

327
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,240
So you have to be grateful.

328
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Eat it slowly, okay?

329
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
It's so nice to die suddenly.

330
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Come on!

331
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Jian-long,

332
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
can you play the role of Dr. Wang's husband

333
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,240
on behalf of Dr. Wang on Christmas?

334
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
No.

335
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,240
But Dr. Wang plays the role of Dr. Wang's husband every year.

336
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Okay.

337
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,240
Let's see if I can live until then.

338
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
You're so funny.

339
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
This is my greatest achievement.

340
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Good job!

341
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Give him a big hand!

342
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Good job!

343
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,240
You're so funny!

344
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
You're so funny!

345
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Good job!

346
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Okay, okay, okay.

347
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
I'll sing a song that everyone will sing.

348
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Okay!

349
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,240
L-O-V-E

350
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
L-O-V-E

351
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,240
L-O-V-E

352
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
L-O-V-E

353
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,240
L-O-V-E

354
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
L-O-V-E

355
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
L-O-V-E

356
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Hey you!

357
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Oh yeah!

358
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
I'm so happy today!

359
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
You're my best friend!

360
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
I'm so happy today!

361
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
I'm so happy today!

362
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
I love you more!

363
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,240
I love you more!

364
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,240
L-O-V-E

365
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
L-O-V-E

366
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
Yeah

367
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
You are the sun

368
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
The snow is growing

369
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
We don't seem to have a day off

370
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
The sun is shining

371
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:37,720
The sound of the

372
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,720
I have to convince customers to buy me insurance every day

373
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
I have to beg for a sick meal

374
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
I have to fight with the ex-husband who has to meet every day with the bride and groom

375
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Siyuan is going to have an operation

376
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Open the door

377
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
The bride and groom are fighting against each other

378
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I'm not going to do it for him.

379
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
Which idiot?

380
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
This one.

381
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Why do you have to be alone?

382
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Didn't you tell him to separate the big and small?

383
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
I'm sorry.

384
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I know you're not going to do it.

385
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Doctor.

386
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Xiao Yang.

387
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Jiang Hao, get up.

388
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
I can't do it.

389
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Calm down.

390
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Yeah, I, I, I'm G.

391
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Happy, I, I'm G.

392
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
The stars are like mountains,

393
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
one and the same.

394
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Yeah, I, I, I'm G.

395
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Change, I, I'm G.

396
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Changed.

397
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
The dusk is coming.

398
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,200
The heart is beating.

399
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
The dusk is coming.

400
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,200
The dusk is coming.

401
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
The dusk is coming.

402
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Xiao Jie.

403
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Xiao Jie, I'm calling you.

404
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
What's wrong?

405
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Miss Wang has a bad breath.

406
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
And I just touched her and her temperature was very high.

407
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I'll go over now.

408
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Okay.

409
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
It's so hot.

410
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Xiao Jie.

411
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Xiao Jie.

412
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Xiao Jie.

413
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Xiao Jie.

414
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
It looks a bit bad.

415
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
I'll get two blood pressure tests first.

416
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Wait a minute.

417
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Okay.

418
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Doctor, this is room 8071, Miss Wang.

419
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Look at me.

420
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
She's looking at the blood pressure.

421
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
It's a bit bad.

422
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Okay.

423
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Okay.

424
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Xiao Jie.

425
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Xiao Jie.

426
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Xiao Jie, the blood pressure is 82 over 56.

427
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
The temperature is 39.8.

428
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
It's 140 degrees.

429
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
The breathing is 40.

430
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
There's a rash in the breathing.

431
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Get oxygen first.

432
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
And then prepare for normal cellulose and maxillofibrosis.

433
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Okay.

434
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Xiao Jie.

435
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Excuse me, the situation is...

436
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Excuse me, wait a minute.

437
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Xiao Jie.

438
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Xiao Jie.

439
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Xiao Jie.

440
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
I'll call the ICU.

441
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Okay, please wait a minute.

442
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Xiao Jie.

443
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Mom.

444
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Mom.

445
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Okay, I'll go get oxygen.

446
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
I'll go get oxygen.

447
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Don't worry, Mom.

448
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
It's okay.

449
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
It's okay.

450
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Contact the office and call the NPS.

451
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Okay, no problem.

452
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Hurry up.

453
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Get up.

454
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Get up.

455
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Okay, let's go.

456
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Push.

457
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Be careful.

458
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Hello, I'm Anderson.

459
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Miss Wang, she just said she's going to the ICU.

460
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I'll be right back.

461
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Kill them.

462
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Kill them.

463
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Xiao Jie.

464
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Xiao Jie.

465
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Xiao Jie.

466
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Be careful.

467
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Do you know what Xiao Jie told me when he first installed the NPS?

468
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
He told me, Xiao Zhen, Xiao Zhen, look.

469
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
This is my voice-over button.

470
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
I just have to press it.

471
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
I can turn into Iron Man.

472
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,200
When the devil comes, I can save the world.

473
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
So you like Iron Man.

474
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Yes.

475
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
What do you like?

476
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
I like Handsome Girl.

477
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
You like Handsome Girl?

478
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,200
I want to take Handsome Girl to save the world.

479
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Can Handsome Girl save the world?

480
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Yes.

481
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Okay, get ready.

482
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Okay, breathe.

483
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Look at Mom.

484
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
It won't hurt.

485
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
It won't hurt.

486
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
It won't hurt.

487
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Xiao Jie.

488
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Mom.

489
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Xiao Jie said he pressed this button here.

490
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
He can turn into Iron Man to save the world.

491
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,200
So he doesn't press the button anymore.

492
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Xiao Jie said he was jealous of us.

493
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
He had his family to accompany him when we slept at night.

494
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
My mom even said she would buy ice cream for him for lunch.

495
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
What about his mom?

496
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Xiao Jie is a child of evil.

497
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
He has to take care of his mom.

498
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,200
But I also heard that he deliberately called his mom Mom.

499
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Have you ever heard him cry in the middle of the night?

500
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I've finished drawing.

501
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Xiao Jie is dead.

502
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Why did you give him the ice cream?

503
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
I gave it to him.

504
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,200
If you give him the ice cream, he'll become a milky way.

505
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
It's okay. My dad is very familiar with this game.

506
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Hey, don't tell me you're wrong.

507
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
She's taken all of yours too.

508
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,200
What's this about? A fair good love is showing through.

509
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,200
We've lost romance. This world is turns us safe.

510
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,200
This C.O. has released a new case of osteosarcoma.

511
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Did you see that?

512
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Their survival rate is so clear.

513
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Look, you can't even answer such a simple question.

514
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
How can I trust you?

515
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
It seems that you have done a lot of homework for today.

516
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
What do you mean?

517
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Everyone has a different place to go.

518
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
The number of cases is too small.

519
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
The statistics are meaningless.

520
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
We're the doctors of the morning.

521
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
You told me to wait until now.

522
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
You told me the number of cases is too small.

523
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
I'm also a doctor.

524
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
You're a doctor.

525
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
I'm a child.

526
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Yes.

527
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
But the one who's sick is my son, not your son.

528
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Can I go to the ward first?

529
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
816.

530
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Find yourself a bed you like.

531
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Da Shan.

532
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Da Shan.

533
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Da Shan.

534
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
We're not sure if we should stay here.

535
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Mr. Kang.

536
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,200
There is no medicine in this world that is 100% effective on patients.

537
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,200
But Da Shan's condition has been changing so fast.

538
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,200
It has been affecting the blood vessels and nerves.

539
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
We've discussed it with the stocks.

540
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
We'll start with this medicine.

541
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
It's decided.

542
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Thank you for your help.

543
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Thank you.

544
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Thank you.

545
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Thank you.

546
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
I'm sorry.

547
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Thank you.

548
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Darling.

549
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
You've become taller and more handsome.

550
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Come back and see me.

551
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
You're really crazy.

552
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Is it this hand?

553
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Where is 816?

554
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Turn left from the front.

555
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
The last one.

556
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Then...

557
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
What's wrong?

558
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
I think I'm faster from here.

559
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Really?

560
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
I think so.

561
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:13,120
I'm thinking of giving you a

562
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
free kick.

563
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
A free kick is good.

564
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
It's good to have a good feeling.

565
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
It's good to be able to do it.

566
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Come.

567
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
I'll take it.

568
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
If you want to wash your hair,

569
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
you can wash your face with a facial cleanser.

570
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
You can wash it.

571
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Or you can wash it with a facial cleanser.

572
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
You're talking nonsense.

573
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
It's not washing your hair.

574
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
You want to wash your hair?

575
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
No.

576
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
They say you can wash it.

577
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
If you don't have hair, why do you use a facial cleanser?

578
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
It's also a head.

579
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Look at this hair.

580
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
It's so clean.

581
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
It's a little bit dirty.

582
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
It's not a mess.

583
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
You're so good at it.

584
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
I feel great when I'm done.

585
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
What are you talking about?

586
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
I'm talking about my hair.

587
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
I'm going to the toilet.

588
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
I'm not talking about your hair.

589
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
I'm here to inform you.

590
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Tomorrow, the stairs next to your ward will be renovated.

591
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
You will be in a fight with another ward.

592
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
So this afternoon,

593
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
I want you to move to 816.

594
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Do you have a four-bedroom in your ward?

595
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
That's the big ward that was left behind

596
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
before the plan was changed.

597
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
So it's a six-bedroom.

598
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
Awesome.

599
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Two people in a room,

600
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
and now a six-bedroom.

601
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
You're helping him?

602
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Sorry, I was impulsive.

603
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Don't worry.

604
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
There are two bathrooms in the ward.

605
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,200
And my colleague has moved all the equipment out.

606
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Auntie has also cleaned up the place.

607
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Just now,

608
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
a child has moved in.

609
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
So you guys quickly pack up your things

610
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
and move to the ward this afternoon.

611
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Is that okay?

612
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Be happy.

613
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
Don't be so rude, princess.

614
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
You're so rude.

615
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Mom, this room is so big.

616
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Look, I can even run here.

617
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Be careful.

618
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Don't fall.

619
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Bye-bye, our house is so big.

620
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,200
What's wrong, Mom?

621
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
What happened?

622
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
Let me see.

623
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Hey, wondering,

624
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,200
I'm sitting here.

625
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Let's eat.

626
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Come on, let's eat.

627
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
We're out of money.

628
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
You're so young.

629
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm not feeling well, I want to go out.

630
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
You want to go out?

631
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
I think it's after the cold.

632
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
I'll do it.

633
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Sorry.

634
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
It's okay.

635
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
I'll help you.

636
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

637
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Let's go.

638
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

639
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Let's go.

640
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Go.

641
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
I'm a little bit of a bad kid

642
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
I'm a little bit of a bad kid

643
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
But I got the bad kid

644
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
It's a you and me

645
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Bad kid, angel, darling, bad kid

646
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Living out of the city

647
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
With the girl and me

648
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Why don't you choose the middle?

649
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Turn around.

650
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
Which one do you want?

651
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
She likes the middle.

652
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Is this the right place?

653
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Why do you want to be hospitalized?

654
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Welcome to the hospital.

655
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Please come in.

656
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Why are you still here?

657
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Be careful.

658
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
You and your parents

659
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,200
You can choose which bed you want to be in.

660
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
My colleagues

661
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,200
will send you the record to the hospital.

662
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
You want to sleep here too?

663
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Come.

664
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
What are you doing?

665
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
What are you doing?

666
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
You're a watchman.

667
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Luo He.

668
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
You're so annoying.

669
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Let's go to this bed.

670
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
I'll put the things here.

671
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Are you okay?

672
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
I almost forgot.

673
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Thank you.

674
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
I'll be back in three days.

675
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,200
Hello, this is your parents.

676
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Both sides are gods.

677
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
I want to pay my respects to my other gods.

678
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Please put the tray in the sink.

679
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
Thank you.

680
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
The harvest will be in the morning.

681
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
The harvest is expected to be in December.

682
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Thank you for your cooperation.

683
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Maogong, take the tray.

684
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Kang.

685
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Our children's ward, single room, double room, and three room are all full.

686
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,200
816 ward, thank you for your cooperation.

687
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Thank you.

688
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Mom.

689
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Mom.

690
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Mom.

691
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Mom.

692
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Why do you keep calling me Mom?

693
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Mom.

694
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Mom.

695
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Mom.

696
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Mom's son is back.

697
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
I'm scared.

698
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
I can also call you Dad.

699
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
I'll take you to the game room.

700
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Call me Dad.

701
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
I'll be the robot.

702
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
What's so funny?

703
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
I'm just kidding.

704
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
You're not a mother.

705
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Be quiet.

706
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Okay.

707
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm listening.

708
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
What's so funny?

709
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
You're going to the game room to eat?

710
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Yes.

711
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,200
I'm going to the game room.

712
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Just chatting.

713
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
No.

714
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm going to the game room.

715
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
No.

716
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
You're a bad girl.

717
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
You're a bad girl.

718
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
No.

719
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
I just want to be your friend.

720
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
I'm going to the game room.

721
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
I want to vomit.

722
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Do you want to vomit now?

723
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Go to the bathroom.

724
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Come on.

725
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Okay.

726
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
There's no light in here.

727
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Don't move.

728
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
There's someone there.

729
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
There's someone there.

730
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Come on.

731
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
What are you doing?

732
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Don't be a bad girl.

733
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
What?

734
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Don't touch me.

735
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Wait.

736
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Hurry up.

737
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Wait.

738
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Don't laugh.

739
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Wait.

740
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
My waist.

741
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
My waist.

742
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
My waist.

743
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Mom.

744
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Mom.

745
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Mom.

746
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Mom.

747
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Mom.

748
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Mom.

749
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Mom.

750
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Go.

751
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Go.

752
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
I'm going to the bathroom.

753
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Don't be a bad girl.

754
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
No.

755
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
No.

756
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
No.

757
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
No.

758
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Go.

759

Is it okay?

915
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
Oh, it's a pencil.

916
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,340
I thought it was tape.

917
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,340
I want to see it.

918
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,340

922
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,340
How old am I?

923
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,340
I'll hug you.

924
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,340
Go get a chair.

925
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,340
Open.

926
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,340
Okay, okay.

927
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,340
Slowly.

928
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
Okay, okay.

929
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
Be careful.

930
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,340
Come on, try it.

931
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,340
Siyu, why are your eyes getting worse?

932
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,340
Does Dr. Wu know?

933
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,340
I know.

934
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,340
I want to see it.

935
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,340
I want to see it.

936
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,340
I want to see it.

937
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,340
I think it must be because this pen is big.

938
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,340
So the doctor wrote B.

939
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,340
B is big.

940
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,340
I'll drive a big car.

941
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,340
Mom, can you close the door?

942
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,340
No, I want to hear them talk.

943
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,340
But I think this is painted by a patient's parents.

944
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,340
Doctor, it's impossible.

945
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,340
If it's painted by a patient's family,

946
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,340
it should be wiped off.

947
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,340
Yanyan, your head is so round and beautiful.

948
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,340
Yanyan, what do you think?

949
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,340
I think it's painted by the children living here.

950
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,340
It's painted when they're sick or sick.

951
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,340
Correct.

952
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,340
It's written by a child who's in a hospital.

953
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,340
I heard that he's a very rich entrepreneur.

954
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,340
Mom.

955
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,340
We're the happiest in the world.

956
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,340
We have two moms.

957
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,340
I'm so happy.

958
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,340
I have two moms.

959
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,340
I'm so jealous.

960
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,340
Mom.

961
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,340
Ten years ago, when the hospital was under construction,

962
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,340
Dr. Wang asked us to keep this place.

963
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,340
Yanyan.

964
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,340
This is a gift for you.

965
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,340
Wow, it's red. I like red.

966
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,340
Mom, I like red, too.

967
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,340
I like red, too.

968
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,340
Ro-Han, you're not a girl.

969
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,340
Why can't boys like red?

970
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,340
Why can't boys like red?

971
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,340
I like red.

972
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,340
Of course boys can like red.

973
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,340
Mr. Jian, I like you.

974
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,340
So cute.

975
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,340
I mean, Jian is very lucky.

976
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,340
He's lucky because he's sick?

977
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,340
No, Jian is lucky because he has King Dizhang and Jesus.

978
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,340
Ladies and gentlemen.

979
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Yanyan is so beautiful.

980
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,340
Wow, Yanyan, you're so clean and beautiful.

981
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,340
Sister Jiang Rong gave you red hair.

982
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,340
You should wear a red hat when you're good.

983
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,340
If you want to be bad, wear red hair.

984
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,340
Grandma, I like you.

985
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,340
Yanyan, you can't see clearly.

986
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,340
Thank you.

987
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,340
Grandma, I like your job.

988
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,340
It's great to be with mom's animals every day.

989
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,340
Mom doesn't let me raise dogs.

990
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,340
I have two dogs.

991
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,340
If I let them down, my breath will be affected.

992
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,340
My sister is going to the zoo to give birth to a baby.

993
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,340
Let's go to the zoo together.

994
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:55,340
Why is your sister going to the zoo to give birth to a baby?

995
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,340
Because Yanyan's sister lives in the zoo.

996
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,340
She's a red-haired star.

997
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,340
Red-haired star?

998
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,340
And her name is Man-Niu.

999
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,340
Man-Niu?

1000
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,340
When Man-Niu was a baby,

1001
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,340
she was pregnant with her aunt.

1002
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,340
Yuanyuan was pregnant with her aunt.

1003
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,340
Man-Niu was born not long ago.

1004
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:22,340
Yuanyuan was also born in the zoo.

1005
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,340
So Man-Niu is Yuanyuan's sister.

1006
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,340
Yes.

1007
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,340
I thought you were a few years old.

1008
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,340
Why do you have a daughter who wants to have a baby?

1009
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,340
Yuanyuan lives in the zoo.

1010
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,340
She's so good.

1011
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,340
Yanyan, I like you.

1012
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,340
What kind of girl do you like?

1013
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,340
I like the girl I like very much.

1014
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,340
I like you very much.

1015
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,340
I like you, Luna.

1016
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,340
Why are you so sudden?

1017
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,340
Your room is so messy.

1018
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,340
I have to go back to work.

1019
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,340
Mom.

1020
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,340
Little girl.

1021
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,340
Dad, I can't stand your age.

1022
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,340
No, I can't.

1023
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,340
I don't want to listen.

1024
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,340
Yuanyuan, go to the zoo.

1025
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,340
Little girl.

1026
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,340
I can't stand it.

1027
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,340
I can't stand it.

1028
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,340
I just want to ask her.

1029
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,340
Which successful entrepreneur is this kid who wrote the BNG?

1030
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,340
Let's go.

1031
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,340
I like the sound.

1032
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,340
I want to go home.

1033
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,340
I want to go to the zoo.

1034
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,340
Dad, where's mom?

1035
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,340
Which mom are you talking about?

1036
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,340
Of course, your old lady.

1037
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,340
My old lady.

1038
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,340
You can call her my wife or my wife.

1039
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,340
Great.

1040
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,340
She treats you like a child.

1041
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,340
I'll show you later.

1042
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,340
Yuanyuan, can you show me your photo?

1043
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,340
I'll go get it.

1044
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,340
I'm sorry.

1045
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,340
I shouldn't have asked you to talk to your colleagues.

1046
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,340
But looking at the situation,

1047
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:19,340
Shiyan and Luo Hen might have to have surgery in the next few days.

1048
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,340
Huang Shiyan's parents...

1049
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:26,340
Shiyan's current condition is so bad that I can't see it.

1050
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,340
We suggest that we should have surgery.

1051
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,340
If we don't have surgery,

1052
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,340
maybe...

1053
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,340
This is the second time in two years.

1054
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:47,340
And then the third time.

1055
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,340
The second time is the same.

1056
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,340
My brain hasn't fully developed.

1057
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,340
After the surgery,

1058
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,340
the tumor hasn't gotten smaller.

1059
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,340
If we don't open it, the condition will be very bad.

1060
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,340
Luo Hen's parents...

1061
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,340
Luo Hen's condition is similar.

1062
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,340
So I think you have to...

1063
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,340
I know.

1064
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,340
My wife is going to give birth in two days.

1065
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,340
You're going to open the door for our child.

1066
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,340
I'm going to be a soldier.

1067
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,340
Luo Hen has been in a nursing home for almost three weeks.

1068
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,340
His tumor has become smaller.

1069
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,340
But it's really not suitable to be taken away.

1070
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,340
Our Luo Hen has been in the hospital for two times.

1071
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,340
He's only five years old.

1072
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,340
He's only five years old.

1073
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,340
He's been to the hospital twice.

1074
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,340
Dad, this is the hospital.

1075
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:49,340
All the procedures are based on medical professional judgment.

1076
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,340
It's not up to you to decide whether to open it or not.

1077
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,340
You're just like Hasa.

1078
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,340
You don't have to say that.

1079
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,340
A child will be gone soon.

1080
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,340
I'm a street dancer.

1081
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,340
I'm not a dancer.

1082
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,340
How do you dance?

1083
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,340
I just want to learn ballet.

1084
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,340
Okay, okay.

1085
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,340
You can learn ballet if you're alive.

1086
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,340
How old are you?

1087
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,340
What are you talking about?

1088
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,340
You're still a child.

1089
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:29,340
What else do you want to say?

1090
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,340
Luna, look.

1091
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,340
I'm going to draw you.

1092
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,340
Mom, I want to see it.

1093
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,340
Okay, okay.

1094
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,340
Don't be so anxious.

1095
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,340
Okay, take your time.

1096
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,340
Hey, Luna.

1097
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,340
Wait, wait.

1098
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,340
Luna.

1099
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,340
What?

1100
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,340
You're so cute.

1101
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,340
I just can't help it.

1102
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,340
You really dare to say that.

1103
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,340
Come on, let's see what you're going to draw.

1104
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,340
Come on, let's see.

1105
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,340
Mom, baby.

1106
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,340
Come on.

1107
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,340
Mom.

1108
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,340
Mom.

1109
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,340
Come on.

1110
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:05,340
Mom, do you want to have a baby?

1111
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,340
So cute.

1112
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,340
Wow, Siyan.

1113
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,340
Is this the girl from the ballet?

1114
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,340
Is that me?

1115
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,340
Of course.

1116
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,340
This is so cute.

1117
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,340
Luna, look at my hand.

1118
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,340
It's so cute.

1119
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,340
Siyan, you have me.

1120
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,340
Thank you.

1121
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,340
What color is it?

1122
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,340
Look, it's blue.

1123
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,340
Oh, that's Yuanyuan.

1124
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,340
It looks like a ballet costume.

1125
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,340
So cool.

1126
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,340
Luna, I'm telling you.

1127
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,340
Yuanyuan said that she's going to live until old and learn until old.

1128
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,340
It's so funny.

1129
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,340
Where is this line from the movie?

1130
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,340
It's so funny.

1131
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,340
She has a child.

1132
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,340
Where is this line from the movie?

1133
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,340
Let's find it together.

1134
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,340
It's so funny.

1135
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,340
It's the funniest line from the movie.

1136
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:09,340
This is the most ridiculous joke in the world.

1137
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,340
This is the funniest joke in the world.

1138
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,340
This is the most ridiculous joke in the world.

1139
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,340
Yuanyuan, this time the bone marrow test,

1140
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:51,340
we found that this medicine still can't be taken.

1141
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:56,340
We'll change another medicine tomorrow.

1142
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,340
But if it still can't be taken,

1143
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,340
we'll change another medicine tomorrow.

1144
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,340
But if it still can't be taken,

1145
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,340
we'll change another medicine tomorrow.

1146
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:12,340
But if it still can't be taken,

1147
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,340
we might have to consider the blood liver cell transplant.

1148
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:23,340
Yuanyuan's mom, don't be sad and don't give up.

1149
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,340
This is just the first round.

1150
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,340
I won't give up.

1151
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,340
We'll never give up.

1152
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,340
Please.

1153
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,340
We'll do our best.

1154
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,340
Please.

1155
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,340
Please.

1156
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,340
Please.

1157
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,340
Please.

1158
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,340
Good luck.

1159
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,340
What's wrong?

1160
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,340
You're not going to die.

1161
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,340
After this treatment, you can leave the hospital.

1162
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,340
Then you can go back to the clinic regularly.

1163
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,340
That's great.

1164
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,340
I can go home now.

1165
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,340
I want to live.

1166
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,340
I want to live.

1167
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,340
Yuanyuan, please give us a good doctor.

1168
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:30,340
Yuanyuan, we need a doctor.

1169
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:35,340
You're a doctor, but you're not a robot.

1170
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,340
If you really want to see us, we'll change your doctor.

1171
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,340
It's okay. You're very weak now.

1172
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,340
You're very weak.

1173
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,340
After you get out of the hospital,

1174
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,340
you can raise 100 turtles.

1175
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,340
Is there a turtle like us?

1176
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:57,340
There are too many turtles.

1177
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:58,340
There are too many.

1178
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,340
Yuanyuan, I'll give you first.

1179
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,340
But you have to return it to me when I get out of the hospital.

1180
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,340
That's great.

1181
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,340
Shiyan, when you get out of the hospital,

1182
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,340
let's go to the animal hospital near the baby's house

1183
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,340
and raise a dog.

1184
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,340
Okay?

1185
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,340
Shiyan, can your dog be called Maria?

1186
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,340
No, my dog is called B.

1187
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:27,340
Then can your little baby be called Maria?

1188
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,340
No, my baby has to be called Handsome.

1189
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,340
No matter if it's a boy or a girl, it has to be called Handsome.

1190
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:37,340
Then my little baby has to be called B.

1191
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,340
That's Jesus.

1192
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,340
Call B.

1193
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,340
Excuse me, please wait.

1194
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,340
No, it's okay.

1195
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,340
You are so beautiful.

1196
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:38,340
And your couple has such a big medical and beauty clinic.

1197
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,340
Your son is handsome.

1198
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,340
Thank you.

1199
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,340
The chairman next to you is very handsome.

1200
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,340
If you can smile occasionally, you should be handsome.

1201
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,340
I'm not.

1202
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,340
I'm not.

1203
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:56,340
I'm not.

1204
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,340
I'm not.

1205
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,340
I'm not.

1206
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,340
I'm not.

1207
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,340
I'm not.

1208
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,340
Hello.

1209
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,340
What are you talking about?

1210
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,340
You can't see me.

1211
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,340
I can guess your expression from your wife's face.

1212
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,340
Drive carefully.

1213
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,340
Red light.

1214
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,340
God.

1215
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,340
I see the path.

1216
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,340
Thou has warmed and clothed and fed me.

1217
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:59,340
Listen to my prayer.

1218
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,340
Amen.

1219
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,340
Goodnight everybody.

1220
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,340
Goodnight Maria.

1221
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,340
Goodnight.

1222
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:10,340
Good night.

1223
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,340
Goodnight.

1224
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,340
Huh?

1225
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,340
What are you doing?

1226
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,340
I want to confess to Da Shan.

1227
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,340
What kind of confession?

1228
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,340
Love.

1229
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,340
Love.

1230
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,340
Can you go out first?

1231
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,340
You want to confess now?

1232
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,340
Go out for a while.

1233
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:41,340
Why should I go out?

1234
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,340
Go out for a while.

1235
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,340
Go out for a while.

1236
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,340
Da Shan, I like you.

1237
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,340
Huh?

1238
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,340
I like you.

1239
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,340
Huh?

1240
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,340
I'll go out for a while.

1241
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,340
Why do you go out?

1242
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,340
Da Shan, are you afraid of your operation tomorrow?

1243
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,340
I'm afraid.

1244
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,340
I'm okay.

1245
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,340
I have one arm.

1246
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,340
It's okay.

1247
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,340
Da Shan, I like you.

1248
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,340
It's love.

1249
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,340
Okay.

1250
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:57,340
What about you?

1251
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:02,340
I'm okay.

1252
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:06,340
Because we have a lot of things to solve.

1253
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:09,340
And a lot of things are uncertain and complicated.

1254
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,340
And everyone has their own problems to solve.

1255
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:17,340
Like I have a problem, and so does Jian Long.

1256
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:22,340
And Shi Yan, Luo Hen, Nura, they all have their own problems.

1257
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,340
Asshole.

1258
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,340
I didn't do anything.

1259
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,340
I'm sorry.

1260
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,340
I don't love anymore.

1261
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,340
I don't believe in love.

1262
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,340
Love...

1263
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,340
It makes people sad.

1264
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,340
But it also makes people smile.

1265
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,340
And feel sad.

1266
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,340
But remember...

1267
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:29,340
No matter how many times you try to stop it,

1268
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,340
There's always a way out.

1269
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,340
And that's what I'm here for.

1270
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,340
I love you.

1271
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:37,340
I love you.

1272
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,340
And remember...

1273
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,340
No matter what happens,

1274
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:45,340
I'll always be by your side.

1275
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,340
Okay?

1276
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,340
Look.

1277
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:08,340
This tumor has removed part of the blood vessels.

1278
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,340
It needs to be rebuilt.

1279
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,340
I'll go get the cat.

1280
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,340
I want to divorce you.

1281
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,340
I want to divorce you.

1282
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,340
You... you came to the hospital to accompany your child.

1283
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,340
You... you came.

1284
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,340
Did I say anything?

1285
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,340
I'm tired.

1286
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,340
If you don't go to my place to help, I'm okay.

1287
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,340
I won't divorce you.

1288
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,340
I want to divorce you.

1289
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:54,340
I want to divorce you.

1290
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,340
I want to divorce you.

1291
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,340
I won't bring you anything but only shit.

1292
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,340
Wonder of the world that you fit in.

1293
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,340
When you do the shit, bring your lover gone.

1294
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:13,340
Drinkin' good and cheap.

1295
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,340
You can drink the wine but you can't drink the water.

1296
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:17,340
Wait 31 when you die die.

1297
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,340
Never take a sign of the day.

1298
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,340
Don't agree, don't agree.

1299
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,340
Look.

1300
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,340
I like beautiful gems too.

1301
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,340
Oh yeah.

1302
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,340
Just a spot in the attic.

1303
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,340
This shit that's getting on your shit.

1304
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,340
We don't really feel...

1305
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,340
Again.

1306
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,340
Again.

1307
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:41,340
Okay, again.

1308
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,340
Come on, stand up.

1309
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,340
Okay.

1310
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,340
Okay, again.

1311
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,340
Ready.

1312
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:49,340
Pose.

1313
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,340
I won't bring you anything but only shit.

1314
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:10,340
Wonder of the world that you fit in.

1315
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,340
When you do the shit, bring your lover gone.

1316
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,340
Drinkin' good and cheap.

1317
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,340
What is this?

1318
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,340
Coke.

1319
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,340
Is this okay?

1320
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,340
Don't worry.

1321
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,340
I bought it for you.

1322
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,340
Come on.

1323
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,340
Let me open it for you.

1324
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,340
Oh, come on.

1325
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,340
Come on.

1326
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,340
Wow, you have a habit.

1327
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,340
Thank you, Lu Han's mom.

1328
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:43,340
Thank you.

1329
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,340
Be careful.

1330
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,340
Come on.

1331
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,340
Is it good?

1332
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:01,340
He's dancing.

1333
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,340
Yeah, he's helping Yu Yu.

1334
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,340
Come.

1335
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,340
Oh, he's so good.

1336
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,340
Lift your head.

1337
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,340
Is it painful?

1338
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,340
I prepared the medicine and anesthesia tomorrow.

1339
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,340
I have a problem.

1340
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:36,340
Mommy!

1341
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:38,580
How are you?

1342
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,300
Where's the dog?

1343
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:43,820
The dog is in the recovery room.

1344
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,020
The surgery was a success.

1345
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:47,740
Wait.

1346
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,380
Wait.

1347
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,060
Come here.

1348
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:51,820
Let me see.

1349
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:54,860
Let me see.

1350
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:06,980
Call the doctor.

1351
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,420
Mommy!

1352
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,700
If the doctor decides to do the surgery,

1353
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:15,900
we have to do it right away.

1354
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:18,460
We've made up our minds.

1355
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,700
Our daughter is about to give birth.

1356
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:20,980
So?

1357
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,980
Are you going to sacrifice this child?

1358
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:28,580
Really?

1359
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,620
That's not what I meant.

1360
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,740
C paths

1361
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:43,900
Is Da Shan's baby fine?

1362
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,780
I will explain the surgery.

1363
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,820
We were going to let him

1364
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,540
go to the freeze reason

1365
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,780
DNA investigation.

1366
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:50,940
But he got worse

1367
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:51,940
instead of the hostility.

1368
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,580
Don't worry.

1369
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,980
The surgery was successful.

1370
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,380
We cleaned all the cancer cells we could see.

1371
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,580
Thank you.

1372
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,580
She should be awake soon. Let's wait a little longer.

1373
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,980
The next treatment will be given to Dr. Wen.

1374
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,580
Thank you.

1375
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:26,580
It's okay. You can go back and take a nap.

1376
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:29,180
No.

1377
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,380
I want to let Da Sheng see me when he wakes up.

1378
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,580
I told him when he wakes up. You should go back.

1379
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:40,580
No.

1380
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,180
Here.

1381
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:10,980
Thou was close and warm and fed me.

1382
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,580
Listen to my evening prayer.

1383
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,380
Let me tell you.

1384
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:26,380
You should go to sleep with your grandma.

1385
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:34,780
Yuan Yuan?

1386
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:37,780
Da Sheng, can we sleep together tonight?

1387
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:38,980
Okay.

1388
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,380
Huh?

1389
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,380
Yuan Yuan, come up.

1390
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,580
Be careful with your hands.

1391
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,980
Okay.

1392
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,980
I can't do it.

1393
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,780
Is it okay to lie down like this?

1394
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,180
He came here yesterday.

1395
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:32,780
Huh? Where are you going?

1396
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:34,380
I'm going to sit on the floor.

1397
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:35,980
I'm going back.

1398
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:37,780
I'll go to the computer.

1399
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,380
Sorry, I can't move my desk.

1400
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,380
I can't hold you.

1401
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,980
It's okay.

1402
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,580
Okay.

1403
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,980
Okay, let's go back and sleep.

1404
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,980
Okay, thank you.

1405
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,980
I'm sorry.

1406
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,980
It's okay.

1407
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,980
I still like you.

1408
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,980
But it's not love.

1409
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,980
Okay, thank you.

1410
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:22,980
Who loves mom?

1411
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,980
I love you too.

1412
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:27,980
I feel the most comfortable when I hug my dad.

1413
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,980
Then can you hug me and sleep every day?

1414
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:33,980
Daddy said he would come to say thank you.

1415
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,980
He wants to say thank you.

1416
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:37,980
He just wants to say thank you.

1417
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,980
He wants to say thank you.

1418
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,980
I'll see you tomorrow.

1419
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:43,980
I love you.

1420
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,980
I love you.

1421
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:59,980
I love you.

1422
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,980
Siyan, come on.

1423
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,980
We'll wait for you to come back and sing.

1424
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,980
Siyan, come on.

1425
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,980
Siyan, come on.

1426
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,980
Siyan, come on.

1427
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:45,980
You have to be as brave as Siyan tomorrow.

1428
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,980
You have to do your best.

1429
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,980
I'm sorry.

1430
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,980
Mom, I'm scared.

1431
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,980
Don't be scared.

1432
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,980
I'll be here with you.

1433
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,980
Be brave.

1434
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,980
You're the bravest now, right?

1435
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,980
Don't be drunk.

1436
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:28,980
Dad and mom will watch you.

1437
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,980
You'll feel safe.

1438
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,980
Wait a minute.

1439
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:38,980
Siyan, can you see clearly?

1440
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,980
When you wake up,

1441
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,980
we can go home.

1442
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,980
You have to do your best.

1443
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,980
You have to be brave.

1444
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:04,980
Do you have anything to say to your parents?

1445
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:12,980
Mom, dad, and mom, come on.

1446
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,980
You have to be drunk.

1447
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,980
Mom, dad, and mom, come on.

1448
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:30,980
Dad and mom, you can go now.

1449
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,980
Mom, dad, and mom, come on.

1450
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,980
Come on.

1451
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,980
Mom, dad, and mom, come on.

1452
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,980
Come on.

1453
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,980
Mom, dad, and mom, come on.

1454
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,980
Mom, dad, and mom, come on.

1455
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,980
Mom, dad, and mom, come on.

1456
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,980
Mom, dad, and mom, come on.

1457
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,980
I'm going to say goodbye to grandpa.

1458
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,980
I'm going to say goodbye to grandpa.

1459
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,980
I'm going to say goodbye to grandpa.

1460
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:04,980
I'll talk to him.

1461
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,980
He must be embarrassed by mom.

1462
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,980
He must be embarrassed by mom.

1463
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,980
I can't talk to him.

1464
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:22,980
Uncle!

1465
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:25,980
Uncle!

1466
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:27,980
Uncle!

1467
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,980
I'm sorry, Uncle!

1468
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,980
I'm sorry, Uncle!

1469
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:49,980
Uncle!

1470
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:52,980
Uncle!

1471
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,980
Thank you, Dad.

1472
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:58,980
Thank you for saying that.

1473
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:00,980
I'll go to the hospital.

1474
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,980
Xiao Yan!

1475
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,980
Let me say goodbye to Dad.

1476
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,980
Let me say goodbye to you.

1477
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,980
Let me say goodbye to you.

1478
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,980
Let me say goodbye to you.

1479
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:49,980
Let me say goodbye to you.

1480
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:19,980
Let me say goodbye to you.

1481
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,980
Thank you.

1482
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:56,980
Dear Uncle,

1483
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,980
thank you for coming to my house.

1484
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,980
Thank you for coming to my body.

1485
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:02,980
I'm not thankful at all.

1486
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:04,980
I'm really thankful.

1487
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,980
I'm really thankful.

1488
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,980
I feel so good.

1489
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:15,980
Let's go.

1490
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:16,980
Let's go home.

1491
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:17,980
Come.

1492
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:19,980
This way.

1493
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,980
Let's go together.

1494
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:26,980
Xiao Yan,

1495
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,980
do you know why Dad's feet can't walk?

1496
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:32,980
When I was on the bed,

1497
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:37,980
Dad fell asleep on the bed.

1498
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:39,980
At that time,

1499
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:42,980
the doctor said Dad was dead.

1500
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:46,980
Do you know why Dad survived?

1501
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:49,980
Because Dad was the general of the officer's team.

1502
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,980
He was the captain of the ghost killing team.

1503
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:53,980
Those bad guys didn't dare to come near Dad.

1504
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:55,980
Do you know that?

1505
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:57,980
So,

1506
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:59,980
I'll help you open the officer's face today.

1507
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,980
Let those bad guys not dare to come near you

1508
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,980
and bully you, okay?

1509
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,980
Do you know

1510
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,980
that you can't talk after opening your face?

1511
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:15,980
What do you want to say to your parents?

1512
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,980
Dad, I love you.

1513
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:22,980
Mom, I love you.

1514
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:27,980
Dad, Mom, I love you.

1515
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:29,980
I love you.

1516
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:36,980
Dad, Mom, I love you too.

1517
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,980
Come on,

1518
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,980
stop talking.

1519
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,980
I'll help you open your face.

1520
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,980
Dad, I love you.

1521
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:19,980
Please don't do this.

1522
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,980
Let us watch it from the side.

1523
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:23,980
You're just disturbing me, aren't you?

1524
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:24,980
I won't disturb you.

1525
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:26,980
You're a doctor. Don't you know that?

1526
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:28,980
You have to be very careful

1527
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,980
when you have a brain surgery.

1528
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:34,980
Can you be mature?

1529
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:37,980
I'm also very sad about the death.

1530
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,980
I'm the one who stabbed you, you know?

1531
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,980
Please,

1532
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,980
please.

1533
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,980
I have to do something.

1534
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:48,980
Do you believe me?

1535
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,980
Please, please.

1536
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,980
Good morning, kids.

1537
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,980
Good morning, Mom and Dad.

1538
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,980
Good morning.

1539
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,980
Good morning, boys.

1540
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,980
He Han, let's go.

1541
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:24,980
Come on.

1542
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,980
Come on.

1543
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:50,980
He Han, come on.

1544
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,980
Come on.

1545
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:36,980
Come on.

1546
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:06,980
Come on.

1547
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:12,980
Come on.

1548
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,980
Come on, girls.

1549
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,980
Come on.

1550
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,980
Let's go.

1551
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:22,980
Come on.

1552
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,980
Come on.

1553
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:06,980
Come on.

1554
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:36,980
Come on.

1555
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,980
Come on.

1556
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,980
Come on.

1557
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:10,980
Come on.

1558
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:17,980
Ula, your father is a pastor.

1559
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:20,980
Isn't he a teacher?

1560
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:23,980
My father is a pastor in the school.

1561
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:25,980
He's not a teacher.

1562
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,980
Oh, I see.

1563
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:29,980
So he can be with you every day.

1564
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:30,980
Yes.

1565
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:32,980
Brie, my mom made me

1566
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:35,980
a dress like Maria's.

1567
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:38,980
Your mom makes clothes by herself?

1568
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:39,980
Yes.

1569
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:42,980
When the ball on my butt falls off,

1570
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:45,980
my mom will make me pants.

1571
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:47,980
I can wear underwear.

1572
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:49,980
Brie, you're going to the competition.

1573
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,980
Will you be nervous?

1574
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:53,980
I can't go.

1575
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:55,980
My mom said I'm in a bad shape.

1576
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:59,980
I have to wait for blood, liver, cells and a matching chair.

1577
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:01,980
What's that?

1578
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:05,980
I have to wait for someone to donate a cell to me.

1579
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:08,980
Then I'll donate it to you.

1580
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:10,980
That's not true.

1581
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,980
Then I'll ask my parents to donate it to you.

1582
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,980
That's not true.

1583
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:19,980
What kind of song do you want to sing today?

1584
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:21,980
Happy song?

1585
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:24,980
Love song? Or a fighting song?

1586
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:27,980
I want to sing Christmas song.

1587
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:30,980
My mom said she wants to sing Christmas song.

1588
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:32,980
Sing Christmas song.

1589
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,980
Sing Christmas song.

1590
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:29,980
Sing Christmas song.

1591
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,980
Sing Christmas song.

1592
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,980
Sing Christmas song.

1593
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:42,980
Hello.

1594
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:47,980
What's up?

1595
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,980
Come here.

1596
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,980
When the bird is about to hatch,

1597
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:54,980
should we bring Yuanyuan here?

1598
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,980
Sure.

1599
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,980
Will she agree?

1600
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,980
Of course she won't.

1601
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:04,980
The question is whether you want to bring her here.

1602
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:14,980
Don't say that.

1603
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:30,980
Dad.

1604
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:32,980
Dad.

1605
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:38,980
Thank you.

1606
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:47,980
Don't come to work tomorrow.

1607
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:49,980
Go with Yuanyuan.

1608
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:52,980
I'll let you know when the bird is about to hatch.

1609
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:59,980
I'll go with Yuanyuan.

1610
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:01,980
Okay.

1611
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,980
Bye.

1612
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:05,980
Bye.

1613
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,980
Bye.

1614
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:09,980
Bye.

1615
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:11,980
Bye.

1616
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,980
Bye.

1617
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,980
Bye.

1618
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:17,980
Bye.

1619
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:19,980
Bye.

1620
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:21,980
Bye.

1621
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:23,980
Bye.

1622
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:25,980
Bye.

1623
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,980
Bye.

1624
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:32,980
Yuanyuan.

1625
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:35,980
Yuanyuan

1626
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:37,980
is very ill.

1627
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,980
A very bad disease.

1628
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:43,980
What should we do?

1629
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:49,980
Can you tell me what to do?

1630
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:57,980
Oh

1631
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:28,020
right

1632
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:50,560
I'm gonna beat the D

1633
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:56,740
Ugh...

1634
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:10,160
Windows XP

1635
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,320
Windows XP

1636
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,200
Windows XP

1637
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:23,000
Windows XP

1638
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,900
I'm not sure.

1639
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:42,980
With his

1640
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,140
To be honest

1641
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:51,120
I've played the rest of your life

1642
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:52,840
Ran with you

1643
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:53,740
We can change it

1644
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:55,800
True

1645
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:56,880
You're such a League!

1646
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:12,700
Can't feel the same

1647
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:15,500
Today's surgery is a miracle.

1648
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:18,300
Outside the surgery room, there are Jesus and the priest.

1649
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:20,300
Inside the surgery room, there are our internal and external doctors.

1650
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:21,500
They are all here.

1651
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,500
Two great priests are here.

1652
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,900
Little girl, you're so good.

1653
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:29,800
When you're done, you can go to the hospital.

1654
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:30,900
What's wrong with you?

1655
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,500
I have a stomachache.

1656
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:34,800
Hurry up. It's not next week.

1657
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,700
Hurry up and help me.

1658
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:38,500
Come on. Come on. Sit up. Sit up.

1659
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,800
Be careful. Be careful.

1660
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:40,700
Come on. Be careful.

1661
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:41,700
Be careful. Sit up.

1662
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:42,600
You...

1663
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,800
Come on. I'll take him to the obstetrics and gynecology department.

1664
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,600
Come on. Be careful.

1665
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,100
Big girl.

1666
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:47,400
You stay.

1667
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:48,700
You stay and take care of the child.

1668
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:50,400
I'll let you know if there's anything wrong.

1669
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,300
Come on. Be careful. Be careful.

1670
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,300
Come on.

1671
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,300
Come on. Breathe in. Breathe in.

1672
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:03,100
Come on. Breathe in.

1673
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:11,300
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1674
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,400
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1675
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:24,400
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1676
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,700
Okay. Congratulations. The baby is out.

1677
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,400
It's a baby.

1678
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:32,600
I'll help you make up for it.

1679
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,400
I'll give you more medicine.

1680
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,300
It's a baby.

1681
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:42,800
Thank you.

1682
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,800
Okay. Wait a minute.

1683
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:48,800
It's okay.

1684
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:00,300
It's okay. It's okay.

1685
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:01,800
Take your time.

1686
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:13,300
It's okay. It's okay.

1687
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:28,800
This is your sister.

1688
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:31,800
So cute.

1689
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,300
It moved.

1690
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:36,300
It knows that the brother is touching it.

1691
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:39,800
So cute, right?

1692
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,300
Hey, congratulations.

1693
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:46,300
Congratulations.

1694
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:47,300
Congratulations.

1695
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:48,300
Congratulations.

1696
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,300
I'm sorry.

1697
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:52,800
You're the head of the department.

1698
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,300
I'll give you a glass of water.

1699
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,800
The head of the department will also get a divorce.

1700
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,300
Why do you want a divorce?

1701
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,800
I was waiting for the operation.

1702
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:05,300
I was in a coma.

1703
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:07,800
You want a divorce after a long time?

1704
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:08,800
It's okay.

1705
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,800
I don't know.

1706
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,800
Divorce is divorce.

1707
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,800
I'm also looking for a divorce.

1708
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:16,800
I'll call you back.

1709
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,300
I'm going to get married.

1710
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:19,300
I can do it.

1711
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:20,300
No.

1712
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:21,300
I'm going back.

1713
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:22,300
I'm not going back.

1714
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,300
It's funny.

1715
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,300
Hey, please don't call me like that.

1716
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,800
This is a hospital.

1717
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:33,300
Don't drink alcohol in our big and small house.

1718
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,800
This is not the place to drink alcohol.

1719
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,300
This is my friend's place.

1720
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:38,800
If you don't drink alcohol,

1721
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:39,800
it's expensive.

1722
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:41,800
How can it be expensive?

1723
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,300
You can't even get a license.

1724
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:45,300
You're...

1725
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:46,800
Are you going to drink alcohol?

1726
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:47,800
You go to eat.

1727
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:48,800
I'm drinking.

1728
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,800
I'm going to work.

1729
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,300
I'm going to work.

1730
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:52,300
I'm drunk.

1731
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:53,300
I won't drink.

1732
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:54,300
You're so young.

1733
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:55,300
Please.

1734
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:56,300
I'm sorry.

1735
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:57,300
I'm sorry.

1736
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:58,300
I'm sorry.

1737
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,300
I'm sorry.

1738
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:00,300
I'm sorry.

1739
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:01,300
Are you loud?

1740
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,300
No.

1741
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:07,300
Everyone should be able to go home.

1742
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,300
Our family is lucky.

1743
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:14,300
We have two weeks to go home.

1744
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:16,300
But I promise you.

1745
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,300
I'll be back to spend Christmas with you.

1746
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:19,300
Okay.

1747
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:21,300
We're not sure.

1748
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,300
The blood flow on his ass has decreased.

1749
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:26,300
But we don't know when we can start the surgery.

1750
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,300
It's more troublesome to have a baby.

1751
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,300
The whole hospital is so sad.

1752
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:41,300
Why is the stairs so far away?

1753
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:44,300
The stairs are more narrow than me.

1754
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:48,300
Xiao Bai, the door to the stairs is locked.

1755
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,300
Go and help your aunt.

1756
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,300
Okay.

1757
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:54,300
I'm on a diet.

1758
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:56,300
I've said it hundreds of times.

1759
01:40:58,300 --> 01:40:59,300
Yi Bei!

1760
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,300
Dad, don't let me.

1761
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,300
I won't.

1762
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:08,300
Happy!

1763
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:10,300
Happy!

1764
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,300
Happy!

1765
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:20,300
Stop it!

1766
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,300
Stop it!

1767
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:24,300
What are you laughing at?

1768
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:25,300
You're so great.

1769
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:27,300
It's okay.

1770
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,300
Does it hurt?

1771
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:31,300
Wait.

1772
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:32,300
It's okay.

1773
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:33,300
Be careful.

1774
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:34,300
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

1775
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:36,300
You're so good.

1776
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,300
Is there a little bit of inflammation in the wound?

1777
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,800
The wound is very beautiful.

1778
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,800
It's only been a week.

1779
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:41,800
Look at this.

1780
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:42,800
It's okay.

1781
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:43,800
After the surgery,

1782
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:46,800
I can remove all your blood.

1783
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,800
Why is it so hard to save you?

1784
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,800
You're so cruel.

1785
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:53,800
I'm sorry.

1786
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:54,800
It's okay.

1787
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,800
You can do it.

1788
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:00,800
Dad!

1789
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:01,800
Dad!

1790
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:02,800
Dad!

1791
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,800
Dad!

1792
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:04,800
Dad!

1793
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,800
Dad!

1794
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,800
Dad!

1795
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:07,800
Dad!

1796
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:09,300
Dad!

1797
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,300
Dad!

1798
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:12,300
I don't dare to do it.

1799
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:22,300
Although no one can see it,

1800
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:24,300
we still shouldn't go against the rules.

1801
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:26,300
It's okay.

1802
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:34,300
You're a warhead.

1803
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:35,300
Come on.

1804
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:36,300
It's too early.

1805
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,800
Hello, brother.

1806
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,800
Any news from the team?

1807
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,800
There are two teams that have succeeded.

1808
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:46,800
But...

1809
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:48,800
They're all in trouble.

1810
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:52,800
Don't worry.

1811
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,800
Just wait.

1812
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:56,800
Dad!

1813
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:57,800
Dad!

1814
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:58,800
Dad!

1815
01:42:58,800 --> 01:42:59,800
Dad!

1816
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:00,800
Dad!

1817
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:02,800
Dad!

1818
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,800
Dad!

1819
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:04,800
Dad!

1820
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:05,800
Dad!

1821
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:07,300
What?

1822
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:10,300
Let's go!

1823
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:11,300
Let's go!

1824
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:37,300
Dad!

1825
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:38,300
Dad!

1826
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:39,300
Dad!

1827
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,300
Dad!

1828
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:41,300
Dad!

1829
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:42,300
Dad!

1830
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,300
Dad!

1831
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:44,300
Dad!

1832
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:45,300
Dad!

1833
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:46,300
Dad!

1834
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:47,300
Dad!

1835
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,300
Dad!

1836
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,300
Dad!

1837
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,300
Dad!

1838
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:51,300
Dad!

1839
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:52,300
Dad!

1840
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:53,300
Dad!

1841
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:54,300
Dad!

1842
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,300
Dad!

1843
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:56,300
Dad!

1844
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:57,300
Dad!

1845
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:58,300
Dad!

1846
01:43:58,300 --> 01:43:59,300
Dad!

1847
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:00,300
Dad!

1848
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:01,300
Dad!

1849
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:02,300
Dad!

1850
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:03,300
Dad!

1851
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:04,300
Dad!

1852
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:05,300
Dad!

1853
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:06,800
Dad!

1854
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:15,800
Thank you!

1855
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:16,800
Thank you!

1856
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:17,800
Thank you!

1857
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,800
You're so great!

1858
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:20,800
You're great too!

1859
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:21,800
You're the best hero!

1860
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:23,800
I'm so proud of you!

1861
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:24,800
So great!

1862
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:28,800
Can I sit here?

1863
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:32,800
Can I sit here and help?

1864
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:34,800
I like him now.

1865
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:36,800
You're so happy!

1866
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:37,800
I like you too.

1867
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:38,800
Sit down.

1868
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:43,800
Hey!

1869
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:44,800
You don't have an adult in your family?

1870
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,800
Boys love girls!

1871
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:51,800
Let's go.

1872
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:08,800
Kathang Yao

1873
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:19,300
Gorge

1874
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:33,800
Mama.

1875
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:34,800
Hm?

1876
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:37,800
If I cry, will you worry?

1877
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,800
I will be more at ease.

1878
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,800
If you hurt, I will be more at ease.

1879
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,800
Can you promise me one thing?

1880
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,800
If you hurt,

1881
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,800
if you are still feeling unwell,

1882
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,800
you must tell me.

1883
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,800
If you want to cry, you have to cry.

1884
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,800
If you want to be angry, you have to be angry.

1885
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,800
Don't be so stubborn, okay?

1886
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,800
Mom, can you tell me again

1887
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,800
the story that I was born

1888
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,800
and was carried on your back?

1889
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,800
Okay.

1890
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,800
At that time,

1891
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,800
your pregnancy period hasn't come yet.

1892
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,800
But you,

1893
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:37,800
when you heard that you were born,

1894
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:39,800
you were so anxious.

1895
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:41,800
You were so anxious that you were going to come out of my belly.

1896
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:43,800
My stomach was so painful.

1897
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:45,800
I don't know what to do with all of them.

1898
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,800
I asked your grandpa,

1899
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:49,800
to take me to the operating room

1900
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,800
of the zoo as soon as possible.

1901
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,800
You went to the operating room?

1902
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:54,800
What should you do now?

1903
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,800
I don't know what to do.

1904
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:57,800
Grandpa asked the

1905
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,800
female colleagues and aunts who had been born to him,

1906
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:01,800
to tell him that they had never had a child.

1907
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,800
Hurry up, what are we going to do now?

1908
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:05,800
What should we do with those aunts?

1909
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:06,800
They said,

1910
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,800
no, we had our own children.

1911
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,800
We have never helped anyone else.

1912
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,800
How can I know what to do?

1913
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,800
Your mom and I were lying there.

1914
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:15,800
We didn't know what to do.

1915
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,800
Actually, your grandpa didn't know what to do either.

1916
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,800
But he said,

1917
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,800
this is also a hospital.

1918
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,800
Animals are the same as humans.

1919
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,800
Move his feet away.

1920
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:27,800
Your mom and I's feet

1921
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:30,800
will be split open by all the colleagues.

1922
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,800
It's all quiet.

1923
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,800
It looks like your grandpa.

1924
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,800
Your grandpa was talking again.

1925
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,800
He said,

1926
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:39,800
what's the point of talking?

1927
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,800
I'm not the one who's going to be eliminated.

1928
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,800
Let him come out on his own.

1929
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,800
Your grandpa,

1930
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:49,800
he's just very funny.

1931
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:51,800
But,

1932
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:54,800
you really just came out like that.

1933
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,800
When you were born,

1934
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,800
you really cried so loudly.

1935
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,800
Even the animals thought

1936
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:05,800
that you were a new little monster.

1937
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:07,800
You were like...

1938
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,800
Grandpa hugged you on my body.

1939
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:13,800
When you hugged me,

1940
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,800
you immediately sneezed.

1941
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,800
You immediately sneezed.

1942
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,800
Then,

1943
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:22,800
you fell asleep on my body.

1944
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,800
I only heard my mom's heartbeat.

1945
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,800
I fell asleep in peace.

1946
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,800
You can't hear it all the time.

1947
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:35,800
I don't care.

1948
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:36,800
When you're discharged,

1949
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,800
you can tell me the next time.

1950
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:40,800
Mom,

1951
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,800
can you call a boyfriend?

1952
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,800
No.

1953
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:45,800
Why?

1954
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,800
If I can't sleep, I'm going to call someone else.

1955
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:49,800
You have to be more careful this time.

1956
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:50,800
Don't let the blood get to you.

1957
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,800
I'm going to check it for you.

1958
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:53,800
Zhang Yuanyuan,

1959
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,800
you're really not a child.

1960
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:56,800
That's right.

1961
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,800
You're getting old.

1962
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:59,800
Grandpa,

1963
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,800
I'm so happy to see you.

1964
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,800
Good boy.

1965
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:06,800
You've finished what grandpa wanted to say.

1966
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,800
Here.

1967
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:12,800
This cake is for all the children.

1968
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:15,800
And this.

1969
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,800
Aunt Pingru.

1970
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:21,800
There are two cakes for you.

1971
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:24,800
She said you can get out of the hospital safely.

1972
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:25,800
Mom,

1973
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:26,800
this one is for you.

1974
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,800
You have to be safe and healthy.

1975
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:29,800
Okay.

1976
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:32,800
I'll help you.

1977
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,800
I came to tell you a good news.

1978
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,800
Is sister going to have a baby?

1979
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,800
It should be these two days.

1980
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:43,800
It's very likely that it's Christmas.

1981
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:44,800
Wow, that's cool.

1982
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,800
I was born on the same day as Uncle Ye.

1983
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,800
Mom, I'm going.

1984
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,800
The hospital won't agree.

1985
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,800
You can't let them know.

1986
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,800
There are so many animal dramas.

1987
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:00,800
How many?

1988
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,800
You do it twice and I'll see.

1989
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:09,800
I saw Uncle Ye being born in the stable.

1990
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:12,800
Then he lay down in mom's arms.

1991
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,800
His mom was in Maria's arms.

1992
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:16,800
Grandpa,

1993
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:17,800
you came to see Yuanyuan?

1994
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,800
Pretty mom.

1995
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:21,800
I'm so happy.

1996
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:22,800
Yuanyuan,

1997
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:23,800
you have to go back to the room later.

1998
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:25,800
Dr. Wei is coming to see you.

1999
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,800
I have good news to tell you.

2000
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:34,800
Yes.

2001
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,800
Is it done?

2002
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:40,800
After Christmas,

2003
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,800
I'm going to make a dry bubble chair.

2004
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:48,800
Thank you.

2005
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:17,800
Mom.

2006
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,800
Come on.

2007
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:27,800
Mom.

2008
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:28,800
Mom.

2009
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:29,800
Mom.

2010
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:45,800
Yuanyuan.

2011
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:47,800
Come on.

2012
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:52,800
Mom.

2013
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:00,800
Mom.

2014
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:02,800
Wait.

2015
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,800
I don't know how to draw.

2016
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:05,800
I'm still young.

2017
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:14,800
Come on.

2018
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:16,800
Come on.

2019
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,800
Come on.

2020
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:19,800
You're chasing like this.

2021
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:20,800
Just right.

2022
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:21,800
Girls like this.

2023
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:22,800
Come on.

2024
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:23,800
Come on.

2025
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:24,800
Come on.

2026
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:25,800
Come on.

2027
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:29,800
Come on.

2028
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:34,800
I want to see.

2029
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:35,800
I can't see.

2030
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:36,800
Come on.

2031
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:37,800
Come on.

2032
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:40,800
I love you.

2033
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:43,800
You're so handsome.

2034
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:44,800
Come on.

2035
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,800
You're so handsome.

2036
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:48,800
Come on.

2037
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,800
Come on.

2038
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,800
You're so handsome.

2039
01:52:58,800 --> 01:52:59,800
Mom.

2040
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:06,800
Wait.

2041
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:07,800
Wait.

2042
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:08,800
Let's try this.

2043
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:17,800
What is grandpa writing?

2044
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,800
It's Christmas.

2045
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,800
Christmas.

2046
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:20,800
I didn't say that.

2047
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:21,800
Now.

2048
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:22,800
I didn't say that.

2049
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:23,800
I didn't say that.

2050
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:24,800
I didn't say that.

2051
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:25,800
I didn't say that.

2052
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:26,800
I didn't say that.

2053
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:27,800
I didn't say that.

2054
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:28,800
I didn't say that.

2055
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:29,800
You're so big.

2056
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:30,800
Do you want to be single?

2057
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:32,800
What?

2058
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:33,800
It's the baby who is going to be born.

2059
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:35,800
We're going to the zoo to see it.

2060
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:37,800
You all go to the zoo.

2061
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:38,800
I can't go.

2062
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:39,800
I can't go.

2063
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:40,800
I can't go.

2064
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:41,800
Mom, please.

2065
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:42,800
Please.

2066
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,800
Just let me go.

2067
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:45,800
We're all going.

2068
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:46,800
Please.

2069
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:47,800
Hurry.

2070
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:48,800
Hurry.

2071
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,800
Hurry.

2072
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:50,800
Hurry.

2073
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:51,800
Hurry.

2074
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:52,800
Hurry.

2075
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:53,800
Hurry.

2076
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:54,800
Hurry.

2077
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:55,800
Hurry.

2078
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:56,800
Hurry.

2079
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:58,800
It's exciting.

2080
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,800
It's like watching a movie.

2081
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,800
How long are you going to teach him?

2082
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,800
Why did you give him the sense of justice?

2083
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:04,800
I know.

2084
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:05,800
You're not.

2085
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:06,800
You know.

2086
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:07,800
The point is that

2087
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:08,800
the doctors and nurses don't know.

2088
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,800
Yeah, we're going to the zoo to see it.

2089
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:11,800
Yeah.

2090
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,800
Hey, why are you looking at the camera?

2091
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:14,800
This is the hospital.

2092
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:19,800
Hey.

2093
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:20,800
What are you doing?

2094
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,800
I'm going to the zoo.

2095
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:22,800
You're going to the zoo?

2096
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:23,800
I'm going to the zoo.

2097
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:24,800
You're going to the zoo?

2098
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:25,800
I'm going to the zoo.

2099
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:26,800
Hey.

2100
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:27,800
Yeah, right.

2101
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:30,800
Yeah, the ceiling is leaking.

2102
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:31,800
Yeah.

2103
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:48,800
Director Ji.

2104
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:49,800
No.

2105
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:50,800
I want to see Director Ji.

2106
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:51,800
Hey, wait.

2107
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:52,800
It's okay.

2108
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,800
Girls like this.

2109
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:56,800
What?

2110
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,800
I'm not stupid.

2111
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:05,800
Dr. Wen.

2112
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:07,800
Don't complain about Christmas.

2113
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,800
And Santa Claus is not stupid.

2114
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:13,800
Doctor, the doctor is coming.

2115
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:14,800
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2116
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:15,800
Hurry up.

2117
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,800
Hurry up.

2118
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:17,800
Hurry up.

2119
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:18,800
Hurry up.

2120
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,800
Hey, where are you going?

2121
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,800
Hey.

2122
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,800
So Dr. Wen is Santa Claus.

2123
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:26,800
Why are you here?

2124
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:28,800
To the toilet.

2125
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,800
Isn't the toilet over there?

2126
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:32,800
Hey, you guys.

2127
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:33,800
Toilet. Toilet.

2128
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:34,800
There's a toilet over there.

2129
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:35,800
There's a toilet over there.

2130
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:36,800
There's a toilet over there.

2131
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:40,800
Next, let's welcome the super hero of today.

2132
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:43,800
Who is Santa Claus?

2133
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:44,800
That's right.

2134
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:48,800
Let's welcome Santa Claus to come to the zoo.

2135
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:50,800
Wow, the three Santa Claus.

2136
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,800
Who wants a gift?

2137
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,800
I want a gift.

2138
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:55,800
Here, here, here.

2139
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:56,800
Give it to your friends.

2140
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,800
Hello.

2141
01:55:58,800 --> 01:55:59,800
Where are we going?

2142
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:01,800
Tonight, Jesus is born.

2143
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:02,800
This is a new secret.

2144
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:03,800
There's a secret?

2145
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,800
Tonight, you're going to have a baby.

2146
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:07,800
What?

2147
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:08,800
You're going to have a baby?

2148
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:09,800
Yes.

2149
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:10,800
It's so exciting.

2150
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:11,800
It's like a movie.

2151
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:13,800
Hello.

2152
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:15,800
Hello.

2153
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,800
Come and give a gift.

2154
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:18,800
Come on.

2155
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:21,800
Everyone has one.

2156
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:23,800
Mom.

2157
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:24,800
Mom.

2158
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:25,800
Where's the kid in 816?

2159
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:27,800
816.

2160
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:35,800
Santa Claus.

2161
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,800
Wait a minute, kids.

2162
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:39,800
I'm going to give a gift.

2163
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:40,800
Wait a minute.

2164
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:45,800
Be careful.

2165
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:49,800
It's not convenient to be naked.

2166
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:51,800
It's not here yet.

2167
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:53,800
Come on.

2168
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:55,800
Hurry up.

2169
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:57,800
Hurry up.

2170
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:58,800
Santa.

2171
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:04,800
Look, look.

2172
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:08,800
It's so familiar.

2173
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:09,800
Oh my God.

2174
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:10,800
Who dares to do this?

2175
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:12,800
Let's go.

2176
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:13,800
We're so excited.

2177
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:14,800
Hurry up.

2178
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:22,800
Come on.

2179
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:30,800
Hello.

2180
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:31,800
Hello.

2181
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,800
Hello.

2182
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:34,800
Where are you going?

2183
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:36,800
Santa Claus.

2184
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:38,800
I want to give a gift.

2185
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:40,800
Come on.

2186
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:41,800
Santa Claus.

2187
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:55,800
It's so cold.

2188
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:57,800
Come on.

2189
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:58,800
Come on.

2190
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:00,800
Thank you.

2191
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:02,800
It's so warm.

2192
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,800
I'm in the family.

2193
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,800
Do you want a brother?

2194
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:07,800
No.

2195
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:08,800
I don't have a brother.

2196
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,800
I want to see the snow.

2197
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:13,800
I want to see the snow.

2198
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:15,800
I want to see the snow.

2199
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,800
Kids.

2200
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:23,800
I ask you again.

2201
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:25,800
Where are you going?

2202
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,800
Santa Claus.

2203
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:30,800
Let's go.

2204
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:39,800
Santa Claus.

2205
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,800
Santa Claus.

2206
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:26,800
It's Santa Claus.

2207
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:34,800
Santa Claus.

2208
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:37,800
Can I have a beauty page?

2209
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:39,800
You're so stupid.

2210
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,800
You're so stupid.

2211
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:44,800
Honey.

2212
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,800
Look at that hot pot restaurant.

2213
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:48,800
When you're discharged,

2214
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,800
let's go to eat with dad and sister.

2215
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:52,800
Okay?

2216
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:53,800
Okay.

2217
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:56,800
Night...

2218
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:57,800
kiss.

2219
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:00,800
It's Christmas.

2220
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:03,800
He just said night kiss.

2221
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:07,800
Don't hit him.

2222
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:09,800
Don't hit him.

2223
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:12,800
Why are you looking at me so close?

2224
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:15,800
I like you.

2225
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:17,800
I'm so anxious.

2226
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:38,800
I'm so happy.

2227
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:46,800
I'm so happy.

2228
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:02,800
This is not exaggeration.

2229
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:03,800
This is arrogance.

2230
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,800
Santa Claus.

2231
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:12,800
Be careful.

2232
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:13,800
Be careful.

2233
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:14,800
Good boy.

2234
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,800
You don't have to use me.

2235
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,800
Your mouth will be envious.

2236
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:19,800
Hey, kid.

2237
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:20,800
You're so short.

2238
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:21,800
You're so short.

2239
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:22,800
I'm going to jump off.

2240
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:25,800
Okay.

2241
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:26,800
Everyone, don't be nervous.

2242
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:27,800
He's saying,

2243
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:29,800
handsome and beautiful, welcome to the forest.

2244
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:31,800
He's shy.

2245
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,800
Welcome back.

2246
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:36,800
Uncle Santa Claus.

2247
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:38,800
Hello, uncle Santa Claus.

2248
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,800
You were born here.

2249
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,800
Everyone welcomes you back.

2250
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:44,800
Okay.

2251
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,800
Before we go in,

2252
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:47,800
let me tell you something.

2253
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:49,800
When the mother of animals

2254
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:50,800
gives birth to babies,

2255
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,800
she's most afraid of being scared.

2256
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:53,800
So,

2257
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:54,800
we zookeepers

2258
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:56,800
usually use monitors

2259
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,800
to observe from a distance.

2260
02:01:58,800 --> 02:01:59,800
But today is different.

2261
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:01,800
For the sake of the children,

2262
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:04,800
we have a special open

2263
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,800
live show for everyone

2264
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,800
to watch through the double camera.

2265
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:09,800
Okay?

2266
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:10,800
Okay.

2267
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:11,800
Is it the kind of

2268
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:12,800
I can see her,

2269
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:13,800
but she can't see me?

2270
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:14,800
That kind of thing.

2271
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:15,800
Yeah.

2272
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:17,800
It's been a long time.

2273
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:18,800
Aunt Kien-Rua, look.

2274
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,800
I brought my bracelet.

2275
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,800
You're still wearing it.

2276
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:22,800
I'm so happy.

2277
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:23,800
Thank you.

2278
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,800
Is this dinosaur that loud?

2279
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:29,800
Uncle, are you pregnant?

2280
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:31,800
Yes, I'm pregnant.

2281
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:33,800
People are so bold and so small.

2282
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:44,800
Don't hit it.

2283
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:46,800
It's all closed.

2284
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,800
Do you know what it is?

2285
02:02:58,800 --> 02:02:59,800
Some of the babies

2286
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:01,800
are about to give birth.

2287
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:06,800
What is that?

2288
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,800
What is that?

2289
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,800
What is that?

2290
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:12,800
What is that?

2291
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:14,800
What is that?

2292
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:16,800
Sister Su-Wen.

2293
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:17,800
Be quiet.

2294
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:19,800
Let's sit down.

2295
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:20,800
There's a chair here.

2296
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,800
I can sit on the glass.

2297
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:23,800
You can sit on the table.

2298
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,800
You can sit here.

2299
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:27,800
You can sit here.

2300
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:29,800
Thank you.

2301
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:30,800
You can sit here.

2302
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:32,800
You can sit here.

2303
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:44,800
Aunt Kien-Rua.

2304
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,800
Aunt Kien-Rua, let's go.

2305
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,800
Let's go.

2306
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,800
It's about to give birth.

2307
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:13,800
It's about to give birth.

2308
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:44,800
It's about to give birth.

2309
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,800
It's about to give birth.

2310
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,800
It's about to give birth.

2311
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:38,800
It's about to give birth.

2312
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,800
It's about to give birth.

2313
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:05,800
Let's not divorce.

2314
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:13,800
Let's not divorce.

2315
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:33,800
Are you okay?

2316
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,800
Are you okay?

2317
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:43,800
Are you okay?

2318
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:47,800
I'm not going to give you a name.

2319
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:49,800
I'm not going to give you a name.

2320
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:01,800
Hello.

2321
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:02,800
Are you going to give birth?

2322
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,800
I'm going to give birth.

2323
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:05,800
Come on.

2324
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:07,800
Get up.

2325
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:09,800
It's almost there.

2326
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:10,800
It's almost there.

2327
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:12,800
Get up.

2328
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:24,800
Get up.

2329
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:26,800
It's almost there.

2330
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,800
It's almost there.

2331
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:43,800
It's almost there.

2332
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:08,800
Where are you going?

2333
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:09,800
Why don't you take me with you?

2334
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:11,800
Don't be angry.

2335
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:12,800
I'm sorry.

2336
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:13,800
How old are you?

2337
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:15,800
You can't keep this kind of instrument.

2338
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:16,800
I'm not an adult.

2339
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,800
Someone left it here.

2340
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,800
Poor thing.

2341
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:22,800
I'm sorry.

2342
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:25,800
Did my daughter cry?

2343
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:26,800
You treat our nursing center

2344
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,800
as a nursing center.

2345
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,800
You have to look at the right side.

2346
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,800
Come on. Give me a hug.

2347
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:34,800
Come on.

2348
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:39,800
Everyone.

2349
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:41,800
Thank you so much for inviting us

2350
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:43,800
to come here today.

2351
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:45,800
I just felt like

2352
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:47,800
Wen Siyan

2353
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:50,800
was brought back by us.

2354
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:53,800
Come on.

2355
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:55,800
I'll take you to my bike.

2356
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:56,800
No need.

2357
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,800
You're a nursing center.

2358
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,800
No, I'm not a nursing center.

2359
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:01,800
I'm more comfortable.

2360
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:02,800
No, no, no.

2361
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:03,800
We have our own.

2362
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:05,800
You can open your own school.

2363
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:06,800
Hey!

2364
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:09,800
What are you thinking?

2365
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:11,800
It's too much

2366
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:12,800
to take a sick child

2367
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:15,800
to the zoo to spend the night.

2368
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,800
You're parents.

2369
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,800
You don't even care about

2370
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:21,800
the safety of the child.

2371
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:23,800
What else do I care about?

2372
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:25,800
It's so loud.

2373
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:29,800
It's so embarrassing.

2374
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,800
It's so loud.

2375
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:44,800
Let me hug you.

2376
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:47,800
Come on.

2377
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:02,800
It's so warm and comfortable.

2378
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,800
I'm so pissed off.

2379
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:11,800
I'm so pissed off.

2380
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:14,800
Okay, you guys go in.

2381
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:15,800
Thank you.

2382
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:16,800
Go in.

2383
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:18,800
Bye.

2384
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,800
Dr. Mu Nan,

2385
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:46,800
I'll tell you a secret.

2386
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:49,800
Mom said that the kid who wrote the big

2387
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:51,800
is a very rich entrepreneur.

2388
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:53,800
Don't listen to her.

2389
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:54,800
Huh?

2390
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:56,800
It wasn't written by a poor kid.

2391
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,800
It was written by a poor kid.

2392
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:01,800
I'm not a rich entrepreneur.

2393
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:03,800
But like you,

2394
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:06,800
you're the blood of Dr. Wang.

2395
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,800
The medical treatment of the epidemic

2396
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:16,800
is not as good as it is now.

2397
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,800
What the kids have to go through

2398
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:21,800
is also a harder process than it is now.

2399
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:24,800
The chance of survival

2400
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:27,800
is much smaller than it is now.

2401
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:28,800
But that kid,

2402
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,800
he won the war of this agreement.

2403
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:33,800
So when he was discharged from the hospital,

2404
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:36,800
he used a pen to change the 816 to Big.

2405
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:41,800
Yu-Yuan, you have to work hard.

2406
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:43,800
In a few days,

2407
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:46,800
we'll help you get the liver cell transplant.

2408
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:48,800
Even if you're the only one

2409
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,800
facing millions of soldiers,

2410
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:53,800
you have to win this war.

2411
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:57,800
Dr. Wang,

2412
02:11:57,800 --> 02:11:59,800
actually,

2413
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:01,800
when you smile,

2414
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:03,800
you're really warm.

2415
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:06,800
Don't laugh at me.

2416
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:14,800
Go to sleep.

2417
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:16,800
Sleep quietly.

2418
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,800
Dr. Wang,

2419
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:22,800
what happened to the kid

2420
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:24,800
who wrote Big later?

2421
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:31,800
Later,

2422
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:34,800
I graduated from the medical school.

2423
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:37,800
Now I'm in the children's nursing room

2424
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:40,800
as your attending doctor.

2425
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:55,800
Yu-Yuan,

2426
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:57,800
good morning.

2427
02:12:57,800 --> 02:12:59,800
Good morning.

2428
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:03,800
Good morning.

2429
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:14,800
You're so hot.

2430
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:16,800
Are you going to sleep here?

2431
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:18,800
Damn it.

2432
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:19,800
Don't make me sweat.

2433
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,800
I'm driving.

2434
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,800
What's that sound?

2435
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:32,800
Let's go.

2436
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,800
What's that sound?

2437
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,800
I really feel like a kid.

2438
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:43,800
Really?

2439
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:45,800
Why are you here?

2440
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:49,800
So good.

2441
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:51,800
You like your dad, right?

2442
02:13:53,800 --> 02:13:55,800
Look.

2443
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:57,800
I feel like a kid.

2444
02:13:57,800 --> 02:13:58,800
You?

2445
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,800
You're a kid.

2446
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,800
You're so cute.

2447
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:04,800
Why are you here?

2448
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:07,800
Why are you so good?

2449
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:09,800
So cute.

2450
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:11,800
Or,

2451
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:13,800
we should take him back home.

2452
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:15,800
Take him back home?

2453
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:18,800
Are you taking him back to your home or mine?

2454
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:20,800
Why are you so cold?

2455
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:22,800
You're so cold.

2456
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:24,800
So cute.

2457
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:29,800
Take him back to our home.

2458
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:32,800
We'll raise him together.

2459
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:39,800
Let's call him a cute cat.

2460
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:42,800
No.

2461
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:44,800
This one

2462
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:46,800
should be called Big.

2463
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:49,800
Big.

2464
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:51,800
Big.

2465
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:55,800
Big.

2466
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:57,800
Big.

2467
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:20,800
Hello.

2468
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,800
The patient's name is Huang Zhinuo.

2469
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:23,800
Age 4 years old.

2470
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:24,800
He's diagnosed with GCT.

2471
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,800
His surgery name is Uterine Tumour Ecession.

2472
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:28,800
He's expected to have a blood pressure of 20 cc.

2473
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:29,800
Correct.

2474
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:31,800
Knife No. 10.

2475
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:53,800
Is the setting ready?

2476
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:55,800
Yes.

2477
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:57,800
Okay.

2478
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,800
Okay.

2479
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:06,800
Okay.

2480
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:08,800
Go to sleep.

2481
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,800
Everything will be fine when you wake up.

2482
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,800
I'm sorry.

2483
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:52,800
I'm sorry.

2484
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:18,800
Why is the blood from the heart still white?

2485
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:21,800
How's your blood pressure?

2486
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:23,800
It's 92 cc after the blood test.

2487
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:28,800
Take the blood test tomorrow.

2488
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:30,800
Okay.

2489
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:33,800
Is there anything else?

2490
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:38,800
Senior.

2491
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:41,800
Senior.

2492
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:51,800
First,

2493
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:55,800
change Yuan Yuan to a single-person room.

2494
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:59,800
I want to sit on the sofa!

2495
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:03,800
Bye, Dad.

2496
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:05,800
The one who loses the game is the winner.

2497
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:07,800
Let's go.

2498
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:12,800
Be careful.

2499
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,800
Come on.

2500
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:19,800
Grandpa Miao Miao.

2501
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:20,800
Hello.

2502
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,800
The kids are here.

2503
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:23,800
Grandpa Miao Miao.

2504
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:24,800
Grandpa, it's so hot.

2505
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:25,800
Let's move.

2506
02:18:25,800 --> 02:18:26,800
Okay.

2507
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:28,800
Where's Yuan Yuan?

2508
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:35,800
Now...

2509
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:37,800
Grandpa,

2510
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:40,800
Yuan Yuan's liver cell transplant failed.

2511
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:43,800
The blood from the heart is still in the cell.

2512
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:46,800
The situation is not good.

2513
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:49,800
He moved to a single-person room last night.

2514
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:55,800
Is it that serious?

2515
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:00,800
Last night...

2516
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:02,800
No wonder I didn't know.

2517
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:04,800
Grandpa.

2518
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:07,800
Come.

2519
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:09,800
This is the photo we took with the bulls

2520
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:12,800
when we were in the zoo.

2521
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:14,800
We've put it up for everyone.

2522
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:16,800
Come, kid.

2523
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:18,800
Thank you, Grandpa Yuan Yuan.

2524
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:19,800
Good girl.

2525
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:21,800
Thank you, Grandpa Miao Miao.

2526
02:19:21,800 --> 02:19:22,800
Come.

2527
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:24,800
Thank you.

2528
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,800
This is

2529
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:28,800
the blood test result.

2530
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:30,800
It's a good result.

2531
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:32,800
This is

2532
02:19:32,800 --> 02:19:34,800
from the family farm and the test.

2533
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:36,800
Please give it to them.

2534
02:19:43,800 --> 02:19:45,800
This is from our family.

2535
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:58,800
Where is he now?

2536
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:02,800
Come.

2537
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:03,800
Come.

2538
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:05,800
Hold this.

2539
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:07,800
Grandpa, I'll take you to Yuan Yuan.

2540
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:10,800
Wait.

2541
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:12,800
We'll put something down and go with you.

2542
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:14,800
We'll go with you.

2543
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:15,800
I want to go too.

2544
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:16,800
I want to go too.

2545
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:17,800
We'll go together.

2546
02:20:17,800 --> 02:20:18,800
Wait for us.

2547
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:20,800
I'll put something down.

2548
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:28,800
Sister-in-law.

2549
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:32,800
I'm sorry.

2550
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:46,800
He just fell asleep.

2551
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,800
Come on.

2552
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:33,800
Yuan Yuan.

2553
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,800
Yuan Yuan.

2554
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:47,800
Yuan Yuan.

2555
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:51,800
Yuan Yuan.

2556
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:02,800
Yuan Yuan.

2557
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:22,800
You are the strongest person I've ever met.

2558
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:32,800
Yuan Yuan.

2559
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:48,800
It's so beautiful.

2560
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:50,800
It's so comfortable.

2561
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:02,800
It's so warm.

2562
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:04,800
It's so comfortable.

2563
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:33,800
Thank you.

2564
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:02,800
Yuan Yuan.

2565
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:13,800
Can I hug you?

2566
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:32,800
Yuan Yuan.

2567
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:05,800
Mom, you are hurt.

2568
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:20,800
Mom loves you.

2569
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:27,800
You are so beautiful.

2570
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:34,800
You can rest assured.

2571
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:37,800
You can be an angel.

2572
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:42,800
It doesn't matter if you are alone.

2573
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:46,800
Okay?

2574
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:51,800
Mom, I want to live.

2575
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:56,800

2576
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:02,800

2579
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:18,800
I want to live.

2580
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:22,800
I want to hug you.

2581
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:24,800
I want to live.

02:36:23,240 --> 02:36:25,240
You

02:36:28,340 --> 02:36:30,340
There you go

2635
02:36:31,380 --> 02:36:31,860
oh

2636
02:36:31,860 --> 02:36:35,580
So you used the Chinese-Inn Album to admit you the change of meaning

2637
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:38,980
Your existence to this world. It's a gift

2638
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:42,080
it's

2639
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:42,840
Penis

2640
02:36:44,360 --> 02:36:46,360
Is a surprise is a surprise

2641
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:49,360
You have to open it to find out what happens next.

2642
02:36:49,360 --> 02:36:50,360
Okay, okay, okay.

2643
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:52,360
I thought you were going to say that.

2644
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:54,360
What's next?

2645
02:36:54,360 --> 02:36:58,360
Every thing has different values.

2646
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:00,360
Different values.

2647
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:04,360
You have to know it in detail.

2648
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:07,360
Then you will know what its value is.

2649
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:11,360
Simply put, living is the best gift.

2650
02:37:11,360 --> 02:37:14,360
How do you say the same thing?

2651
02:37:14,360 --> 02:37:18,360
Human's existence is a gift.

2652
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:20,360
If you want to think of something better,

2653
02:37:20,360 --> 02:37:21,360
you can say,

2654
02:37:21,360 --> 02:37:23,360
the simpler the better.

2655
02:37:23,360 --> 02:37:25,360
The simpler the better.

2656
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:26,360
So in this world,

2657
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:29,360
you are giving this world a wonderful gift.

2658
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:30,360
Simply put,

02:37:30,360 --> 02:37:33,360
you are the most beautiful gift in this world.

02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:34,360
That's right.

2661
02:37:34,360 --> 02:37:35,360
Listen to Y9.

2662
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:37,360
The simplest, the shortest.

2663
02:37:37,360 --> 02:37:38,360
You are a gift.

2664
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:40,360
Everyone has different values.

2665
02:37:40,360 --> 02:37:42,360
People all over the world are the best gifts.

2666
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:44,360
There are bad people.

2667
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:47,360
Bad people are also the best gifts.

2668
02:37:47,360 --> 02:37:48,360
Living is the best.

2669
02:37:48,360 --> 02:37:51,360
Living is the only way to have a voice.

2670
02:37:51,360 --> 02:37:52,360
What did you say?

2671
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:53,360
Have you thought it through?

2672
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:54,360
Come back.

2673
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:56,360
Luna, which sentence do you know?

2674
02:37:56,360 --> 02:37:57,360
I don't know.

2675
02:37:57,360 --> 02:37:59,360
I know the first sentence.

2676
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:00,360
Okay, wait.

2677
02:38:00,360 --> 02:38:02,360
You say one sentence.

2678
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:05,360
Being is a gift.

2679
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:06,360
The second sentence.

2680
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:09,360
Battle inspires growth.

2681
02:38:09,360 --> 02:38:11,360
Battle inspires growth.

2682
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:13,360
Being is gold.

2683
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:14,360
Being is gold.

2684
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:17,360
Beater inspires rock.

2685
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:19,360
Rock inspires light.

2686
02:38:19,360 --> 02:38:21,360
Believe in our gold.

2687
02:38:21,360 --> 02:38:26,360
Believe.

Believe.

02:38:30,360 --> 02:38:31,360
What does it mean?

2691
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:36,360
Believe in the voice of the enemy.
