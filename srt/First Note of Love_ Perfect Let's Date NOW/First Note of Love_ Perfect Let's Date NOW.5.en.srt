28
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:56,535
to see who gets to pull

Oh!

38
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,671
- Do you want to go first or second?
- Second.

39
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,233
Okay. You first.

40
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:16,429
Ichigo, you first.

41
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:18,695
You first.

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,140
- I'm first?
- Yes.

43
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:23,264
Oh.

44
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:24,340
I forgot to mention,

45
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:25,781
the loser will face a punishment.

46
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:26,905
Huh?

00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,936
Ah, okay.

00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:34,976
- Hey.
- Huh?

51
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,264
Like this?

52
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:37,515
Ichigo.

53
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:39,656
- This is how you're playing?
- Yes.

54
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
- Impossible.
- Possible.

55
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:48,100
- Where will you put the next block?
- Sure, sure.

56
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,608
- Huh?
- Okay.

57
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:52,514
- Oh wow.
- Ichigo.

58
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,616
Idiot, I can’t see it clearly!

59
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:58,108
Excuse me.

60
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:01,382
Gojo Satoru, good luck!

61
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:02,686
- Wow.
- Here, here, here, here!

62
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:04,069
- Here, here, here, here!
- Wow, dammit.

63
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:06,094
Here.

64
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:08,991
Wow.

65
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,476
Mist Hashira,

66
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,874
will your hair get in the way?

67
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,084
No.

68
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:14,389
Here.

69
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:17,576
- Wow, Bankai.
- Hey.

70
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,200
No problem, I also have a sword.

71
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:21,444
- Here, take it.
- Okay.

72
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:23,545
Using the same equipment as me?

73
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:25,623
Lend me your power.

74
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:30,584
- I mean... I want to borrow your sword.
- Oh, borrow my sword.

75
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:33,084
How do you say One Piece in Mandarin?

76
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:36,092
Jame Jame Jame.

77
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:42,944
Wow, seriously!

78
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,858
- Wow!
- Wow!

79
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,500
Impossible!

80
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:50,500
With your height? That’s a problem!

81
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:52,803
Have to open my eyes.

82
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:55,147
Have to open your eyes.

83
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:59,451
It’s over. It’s over. No way.

84
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:01,834
- Woo!
- Oh!

85
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:04,412
Let's not compete with him.

86
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,936
- I'm screwed.
- I'll help, okay?

87
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:08,795
- Haa...
- Uh-oh.

88
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:12,436
Oh!

89
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:14,928
It’s going to fall!

90
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,830
It’s going to fall!

91
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:19,011
- Careful!
- Aghh!

92
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:26,458
- Yay!
- Dammit!

93
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:28,178
No, the character personality!

94
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,468
Alright, the next game is...

95
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:34,844
Table tennis soccer.

96
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,717
Best of three matches.

97
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:37,794
Alright.

98
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:39,428
3, 2, 1, Action!

99
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:46,272
Yay!

100
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
I suddenly felt two breaths on my face.

101
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,241
And it was over.

102
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,631
- So that makes it 1-0.
- 1-0.

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,241
- On match point.
- On match point.

104
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,787
3, 2, 1, Action!

105
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:01,276
Yay!

106
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,775
We won!

107
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,510
Let’s congratulate Gojo Satoru

108
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,135
and the Mist Hashira for winning again.

109
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,069
They memorized it.

110
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:10,675
Mist Breathing!

111
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,912
- Domain Expansion!
- Bankai!

112
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,956
(The judges will vote on
who has the best cosplay)

113
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:21,394
We invite our five judges to the pool.

114
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:26,503
Are those waves behind us?

115
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:27,800
Roaring tides!

116
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,636
I think I was quite thoughtful,

117
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:31,461
I wore blue contact lenses.

118
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:33,425
Now, let’s announce the results.

119
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,691
The Mist Hashira scored 2 points.

120
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:37,347
Hey! You can’t turn your head!

121
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:39,000
- Not allowed?
- Not allowed, it’s anonymous.

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,956
Gojo Satoru scored

123
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,000
1 point.

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,075
- Yes!
- So that’s 3 points total.

125
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,400
The Shinigami scored 1 point.

126
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:47,100
Luffy 0 point.

127
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:49,417
- Huh?
- Here! Right here.

128
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,839
Finally, congratulations to Gojo Satoru

129
00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:53,301
and the Mist Hashira,

130
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:55,401
our champions of the day!

131
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:56,589
Yes!

132
00:04:57,218 --> 00:05:00,394
Today’s punishment is doing yoga.

133
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:05,597
I don’t think this is very okay.

134
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,105
Alright, okay.

135
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,979
It’s just yoga, no “Road to Heaven?”

136
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:14,004
No.

137
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:20,253
Oh, oh.

138
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,394
Okay.

139
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:24,901
I can’t do this.

140
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,643
I really can’t.

141
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:33,198
There we go, okay!

142
00:05:34,346 --> 00:05:35,590
Good thing we didn’t lose,

143
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,629
- or we’d be fighting.
- Good thing you didn’t lose.

144
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:38,400
- Yes.
- Good thing you didn’t lose.

145
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,945
Thank you for watching our

146
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,738
“Romance Night of Terror” today.

147
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,456
See you next time! Bye-bye!
