1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,366
(Highlights)
This is the prize I won

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,766
I will take it home.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,300
Yeah.

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,600
Congratulations, you win the prize

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,933
I dropped it.

6
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:08,833
If you want more hints.

7
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:11,100
(Obvious Hints)

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,366
(MingTing's arm line.)

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,000
(Too Shining!)

10
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:24,566
it should be very hot.

11
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,300
It‘s hot. Its hot.

12
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:31,133
Perfect! Let's Date Now.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,933
Wow.

14
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:34,700
There are so many people

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,133
many, many, many

16
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,300
many people.

17
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,333
Today I bring ORCA to visit
our very famous night market in Taiwan.

18
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,600
Raohe Night Market.

19
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:44,833
Today is very special.

20
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:47,100
It is Hungry Ghost Festival.

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,300
So I also let him see

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,900
our special culture.

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,400
Right.

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,166
Hey, don't you said you will take me home?

25
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,833
(Jame is looking forward to this.)
You said it.

26
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,800
Come on, we are going home.

27
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,600
Just kidding

28
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,466
back to my home, this time.

29
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:04,366
Do you also have this kind of Phee (ghost) in Thailand?

30
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:05,300
Yes, we do.

31
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:05,833
Yes?

32
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:06,333
Yes.

33
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,866
It's actually very close.

34
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,866
I am your Phee.

35
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,300
You are Phee?

36
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,466
I'm yours

37
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:15,733
your Phee.

38
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:16,800
Oh.

39
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:18,733
You don't want it

40
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:19,266
I want

41
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:20,433
I'm leaving now.

42
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:21,566
Just kidding.

43
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,100
Okay.

44
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,700
Let's take ORCA to eat some local food.

45
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,366
Go.

46
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,166
Let's eat.

47
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,033
(Jame, who is still learning to speak.
Spicy.

48
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:38,866
And MingTing, Jame's personal translator.)
You want spicy food?

49
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:39,733
I want spicy food.

50
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:40,633
You want spicy food?

51
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,166
Yes.

52
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:42,966
Eats this first.

53
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:44,066
He will probably like this.

54
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:44,933
Crispy pork ribs.

55
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:47,100
Okay.

56
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,633
Is it spicy?

57
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:49,700
You can make it spicy.

58
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,366
Okay.

59
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,900
Okay.

60
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:53,700
You're hungry now.

61
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,966
(How can MingTing discovered this?)
He just swallowed his saliva.

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,333
He just

63
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,466
swallowed my saliva.

64
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,266
He’s hungry now.

65
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,600
Me too.

66
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,300
I’m also hungry, too.

67
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,600
Do you believe me?

68
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,000
Do yo believe, I'm really hungry now.

69
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,400
Delicious.

70
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,233
It's delicious

71
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:21,200
Thai fried chicken has cheese powder and sour cream powder

72
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,033
but Taiwan's fried chicken mainly uses chili powder

73
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:25,433
which is different kind of delicious.

74
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,233
(MingTing spoiled Jame.)
It's all yours.

75
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,600
Do you want to try steak?

76
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:40,500
Jame, let's see his photo album.
How many pictures are there with MingTing?

77
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,333
What you must drink when visiting Taiwan’s night market

78
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:46,700
is creamy corn soup, right?

79
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,533
So I will give corn soup to Orca.

80
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:52,933
Considerate boyfriend.

81
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,866
Drooling through the screen.

82
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:59,600
Let him try my childhood memories.

83
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,333
Check it out.

84
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:06,833
Thank you.

85
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,866
This is traditional.

86
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:11,266
Because I know you like spicy food

87
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,166
so I brought you this.

88
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,833
No, no, you have to understand me this

89
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:18,633
I like spicy food. It doesn’t mean that every dish must be spicy.

90
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,466
This one is no need.

91
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:26,866
It's creamy corn soup.

92
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:27,366
Delicious.

93
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:27,866
Do you like it?

94
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:28,366
I like it.

95
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,500
I like corn soup.

96
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,066
Delicious

97
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:35,700
I like it

98
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,966
so delicious.

99
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,833
This is my childhood memories.

100
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,966
Can I be a memory for you when you grow up?

101
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,966
Every second~.

102
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,200
Uneasy hands

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,766
I like it.

104
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,900
Okay.

105
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,700
Thank you.

106
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:58,033
Spicy.

107
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:01,200
Why isn't anything coming out?

108
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:05,433
This spoiled smile.

109
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,766
But nothing seems to come out.

110
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,166
You just turned in the wrong direction.

111
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,166
Wrong direction.

112
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,966
It's the wrong side.

113
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:14,833
You’re wrong

114
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,233
I don’t know.

115
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:17,200
It’s okay.

116
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,833
Let's eat!

117
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,766
You like it?

118
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Yes, I do.

119
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,766
(Jame's Thai Language Classroom ชอบ: like)
Like=Chob (Thai)

120
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,366
Like.

121
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,400
Chob Mai？(Do you like this?)

122
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,066
Chob (Yes, I do.)

123
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,300
Chob Mai？(Do you like this?)

124
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:29,500
He.

125
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,033
Orca loves to drink cola.

126
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,100
So I will grab this lovely cola for him.

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,933
Let him drink this.

128
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,633
See if he will be very happy

129
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,200
gaze deeply.

130
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,300
Satisfied.

131
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:59,766
(Sticky couple)
The restaurant is so good

132
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,466
and I am very happy to go to that restaurant

133
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:02,466
because.

134
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,300
It's not only able to eat delicious food.

135
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,666
But I can also know that corn soup is RESSE’s childhood memory.

136
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:12,400
But I am his memory when he grows up now.

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
That's right.

138
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,900
We are going to have more memories together.

139
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,700
Can we?

140
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,433
Sure

141
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:21,466
I wish we can have memories in Thailand next time.

142
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:22,166
Sure, we can.

143
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,033
We can?

144
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,866
(Already arranging beds)
Ah, you sleep...

145
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,100
sleep in your home?

146
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,266
Thailand.

147
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,766
Sleep in Thailand

148
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:31,466
with me

149
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:32,400
with you.

150
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,900
Okay

151
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,133
with you.

152
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:34,733
Yes.

153
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:36,266
Let's go back to Thailand together.

154
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:36,933
Okay.

155
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:38,966
Next time, I will to go back to Thailand with him.

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,100
Sleep with him

157
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,666
in his house.

158
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:44,200
Next, we are going to have some dessert.

159
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Go.

160
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,133
Let's go.

161
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,700
Do you wanna play?

162
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,133
I'm not good at it.

163
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:54,633
Check it out.

164
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,900
This area is for children.

165
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,233
For children.

166
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,100
You are not a child. You are a baby.

167
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,333
You are a baby.

168
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:04,900
My baby.

169
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,633
(Really like Coke)
Cola.

170
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:11,466
Is this also his childhood memory?

171
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:13,300
Yes, this is my childhood memory.

172
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,533
So I want to take you to recall my childhood memory.

173
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,233
Then don’t play with this, come and play with me.

174
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,966
Play with you.

175
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:19,866
Eh.

176
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,533
I’m sorry.

177
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,300
This is mine

178
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:24,866
I won.

179
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,300
(Got an Orca.)
Not like this.

180
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,633
(Got an Orca.)
Mine.

181
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:39,666
Dedicated Two.

182
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,766
There is another way to play.

183
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,166
Take many at a time.

184
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:46,800
Missing.

185
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,333
It's waste.

186
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,166
Waste?

187
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:49,666
Come on.

188
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,166
Give this to you.

189
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:50,733
Come on.

190
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:53,333
Just kidding.

191
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:54,633
You can. Just kidding.

192
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,566
The last one.

193
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,666
Let's see who can win.

194
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,466
Carefully calculate the distance ...?

195
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:03,466
Just random it.

196
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,366
(Still missing)

197
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:13,900
I want this.

198
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:15,333
Come on. You won the prize.

199
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:16,766
You won the prize now.

200
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:19,533
Can't stop smiling.

201
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:24,600
It is a pity.

202
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,266
Thank you.

203
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,200
(Introducing Trophies)
This is the prize I won

204
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,066
I will take it home.

205
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah.

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,233
Congratulations, You win the prize

207
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,400
I dropped it.

208
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,133
Congratulations, take me home.

209
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,933
(Jame made himself a prize)

210
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:37,766
Wait a second.

211
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,500
Didn't we just win one?

212
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,500
Yes, we didn't get the prize.

213
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:45,266
It doesn't matter.

214
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,900
Jame's been talking a lot of love today

215
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,466
I already got you.

216
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,100
So it doesn't matter.

217
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,433
Great.

218
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,633
Let's the shop owner earn a little more.

219
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:01,333
We all forgot

220
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:02,600
what we just won

221
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,733
the marble game.

222
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,200
It's too difficult.

223
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:11,366
Now, let's play a mini game.

224
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,700
We're now in claw machine shop.

225
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:20,100
Let Orca take a picture of something in this shop and I will find it.

226
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,700
Take a picture and show it to me

227
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,400
I will find it.

228
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,466
Let's play a fun game with him.

229
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:28,433
Don’t find one that is too difficult.

230
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:29,866
Can we start now?

231
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:30,766
You have to.

232
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:32,033
Yes, do like this.

233
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:32,533
Okay.

234
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:33,833
Close your eyes.

235
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,866
Like this.

236
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,300
Don't open your eyes.

237
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,633
Let's go home.

238
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,333
(Naughty Jame)
You will back home now?

239
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:40,966
Okay, Okay.

240
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,866
Just kidding.

241
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,000
He just kidding.

242
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,700
Don't turn back.

243
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:51,866
(He picked a very private corner)

244
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,033
Okay.

245
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm ready now.

246
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,866
Let's see.

247
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,300
This one.

248
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
This one?

249
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,833
Melody in Glasses.

250
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,500
Can MingTing actually telepathize with Jame...?

251
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:24,200
Searched for the first time
and can't seem to find anything.

252
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,066
If you want more hints

253
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:30,033
you have to hold my hand first.

254
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,266
It's very close now.

255
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:40,066
MingTing got the hint
and started searching the high ground.

256
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,700
(Found it?)
This one?

257
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,966
No.

258
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:47,900
This one.

259
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,933
That's right.

260
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,666
He founded.

261
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:56,666
Just what I said, he would definitely not
choose one that is easy to find.

262
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,800
Okay

263
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I must let him
(Prepare for revenge)

264
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,766
look for.

265
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:15,433
Can't believe he picked the smallest picture on the package.

266
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,500
Okay.

267
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,600
This one is not easy.

268
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,066
I come.

269
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:28,366
(Jame: I'm afraid of losing, so I'll leave first)
Let's stop playing this. Let's go home. I'm sleepy now.

270
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,500
No, No.

271
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,566
Just kidding.

272
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
This one.

273
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:38,200
It must not be in the claw machine.

274
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,933
Go.

275
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,100
It must not be in the claw machine.

276
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,000
You can't lie to me.

277
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,600
It's in the claw machine.

278
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:43,166
You cannot trick me.

279
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,233
It must not be in the claw machine

280
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:45,500
I don't believe.

281
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,966
Jame is also in a tough battle.

282
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,033
Do you want some hints?

283
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:54,033
Yes, I do

284
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,266
on.

285
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,033
Come on.

286
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,033
What's the hints?

287
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:01,766
It's inside the claw machine.

288
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:02,966
Really?

289
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:03,866
I don't really believe it.

290
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:05,366
Here.

291
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,566
It's around here.?

292
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:07,266
Oh, this one
(Find it quickly after getting the hint!)

293
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,900
I found it
(Find it quickly after getting the hint!)

294
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,500
this one
(Find it quickly after getting the hint!)

295
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,133
He found it.

296
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:12,900
Right?

297
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,066
Yes.

298
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:16,300
It’s so big in the picture.

299
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,133
We're arrived.

300
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,266
This is also my memory.

301
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:26,133
So.

302
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,966
Let us be in my memory together.

303
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,133
(Has been waiting with his mouth open)
Thank you.

304
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:36,900
Delicious?

305
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,733
You like it?

306
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:38,433
It’s delicious.

307
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,900
Fans, take a screenshot of this!

308
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,200
Taking pictures of each other is so sweet.

309
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:24,600
Orca really likes the crispy pork ribs we just ate.

310
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,866
So we will buy more.

311
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,233
Today is a big success.

312
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:30,933
At least, there is the one thing he likes very much.

313
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,000
We come back to eat the first one

314
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,966
because I like it very much.

315
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,766
From the start of this video.

316
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,100
So delicious.

317
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,600
Yes, I really like it.

318
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,100
Do you want spicy?

319
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,333
Very spicy, please.

320
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,366
The boss filled it up with chili powder.

321
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:58,466
It's hot. It's hot.

322
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:00,233
It's okay now.

323
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,033
Okay?

324
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:02,666
(Go to the next tour)
Let's go to the temple.

325
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,033
We have finished eating today

326
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,066
and he is very happy now.

327
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,233
We all ate what we wanted

328
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,733
and ate a lot of my childhood memories.

329
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,433
Finally, we're here

330
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:14,333
to make a wish

331
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,566
I hope that everything goes well for us

332
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:19,133
I hope that our drama series will also go smoothly

333
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,800
and everyone will like it

334
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:27,133
I also hope that this drama will be successful.

335
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,366
And also

336
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:33,766
hope that after this drama becomes popular

337
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,766
we will have more and more chance to work together

338
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,933
in the second, third, fourth and fifth seasons
First Note of Fans should have wanted and wished for.

339
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,566
And the most important thing is that

340
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,500
if it becomes popular, we can shoot the second season

341
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,733
I will go to Thailand to find him.

342
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:44,733
Okay.

343
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:45,400
Okay, right?

344
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,466
Okay, Let make a wish now
