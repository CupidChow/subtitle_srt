1
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,847
Hands out.

2
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,265
Creating a theme that echoes

3
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,100
the vibe of Ocean Carousel.

4
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,668
Hmm, that's right.

5
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,439
Oh no, oh no!

6
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,174
I've already broken the limit.

7
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,111
Alright, this level is fine.

8
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,881
No, I'm riding for free.

9
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,917
I'll ride for free.

10
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,352
Alright, just do this later.

11
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,087
Come, come here, come here.

12
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,823
Hahaha.

13
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,525
Finding Nemo.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,962
Can you speak whale language?

15
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:14,374
Big fish, big fish.
What kind of fish do you like to eat?

16
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,576
I like to eat fish that speak slowly.

17
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,879
- OK, bye.
- Hahaha, that's right.

18
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,187
Here, here.

19
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,256
I'm starting to feel dizzy.

20
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,125
Hahaha.

21
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,096
- That's it.
- That's it.

22
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:37,664
Oh my god.

23
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:42,402
- Oh.
- Hahahahaha.

24
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,937
I'm too big for this.

25
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,978
Once, I rode the pirate ship for a record.

26
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,681
Five times in a day.

27
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,982
And lined up five times.

28
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,052
Almost, almost threw up.

29
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,787
Why ride it five times?

30
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,588
Challenge.

31
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,857
(You know) why I dare ride the pirate ship?

32
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,290
Why?

33
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,493
Because I'm the man who will become the Pirate King.

34
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,664
That kid.

35
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:12,465
Keeps staring at me.

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,002
Makes me a bit embarrassed.

37
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:17,871
Maybe they've never watched One Piece.

38
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,473
Maybe, but they know it as Pirate King.

39
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:24,844
Are you scared?

40
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,112
He is scared.

41
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,914
He's terrified.

42
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:28,715
Look at his face.

43
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,049
I'm swea... breaking into a cold sweat.

44
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,518
Can you cheer him up?

45
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,553
- Cheer up.
- Thank you.

46
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,421
- Hahaha.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,157
Here it comes.

48
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,198
I'm getting dizzy, I'm getting dizzy.

49
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:45,665
I'm about to...

50
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,469
Hahahaha.

51
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,541
I didn't expect it to be this high.

52
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,042
My stomach tickles, it tickles.

53
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,144
Scratch it, scratch it.

54
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,446
Hahaha.

55
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:01,915
That's enough, that's enough.

56
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,051
- Lower your center of gravity.
- Lower your center of gravity.

57
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,387
- I can't talk now.
- Haha.

58
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:10,757
Oh my god.

59
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,992
My hands were shaking for a moment.

60
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,060
Almost dropped my phone.

61
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,796
I'm actually feeling my age now.

62
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:17,530
It looks small...

63
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,532
- But actually...
- Because before...

64
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,200
Still felt it.

65
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,836
When I was 20 years old, playing on it.

66
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,905
That pirate ship.

67
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,174
But now, after about...

68
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,176
Five years without pirate ships.

69
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,979
Almost...

70
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,280
This isn't sweat.

71
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,114
It's cold sweat.

72
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,317
Here!

73
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,186
Hahaha.

74
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:46,292
Short legs, hahaha.

75
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:52,265
Hi.

76
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:56,002
Why do you keep saying hi to strangers?

77
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,870
That's what theme parks are for.

78
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,240
You'd be great as Mickey.

79
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,507
The Mickey in the mascot costume.

80
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,343
Like this. You'd totally fit.

81
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,345
We're already in a kid's amusement park...

82
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,679
we need to keep a childlike heart.

83
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,248
Childlike heart.

84
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,450
“Child” heart circle.

85
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,518
That's a concentric circle.

86
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,090
Oh no, I feel like throwing up.

87
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,058
Hahaha.

88
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,127
Stop spinning.

89
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,796
Wait, wait. Where am I? Where am I?

90
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:28,101
Hahaha, I'm laughing so hard I'm crying.

91
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,003
- Oh my God.
- Almost done, almost done.

92
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,738
- No, no.
- Hahaha.

93
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,545
Hahaha.

94
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,959
Everything I ate this week is coming out.

95
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,796
When you were doing that just now, it all came up to here.

96
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,864
I wasn't doing that.

97
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,766
- Yes, you were.
- No, I wasn't.

98
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:00,733
I only did this.

99
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,934
You were doing this and that and this.

100
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,671
No, it's not actually that weak.

101
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,105
Because we just ate.

102
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,907
You know there's a saying...

103
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,043
People with good balance get dizzy more easily.

104
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:14,547
- Yeah, it's true.
- It's true.

105
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,481
Why is that, though?

106
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,349
So that's why I got dizzy.

107
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,350
I have good balance.

108
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,985
We're fine doing this,

109
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,986
don't do it this way.

110
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,454
- This is fine.
- Oh.

111
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,156
Alright, alright. Let's go play.

112
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,558
- Okay.
- Let's go.

113
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,365
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

114
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:36,836
Do you feel dizzy?

115
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,937
Not at all.

116
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:38,871
- It's my specialty.
- Piece of cake.

117
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,139
Piece of cake.

118
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,343
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

119
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:50,450
Capybara, capybara, capybara.

120
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,318
Doo doo, pybara.

121
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,022
Capybara, da-da-da-da-da.

122
00:05:58,925 --> 00:05:59,859
Is it starting?

123
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,060
Here it comes, here it comes.

124
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,694
It's starting, it's starting.

125
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,729
It's actually quite high.

126
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,097
Not bad.

127
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,303
Wow.

128
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,440
- Wow.
- Turn right.

129
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,513
- Haha, turn right again.
- Turn right again.

130
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,916
Wow.

131
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,353
Wow, turn left.

132
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,323
Done.

133
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,759
We've arrived.

134
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,460
This was a piece of cake.

135
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,530
- Cake.
- A piece of cake.

136
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,129
Are you dizzy?

137
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:10,997
Are you dizzy?

138
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:14,867
- A little.
- A little.

139
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,312
It's that kid.

140
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,014
Bye-bye.
