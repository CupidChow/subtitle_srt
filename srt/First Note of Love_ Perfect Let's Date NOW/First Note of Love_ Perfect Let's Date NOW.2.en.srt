00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:02,869
(Preview)
Oh~ cute.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,509
Two male lions, just like us.

3
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,244
Oh, cow, cow, chicken.

4
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,946
Like us, like us.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,614
Actually, I'm a little afraid of this.

6
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,216
It makes me feel dizzy.

7
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,218
Oh~ GO!

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,020
Spicy, spicy, spicy.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,987
Spicy, spicy, spicy.

10
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,456
Which one do you want to eat?

11
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,425
You.

12
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,092
Me?

13
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,166
Orca,

14
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,001
look, the weather is great today.

15
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,269
It's a good day, right?

16
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,003
Yeah.

17
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,406
Today, I brought Orca to the amusement park.

18
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,407
Are you excited?

19
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,143
I just want to try the thrilling rides.

20
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,512
Today, we have to go on the roller coaster.

21
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,813
Which one is fun?

22
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,580
You have to take me there.

23
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,848
Want to try something thrilling?

24
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,417
That tall one, then.

25
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:50,950
Water rides?

26
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,520
Water rides? Maybe not today.

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,654
We didn't bring clothes.

28
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,389
Then we can't watch you take off your clothes.

29
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,125
Then we'll watch at home.

30
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,593
OK.

31
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,594
I'm not going, let's go home.

32
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,962
Let's go have fun!

33
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,265
OK.

34
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,173
So cute.

35
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:15,708
Just like me.

36
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,010
Definitely.

37
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,380
We're going to find the animals!

38
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,047
Go!

39
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,151
What animals do you like?

40
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,520
Lions.

41
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,123
And you?

42
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,124
Guess what I like?

43
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,193
Me.

44
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:34,928
Yes.

45
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:41,734
You stole my answer, I was going to say that.

46
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,270
Okay, what do you really like?

47
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,972
I don't really know.

48
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:46,873
You don't know?

49
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:47,974
I just??

50
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,776
Like a lot of animals.

51
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,010
So you don't really,

52
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,645
So I don't really have one.

53
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:53,613
Oh~ lions.

54
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,583
Right, that's a white tiger.

55
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,088
Cute.

56
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,891
I'm not giving it to you.

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,895
Just kidding.

58
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,899
We are cute.

59
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,934
Hello.

60
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,136
So cute.

61
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,270
I want to ride that.

62
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,772
No, you'll break it.

63
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,940
A bigger one?

64
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,142
Then just...

65
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:22,942
Ride me.

66
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,244
OK

67
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,379
Ready?

68
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,749
We're here for the animals to see us.

69
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:30,884
So we need rules.

70
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,052
We should take off our clothes,

71
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,387
for the animals.

72
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,688
Again?

73
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,490
Sure, you go first.

74
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,658
No~

75
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,894
You first.

76
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,966
The animals here

77
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,102
are different from the ones in Thailand.

78
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,937
The animals here look pretty sturdy, I've seen a few.

79
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:51,838
They don't move much.

80
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,939
Kind of stiff.

81
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,311
Just kidding.

82
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,480
Sexy.

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,448
Showing too much skin.

84
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,524
Sheep, sheep.

85
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,660
She wants to eat.

86
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,563
Food.

87
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,001
No~

88
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:28,942
Lazy.

89
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,743
Very lazy.

90
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,645
Enough. You ate too much!

91
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,681
Now all the food is gone.

92
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,515
What are we going to eat?

93
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,616
What are we going to eat?

94
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,351
All the food is gone. What are we going to eat?

95
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,554
What do you want to eat?

96
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,906
We're heading to the carnivora area next.

97
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,474
Tour bus.

98
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,743
What animals are there?

99
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,112
There are lions.

100
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,481
And maybe tigers.

101
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,117
Who's scarier, you or the tiger?

102
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,852
The tiger or me?

103
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,821
You're scarier.

104
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:15,888
In Mandarin?

105
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,323
Tiger.

106
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,291
In Thai?

107
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,928
Yes.

108
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,633
In Thai, the word "tiger" can also refer to
someonewho is a player.

109
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,948
Tiger.

110
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,351
Ah, a white tiger!

111
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,953
Is there?

112
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:48,888
What?

113
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,794
He's a lion from a BL drama.

114
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,563
Because...

115
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,332
he left the lioness alone.

116
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,434
Just like us.

117
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,702
Two male lions.

118
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,237
Just like us.

119
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,706
Like us. Like us.

120
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,142
You're a tiger.

121
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,643
I'm a tiger? I'm not a tiger.

122
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,546
No, you are a tiger.

123
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,917
OK.

124
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:18,651
Thank you.

125
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,286
Thank you, thank you.

126
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,588
Where are we going next?

127
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,257
Where are we going next?

128
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,592
We are going to have lunch!

129
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,361
Go!

130
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,662
Are you hungry?

131
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,396
Yes.

132
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,466
Which one do you want to eat?

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,168
You.

134
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:35,968
Me?

135
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,238
Just kidding.

136
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,473
OK

137
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,008
Or let's go back home.

138
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,975
Go back, go back.

139
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,544
Go home.

140
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,579
Jame!

141
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,916
Let's eat!

142
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:53,820
Yours is here.

143
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,121
Thank you.

144
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,258
How is it?

145
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,227
It's delicious.

146
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,729
Dip it in this.

147
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,229
Huh?

148
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:03,763
Yes.

149
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:04,630
Really?

150
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,436
Really?

151
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,037
No.

152
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,206
I want beef.

153
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,475
I want beef.

154
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,844
Cheers.

155
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,714
One pose.

156
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,119
Next pose.

157
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,920
Good!

158
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,089
Last one, last one.

159
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:33,960
Good!

160
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,264
Really?

161
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,265
Yeah~

162
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,871
Now we're going to ride the carousel.

163
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,673
Pony.

164
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,409
Little pony.

165
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:54,814
Go!

166
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,458
Actually, I'm really scared of this.

167
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,826
It makes me dizzy.

168
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,863
Hurry up.

169
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,865
Hurry, keep up.

170
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:13,933
Keep up.

171
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,869
A lot of people are watching us.

172
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,872
Yeah.

173
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:20,873
Yes, yes.

174
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:21,974
We're kids.

175
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,276
A lot of kids are watching us.

176
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,811
They're thinking, what???

177
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,546
Why???

178
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,648
Why are we playing this???

179
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,016
You should film the kids.

180
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,384
The kids keep watching us.

181
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:34,821
OK.

182
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,523
Be careful, be careful.

183
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,427
We're done.

184
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,064
A lot of kids are watching us.

185
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,866
A lot of girls are watching.

186
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,034
You two burly men,

187
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,969
Why are you playing this?

188
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,771
It's really been years.

189
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,739
I haven't ridden this kind of thing for about ten years.

190
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,907
What about you?

191
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,042
Me too.

192
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,978
I'm really happy to be able to play with him.

193
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,545
Really?

194
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,179
Yes.

195
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,247
Me too.

196
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,917
Then let's go to the next one.

197
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:05,618
Let's go!

198
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,256
Ready.

199
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:11,757
Go!

200
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,098
Go!

201
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,606
Maybe an English shot?

202
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,322
For you.

203
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,592
No.

204
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:48,828
I want it.

205
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:50,997
OK.

206
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,498
Let's go.

207
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,707
Fighting!

208
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,709
Let's go, let's go.

209
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,343
Go!

210
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,651
Are you afraid?

211
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,585
No.

212
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,619
I am afraid.

213
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,787
Really?

214
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:15,888
Just kidding.

215
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,658
Just kidding.

216
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,995
Just kidding.

217
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,336
Go!

218
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,781
Piece of cake.

219
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:20,720
Minting called out.

220
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,825
Reese, you were scared.

221
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,893
No.

222
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,495
Piece of cake.

223
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:30,663
Piece of cake.

224
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,000
So, let's go on this one!

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,334
No.

226
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,971
After you.

227
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,872
No.

228
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,342
Potato!

229
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,944
The one I mentioned!

230
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,646
This is not complete.

231
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,581
You have to finish it for me.

232
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,016
You have to select the seasoning.

233
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,350
I know him very well.

234
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,685
I know what he likes.

235
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,020
He has to guess what I like to eat.

236
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,522
He definitely wants chili.

237
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:58,791
Chili first.

238
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,825
Yeah.

239
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,293
OK.

240
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,662
Spicy, spicy.

241
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,597
Spicy, spicy, spicy, spicy, spicy.

242
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,734
And there's another flavor I want.

243
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,469
The other one is this.

244
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,170
Yes.

245
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,039
Yes, yes.

246
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,440
Should I add a lot?

247
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:15,875
A lot?

248
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,144
A lot.

249
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,680
Won't it be too salty?

250
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,115
A ton.

251
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,316
Reese.

252
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,988
Did I season it well?

253
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,127
Choked on it.

254
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,168
It's good.

255
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,404
It's good.

256
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,208
But a bit spicy.

257
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,309
A bit spicy.

258
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,188
Here's 1000 for you.

259
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,255
Line pay.

260
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,157
1000 for me?

261
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:05,925
Yes.

262
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,294
Here you go.

263
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:09,995
Finished.

264
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,764
And he's asking me for money.

265
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,332
Is it cute?

266
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,834
Of course, it's cute.

267
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,078
Next, I'm taking Orca for dessert.

268
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,280
Dessert!

269
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,218
I'm very happy today.

270
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,120
Reese and I have become closer.

271
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,688
We've had the chance to understand each other better.

272
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:39,425
Understanding what food each other likes and dislikes.

273
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,161
We get to know each other more,

274
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,897
We're getting closer.

275
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:49,235
Whether he's treating me to meals or helping me fix my clothes,

276
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:54,940
We've had great conversations, like good friends.

277
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,111
Even with the language barrier, we can still joke around.

278
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:03,616
So, I want to go out with Reese more often.

279
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:10,923
It would be great to hang out together almost every day.

280
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,192
I'm also very happy, because

281
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:18,297
I took Orca to the amusement park in Taiwan.

282
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,900
I haven't been here in a long time.

283
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,737
I can experience so many things with him.

284
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,038
Like watching animals.

285
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,807
And riding roller coasters together.

286
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,976
So I'm also very happy today.

287
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,312
I'm looking forward to the next trip even more.

288
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,415
Now, let's eat.

289
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,083
Eat!

290
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,333
He finished all the food!

291
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,435
Very good, a kid who doesn't waste.

292
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,038
- Is it good? Do you like it?
- I like it.
