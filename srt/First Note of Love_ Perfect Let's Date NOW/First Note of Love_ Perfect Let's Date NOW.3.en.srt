1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,233
Baby, baby.

2
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:05,466
You’re my baby, too.

3
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:06,500
Be careful.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,400
His face already reveals some secrets.

5
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,066
I’ll have one too.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,300
Jump into the sea competition.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,133
The one loses has to jump into the sea?

8
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:22,500
No, no, no.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,366
No, no, no.

10
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,466
Look how it goes.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,200
Isn’t it like this first?

12
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:34,166
Today, for our date,

13
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,300
I’m bringing Orca

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,933
To know about some famous Taiwanese tradition,

15
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:39,500
which is shopping for the New Year.

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,033
So today, I’m taking him to Dihua district.

17
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:47,300
Do you have this kind of tradition in Thailand?

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,200
Buying things to eat for the New Year.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,500
Yes, yes.

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,900
What do you usually buy?

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,900
You.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,300
Except me.

23
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:59,300
For New Year,

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,166
I buy games.

25
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:05,233
Now we’re going to a famous shop called "June 1st,”

26
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,466
so he can bring it back to Thailand.

27
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,166
Take it back with him.

28
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,266
Go!

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,766
Hello.

30
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:21,566
Hello.

31
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:23,133
så-wǎd-diī-khrãb

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,400
Can you speak Thai?

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,666
Speak…Thai.

34
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,600
We’ll say

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,500
så-wǎd-diī-khrãb

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,300
You’ll say

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,000
så-wǎd-diī-khà

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,033
For women, it should be shorter, "khà."

39
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:35,633
Khrãb is for men.

40
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:37,466
Yes, yes, så-wǎd-diī-khrãb.

41
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:40,233
It’s now turned into a Thai language class.

42
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,000
Might as well share this with you.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,200
There are actually different pronunciations
for men and women.

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,433
What flavor of egg roll does Orca want?

45
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,433
Pork.

46
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,466
Means pork.

47
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,433
Pork.

48
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,433
I want this.

49
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,233
You want this?

50
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:56,433
I know why he chose this one.

51
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,433
Because this one’s spicy.

52
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,633
I want to have this but I want 20 boxes.

53
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:01,966
20 boxes?

54
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:03,566
Sure, sure.

55
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:05,400
I’ll buy you whatever you want.

56
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,466
Just kidding.

57
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:09,400
You could take some back for your mom, too.

58
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,933
For my mom.

59
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:12,133
Oh right, right, for mom.

60
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,833
But this isn’t egg rolls.

61
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,433
You should buy egg rolls.

62
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,300
Try one first.

63
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:23,433
Very particular about cleanliness.

64
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,200
Very nice.

65
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,033
We’re also educating everyone about washing hands.

66
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:28,833
I’ll let him try one first.

67
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,600
This is…

68
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,333
Original first.

69
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,633
He’s pretty picky.

70
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:34,233
Original first.

71
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,733
I’ll have one too.

72
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,133
Which one do you like?

73
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,733
Try again?

74
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:50,866
He is choosing between these two.

75
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:51,466
This one, this one.

76
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,400
Let's take one sesame flavor,

77
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
And one…

78
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,566
Thank you.

79
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:57,400
Sea sedge（X）

80
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,166
Pork floss（O）

81
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,166
For mom.

82
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,733
Sure, sure.

83
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,300
Car, car.

84
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,233
This is also considered famous.

85
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:11,633
It’s also a famous strawberry daifuku shop.

86
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:12,600
I want it, I want it.

87
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,133
You want it? He wants it.

88
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,666
He wants it.

89
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,833
Thank you.

90
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,333
Thank you.

91
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,533
Good.

92
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:32,666
Good.

93
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,266
Yes.

94
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,933
Good means,

95
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:35,366
Good!

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,733
Hmm~ means "very good."

97
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,133
Ummm,

98
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,500
Yes.

99
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,166
I know exactly what he’s up to.

100
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,500
We’re now going to the City God Temple to pray.

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,966
Pray to Yue Lao(The God of Love).

102
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,866
Praying for everyone’s relationships.

103
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,366
Hoping you can find a good partner.

104
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:54,333
I hope to have many partners.

105
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,533
He hopes for many partners?

106
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:56,266
Yes.

107
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,500
You hope...

108
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,533
Just kidding.

109
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,733
How can there be many partners?

110
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,200
It should only be me.

111
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,100
Only me

112
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,133
Oh no no no.

113
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:04,200
Only me.

114
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:05,500
Why you do this?

115
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,000
Very famous.

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,500
A place to pray for love.

117
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,366
Today I brought Orca here to pray,

118
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:19,500
not to pray for us.

119
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
We want to pray for you all.

120
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
For our fans, praying for you all.

121
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,200
Hoping you can find

122
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,300
a partner you like.

123
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,766
Yes.

124
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,400
To hear the first note of love.

125
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:29,733
And join us to,

126
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,533
hear the first note of love.

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,066
Good one.

128
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:37,633
We hope our fans can be like us,

129
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:39,400
loving each other.

130
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,900
And hear the first note of love.

131
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,533
First note of love.

132
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,066
Next, we're heading to the pier.

133
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,733
To the pier.

134
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Baby.

135
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,466
You're my baby too.

136
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:53,500
Be careful.

137
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,500
Car, car.

138
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,266
Thank you.

139
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,066
Sure, sure.

140
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:01,866
Local food

141
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,400
Local tradition.

142
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,333
Orca is going to try Four-Herbal Soup.

143
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,366
I, Reese, actually

144
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:09,233
doesn’t like Four-Herbal Soup.

145
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,133
But I can still join him.

146
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:13,566
Join him to try it.

147
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,866
I don’t like this too.

148
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:17,933
But he called me to come here.

149
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,300
Oh, I’m just kidding.

150
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,733
Just kidding.

151
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:23,033
Just kidding.

152
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,433
Oh no I’m just kidding, actually I like eating this.

153
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:26,566
Right, let’s try it.

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,900
A little hot.

155
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,066
Like it?

156
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,300
No?

157
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,666
I like it.

158
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:51,300
His face

159
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,033
has already revealed some secrets.

160
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,733
But the intestines are very soft.

161
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,100
I mean they cooked them so soft.

162
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,000
Does that mean this is good for health?

163
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,266
Is it good for the body?

164
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:02,266
Actually, yes.

165
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,566
Because it has Chinese medicinal ingredients.

166
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:05,600
And Job’s tears, which is very good for the body.

167
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,866
Good, good.

168
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,666
Good?

169
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Then finish it.

170
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
I'll give it to you.

171
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,966
You said it’s good, finish it then.

172
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:14,500
I’ll give it to you.

173
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,566
This video was taken

174
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:18,500
near my house.

175
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
My house is at Wongwian Yai, so close.

176
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,200
Your hometown looks like this place?

177
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,033
Yeah, yeah.

178
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,300
Dancing, dancing.

179
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,366
Go!

180
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,833
I want to play with it(the dog)!

181
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,533
Can you call it over?

182
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,400
This one? Dog?

183
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,900
Can you call it over to me?

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,266
It's beautiful.

185
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:46,066
Yes.

186
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,533
Let’s play the game.

187
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:53,500
Jump into the sea competition.

188
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,966
The one loses has to jump into the sea?

189
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,400
Ok, you go first.

190
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,566
Shall I start first?

191
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:58,333
Ok, come on.

192
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,300
