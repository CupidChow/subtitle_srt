1
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:06,099
Today, I brought Orca to make perfume.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,333
Because our birthdays are both in October,

3
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,133
we're Libra babies!

4
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:11,066
We're going to choose a scent that we think

5
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:12,166
the other person will like.

6
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,533
We'll both pick a scent we believe the other one will love,

7
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:16,999
and give it to each other as a birthday gift.

8
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,866
Today, I brought Orca to make perfume.

9
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:42,966
And as you can see here,

10
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,399
there are 36 different scents.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,100
And later,

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,366
we'll mix a scent that the other person will like.

13
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:50,466
Today is pretty special,

14
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:52,566
since both of our birthdays are in October.

15
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:54,199
We're both Libra babies!

16
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,366
To me?

17
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:58,266
To you!

18
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:58,999
This one?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,533
Yeah.

20
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:01,799
I want PS5.

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,833
Okay.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,033
Oh, no, no, no.

23
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:08,366
Just kidding.

24
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:09,966
This one this one.

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,866
It has to be made by you

26
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:14,833
and must contain your scent.

27
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,366
Come, smell my scent then.

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,966
He likes my scent better.

29
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:21,399
Then we can call it a day. Let's go.

30
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:23,199
Just kidding.

31
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:27,166
Let's be serious today.

32
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,133
Be serious, be serious.

33
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:30,799
We'll add a bit of it later, okay?

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,200
We'll add a bit later.

35
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,266
Alright, today we're here to make perfume.

36
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,533
And we'll,

37
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:39,433
Choose a scent we think the other person will like,

38
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,399
mix a scent we believe the other one will enjoy,

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,200
and give it to each other as a birthday gift.

40
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:46,099
What's on your mind?

41
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,200
I was thinking

42
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,366
how should we cut it, or we use scissors.

43
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,399
He's joking around again.

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,400
No, I'm seriuos.

45
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,200
Seriously.

46
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,800
No kidding!

47
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,566
I'm serious.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,566
I'm serious.

49
00:01:58,566 --> 00:01:59,299
He can understand me.

50
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:01,999
He's getting better.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Go on.

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,000
I think

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,533
it's gonna be fun

54
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,533
because I've never done this before.

55
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:11,666
And I feel like.

56
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,599
It's very good to

57
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,266
choose the scent

58
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:16,533
and create the perfume by myself

59
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,866
for my special person.

60
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,033
Something like that.

61
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,799
Okay, let's have the instructor teach us

62
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,600
how to make a perfume.

63
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,099
Ok, we're starting to make the perfume now.

64
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:37,833
Like this.

65
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,533
You can try first.

66
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,066
The scent of lemon.

67
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,933
Smells nice!

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,433
Okay.

69
00:02:58,433 --> 00:02:58,966
Alright.

70
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:06,666
Let's see what suits him.

71
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:08,833
First, there has to be spiciness.

72
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,000
He likes spicy food.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,566
The perfume should be spicy too.

74
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:16,866
It's that kind of slightly spicy scent.

75
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:17,966
But not exactly like

76
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:23,133
the chili pepper smell we thought.

77
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,700
Okay, he likes spicy things.

78
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,333
I believe he'll definitely like it.

79
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
But spicy perfume

80
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,900
seems like a really weird concept.

81
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,466
Don't do it.

82
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,766
I don't know what he's saying,

83
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:40,333
but I know he's joking again.

84
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,766
Don't do it.

85
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:44,066
Spicy food is fine, the perfume is no need no be spicy.

86
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,300
I would like floral scents or fruit

87
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,200
I don't want spicy.

88
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:51,899
And fruit.

89
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,166
Let me add a…

90
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,099
Is there durian?

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,966
You don't like me.

92
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:03,299
I think this suits him well.

93
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:06,366
He gets a vibe like…

94
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:12,333
somewhat like a lavender scent.

95
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,600
Ummm smells good.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,266
Smells good right?

97
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,900
Let me. Ummm smells good.

98
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:28,766
I think I'm finished.

99
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:31,166
He will definitely love this scent.

100
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,366
I chose pomelo,

101
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,066
lavender,

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,066
camellia and orange.

103
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:45,499
This is a blend of floral and fruity notes.

104
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:47,766
So I think he

105
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:50,066
will definitely love this birthday gift.

106
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,933
I wanted to say

107
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,733
the one he chose is my favorite

108
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:56,833
because I love

109
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,499
fruit-scented perfume

110
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,200
I really love fruit-scented stuff

111
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
and he has never known that before

112
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,966
that I love

113
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:07,466
fruit scents.

114
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,633
So I was thinking

115
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:11,333
why he chose this fruit-scented.

116
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,966
Mine will be adjusted a little

117
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:15,366
maybe less this one

118
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:16,899
and more White Wood.

119
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,733
Because I feel like

120
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,366
I don't know how to say it.

121
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:25,299
It's like there is sexy in the gentleness.

122
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,500
So, in his mind, I'm only sexy.

123
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:37,999
Smells nice.

124
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,666
Now mine is a bit messy

125
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,799
maybe we wait until it's done.

126
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,400
Is it okay?

127
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,266
Yes, it's fine.

128
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:45,399
Smells really nice.

129
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,133
Oh, smells good~.

130
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,100
Tell me the truth.

131
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,799
Say it, how is it?

132
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,866
It's a very complex scent.

133
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,700
A very complex scent.

134
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,200
Teacher,

135
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:09,599
was frowning.

136
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,100
The teacher was frowning.

137
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,700
The teacher was like…

138
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,100
Teacher is confused.

139
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,799
Hmm, a bit better.

140
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,466
Now it smells like a bathroom.

141
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,666
Bathroom.

142
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,666
It doesn't!

143
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,566
It smells like bathroom cleaner.

144
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:38,999
You are a bad guy!

145
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:41,499
Bathroom, bathroom.

146
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:45,099
Because I like bathroom.

147
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:46,733
He likes bathrooms.

148
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:48,966
Yeah, he likes going to the bathroom.

149
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,833
So he gave me what he likes the most.

150
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,366
Yes.

151
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,300
Well, that's kind of sweet.

152
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,733
Alright, let's go with this bathroom scent.

153
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,133
Because sexy.

154
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,533
Bathroom is sexy.

155
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,366
Sexy, bathroom is sexy.

156
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:16,933
Sexy.

157
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:20,299
It's like you are taking a bath when using this.

158
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:42,800
Now, as the teacher just mentioned,

159
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,733
we can choose a color for each other.

160
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,500
And I think Orca,

161
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,766
is like the sun in my heart.

162
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:51,133
Always bringing me warmth.

163
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,266
So, I decided to choose the color of the sun.

164
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:54,966
Yellow.

165
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,233
You can't choose, can you?

166
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,200
You can't decide, right?

167
00:09:59,133 --> 00:09:59,933
Yes.

168
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,666
Then, I'll give you a suggestion.

169
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:04,033
Orange.

170
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,000
Why?

171
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,300
Because,

172
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,800
you're the only one I 'peel' for.

173
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:11,966
Thank you.

174
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,533
Though I don't understand.

175
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,333
He's the only one I 'peel' for.

176
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,866
I'm also the only one you 'peel' for.

177
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:27,900
The only one.

178
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,200
Okay, okay.

179
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,800
We've finished mixing it.

180
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,733
Now, we need to put this perfume into

181
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,266
a bottle.

182
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,866
And we need to choose a bottle.

183
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:45,333
You record videos for me every day

184
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,366
to prove that you actually use it.

185
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,466
Wait, wait.

186
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:50,500
Just kidding.

187
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,000
When he goes back to Thailand, and isn't here,

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,733
This smell would remind me of him.

189
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,800
Take it. Bathroom every day.

190
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,133
I choose this one.

191
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:14,666
I choose this one.

192
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,433
Happy birthday!

193
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:27,233
Thank you.

194
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,466
The sun.

195
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,033
He drew me.

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,566
Happy birthday!

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,833
Thank you.

198
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,166
I got this one!

199
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,133
He must be thinking,

200
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,900
“glad I got this one.”

201
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:03,233
No, I like this one, too.

202
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,900
It's all about…yeah.

203
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,866
If you

204
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:08,500
It's from him, so it feels nice.

205
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,666
If you are not using it

206
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,233
you can just keep it

207
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:12,100
I'll use it.

208
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,666
Because when he goes back to Thailand, I'm alone in Taiwan,

209
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,800
as long as I spray this, I'll think of him.

210
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,033
Really?

211
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:19,400
Yes.

212
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,666
Bathroom.

213
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,266
Just kidding. Happy birthday.

214
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,466
Happy birthday!

215
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,333
The fruity-scented perfume I made for you.

216
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:34,266
Hope you have a happy birthday.

217
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,933
Happy birthday!

218
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:38,166
Here you go~

219
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,800
Here you go~

220
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,766
Thank you, thank you.

221
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:41,766
Thank you.
