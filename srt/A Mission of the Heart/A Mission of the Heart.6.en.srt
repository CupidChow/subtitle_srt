[A Mission of the Heart]

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,880
[Episode 6]

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,920
Chen Zhao from the Ministry of Personnel

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,840
actually died in a brothel.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,580
This is no trivial matter.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,210
There are no obvious wounds
on Chen Zhao's body.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,630
How did he die?

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,320
Could it be from taking love potions?

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,920
Be careful.

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,740
There might still be love potions
in there.

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,620
Take the cup back for inspection.

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes.

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,030
Lord Shen, come here.

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,260
Let's reconstruct the scene.

15
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:14,060
All the valuables are gone.

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,440
My Lord.

17
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,690
Why are you suddenly so angry?

18
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,870
You're so fond
of reconstructing the scene, aren't you?

19
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,630
Zhao,

20
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:32,259
you take Huang Yu's place.

21
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,039
I...

22
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,170
Wait.

23
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:37,920
I'm only interested in women.

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,670
As for men,

25
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,550
I have no interest.

26
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,720
But why did Chen Zhao

27
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,460
kill Liu Mei'er?

28
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:52,850
No,

29
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,330
it wasn't Chen Zhao.

30
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:54,970
Why?

31
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,160
Their body temperatures are different.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,759
Chen Zhao died earlier.

33
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,030
Yu, you can even do autopsies?

34
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,520
It never hurts to have more skills.

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,630
I'm just trying to make a living.

36
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,100
My Lord,

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,150
this will cost extra.

38
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,570
No problem.

39
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,990
I'm sure

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,320
Lord Shen will be willing to pay.

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,480
Of course.

42
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,860
I'll go right away.

43
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
I've found a clue!

44
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,930
Look at this.

45
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,470
Under Liu Mei'er's fingernails,

46
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,880
there are bloodstained skin fragments.

47
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,990
This proves that before her death,

48
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,100
she had a confrontation with someone.

49
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,110
Liu Mei'er's body

50
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,990
shows signs of being moved manually.

51
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,150
In other words,

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,829
there was likely

53
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,640
a third person at the scene.

54
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,030
Do you think

55
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,560
Liu Mei'er's death

56
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,550
could be related to the thief?

57
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,650
We can't rule out that possibility.

58
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,260
Huang Yu.

59
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,950
Have you figured out the cause
of Chen Zhao's death?

60
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,440
No, further examination is needed.

61
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,720
But we need his family's permission.

62
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,770
After all, it doesn't look like
he died an unnatural death.

63
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,100
If I perform an autopsy,

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,720
there'll inevitably be scratches
on the body.

65
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,570
Zhao.

66
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,510
My Lord.

67
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Go to the Chen Mansion immediately.

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,040
Yes.

69
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,440
With all these clues,

70
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,250
if you still can't solve the case,
Lord Shen,

71
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,620
it'll only prove

72
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,950
your Ministry of Punishments
is full of useless fools.

73
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,280
My Lord,

74
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,980
couldn't you just put it nicely

75
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,510
instead of making enemies?

76
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,630
It's fine.

77
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,340
I will solve this case soon.

78
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,700
Well, Lord Lu,

79
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,760
you should worry about yourself.

80
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,840
About the official silver case,

81
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,920
His Majesty only gave you 3 months.

82
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,440
Lord Shen,

83
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,930
that's none of your concern.

84
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,130
What are you thinking about?

85
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,750
Nothing. Nothing at all.

86
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,890
It just occurred to me

87
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,070
that I have something to do.

88
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,350
I'll take my leave now.

89
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,780
Farewell, Lord Shen.

90
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,290
Lord Shen is so kind.

91
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,240
All the money was given to me.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,970
Otherwise, I would have

93
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,830
had to give Lu Sanliang the money.

94
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,530
Lu Sanliang, is it?

95
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,440
Officer Huang,

96
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,750
we have a score

97
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,750
to settle, don't we?

98
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,140
My waist...

99
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,850
Help me up now!

100
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,490
Why should I help you apply medicine?

101
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,310
You have the nerve to say that?

102
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,650
It's all your fault!

103
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,050
Right here?

104
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,860
Don't worry, My Lord.

105
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,710
I won't ask you to take care of me.

106
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,880
You expect me to take care of you,

107
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,520
just because you fell down?

108
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,370
Officer Huang!

109
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,909
Officer Huang!

110
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:01,930
What's wrong?

111
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,010
My Lord.

112
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,060
Why are you...

113
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,690
What's the matter?

114
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,870
Well,

115
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,360
Mrs. Chen

116
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,370
refuses to allow an autopsy
on Lord Chen's body.

117
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,120
This is Shen Pan's case.

118
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,200
Just report it to him truthfully.

119
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,690
Yes.

120
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,880
Don't worry.

121
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,500
I won't ask you for the money.

122
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,850
You could have said so earlier!

123
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,600
Officer Huang,

124
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,430
in your eyes,

125
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,280
am I really such a stingy person?

126
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,230
Aren't you?

127
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,700
Shall I help refresh your memory?

128
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,340
Lord Shen,

129
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,500
these are the exact words from Lord Lu.

130
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,560
Please pass on my thanks to your lord.

131
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,020
You're welcome.

132
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,990
I'll take my leave.

133
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:18,890
Mao.

134
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,580
Look for anyone

135
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,530
at Xiafeng House

136
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,420
with a piece missing from their clothing.

137
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,330
Yes, My Lord.

138
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,560
And anyone with scratch marks
on them.

139
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,290
Understood.

140
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,000
Do you really enjoy performing autopsies?

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,780
Yes, I do.

142
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,960
Then why didn't you keep working
as a coroner?

143
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,880
With your skills,

144
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,460
you could've become

145
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,990
a pretty good coroner.

146
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,310
I also wish I could,

147
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,090
but it's not that simple.

148
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,060
In this world,

149
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,460
it's hard enough for ordinary people

150
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,410
without connections to get a job.

151
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,030
And for a woman like me,

152
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,740
it's even harder.

153
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,680
My Lord, you...

154
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,430
From now on,

155
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,030
you can keep doing what you like.

156
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,720
Really?

157
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,340
It'd be even better
if my salary could be raised.

158
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,220
My Lord, are you hungry?

159
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,840
What would you like to eat?
I'll make it for you.

160
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,110
Anything is fine.

161
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,420
Then I'll just make something simple.

162
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
I never knew

163
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,070
a woman's hair

164
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,060
could be so soft.

165
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,790
Where did it go?

166
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,880
Are you looking for this thing?
