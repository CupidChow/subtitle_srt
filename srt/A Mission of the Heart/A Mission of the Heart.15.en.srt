[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,910
[Episode 15]

3
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,700
My Lord?

4
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,490
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:53,990
Zhao.

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,440
Zhao.

7
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,770
Yu kissed me.

8
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,410
Kiss?

9
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,570
Great news!

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,120
Terrific.

11
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,760
What did I tell you?

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,050
Yu definitely has a place for me
in her heart.

13
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,980
Yes. That's what I've been saying.

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,700
She must have feelings for you.

15
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,730
She likes me.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,330
Yes!

17
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,890
That's right.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,680
Zhao.

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,740
Do some martial practice with me.

20
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,759
My Lord,

21
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,380
it's already midnight.

22
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,090
It's quite late.
Let's get back in for some rest.

23
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,200
Why the rush?

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,130
It's only midnight.

25
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,740
We've got much time.

26
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:57,300
Freeze!

27
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,450
Lord Shen is holding an umbrella
for Officer Huang.

28
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,890
How thoughtful.

29
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,120
So romantic.

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,290
Using an umbrella in broad daylight...
Seems shady.

31
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,880
Something's off with him.

32
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,190
Lord Shen,

33
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,440
aren't we already good friends?

34
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,320
No need to go to all this trouble.

35
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,250
How come...

36
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,090
Why is your son such a simpleton?

37
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,590
After taking the drug,

38
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,470
he still failed to win this girl over.

39
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,090
He could've secured a wife for himself.

40
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,740
Now,
another guy is about to steal her away.

41
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,140
You're right. He's such a disappointment.

42
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,950
Lord Shen,

43
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,370
thank you
for teaching me lightness skills.

44
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,829
Eat up. It's my treat today.

45
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:27,690
Help yourself.

46
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,850
It looks like you've made a fortune, Yu.

47
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,340
Lord Lu gave me a handsome reward.

48
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,360
Really?

49
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,030
I'll enjoy this feast then.

50
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,940
Is it good, Yu?

51
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,040
Yes, very tasty.

52
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,940
Let me try this.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,900
Delicious!

54
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,380
My Lord,

55
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,520
won't you go over there

56
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,090
to beat up Lord Shen?

57
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,420
Why would I do that?

58
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,790
Do I look like a petty man?

59
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,750
You coward!

60
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,610
Who is it?

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
Mother.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,880
Father.

63
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,040
What brings you here?

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,450
Come on, sit down.

65
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,320
Mr. Lu, Mrs. Lu.

66
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,399
I had to come

67
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,660
to make sure I'll have a daughter-in-law.

68
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,270
Finally, there's a girl
who can handle having you around.

69
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,950
If Shen Pan steals her away,

70
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,310
I'll be devastated, won't I?

71
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,920
Honey,

72
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,150
our son

73
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,010
is not as terrible as you said.

74
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,390
He's adored by many girls.

75
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,840
Shut up.

76
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,330
Mother,

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,830
I can deal with this.

78
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,690
You've never even held hands with a girl.

79
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,120
How are you able to deal with this?

80
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,670
I...

81
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,010
Isn't that Shen Pan's close female friend?

82
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,450
I have an idea.

83
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,720
Mother,

84
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,970
I've worked out a solution.

85
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,880
Nonetheless,

86
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,200
I need your help to put on a little show.

87
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,760
Did you enjoy it, Yu? Was it good?

88
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,710
Lord Shen!

89
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,180
Ms. Su?

90
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,740
I have a favor to ask you.

91
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,110
Will you lend me a helping hand,
Lord Shen?

92
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,690
Well...

93
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,340
Lord Shen, attend to your matters first.

94
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,870
Mine are not urgent anyway.

95
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,870
I happen to need to go to
the Northern Inspection Division.

96
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,130
I'll take my leave now.

97
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,570
Yu...

98
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,420
Lord Shen.

99
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,960
What's the matter?

100
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,020
Let's talk inside.

101
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:33,850
Son,

102
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,520
if you put in some effort,

103
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,510
you won't have trouble finding a wife.

104
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,490
Exactly.

105
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,710
No other girls are like Yu.

106
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,860
Why should I bother courting them?

107
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,350
Madam!

108
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,570
Are you alright?

109
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,930
Shall I take you to a clinic?

110
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,280
I'm all fine, miss.

111
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,250
Oh, it's you, Yu.

112
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,340
You are...

113
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,660
Mrs. Lu!

114
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,770
Don't call me "Mrs. Lu."

115
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,590
Call me "Auntie" instead.

116
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,220
Auntie...

117
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,230
Thank you, Auntie!

118
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,350
What are you thanking me for?

119
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,970
The deed
that you asked Commander Li

120
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,430
to deliver to me last time.

121
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,170
I'm the one owing you thanks
for saving my life.

122
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,210
Listen,

123
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,490
we the Lu family are very wealthy.

124
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,610
I would've offered you an entire vault,

125
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,010
if it hadn't been for the fear
of drawing unwanted attention.

126
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,750
An entire vault would be too much.

127
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,870
Oh, right, Yu,

128
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,120
as it happens,

129
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,430
I'm going to Changsheng Temple
in Feng Mountain to make prayers.

130
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,190
Would you

131
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,310
keep me company, if you have time?

132
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,240
I...

133
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,670
What a poor thing I am!

134
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,020
Though my life is financially comfortable,

135
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,690
my husband and son

136
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,980
are busy working all day long.

137
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,020
They never have time for me.

138
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,800
There isn't even a person I can talk to.

139
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,230
See, now,
I have to go make prayers in a temple

140
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,930
all by my lonesome...

141
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,860
Auntie,

142
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,470
I'll go with you.

143
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:19,810
Is it true?

144
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:20,890
That's great!

145
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,330
Let's hurry.

146
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,680
If we miss the time for offering incense,

147
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,410
our prayers won't be answered.

148
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,330
Tell me.

149
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,950
What can I help you with?

150
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,480
No need for this.

151
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,780
I implore you, Lord Shen,

152
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,150
to have some people look for my sister.

153
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,260
What happened to your sister?

154
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,700
She went missing.

155
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,090
Let's go.

156
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
My Lord?

157
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,870
Auntie...

158
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,760
Yu,

159
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,310
it has just occurred to me
that I need to be home for some matters.

160
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,170
I can't go offer incense with you.

161
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,659
But Zhan will keep you company.

162
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,140
Remember to offer

163
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,890
plenty of incense on my behalf.

164
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,190
Let's go.

165
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,210
Yu.

166
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,620
Come on.

167
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,370
I'll carry you on my back.

168
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,480
No need, My Lord. I can walk on my own.

169
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,630
Just get on my back.

170
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,220
Yu.

171
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,260
In fact, I arranged for all this.

172
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,320
What do you mean?

173
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,150
I had Shen Pan distracted

174
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,680
and asked my mother
to invite you for this trip,

175
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,890
so that I could

176
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,390
meet with you.

177
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,570
But

178
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,080
didn't we just see each other yesterday?

179
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,760
It was not the same, was it?

180
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,140
I don't want you

181
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,840
to get too close to Shen Pan.

182
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,260
My Lord,

183
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,730
Lord Shen is just a friend of mine.

184
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,060
But you asked him,
instead of me, to teach you

185
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,120
lightness skills.

186
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,440
I didn't ask you

187
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,580
because I feared we might get into fights.

188
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,790
Zhao,

189
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,760
turn back.

190
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,040
Mrs. Lu,

191
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,890
it's not a good idea, is it?

192
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,590
If Lord Lu knows

193
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,910
we tail and watch him from behind,

194
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,430
I'll be punished.

195
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,460
Don't worry. He wouldn't dare.

196
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,900
Just do as I say.

197
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,160
Yes.
