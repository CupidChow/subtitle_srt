[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,900
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,070
You've worked hard, Lord Shen.
Have some tea.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,440
Thank you, Yu.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,780
You have some tea too.

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,689
How's the investigation going?

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,760
Lu Zhan,

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,260
I'm not your subordinate.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
So?

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,410
Well, Lord Shen.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,370
The case is what matters.

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,900
The case is more important.

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,360
I haven't found anything
about Qiao Pan'er's death,

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,090
but Zhao Wenshu's death was no accident.

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,520
It was murder.

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,880
Murder?

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,080
According to a maid from Zhao Mansion,

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,650
Zhao Wenshu, in his daily life,

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,850
had a peculiar habit.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,630
He enjoyed tormenting servants
for amusement.

21
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,360
Young Master, please spare me!

22
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,030
I know I was wrong!

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,090
Please spare me, Young Master!

24
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,370
Spare you?

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,110
Who do you think you are?

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,290
Please!

27
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,440
I know I was wrong, Young Master!

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,110
What about that girl, Qingyue?

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,800
She's dead.

30
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,050
To protect Zhao Wenshu's reputation,
Zhao Yutang

31
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,259
ordered everyone in the mansion

32
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,320
not to tell anyone about this matter.

33
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,620
But Qingyue was only trying
to protect herself.

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,350
How did she end up being killed?

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,110
The servants in Zhao Mansion
all signed indentured servitude contracts.

36
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,970
Their lives

37
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,120
didn't belong to themselves long ago.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,229
In other words,

39
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,450
even if the masters of the mansion

40
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,170
kill these maids and servants,

41
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,630
the authorities
can't do anything about it.

42
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,460
Besides,

43
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,670
Qingyue accidentally killed Zhao Wenshu.

44
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,710
They simply have no regard for human life.

45
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,770
It's infuriating!

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,880
Miss,

47
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,690
what are you doing?

48
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,780
Is this enough?

49
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,200
Yes. It's enough.

50
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,940
Officer Huang,

51
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,590
this will be deducted from your salary.

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,950
That smell again.

53
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,910
It's the killer.

54
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,120
After her!

55
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,130
I closed another big deal today.

56
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,420
Stop!

57
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,610
Stop it!

58
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,700
After her!

59
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,570
I don't know.

60
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,030
I don't know. I...

61
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,760
You're Madam Wang,

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,090
who arranges marriages for the dead,
right?

63
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,210
I'm not!

64
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,660
The Imperial Guard
is investigating a case.

65
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,280
I advise you to confess honestly.

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,720
I do arrange marriages for the dead.

67
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,270
Who was the person after you just now?

68
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,150
I don't know.

69
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,720
I don't know them.

70
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,300
How did Qiao Pan'er die?

71
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,840
I don't know either.

72
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,490
I only handle the matchmaking.

73
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,010
Ma'am, given your attitude,

74
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,850
you seem eager to go to prison.

75
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,260
Her family

76
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,690
poisoned her to death.

77
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,640
Just as I thought.

78
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,060
They all truly deserved to die.

79
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,170
Does Zhao Yutang know about this?

80
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,079
I don't know,

81
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,800
but Zhao Mansion's butler

82
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,380
definitely knows about it.

83
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,520
Huang Yu, what are you doing here?

84
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,260
Mao,

85
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,490
keep an eye on Madam Wang.

86
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,550
Make her list all the names

87
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,560
involved in the ghost marriages

88
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,450
she has arranged.

89
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,900
The Ghost King might be among them.

90
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,850
Oh, and also,

91
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,190
interrogate Zhao Mansion's butler

92
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,750
thoroughly.

93
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,870
Hey, Huang Yu!

94
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,910
Huang Yu, go after her!

95
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,050
You both are injured.

96
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,620
I need to take you to a clinic first.
Let's go.

97
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,970
[Wind Inn]

98
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,050
When did you get into my bed?

99
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,480
We're both grown men.

100
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,720
Are you feeling shy, Lord Lu?

101
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,320
You...

102
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,990
Put your clothes on properly
before coming out!

103
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,790
Officer Huang.

104
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
From now on, you can't

105
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,660
place me and Shen Pan together again.

106
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,610
Do you hear me?

107
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,860
I was just trying to save money.

108
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,180
My Lord, as you know,

109
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,140
I'm just a poor commoner.

110
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,410
How can I afford

111
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,790
such a high-class room?

112
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,230
But I couldn't let you two suffer either.

113
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,970
This one room alone

114
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,100
cost me a few months' living expenses.

115
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,190
Yu,

116
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,840
would you like to consider working for me?

117
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
The salary I offer

118
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,370
is much more than that Lu Zhan offers.

119
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,120
Really?

120
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,430
Lord Shen, I wonder

121
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,200
how much you offer monthly.

122
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,220
Ten taels.

123
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,340
That much?

124
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,120
At this rate,

125
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,970
I definitely can afford a house.

126
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,030
Just thinking about it
makes me a little happy.

127
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,260
So?

128
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,980
Yu, what do you say?

129
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,760
No need to consider it.

130
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,370
No need to consider it.

131
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,500
After all, Lord Lu treats me very well.

132
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,550
How could I do something

133
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,490
like abandoning loyalty
for the sake of money?

134
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,090
I appreciate your kind offer, Lord Shen.

135
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,800
By the way,

136
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,150
Lord Shen,

137
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,220
we still need to ask someone

138
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,020
to draw the murderer's portrait

139
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,900
for a citywide search.

140
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,010
This way,

141
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,160
we should be able to find her soon.

142
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,520
I don't need you to tell me that.

143
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,440
Huang Yu!

144
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
Uncle Fu. What's the matter?

145
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,620
My son is about to get married.

146
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,920
I plan to use this place

147
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,020
as their bridal home.

148
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,630
So I...
can't rent this place to you anymore.

149
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,770
Okay.

150
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,680
But Uncle Fu,

151
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,740
can you give me a few more days?

152
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,840
I'll leave
as soon as I find another place.

153
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,280
It's not that
I don't want to give you time.

154
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,170
It's just that
my son... is in a hurry to get married.

155
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,210
Is it... Zhao Yutang,
Minister of Personnel?

156
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,000
Yu, lower your voice.

157
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,820
If someone overhears this,

158
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,840
we could get into trouble.

159
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,330
Huang Yu,

160
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,680
we are just commoners
without power or influence.

161
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,980
We're no match for those high officials.

162
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,100
I... have no choice.

163
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,900
Okay.

164
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,180
I'll pack my things and move out now.

165
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,460
I'm sorry, Huang Yu!

166
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,240
That brat.

167
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,630
He's no longer young,

168
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,280
yet he's not concerned
about his marriage at all.

169
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,930
So I had to travel all this way

170
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,230
to a Taoist temple
to pray for a match for him.

171
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,380
But it's so late,

172
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,120
will Master...

173
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,740
It's fine.

174
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,340
Even if Master finds out,
he'll just nag a bit.

175
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,970
He wouldn't dare get angry.

176
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,740
You don't need to worry too much.

177
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,760
Didn't we get a very auspicious lot today?

178
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,250
Perhaps Young Master's match

179
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,340
will appear soon.

180
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,290
Madam!

181
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,710
Madam, what's wrong?

182
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,250
Madam! Help!

183
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,560
Someone help her!

184
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,440
What happened?

185
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,720
What's going on?

186
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,380
Let's take her to a clinic now!

187
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,090
Be careful!

188
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,190
Li! Li, hurry up!

189
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,409
Someone has fainted!

190
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,580
Hurry.

191
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,220
Where did you bring someone from
this time?

192
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,660
No credit this time!

193
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,790
Madam.

194
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,950
Madam. Madam.

195
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,770
Is this enough?

196
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,030
Where did you get so much money?

197
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,320
Could it be...

198
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,870
you did something illegal?

199
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,980
How could you say that?

200
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,890
It's my hard-earned money.

201
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,130
Cut the crap and save her! Hurry up!

202
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,880
Where's my bundle?

203
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,270
You save her first!

204
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,470
What a silly girl.

205
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,020
She can barely feed herself,

206
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,480
yet she's still helping others everywhere.

207
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,330
Madam is not seriously ill.

208
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,980
I'll go prepare some medicine for her.

209
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,670

My Lord,

245
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,910
you're not planning... to sleep
in the same room with me, are you?
