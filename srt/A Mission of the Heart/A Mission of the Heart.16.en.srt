[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,000
[Episode 16]

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,820
My Lord,

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,320
Lord Shen and I are just friends.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,600
Then why did you ask him, instead of me,

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,330
to teach you lightness skills?

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,150
That's because...

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,440
I was worried we might argue.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,190
Why were you worried?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,040
First,

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,000
you are a very serious person, My Lord.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,820
Whether dealing with people or matters,

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,470
you are meticulous and strict.

14
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,780
And I'm rather slow-witted.

15
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,980
If you were harsh while teaching me,

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,890
I would surely curse you in my heart.

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,080
From the sound of it,

18
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,370
you must've cursed me in your heart
quite often, haven't you?

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,540
Not really.

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,160
You were mean and deceived me before.

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,080
And you were so stingy.

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,310
Fine.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,890
It's all my fault.

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,760
Then...

25
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,570
do you still dislike me now?

26
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:26,890
No.

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,160
It's precisely because
I don't dislike you...

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,020
that I didn't want you to teach me.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,390
Why?

30
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,720
I was worried you'd despise me.

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,800
Yu,

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,050
by nature, I am aloof and detached.

33
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,180
My sole ambition was to make contributions
and build a career.

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,440
I never liked getting too close to women.

35
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,440
Until you appeared.

36
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,479
You are the one I love.

37
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,800
I can't cherish you enough.

38
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,520
How could I possibly despise you?

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,110
My Lord.

40
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,860
Who said Lord Lu

41
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,250
doesn't know how to be romantic?

42
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,510
The sweet words he said

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,740
are not worse than those Lord Shen said.

44
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,290
He's worthy of being my son.

45
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,930
Just seize this opportunity

46
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,260
and take Yu back
to the Lu family directly.

47
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,090
Help.

48
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,880
Help me!

49
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,930
Let's go take a look.

50
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,760
What's wrong?

51
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,070
Let's go.

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,740
Young Lady.

53
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,460
Young Lady!

54
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,270
Zhao!

55
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,460
Check on her.

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,490
She's not going to make it.

57
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,300
It's already a miracle

58
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,829
that she's made it this far.

59
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,020
What about the baby?

60
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,460
Ziling!

61
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,920
It's Ziling!

62
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,930
Wake up! Look at me!

63
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,460
Look at me!

64
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,580
Which heartless bastard

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,960
did this to a pregnant woman?

66
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,060
Ziling.

67
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,230
Su Ziling's wrists and ankles

68
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,030
show signs of having been bound.

69
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,920
It's highly likely she was kidnapped...

70
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,170
or imprisoned.

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,530
She accidentally fell off the cliff
while escaping.

72
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,370
Judging from the chaotic footprints
at the scene,

73
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
there were at least 3 perpetrators.

74
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,220
But Su Ziling and her husband's family

75
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,960
are not wealthy people.

76
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,880
Even if the perpetrators kidnap them,

77
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,630
they can't get much ransom.

78
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,650
What could possibly be the reason

79
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,600
that would make these people

80
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,760
kidnap a pregnant woman?

81
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,600
Yu.

82
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,120
Let me try.

83
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,770
This place can hide someone?

84
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,590
Let's split up and search.

85
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,900
See if there are any other clues

86
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,500
or mechanisms or something.

87
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,500
There's nothing here.

88
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,840
Su Ziling and the others

89
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,550
couldn't have appeared out of nowhere.

90
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,210
Let's go back first

91
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,630
and see if we can

92
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,180
get any clues from Su Ziyan.

93
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,560
My Lord!

94
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,040
There's a clue here!

95
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,530
This footprint looks very familiar.

96
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,350
It's the same as the footprint

97
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,150
of the man in black
at Xiafeng House that night.

98
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,960
Yu.

99
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,180
Where's the dagger
left by the man in black

100
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,020
that day?

101
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,660
It's at my place.

102
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,070
Bring it and go somewhere with me.

103
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,080
Take me with you!

104
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,710
Yu.

105
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,150
Go check Wang Mang's body

106
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,140
and see if there are any wounds
caused by this knife.

107
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,920
My Lord,

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,060
the knife wounds on Wang Mang's body

109
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,970
were indeed caused by this curved knife.

110
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,950
Just as I thought.

111
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,180
Could it be...

112
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,670
that Wang Mang's death

113
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,770
is also related to the man in black?

114
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,520
When I was chasing Wang Mang,

115
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,220
a man bumped into him.

116
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,390
I didn't pay much attention at the time.

117
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,690
After Wang Mang died from poisoning,

118
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,930
I became suspicious.

119
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,120
But I never found any leads.

120
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,320
Now we finally have some clues.

121
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,860
You mean...

122
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,250
Su Ziling's death?

123
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,320
But Wang Mang and the man in black

124
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,050
are both related
to the disaster relief fund robbery case.

125
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,330
What about Su Ziling?

126
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,840
Was she also involved?

127
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Zhao probably has some leads by now.

128
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,550
Let's go back and check first.

129
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,820
Let's go.

130
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,900
I asked around.

131
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,970
Currently in the city,

132
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,409
there are many pregnant women

133
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:35,470
like Su Ziling who have gone missing.

134
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,120
Why specifically target

135
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,280
pregnant women?

136
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,720
Could it be...

137
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,420
for the babies in their wombs?

138
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,540
But their targets

139
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,220
all have something in common.

140
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,040
First,

141
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,380
they are ordinary people

142
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,320
without status or powerful backgrounds.

143
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,950
Second,

144
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
they are women despised by their husbands

145
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,290
and asking for secret remedies everywhere

146
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,350
because they couldn't get pregnant.

147
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,200
Third,

148
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,610
they all visited Changsheng Temple.

149
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,770
Mrs. Lu told me

150
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,370
about Changsheng Temple.

151
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,260
Many couples who can't have children

152
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,120
would go there.

153
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,960
Women who have been there
would get pregnant.

154
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,350
No wonder Mother asked us
to go to Changsheng Temple.

155
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,330
Changsheng Temple is more effective
than the Child-Giving Guanyin?

156
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,910
It can actually make these women

157
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,210
pregnant?

158
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,000
There must be something fishy about this.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,070
Ziyan said

160
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,220
that her younger sister, Ziling,

161
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,650
disappeared precisely after
visiting Changsheng Temple.

162
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,230
Then why didn't she report it
to the authorities?

163
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,390
How do you know she didn't?

164
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,450
Officer Huang, you seem
to dislike government officials a lot.

165
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,350
Yes.

166
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,280
I dislike them.

167
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,590
But you guys are exceptions.

168
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,810
Mao.

169
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,310
Did you find any clues?

170
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,940
I found

171
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,000
Mrs. Chen would go to Changsheng Temple
to pray

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
on the first and 15th of every month.

173
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,320
Do you think

174
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,520
Mrs. Chen's death

175
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,890
could be related to Changsheng Temple too?

176
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,280
It's possible.

177
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,840
It seems
Changsheng Temple is very suspicious.

178
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,840
Then...

179
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,880
we should go to Changsheng Temple
to investigate.

180
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,940
Darling, I'm begging you.

181
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,390
This place is really effective.

182
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,980
Let's pray and worship here, okay?

183
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,790
We'll have a child soon.

184
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,910
Darling,

185
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,880
was everything you said about loving me
a lie?

186
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,520
Don't you want to have a child with me?

187
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,120
-Let's just pray...
-Let go!

188
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,000
My Lord, calm down.

189
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,710
Calm down.

190
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,420
Calm down, calm down.

191
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,020
I just asked him to act.

192
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,630
Why did he use so much strength?

193
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,950
Lord Shen asked you to act,

194
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,320
but you refused.

195
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,799
If you still can't bear a child,

196
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,710
I will divorce you and marry someone else!

197
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,880
Suit yourself!

198
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,250
Darling!

199
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,390
You can't do this to me!

200
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,490
Darling!

201
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,990
My Lord, you are truly brilliant.

202
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,790
Impressive.

203
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,100
It's okay. It's okay.

204
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,050
Why is my life so miserable?

205
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,570
Tell you what,

206
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,940
Yu's acting

207
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,700
is really convincing.

208
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,280
Yes.

209
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,310
Immortal,

210
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,920
please save me!

211
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,630
Immortal, I'm Pu Yu.
Please answer my prayer.

212
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,230
Please bless me with a child.

213
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,970
If my wish comes true,

214
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,550
I will serve you for the rest of my life.

215
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,590
I

216
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,570
have heard the sincere prayer of you,
Pu Yu.

217
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,490
Just drink this bottle of Holy Water,

218
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,910
and your wish will come true.

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,180
Thank you for answering my prayer.

220
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,110
Thank you for answering my prayer.

221
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:11,960
Crap.
