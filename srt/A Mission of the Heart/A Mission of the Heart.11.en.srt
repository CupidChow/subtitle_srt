[A Mission of the Heart]

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,960
[Episode 11]

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,920
When was the body found?

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,350
The heavy rain two days ago
caused a landslide.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,290
Zhang Chuchu's coffin
was thus flushed out.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,940
It was discovered this morning
and reported to us.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,370
How unfortunate.

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,360
The dead was named Zhang Chuchu,

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,430
the former top courtesan at Xiafeng House.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,470
She was about 23 years old.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,700
It's been around 10 days since she died.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,500
There are

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,030
multiple whip and ligature marks on her.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,470
This means

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,660
she was probably confined

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,510
and tortured before she died.

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,610
She most likely died from suffocation.

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,710
Yu,

19
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,560
what caused that bruise

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,890
on her neck?

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,460
About that...

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,099
I'm not sure yet.

23
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,200
Zhao,

24
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,720
bring the body to the division.

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,730
Focus on investigating

26
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,520
those close to Zhang Chuchu,

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,880
especially the males.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,410
Got it.

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,570
-Yu!
-Yu!

30
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,400
Yu!

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,030
Zhao.

32
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,310
Feel her pulse.

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,900
How is she?

34
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,450
Is Yu seriously ill?

35
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,360
No.

36
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,950
She just...

37
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,360
Just what?

38
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,440
She just ate too much food.

39
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,130
What?

40
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,630
My Lord,

41
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,930
what did Officer Huang eat this morning?

42
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,380
Meat. Why do you ask?

43
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,259
Meat?

44
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,979
That's the problem!

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,600
She ate so much greasy food

46
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,500
that her stomach has got upset.

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,110
Officer Huang should really curb

48
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,020
her huge appetite.

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,610
As the saying goes,
only those who eat moderately

50
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,550
would live long.

51
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,050
If this continues,

52
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,340
she'll die from overeating one day.

53
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,620
But, My Lords,

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,970
why didn't you stop her?

55
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,199
Lord Shen,
anything wrong with your throat?

56
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,980
It was my fault.

57
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,730
My Lord,

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,950
you are indeed to blame for this matter.

59
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,150
You must stop indulging Officer Huang.

60
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,800
I made her eat that much.

61
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,060
Lord Shen! Well...

62
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,570
I need to bring Zhang Chuchu's body

63
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,420
to the Northern Inspection Division.

64
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,060
I may have to trouble you
to lead the horse.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,060
Thank you, My Lord.

66
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,070
I can't believe this punk Li Zhaoxia

67
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,380
asked me to drive the carriage myself.

68
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,640
I'm like a coachman for Lu Zhan now.

69
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,860
Are you feeling better?

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,530
After Commander Li
performed acupuncture on me,

71
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
I'm feeling much better now.

72
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,910
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,830
My Lord, that was not your fault.

74
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,540
I shouldn't have eaten so much.

75
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,040
From now on, you won't have to do

76
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,870
what you're reluctant to.

77
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,760
Don't be in fear of offending me.

78
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,130
Really?

79
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,620
But you'll get angry that way.

80
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,650
I'll try not to.

81
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,090
Okay.

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,780
From now on,

83
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,810
I'll try

84
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,030
declining what I don't feel like doing.

85
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,720
My Lord, I know what caused that bruise.

86
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,890
It was a thumb ring.

87
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,860
The thumb ring on Lord Chen's hand.

88
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,280
Shen Pan, halt the carriage.

89
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,320
What is it now?

90
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,829
Take care of Yu for the moment.

91
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,500
I have urgent business to attend to.

92
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,210
Fine.

93
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,830
Watch the speed.

94
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:09,900
Okay.

95
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,750
I must bring Mao with me
next time I go out.

96
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,720
God knows where that lad has gone.

97
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,070
He always disappears at critical times.

98
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,180
Where's the stuff I told you to look for?

99
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,880
Where is it now?

100
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
You'll get your payment!

101
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,700
Mrs. Chen.

102
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,590
Sorry for the intrusion.

103
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,720
We may need to open the casket
to examine Mr. Chen's body.

104
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,340
You're crossing the line, Imperial Guards!

105
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,430
This is my husband's funeral.

106
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,370
Can't you just let him

107
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,290
rest in peace?

108
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,930
We the Imperial Guards
are investigating a case.

109
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,800
Those who dare to cause obstruction

110
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
will be executed.

111
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,650
Zhao!

112
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,270
Yes.

113
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,230
Open the casket.

114
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,770
Yes.

115
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,050
My Lord!

116
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,560
My Lord,

117
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,250
those works are about the love life
of me and my husband.

118
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,370
I'm afraid
they're not proper reading for you.

119
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,790
My Lord.

120
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,090
The thumb ring on Chen Zhao's hand

121
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,490
matches the bruise on Zhang Chuchu's neck.

122
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,700
What?

123
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,850
Mrs. Chen, you know that woman?

124
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,930
No, I don't.

125
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,610
Tell the truth.

126
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,300
My husband

127
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,750
once hid this woman

128
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,820
in his secret chamber.

129
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,240
Take us there.

130
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,060
How did you find out

131
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,140
your husband was hiding a woman here?

132
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,659
Previously,

133
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,820
my husband often got up
late at night and went out.

134
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,320
He acted mysteriously.

135
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,430
I thought he was cheating on me.

136
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
So,

137
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,450
I followed him in secret.

138
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,110
Tell me!

139
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,730
Where is the stuff hidden?

140
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,780
I really don't know.

141
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,860
You don't know?

142
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
You and Wang Mang are lovers.

143
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,460
How could you not know?

144
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,620
He only told me

145
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,870
that he'd take me away
once he made a fortune.

146
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,510
Now that you know nothing,

147
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,570
you've outlived your usefulness.

148
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,640
Out of fear of getting killed,

149
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,060
I dared not say a word about it

150
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,110
to outsiders.

151
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,510
Zhao.

152
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,790
Yes.

153
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,130
Bring all these things

154
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,150
back to the Northern Inspection Division.

155
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,650
Yes.

156
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,020
Lord Shen,

157
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,890
I'm really fine now.

158
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,480
You don't need to care for me
like this anymore.

159
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,230
But I insist,

160
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,720
until you fully recover.

161
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,970
Have some more.

162
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,460
My Lord,

163
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,710
I got a lead.

164
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,780
What is it?

165
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,580
The killer of Chen Zhao

166
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,730
is among these men.

167
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,960
Who is this?

168
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,990
This is Jia Fugui.

169
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,450
He and Chen Zhao

170
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,300
once fought over Liu Mei'er.

171
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,240
Chen Zhao kept bullying him.

172
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,179
That makes him

173
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,039
a major suspect.

174
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,240
Hold on!

175
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,059
Isn’t this Mr. Zhou,

176
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,260
who had a crush on Chuchu?

177
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,220
Yes.

178
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,840
In fact,

179
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,200
he was stalking Chen Zhao the entire time.

180
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,150
Looks like he's a major suspect too.

181
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,370
I quietly followed
the Chen family's carriage.

182
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,610
Then I saw them just toss Chuchu's body

183
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,290
at the mass grave.

184
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,220
I dared not hold a grand funeral for her,

185
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,190
so I bought a fine coffin

186
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,720
and buried her in secret.

187
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,580
Why didn't you report it
to the authorities?

188
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,540
Did you not know
Chuchu was a wanted criminal?

189
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,870
Back then, I only wanted to avenge Chuchu.

190
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,690
I planned to kill Chen Zhao!

191
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,190
But I never

192
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,160
got a chance to do so at that time.

193
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,540
Then, one day,

194
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,330
I found him drinking the Drunken Dream

195
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,190
for more pleasure in the brothel.

196
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,330
So, I slipped poison

197
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,810
in this wine.

198
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,980
Who gave you the Threads of Love?

199
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,130
I don't know that man's identity.

200
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,460
The only thing I know
is that he wore a mask.

201
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,180
Put the drug in this bottle

202
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,960
into Chen Zhao's wine,

203
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,040
and you'll avenge Chuchu.
