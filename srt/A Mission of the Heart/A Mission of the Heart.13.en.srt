[A Mission of the Heart]

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,980
[Episode 13]

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,900
By the way,

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,860
who was that person last night?

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,080
Did you catch them?

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,310
No.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,710
Failed again?

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,840
My Lord,

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,250
your ability to catch people

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,680
doesn't seem all that impressive.

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,390
What do you mean "failed again"?

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,320
Are you questioning my abilities?

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,870
Not at all.

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,250
It was the ghost-masked man.

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,310
He deliberately led me
to the Chen Mansion.

16
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,570
The ghost-masked man?

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,030
What was he doing at the Chen Mansion?

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,290
Something happened to Mrs. Chen?

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,290
Mrs. Chen is dead.

20
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,570
Dead?

21
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,680
What's the cause of death?

22
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,810
Not yet determined.

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,700
Alright,

24
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,080
I'll get my tools and investigate.

25
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,280
Are you well enough to go?

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,980
This little cold is nothing.

27
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,140
Besides,

28
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,800
what matters most now
is to find out the truth.

29
00:00:59,050 --> 00:00:59,580
Let's go.

30
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,000
Good morning, Lord Shen.

31
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,280
Commander Li.

32
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,620
What brings you here

33
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,930
in the early morning?

34
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,840
Why did your lord

35
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,110
give me a bunch
of calligraphy and paintings?

36
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,100
For investigation.

37
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,100
What case?

38
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,039
Mrs. Chen hanged herself
at home last night.

39
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,310
My lord is confused about this

40
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,840
and has sent me
to consult with you, Lord Shen.

41
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,360
Mrs. Chen is dead?

42
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,130
Yes.

43
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,550
My lord also said

44
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,590
that in the art
of calligraphy and painting,

45
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,120
your mastery is unmatched.

46
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,840
He believes you will surely
be able to determine

47
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
whether this suicide note

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,410
was personally written by Mrs. Chen.

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,910
That goes without saying.

50
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,420
In calligraphy and painting,

51
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,210
none can rival my lord.

52
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,150
Indeed.

53
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,360
Lu Zhan is finally
getting to act like a person.

54
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,390
Leave it here.

55
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,890
I'll provide my findings soon.

56
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,880
Commander Li,

57
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,310
do you have any other questions?

58
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,230
No.

59
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,630
I'll take my leave now.

60
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,780
I won't see you out.

61
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,400
I thought I'd need to do more convincing.

62
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,370
I didn't expect Lord Shen

63
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,449
agreed so soon.

64
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,520
Epidermal abrasion at the ligature mark.

65
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,829
Hemorrhage in the skin tissue.

66
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,290
Bruising on the neck.

67
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,990
Fracture of the greater cornu
of the hyoid bone

68
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,770
with associated hemorrhage.

69
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,630
What's the result?

70
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,290
Based on the autopsy results,

71
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,100
Mrs. Chen did indeed
die from strangulation.

72
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,030
Strangulation?

73
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,620
Strange.

74
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,850
Did I miss something?

75
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,040
No hurry.

76
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,330
Take your time.

77
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,750
Officer Huo.

78
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,360
Yes.

79
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,650
Secure the scene.

80
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,690
Without my order,

81
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,390
no one is allowed to approach this area.

82
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:09,890
Also,

83
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,850
when Commander Li returns,

84
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,480
tell him to come to the villa.

85
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,720
Say I have urgent business with him.

86
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,440
Yes, sir.

87
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,579
Let's go.

88
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,230
My Lord!

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,110
My Lord.

90
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:26,960
My Lord.

91
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,960
My Lord.

92
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,960
Officer Huo

93
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,660
said you needed me urgently.

94
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,290
Come check Yu's pulse.

95
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,490
There's really nothing serious.

96
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,630
I'll just brew some ginger tea

97
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,160
and drink some, that'll do.

98
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,390
Zhao.

99
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,250
How is she?

100
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,030
She's fine.

101
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,710
Some brown sugar ginger tea
will warm her up

102
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,110
and make her feel better.

103
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,410
My Lord.

104
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,390
This is your urgent matter?

105
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,950
Anything concerning Yu

106
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,950
is never trivial.

107
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,710
Yu.

108
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,750
Do you have brown sugar
and ginger at home?

109
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,440
Yes.

110
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,240
Good.

111
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,400
By the way,

112
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,280
Zhao,

113
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,380
the roof seems to be damaged.

114
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,399
Go check it now.

115
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,779
Yes, sir.

116
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,680
I, a dignified Imperial Guard,

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,460
ended up

118
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,240
repairing the roof.

119
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,420
It seems our lord

120
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,070
is really obsessed.

121
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,270
Lord Shen.

122
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,040
What brings you here?

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,720
We heard that Officer Huang is sick.

124
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,409
We came specifically to see her.

125
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,220
What's wrong?

126
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,430
Are we not welcome?

127
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,870
That's not what I meant.

128
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,920
It's just that

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,450
you've come at an inconvenient time.

130
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,080
But Lord Shen,

131
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,000
I didn't mean that, either.

132
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,940
But now

133
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,720
my lord is taking care of Officer Huang.

134
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,550
You can rest assured, Lord Shen.

135
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,760
Your lord?

136
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,470
That King of Hell

137
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,190
can take care of others?

138
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,190
Who said I don't know
how to take care of people?

139
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,030
Oh, it's you, Lord Shen.

140
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,140
You worry too much, Lord Shen.

141
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,600
I will take good care of Yu.

142
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,750
Zhao.

143
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,020
See him out.

144
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,300
Excuse me, Lord Shen.

145
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,640
It's fine.

146
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,140
As long as Yu is safe.

147
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,690
Commander Li, what are you doing?

148
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,370
Last night,

149
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,390
our lord
and Officer Huang did something,

150
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,760
I don't even know what,

151
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,840
and ended up poking a hole in the roof.

152
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,890
So I was sent to fix it.

153
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,760
I see.

154
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,290
Then I'll have Mao stay and help you.

155
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,640
Let me tell you,

156
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,690
I won't help you with manual labor.

157
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,050
After my lord

158
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,610
marries Officer Huang,

159
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,450
tasks like building roofs and fixing beds

160
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,600
will be my responsibility.

161
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,800
I can't trouble

162
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,160
outsiders like you.

163
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,850
Your lord

164
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,250
will marry Officer Huang?

165
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,310
Is there a problem?

166
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,310
Of course there's a problem.

167
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,250
If they are married,

168
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,600
what about my lord?

169
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,720
The one who will marry Officer Huang

170
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,640
will definitely be my lord.

171
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,880
My lord.

172
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,830
My lord.

173
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,760
My lord.

174
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,750
My lord!

175
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,950
My lord!

176
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,390
My lord!

177
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,290
My lord is handsome and elegant.

178
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,090
Your lord is a fair-faced Asura.

179
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,730
Your lord is a ladies' man.

180
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,900
My lord is loyal and devoted.

181
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,909
Surrounded by beauties,

182
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,690
my lord's heart remains still.

183
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,600
Among countless choices,

184
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,520
my lord's heart belongs to only one.

185
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,290
My lord is charming and elegant.

186
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,620
My lord is highly skilled in martial arts.

187
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,920
My lord...

188
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,720
My lord...

189
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,490
Your lord has already gone far away.

190
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,460
My Lord!

191
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,040
Alright.

192
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,740
-My Lord!
-Your lord. Your lord.

193
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,650
-Alright. Don’t cry.
-My Lord!

194
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,780
Fine, your lord...

195
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,150
Your lord is good.

196
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,280
It's my lord who is good.

197
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,810
Right.

198
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,590
My lord is good.

199
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,600
My Lord!

200
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,890
My Lord!

201
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,510
Mao!

202
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,280
Mao!

203
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,790
Help me!

204
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,750
My Lord.

205
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,050
I'd rather drink it myself.

206
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:32,980
Zhao.

207
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,490
Turn around.

208
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,480
Deceiving yourself.

209
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,950
My Lord.

210
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,150
What did you find out about Mrs. Chen?

211
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,360
I've figured it out.

212
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,740
Not long ago, Mrs. Chen

213
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,200
had quite a few new clothes made

214
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,720
for her unborn child.

215
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,930
When?

216
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,850
The day after Chen Zhao's death.

217
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,540
The day after Chen Zhao's death?

218
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,440
I know what I missed.

219
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,510
My Lord, I'm going to the morgue.

220
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,570
I'll be right back.

221
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,640
Zhao.

222
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,550
My Lord.

223
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,280
What would you like me to do?

224
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,370
My Lord!

225
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,280
I was wrong.

226
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,710
I shouldn't have

227
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,680
told the truth.

228
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,000
But it's not a crime worthy of death!

229
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,419
My Lord, please spare me.

230
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,860
Stop talking nonsense.

231
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,610
Who said anything about dying?

232
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,590
I want you to simulate

233
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,049
Mrs. Chen's death.

234
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:11,920
Again.

235
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,090
What?

236
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,160
What are you waiting for? Again.

237
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,250
[As a mother, I failed to protect
the child in my womb.]

238
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:09,830
[I have brought shame
upon the ancestors of the Chen family,]

239
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,420
[and only by death
can I atone for my sin.]

240
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,560
The force is wrong.

241
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,190
Zhao.

242
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,710
One more time.

243
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,660
Again?

244
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,260
My Lord.

245
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,770
Is this good enough now?

246
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,950
Lu Zhan, what are you doing?

247
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,470
Testing.

248
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,870
Zhao and I

249
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,470
repeatedly tested it.

250
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,040
If someone kicked over their own stool,

251
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,730
under no circumstances

252
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,840
would it end up here.

253
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,230
This means

254
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,000
someone deliberately
staged the hanging scene.

255
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,760
I agree with your theory.

256
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,310
Because that suicide note

257
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,640
was not made by Mrs. Chen.

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,030
To imitate it so perfectly,

259
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,170
the person must be skilled at forgery

260
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,260
and

261
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,230
familiar with Mrs. Chen's habits.

262
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,380
But Officer Huang said

263
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,930
Mrs. Chen hanged herself.

264
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,170
It was indeed a hanging suicide.

265
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,590
But it wasn't voluntary.

266
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,920
What do you mean by that?

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Because of this.
