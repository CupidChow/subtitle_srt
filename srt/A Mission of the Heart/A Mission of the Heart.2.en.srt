[A Mission of the Heart]

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,970
[Episode 2]

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:11,940
My Lord,

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,990
I truly didn't know
it was a ghost marriage.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,800
If I had known that,

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
I would never have done such a thing.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,350
It's true

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,460
that I'm a bit greedy for money,

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,360
but I do have my principles.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,630
Why was I so unlucky

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,540
to stumble upon this murder case?

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,770
If I had known it,

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,730
I shouldn't have worked relentlessly

14
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,140
day and night on that sort of thing

15
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,950
just to make money.

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,980
You shameless woman!

17
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,030
How dare you speak such explicit words!

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,280
I work day and night.

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,780
How is that shameless?

20
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,770
You even work day and night!

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,260
Ms. Huang, are you full now?

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,539
Yes, I'm full.

23
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,930
Thank you, Lord Shen.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,960
If you have any more questions,
feel free to ask me.

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,770
Ms. Huang, it seems

26
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,610
you're having quite a good time

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,110
in this prison.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,820
Lord Lu.

29
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,430
Why is he everywhere?

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,830
What brings you here, Lord Lu?

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,130
You're the esteemed Commander
of the Imperial Guard.

32
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,009
Why bother visiting the prison
of our Ministry of Punishments?

33
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,539
I'm here to claim my person.

34
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,509
Since when did I become his person?

35
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,009
Your person?

36
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,729
You don't even know
whose person you've arrested.

37
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:02,260
No wonder your Ministry of Punishments
never solves any cases.

38
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,080
Lu Zhan,

39
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,760
don't push it too far!

40
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,480
What's going on with these two lords?

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,570
Come with me now.

42
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,840
Wait.

43
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,060
Lord Lu, since you just said

44
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,970
that Ms. Huang is your person,

45
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,320
then...

46
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,250
the meal fee...

47
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,520
is 100 taels.

48
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,590
100 taels?

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,300
What are you standing around for?

50
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,210
Thank you for the meal, Lord Shen.

51
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,290
I'll take my leave.

52
00:02:58,329 --> 00:02:59,250
Lord Lu.

53
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,100
Lord Zhao.

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,810
Arrest this woman!

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,240
I'd like to see who dares!

56
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,130
Lord Lu,

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,930
what's the meaning of this?

58
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,140
Do you think

59
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
you can arrest my person at will?

60
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,270
Lord Lu, you're trying
to harbour a murderer, aren't you?

61
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,480
Lord Zhao, you are mistaken.

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
Ms. Huang is a survivor,

63
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,010
not the murderer.

64
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,520
You're a womanizer
who can't keep his eyes off women.

65
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,510
How can I believe your words?

66
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,560
Nonsense!

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,350
It's true that my lord
enjoys carousing with women,

68
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,690
but he would never bend the law
for personal gain.

69
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,020
He always enforces justice impartially.

70
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,110
7 days.

71
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,650
Within 7 days,

72
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,750
Lord Shen will definitely solve this case.

73
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,690
When did I...

74
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,840
Am I right,

75
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,600
Lord Shen?

76
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,079
I will definitely solve the case

77
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,310
within 7 days.

78
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
What if you fail to solve the case

79
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,440
within the deadline?

80
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,490
There's no "if."

81
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,000
Lord Zhao,

82
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,410
I advise you

83
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,740
strengthen your guards.

84
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,090
After all,

85
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,630
in the previous ghost marriage cases,

86
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,850
none of the involved parties survived.

87
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,399
I don't believe such a thing.

88
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,350
Fine.

89
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,150
I'll give you 7 days.

90
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,380
Let's go.

91
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,440
Damn you, Lu Zhan!

92
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,960
What gave you the right to decide for me?

93
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,400
I don't have time to argue with you.

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,120
Huang Yu.

95
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,110
Come with me to the crime scene.

96
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,940
My Lord, it's pitch-black here.

97
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,470
Why did you bring me to this place?

98
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,670
Either find the murderer,

99
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,850
or be thrown into prison.

100
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,170
The choice is yours.

101
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,340
I'll start looking right now!

102
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,240
This is the incense that made Ms. Huang
and the others unconscious?

103
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,370
It has a very unique scent.

104
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,980
I've examined the scene.

105
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:39,450
The murderer must be quite skilled
in martial arts.

106
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,500
Their attack was quick, precise
and ruthless.

107
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,690
There was no hesitation at all.

108
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,170
Even you and I might not

109
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,310
have been able to pull this off.

110
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,750
My Lord,

111
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,659
I found a lead.

112
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,660
The murder must be a woman.

113
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,160
Why a woman?

114
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,290
Lotus patterns?

115
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,620
Usually,

116
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,910
only women have these patterns
on the soles of their shoes.

117
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,060
Judging by the size of this footprint,

118
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,690
the murderer should be slim

119
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,480
and aged between 30 and 35.

120
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,270
How did you deduce that
from the footprint?

121
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,210
It's not hard.

122
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,100
Everyone has a unique height and build,

123
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,130
so their stride length,

124
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:32,670
as well as the size

125
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,250
and depth of their footprints, varies.

126
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,250
Anyway, you'll figure it out
once you've seen enough.

127
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,780
Yu, it seems you know quite a lot.

128
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,930
Screen out the list of people
who fit the criteria

129
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,260
and show it to Huang Yu.

130
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,640
Also,

131
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,150
the murderer

132
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,300
seems to be very interested
in the ghost marriage bride.

133
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,060
Send someone to the bride's home.

134
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,340
We might find something useful there.

135
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,170
As soon as the murder happened,

136
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,970
I took our men to the Qiao family.

137
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,770
But they've already run off.

138
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,610
Looks like they're guilty
and trying to hide.

139
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,580
The bride's family has fled,

140
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,910
but the groom's family is still here.

141
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,640
Send someone to the Zhao Mansion.

142
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,300
We might find new leads there.

143
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,760
Let's go.

144
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,810
What does he mean?

145
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
My Lord,

146
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,650
if there are no other orders,

147
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll take my leave now.

148
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,670
Wait.

149
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,090
I hereby grant you special permission

150
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,440
to join the Northern Inspection Division

151
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,550
as an unofficial member

152
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,450
of the Imperial Guard.

153
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,130
What's wrong?

154
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,890
Too happy

155
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,490
to speak?

156
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,980
Thank you for your kindness, Lord Lu.

157
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,110
But I'm unworthy of such an honor.

158
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,160
I'll have to decline the offer.

159
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,600
Please rest early, My Lord.

160
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,390
Good night.

161
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,180
Good night, My Lord.

162
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,590
She declined my offer?

163
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,950
Why are you so nervous?

164
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,419
Don't be such a coward.

165
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,900
Father.

166
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,600
I heard something happened
to the Zhao family.

167
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,800
Do you think the Ghost King

168
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,070
will come for us?

169
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,550
We've hidden away in this lousy place.

170
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,870
How could the Ghost King possibly find us?

171
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,990
That's true.

172
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,050
P-Pan'er.

173
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,420
What are you yelling about?

174
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,500
Pan'er died a long time ago!

175
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,600
Stop being so paranoid all the time!

176
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,190
It really is Pan'er!
