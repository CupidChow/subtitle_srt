[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,000
[Episode 7]

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,750
Where is it?

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,990
Are you looking for this?

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,360
My Lord,

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,900
that belongs to me.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,680
Why do you have it?

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,790
It belongs to you?

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,490
How could a servant like you

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,600
afford such expensive jewelry?

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,689
Someone gave it to me as a gift.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,220
Qiulan,

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,640
I'd hate to use force on a woman.

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,620
Would you rather confess

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,720
or be tortured by me

16
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,320
till you spill the truth?

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,560
Tell me.

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,580
What exactly happened that night?

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,490
I meant to steal from Ms. Liu

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,050
so that I could pay off

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,980
my brother's gambling debts.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,520
When I

23
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,250
worked as Ms. Liu's maid,

24
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,360
I saw

25
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,700
where she placed her valuables.

26
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,620
That night,

27
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,180
my plan

28
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,770
was to sneak into Ms. Liu room

29
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,170
while she was out with Lord Chen.

30
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,539
Stop it, My Lord.

31
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,580
We haven't got in the room yet.

32
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,050
Why the rush?

33
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,830
Oh, gorgeous.

34
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,289
How can I wait anymore?

35
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,950
I've been dying to see you.

36
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,720
Oh, My Lord.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,630
Come on.

38
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,170
Come on, give me a smile.

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,120
I attempted

40
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,320
to leave the room
when Ms. Liu and Lord Chen

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,750
fell sound asleep.

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,090
But unexpectedly...

43
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,070
What are you doing here?

44
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,310
What did you take?

45
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,630
Please let me go, Ms. Liu!

46
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,960
I didn't see anything!

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,720
Seeing Liu Mei'er stop breathing,

48
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,860
Qiulan dragged her onto the bed

49
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,340
to make people think Chen Zhao killed her.

50
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,250
It's exactly what we deduced earlier.

51
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,510
Has Chen Zhao's body been examined yet?

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Yes.

53
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,290
The coroner said

54
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,640
he died of a cardiac arrest

55
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,030
caused by over excitement during sex.

56
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,890
Anything unusual about the wine?

57
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,130
Nothing.

58
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,130
A small dose of ordinary aphrodisiac
wouldn't be enough to kill.

59
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,530
Given all that,

60
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,910
the Ministry of Punishments
can close the case now.

61
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,130
I wish I could.

62
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,430
But my hunch keeps telling me

63
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,160
that Chen Zhao's death
isn't as simple as it appears.

64
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,490
What makes you say that?

65
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,000
When Mrs. Chen came

66
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,930
to claimed Chen Zhao's body,

67
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,110
the expression on her face
was rather peculiar.

68
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,070
Lord Shen,

69
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,280
I'm here

70
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,620
to claim my husband's body.

71
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,000
Mao.

72
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,190
Yes.

73
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,900
Thanks, Lord Shen.

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,050
In theory,

75
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,970
Mrs. Chen should've grieved,

76
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,660
but I actually caught her smiling.

77
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,420
She even personally came and checked

78
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,860
if Chen Zhao was dead.

79
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,590
Something must be off.

80
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,220
It's a no-brainer.

81
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,700
I think there's a different cause
of Chen Zhao's death.

82
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,630
Now that you're suspicious,
just conduct an investigation.

83
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,700
Why did you ask us to come?

84
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,190
I didn't ask for you.

85
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,120
The one I asked for was Yu.

86
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Yu,

87
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,200
would you join me
in visiting the Chen Mansion at night?

88
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,860
I guarantee

89
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,210
there will be a handsome reward.

90
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,220
I disagree.

91
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,150
Who are you to make decisions for Yu?

92
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,430
Why can't I do that?

93
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,720
Don't you forget

94
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,130
she works for the Imperial Guard now.

95
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,160
You and I are both officials.

96
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,520
We should help each other

97
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,450
in the course of seeking the truth.

98
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,529
Why draw clear boundaries?

99
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,920
Shen Pan,

100
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,600
are all the officers
in the Ministry of Punishments dead now?

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,580
I'm determined to take Yu with me.

102
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,040
Then let's see if you're able to do that.

103
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,020
Lu Zhan is a real punk.

104
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,400
He kept hitting my face.

105
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,760
You big loser.

106
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,370
Lord Shen,

107
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,610
did your hands get hurt?

108
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,470
No.

109
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,280
That's good.

110
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,690
It was my face that got injured.

111
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,920
Yu, why did you ask about my hands?

112
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,620
She's not worried about you,

113
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,590
but her money makers.

114
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,300
I'm just concerned about you, My Lord.

115
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,140
Lord Shen,

116
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,760
let me put salve on your face.

117
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,610
Here.

118
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,490
Does it hurt?

119
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,580
Not much.

120
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,400
What is this about?

121
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,810
Don't you see I'm also injured?

122
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,470
Why are you only treating him?

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,150
Those minor injuries of yours

124
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,030
are barely visible to the eye.

125
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,310
Why even complain?

126
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,950
Treat them yourself.

127
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,860
I'm busy.

128
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,530
Hope to see you again soon, Mr. Wang. Bye.

129
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,410
Sir,
it's been a while since your last visit.

130
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,340
Officer Huang

131
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,030
is really getting out of line.

132
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,420
Does she even know who her superior is?

133
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,610
Do you have to be this mad
because she didn't

134
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,890
treat your injuries?

135
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,350
What do you know?

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,550
I just hate to lose to Shen Pan.

137
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,040
And you...

138
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,510
I asked you to choose a place for drinks.

139
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,610
What kind of place is this?

140
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,320
Sir...

141
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,930
Look what a place you picked!

142
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,580
My salary is way too low

143
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,980
for this place.

144
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,490
If you hadn't objected,

145
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:59,110
I would've got some girls to this table.

146
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,100
But I'm fine with how it is now.

147
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,830
What nonsense are you talking?

148
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,920
All men should contribute to the court

149
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,890
and make achievements.

150
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,850
You're right.

151
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,740
But in the matter about Officer Huang,

152
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,880
I have to say you did wrong.

153
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,060
It was up to her to decide

154
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,990
whether to assist Lord Shen or not.

155
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,470
Why did you try to make decisions for her?

156
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,480
Why couldn't I do that?

157
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,400
She's now working for the Imperial Guard,
isn't she?

158
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,310
That's true.

159
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,120
But you don't own her.

160
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,240
You can't stop her from making money,
can you?

161
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,520
When it comes to winning a girl's heart,

162
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,370
Lord Shen does outperform you.

163
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,490
You should really learn from him.

164
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,820
Are you hearing yourself?

165
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,890
You'll pay for this meal.

166
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,970
My Lord,

167
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,290
didn't you say this would be your treat?

168
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,270
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

169
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:46,960
Off you go.

170
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,810
Hold on!

171
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,130
What's the matter, sir?

172
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,460
What kind of wine is this?

173
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,820
It's called "Drunken Dream."

174
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,320
It nourishes kidneys, boosts virility,

175
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,540
and enhances pleasure.

176
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,470
It's an exclusive specialty here.

177
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,090
Are there varieties of this wine?

178
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,640
Yes.

179
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,500
Bring them all to me.

180
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,000
Why aren't you moving yet?

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,130
Yes, sir. I'll go get them.

182
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,860
Yu, have you eaten yet?

183
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,280
Yes, I have.

184
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,760
I came to see you for real business.

185
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,650
What's this?

186
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,520
The money

187
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,940
we earned for selling Lord Lu's portraits.

188
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,630
Let's each keep half of it.

189
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,530
No need.

190
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,409
I promised to help you make money.

191
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,419
No way.

192
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,830
How can you not get anything in return
for your effort?

193
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,880
Please take it,

194
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,789
or I'll be too embarrassed

195
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,360
to ask you
to be my business partner again.

196
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,300
You want me
to be your business partner again?

197
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,830
Am I disturbing you, My Lord?

198
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,730
Not at all.

199
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,090
It's just...

200
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,760
that others may think of me

201
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,780
as a philanderer,

202
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,840
so they wouldn't fraternize with me.

203
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,670
Do you not mind it at all?

204
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,530
I don't think
you're like what people say you are.

205
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,180
On the contrary,

206
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,180
in my eyes, you truly respect women.

207
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,070
You wouldn't look down on a female

208
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,600
because of her background.

209
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,680
You've noticed that?

210
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,830
I learned of what Xue Jingshu did.

211
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,420
Although she was a murderer,

212
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,750
you still kept her

213
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,400
from unjust treatment in prison.

214
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,530
You also had her body properly buried.

215
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,850
So many women

216
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,990
were assaulted and abused
when they were alive.

217
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,780
Their bodies were left in the wilderness
after they died.

218
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,000
Xue Jingshu was lucky

219
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,510
to have met you, My Lord.

220
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,930
You should keep all the money.

221
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,020
I'll take it then.
