[Episode 20]

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,110
Thirteen years ago,

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,030
Ling Yuanhang's entire family was executed

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,510
due to rebelling

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,560
and embezzling military funds.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,600
His eldest daughter, Ling Zhang,
was sold to Yanyu Brothel.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,460
The whereabouts of his son, Ling Xiao,
was unknown.

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,000
At 10, Ling Xiao
had exceptional lightness skills

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,460
and excelled in medicine.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,380
The ghost-masked man
also knows about the Moon Stone.

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,200
Back when the Ling family was purged,

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,660
were there any survivors?

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,890
Zhao.

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,430
What are you thinking about?

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,100
Nothing.

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,100
Did the Mu family have any survivors?

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:51,980
No.

19
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:02,930
My Lord.

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,330
Where is Commander Li?

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,130
Commander Li went to take a bath.

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,580
Where would Zhao Yutang go
to keep the appointment?

23
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,950
Could it be Changsheng Temple?

24
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,950
Shen Pan!

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,930
Shen Pan!

26
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,640
Has Yu come to you?

27
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,700
No.

28
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,860
Crap!

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,280
Yu is missing!

30
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,420
Yu is missing?

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,810
Wasn't she with you?

32
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,190
I think she was taken by Li Zhaoxia.

33
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,380
Li Zhaoxia?

34
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,950
Why would he take Yu?

35
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,150
I found out that Li Zhaoxia

36
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,800
might be the ghost-masked man.

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,060
Yu was probably taken

38
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,000
because of that.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,270
You're saying
Li Zhaoxia is the ghost-masked man?

40
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,729
We must rescue Yu quickly.

41
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,640
My Lord,

42
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,910
we've tracked down
the ghost-masked man's whereabouts.

43
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,690
Go!

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,420
Call the Imperial Guards!

45
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,540
Commander Li,

46
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,810
I have no grudge against you.

47
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,640
Why are you doing this to me?

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,390
Why?

49
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,220
Because you deserve to die!

50
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,670
Youlan, whom you tortured to death,

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,150
was my sister, Ling Zhang.

52
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,470
I am Ling Xiao, the son of Ling Yuanhang,

53
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,910
Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review Court.

54
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,360
It was Chen Zhao and Jiang Ning

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,670
who framed the Ling family!

56
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,550
It has nothing to do with me!

57
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,210
You're still making excuses!

58
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,860
Do you really think

59
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
I came here alone?

60
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,310
To tell you the truth,

61
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,000
if anything happens to me today,

62
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,370
you won't survive either.

63
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,850
So what?

64
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,620
Get up!

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,600
What you owe the Ling family—

66
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,880
I'll make you pay for it

67
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,450

68

Stop.

70
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,770
You know everything?

71
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,450
Yes.

72
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,630
You're going to stop me too?

73
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,310
Have you forgotten

74
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,550
how our families were wiped out?

75
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,750
I haven't forgotten!

76
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,210
But Zhao Yutang shouldn't die here.

77
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,190
We should expose his crimes

78
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,830
and clear our names openly and justly!

79
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,190
Openly and justly?

81
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,550
You're still too naive.

82
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,360
The court today is corrupt.

83
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,910
There's no justice.

84
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,330
There's no justice!

85

Shut up.

88
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,210
Fine.

89
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,800
I won't go over there.

90
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
I won't go over there.

91
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:35,880
Zhao,

92
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,940
I have obtained

93
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,909
all the evidence needed
to bring Zhao Yutang to justice!

94
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:39,820
Release them first!

95
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,530
Enough!

96
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,030
Zhao,

97
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,820
Mrs. Chen's booklet

98
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,860
records all the evidence
of Zhao Yutang's crimes!

99
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,180
The donations to Changsheng Temple

100
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,710
were all embezzled by him!

101
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,909
With this,

102
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,090
it's enough to clear the names
of the Ling family and the Mu family!

103
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,970
Clear our names?

104
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,480
He caused the extermination
of the Ling family.

105
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,280
He caused my sister
to die tragically in a brothel.

106
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,680
If I don't tear him into pieces,

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,660
it won't be enough
to ease the hatred in my heart!

108
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,240
Ling Xiao.

109
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,480
Listen to me.

110
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,920
I believe your father and mother

111
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,520
wouldn't want you to do this.

112
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,830
All these years,

113
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,030
your sister never looked for you

114
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,290
just because she wanted you to live well!

115
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,260
Thirteen years ago,

116
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,230
Ling Xiao was already dead.

117
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,620
Already dead!

118
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,550
Zhao!

119
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,000
Back when the Ling family was wiped out,

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,770
my master secretly took me to a valley.

121
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,440
He told me

122
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,000
not to seek revenge.

123
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,590
But when I found out my sister

124
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,380
died an unnatural death

125
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,630
and was forced into a ghost marriage,

126
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,110
how could I not hate?

127
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,040
So...

128
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,070
that's why
you were willing to help Xue Jingshu?

129
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,610
Yes.

130
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,110
I targeted everyone
involved in ghost marriages!

131
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,970
If I had known earlier

132
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,700
that Zhao Yutang was the one
who killed my sister,

133
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,850
how could I have let him live until now?

134
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,150
What about Chen Zhao?

135
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,200
Why did you use Zhou Yue

136
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,450
to kill Chen Zhao?

137
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,050
Chen Zhao was my sister's fiancé.

138
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,020
But he colluded with Jiang Ning,

139
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,880
intentionally framing my father

140
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,220
and causing my sister

141
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,310
to end up in a brothel.

142
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,480
If I hadn't wanted
to keep my identity secret,

143
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,860
I would have killed him
with my own hands long ago.

144
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,780
Even so,

145
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,870
your enemy is Zhao Yutang!

146
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,240
Why did you capture Yu?

147

After I kill Zhao Yutang,

149
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,610
I will apologize to you all.

150
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
That's just your wishful thinking.

151
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,430
Perhaps you all don't know yet,

152
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,230
but my men will be here soon.

153
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,920
No one can leave!

154
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,920
Your men have been wiped out by us.

155
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,280
Impossible.

156
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,490
Since that's the case,

157
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,180

Zhao Yutang, I'm going to kill you!

160

framed loyal officials,

161

embezzled official silver,

162
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,640
accepted bribes,

163
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,280
sold official positions,

164
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,390
and corrupted the court's discipline.

165
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,120
In the end, they were beheaded.

166

The names of the Ling and Mu families

167
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,530

172
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,260
She has never blamed you.

173
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,110
Why did you save me?

174
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,790
Because you, Li Zhaoxia,

175
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,610
are my subordinate.

176
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,820
Why didn't you tell me from the start?

177
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,030
If I had told you earlier,

178
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,990

would have been different.
