[A Mission of the Heart]

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,890
[Episode 17]

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,120
Officer Huang must have been hit

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,020
with the Weakness Powder.

5
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,060
It doesn't just cause fatigue.

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,300
It also has aphrodisiac
and hallucinogenic effects.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,280
That filthy Taoist!

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,010
If he dares to lay a finger on Yu,

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,360
I'll skin him alive!

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,150
It has only been a moment.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,460
She must still be in the temple.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,530
Zhao, Mao,

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,750
you two search the outside.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,750
Shen Pan and I will check the inside.

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,500
-Yes.
-Yes.

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,150
Shen Pan.

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,150
How's it going?

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,480
My Lord.

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,640
We've searched everywhere,

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,840
but we found nothing.

21
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,520
Impossible.

22
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,040
That's impossible!

23
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,400
This Changsheng Temple isn't very large.

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,680
To hide someone in such a short time,

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,360
there must be a secret passage
or chamber.

26
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
Keep searching.

27
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,849
Even if we have to turn the whole temple
upside down,

28
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,260
we must find her!

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,940
If we can't find her here,

30
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,510
expand the search into the mountains.

31
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,270
Keep looking!

32
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,680
Yes.

33
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,230
Yes.

34
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:11,840
Let's go.

35
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,000
We know nothing about her background.

36
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,860
She's not even on our list.

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,460
You shouldn't have kidnapped her.

38
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,380
I have already checked it.

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
There's absolutely no problem.

40
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,910
But...

41
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,050
No buts.

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,850
If that lord hadn't

43
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,830
accidentally killed Mrs. Chen,

44
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,190
I wouldn't

45
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,229
have resorted to such a move.

46
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,930
Without the list provided by Mrs. Chen,

47
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,930
I have to find my own way.

48
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,160
Our plan cannot stop.

49
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,190
If it stops,

50
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,190
all our previous efforts
will be for nothing.

51
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,440
Can you afford

52
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,229
that responsibility?

53
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,930
Then be careful.

54
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,410
My little beauty,

55
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,250
let me

56
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,930
give you some real pleasure.

57
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,570
I promise I'll make

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,700
you pregnant.

59
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,360
This isn't Lord Lu.

60
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,330
Ms. Huang?

61
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,720
Miss Ziyan?

62
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,840
Why are you here?

63
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,860
I got caught by them while trying

64
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,820
to uncover the truth for my sister.

65
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,420
Now is not the time to talk about this.

66
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,270
You...

67
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,150
You go get that girl

68
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,070
and bring her back.

69
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,780
Since you've already exposed yourself,

70
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,640
there's no need for you to live anymore!

71
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,230
Let's go!

72
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,070
The Taoist is dead. Let's escape now!

73
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,820
He's dead?

74
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,650
Thank goodness!

75
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,050
Follow me. I know where the exit is.

76
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,230
Let's go!

77
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,190
Be careful!

78
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,930
The old bastard died just like this?

79
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,810
He really didn't suffer enough.

80
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,460
We need to find Yu as quickly as possible.

81
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:04,800
Let's go.

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,330
Let's go.

83
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,570
Hurry!

84
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,320
Hurry!

85
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,600
Ziyan, take this.

86
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,660
I'm leaving their safety
in your hands now.

87
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,270
What about you?

88
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,690
Don't worry. I'm from the Imperial Guard.

89
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,830
I'll take care of myself.

90
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,980
Take care of them.

91
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,230
Be careful!

92
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,110
Stop running!

93
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,380
Hurry!

94
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,030
Stop!

95
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,090
Lord Shen?

96
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,500
Lord Shen?

97
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,730
It's Lord Shen!

98
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,690
Miss Ziyan.

99
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,890
Miss Ziyan.

100
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,480
Why isn't Huang Yu with you?

101
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,110
To protect us, Ms. Huang

102
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,130
lured those people away by herself.

103
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:20,780
My Lord.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,610
My Lord.

105
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,130
Zhao, take them back.

106
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:23,730
Yes.

107
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,120
Mao,

108
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,900
escort them to a safe place.

109
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,570
I'll go find Yu.

110
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,530
Yes, My Lord.

111
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,530
Huang Yu!

112
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,550
Huang Yu!

113
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,880
How's it going?

114
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,070
I still haven't found them.

115
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,360
My Lord.

116
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,240
What about you?

117
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,380
No sign of Lord Lu and Officer Huang.

118
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,540
Send more men.

119
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,380
Find them at all costs.

120
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,660
Yes.

121
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,030
It hurts.

122
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,190
-Yu.
-It hurts.

123
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,700
Bear with it a little longer.

124
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,760
I'll pull the arrow out for you first.

125
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,340

Zhao,

00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,250
hurry and examine Yu!

172
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:05,920
Okay.

173
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,250
How is Yu doing?

174
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,110
She's not well.

175
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,560
What do you mean by that?

176
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,510
After suffering severe injuries,

177
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,790
Yu was soaked in water.

178
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,880
And now she has a persistent high fever.

179
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,940
If this continues,

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,560
I'm afraid she might...

181
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,620
That won't happen!

182
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,340
Yu will be fine.

183
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,030
Zhao.

184
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,870
Last time,

185
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,429
I asked you to investigate

186
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,510
if there's any connection
between Jiang Ning and Yu.

187
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,970
You said there wasn't any.

188
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,380
Focus on investigating

189
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,909
what Jiang Ning did

190
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,230
before Yu turned 5 years old.

191
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,909
Yes.

192
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,140
Yu.

193
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:17,880
Yu.

194
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,850
Yu, it's me.

195
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,070
It's me, Yu.

196
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,240
My Lord.

197
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,770
Yu.

198
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm here.

199
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,150
It's all over now.

200
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,810
You'll be alright, Yu.

201
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,240
I'm here.

202
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,370
Everything's fine now.

203
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,120
Don't be afraid.
