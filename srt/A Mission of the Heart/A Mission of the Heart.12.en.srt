[Episode 12]

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,510
I wonder what this ghost-masked man

4
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,150
truly wants.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,380
Could he have something to do

6
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,110
with the disaster relief fund?

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:32,890
I don't know.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,620
Mr. Zhou

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,900
was also a pitiful man.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,070
In order to pursue Zhang Chuchu,

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,250
he spent all his savings.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,050
In the end,

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,390
in order to avenge her,

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,810
he even lost his own life.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,950
Young Lady.

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,030
Young Lady,

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,970
have we met somewhere before?

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,160
You... must have mistaken me
for someone else.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,120
No, Young Lady.

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,820
I really think

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,040
you look very familiar.

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,640
You've got the wrong person.

23
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,530
-Young Lady.
-What are you doing?

24
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,030
What is wrong with...

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,020
Lord Lu.

26
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,789
So it's Lord Jiang,
Vice Minister of Revenue.

27
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,750
What?

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,450
Interested in my subordinate?

29
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,480
You're old.

30
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,700
Surely you aren't thinking
of snatching a young lady, right?

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,500
Lord Shen,

32
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,820
don't talk nonsense.

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,100
I merely thought

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,720
her eyes and brows
resemble those of an old friend

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,650
and wanted to ask who her father is.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,560
Asking about her father?

37
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,530
Trying to make connections?

38
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,160
Not at all.

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,350
Since you're not trying
to make connections,

40
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,470
why ask about her father?

41
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,509
I am a third-rank official.

42
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,360
What would I do to a young lady?

43
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,650
You'd better not.

44
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,690
I have important matters to attend to.

45
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,750
I should get going.

46
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,250
Let's go.

47
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,090
See you, Lord Jiang.

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,160
Yu.

49
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,540
You know Jiang Ning?

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,960
No.

51
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,810
Then why are you afraid of him?

52
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,140
I don't know why

53
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,579
I'd recall

54
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,600
some very frightening scenes

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,770
whenever I see him.

56
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,140
But my memories are very blurry.

57
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,680
I can't remember clearly.

58
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,420
By the way, Officer Huang,

59
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,090
where's your family?

60
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,520
How come
I've never heard you mention them?

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,540
I don't remember.

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,220
I have no memories before the age of 5.

63
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,400
Then how did you grow up?

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,960
What's wrong?

65
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,920
When I was 5,

66
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,570
my father found me,
who was still breathing,

67
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,300
at a mass grave. So he took me in.

68
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:18,940
And then,

69
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,240
he taught me
how to perform autopsies and read.

70
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,020
No wonder you're so skilled at autopsies.

71
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,520
I didn't expect you to start learning
at such a young age.

72
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,650
Your father must be very capable then.

73
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,840
Can you introduce me to him?

74
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,600
Hey, Mao.

75
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,260
I want...

76
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,600
What are you doing?

77
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,000
I want to go to the toilet.

78
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,630
I want to go to the toilet.

79
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,310
You, a grown man, still need someone

80
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,840
to go to the toilet with you?

81
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,980
I'm sorry, Yu.

82
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,510
Mao...

83
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,360
doesn't know your background.

84
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,630
It's fine.

85
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,190
Don't worry.

86
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,890
Aren't I perfectly fine?

87
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,690
Delicious.

88
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:02,090
-Don't eat too much.
-Don't eat too much.

89
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,440
Are you scared?

90
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,140
No.

91
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:34,540
Yu.

92
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,409
Did your adoptive father...
treat you well?

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,600
My father was very good to me.

94
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,330
But when I was 15,

95
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,590
he passed away due to an illness.

96
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,270
After that...

97
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,310
I was all alone.

98
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,140
Then... did anyone bully you?

99
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,120
You little brat.

100
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,160
What are you talking about?

101
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,460
With my great strength,

102
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,760
how could anyone bully me?

103
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,090
They were lucky
that I didn't beat them up.

104
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,470
Our Yu is the most formidable.

105
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,140
These are the names

106
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,170
of those who bullied Officer Huang.

107
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,170
Yu has immense strength.

108
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,760
How could she be bullied?

109
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,640
Since ancient times,

110
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,020
commoners don't fight against officials.

111
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,830
Although Officer Huang has great strength,

112
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,550
she is still just an ordinary person.

113
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,080
How can she fight
against the powerful and noble?

114
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,410
She can fight back once,

115
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,210
but she can't do so every time.

116
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,560
The people on this list—

117
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,220
don't let them live too comfortably.

118
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,220
From now on...

119
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,990
if anyone dares to bully you,

120
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,310
I'll help you punish them severely.

121
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,270
What's wrong?

122
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,840
Nothing.

123
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,200
What does Lu Sanliang

124
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,410
mean by this?

125
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,430
At least he could have put me down
before leaving!

126
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,740
How was the relationship

127
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,860
between your madam

128
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,260
and your master usually?

129
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,900
Before Madam became pregnant,

130
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,390
they were always on good terms.

131
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,950
Later, after Madam became pregnant,

132
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,680
their relationship worsened.

133
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,660
She became emotionally unstable

134
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,320
and often argued with Master.

135
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,720
Then Master grew weary of it

136
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,310
and rarely came home.

137
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,480
How did your madam

138
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,300
dress usually?

139
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,200
During the daytime,

140
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,330
when we saw Madam,

141
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,070
she always dressed plainly.

142
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,590
[Daily Journal]

143
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,030
Do you recognize the handwriting on this?

144
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,000
This is Madam's handwriting.

145
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,100
Are you certain?

146
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,790
Usually, when Madam wrote or painted,

147
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,520
it was always me who served her.

148
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,000
Zhao.

149
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,160
Yes.

150
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,560
Take Mrs. Chen's previous calligraphy
and paintings

151
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,820
and this suicide note,

152
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,670
and give them all to Shen Pan.

153
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,070
He has considerable expertise
in calligraphy and paintings.

154
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,070
He should be able to find something.

155
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,780
What's wrong?

156
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,780
Just say it.

157
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,370
Was what happened yesterday...

158
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,400
too much of a blow

159
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,570
to Officer Huang?

160
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,669
This morning, I didn't see her at all.

161
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,990
Crap.

162
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,370
Yu!

163
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,590
Yu?

164
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,740
Yu!

165
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,100
Yu.

166
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,930
Yu.

167
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,280
Are you okay?

168
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,390
What do you think?

169
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,350
I'm sorry, Yu.

170
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,560
You still remember me?

171
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,360
I'll take you back to rest first.

172
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,040
You must have been freezing all night
last night.

173
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
What do you think?

174
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,770
It was all thanks to you.

175
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,270
I endured cold wind all night

176
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,830
and fell flat on my face.

177
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,750
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,830
I'll never do that again.

179
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,010
Alright.

180
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,470
You can put me down now.

181
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,200
I'm not that badly hurt.

182
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,750
I'll forgive you this time.

183
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:34,870
Really?

184
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,880
By the way,

185
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,970
who was that person last night?

186
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Did you catch him?

187
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,270
No.

188
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,310
Again?

189
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,770
My Lord,

190
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,260
your ability to catch people

191
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,720
doesn't seem very reliable.
