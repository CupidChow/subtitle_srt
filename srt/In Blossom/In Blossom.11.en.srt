00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,800
Come.

20
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:41,720
You can have this.

21
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,550
Thank you.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,760
You are welcome.

23
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,120
- Sir, here's yours.
- Here you go.

24
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,830
Thank you.

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,230
Here.

26
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,510
I want one bowl of these, please.

27
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,720
Little girl.

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,230
Here you go, sir.

29
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,950
I'll have one too.

30
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,270
Thank you.

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,760
Young Master Zhuo, what is going on here?

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,870
I feel bad for causing an upset encounter

33
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,550
for you and Miss San.

34
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,630
I explained it to her

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,830
and compensated her with some money.

36
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,910
I told her it was a kind gesture of yours.

37
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,360
However, Miss San didn't want
to take it for granted.

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,830
So, she bought the iced dessert

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
to give everyone a sweet treat.

40
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,600
Come with me.

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,520
I prepared this for you.

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
More honey for you.

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,240
Thank you so much.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
Please give me one more bowl of this.

45
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,670
Sure.

46
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,630
Try this. It is sweet.

No need.

- Why?
- Miss San, give me more.

- Does the noble lady Shangguan Zhi

when she serves at the county yamen?

52
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,240
I don't think this is appropriate.

53
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,750
As you said,

54
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,360
Shangguan Zhi

55
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,600
serves at the county yamen.

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,550
She is not yet the young madam
of Silver Rain Terrace.

57
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,190
I have much patience for my own marriage.

58
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,960
I believe faith can move mountains.

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,670
Zhi will realize

60
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,670
who cherishes her dearly one day.

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,830
That's enough.

62
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,080
Aside from offering iced dessert,

63
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,470
I came here for something serious.

64
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,110
Why?

65
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,720
Do you want to report another grievance?

66
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,800
You seem biased against me.

67
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,110
What are you up to again?

68
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,520
Mr. Pan, may I have a word with you?

69
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,830
I was reckless to report
that you murdered your wife.

70
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
I apologize for that.

71
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,600
I beg your pardon.

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,550
Please don't.

73
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,190
Why don't you tell me
what is on your mind?

74
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,320
Well, I will cut right to the chase.

75
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,440
The county yamen is going
to review the Lantern Festival Case.

76
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,440
Silver Rain Terrace would like to assist.

77
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,440
It seems that there is nothing in Heyang

78
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,790
that can be hidden

79
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,480
from Silver Rain Terrace.

80
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,320
It is more efficient

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,270
if we join hands.

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,790
It is just an old case.

83
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,550
Why is Silver Rain Terrace
so concerned about it?

84
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,070
Silver Rain Terrace is widely known
as the guardian of Heyang.

85
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,640
Since someone wants to stir up trouble
in Heyang,

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,200
how can I not take care of it?

87
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,720
Right, Mr. Pan?

88
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,390
What did you two talk about?
It took so long.

89
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,720
I sincerely propose a collaboration
with Mr. Pan.

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,440
What a shame. He doesn't trust me
and has turned me down.

91
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,550
It's the county yamen's duty
to investigate.

92
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,440
Kindly don't worry about it.

93
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,760
Never mind.

94
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,160
I just came here

95
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,440
to inform you about my intention.

96
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,270
Whether or not we collaborate,

97
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Silver Rain Terrace will take this matter
into its own hands.

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,320
I see.

99
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,920
If so,

100
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,600
let's see how we do it.

101
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,270
Hold on.

102
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,230
What collaboration?

103
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,920

104
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,950
Zhi, I'm leaving.

105
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,920
Aren't you going to see me off?

106
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,440
Why are you looking at me?

107
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,950
He's not my friend.

108
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,070
See him off

109
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,320
if you want.

110
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:44,950
Let's go.

111
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,000
I think I'd better show him out.

112
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,440
Fine.

113
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,200
What? You want to investigate
the Lantern Festival Case?

114
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,390
Are you suspecting me too?

115
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,270
Of course not. I trust you.

116
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,270
But does Pan Yue allow you to step in?

117
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,270
I don't need his approval

118
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,640
for what I'm going to do.

119
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,920
Well, then.

120
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,350
Maybe the case might be solved faster
with you interfering.

121
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:11,950
Of course.

122
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,160
I promised you

123
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,000
I would find the culprit.

124
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,920
By the way,

125
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,390
you brought the iced dessert
and Miss San here today.

126
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,550
I appreciate that.

127

or ice carts

Mr. Pan.

146
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,950
When it was around
the summer solstice back then,

147
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,510
it was our busiest time.

148
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,720
But since the Lantern Festival stopped
due to the case,

149
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,950
there have been fewer people
hanging out at night,

150
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,670

as soon as possible

153

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,640
Miss San,

177
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,790
please tell me frankly

178
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,470

Mr. Pan, you are right.

180

I hate him.

181
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,910
Why?

182
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,350
It's not my sister's fault.

183

She's not a local.

184
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,230
She came to Heyang due to a famine.

185
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,350
Superficially,
she was adopted by my father.

186

But in fact, he used her
for back-breaking work.

187

00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,760
He forced children under him to beg.

He was found dead

on a secluded road by the riverside.

230

00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,400
the environment changes
according to our minds.

375
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,310
But is it possible

376
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,280
for a person to change so much

Nowhere.

413
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,000
We passed by a fruit orchid,

414
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,470
and Young Master and Miss Shangguan
picked some fruit.

415
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,520
That's why we are back late.

416

Mr. Pan and Young Lady
picked fruit together?

they couldn't even

00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,160
sit at the same table

421
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,310
to eat.

422
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,470
Even though their relationship
became less intense afterward,

423
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,950
they only discussed official matters

424
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,350
and nothing more.

Mr. Pan

427
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,310
was accompanying Young Lady to pick fruit.

428
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,920

430

You are just overthinking.

Earlier today, Miss Shangguan
made a contribution

433
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,830
as she protected the body.

434
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,230
Young Master was concerned
she might be hungry,

435
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
so he showed concern for her.

436
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,070
It is a concern for the subordinates.

437
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,070
Besides,

438
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,830
I stopped the carriage
to remove the raincoat for the horses.

439
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,800
It wasn't Young Master's idea.

442
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,680

00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,590

Why is she mad?

446
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,560
Though you weren't a good person
before you died,

447
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,470
you should know
the truth behind your death.

fine scars should have been shown
around the bones.

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,190
If he had been pierced by a sharp tool,

456
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,160
there should have been a stab wound
near the neck bone.

504
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,350

and one thick and short.

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,160

531
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,680
All right.

532
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,070
This weapon

533
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,640
can be used in two ways.

534
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,710
If used with normal force,

535
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,920
it could function like an ordinary sword.

536
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,760
But if used with special skills,

537
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,160
the three spikes at the top

538
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,520
can create this wound.

539
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,640
Among the three spikes,

540
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,280
the short one comes as assistance,

541
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,400
while the long ones can kill.

542
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,040
The sharp tools that penetrated
the Tiantu acupoint

543
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,310
are these two long spikes.

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,880
With sharp ridges,

545
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,040
that's why the cut is neat.

546
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,230
Due to the handle below,
it could only penetrate two cun deep.

547
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,470
Because the penetration wasn't deep,

548
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
it wouldn't hurt the bones.

549
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,350
Is it necessary for the murderer

550
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,590
to use a complex weapon?

551
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,040

00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,590
has seen weapons before.

553
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,880
This is just a wild guess.

554
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,310
Whether or not the guess is right,

555
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,000

00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,310
But this

560
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,070
is Miss Shangguan's speculation.

561
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,470
It can't be

562
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,800
proven.

563
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,310
Will this benefit the investigation?

564
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,640
We haven't seen it.

565
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,070
Then go find someone who might have.

566
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,430
Shangguan Zhi, take your drawing.

567
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,470
We are going to verify it.

568
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,350
Verify?

569
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,920
Wait for me, Mr. Pan.

570
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,470
Mr. Pan actually believes her?

571
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,760
In this prison,

572
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,710
most of them are desperate outlaws

who may be knowledgeable.

574
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,950
Mr. Pan, do you really believe me?

575
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,430
After all possibilities are denied,

576
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,710
even if the remaining one

577
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,430
is a wild guess,

578
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,590
it is the truth.

579
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,000
We are from the county yamen
for investigation.

580
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,040
Whoever provides clues

581
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,040
will have mitigation.

582
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,230
How?

583
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,920
Anyone who provides hints
about this unusual weapon

584
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,760
will get a lighter punishment
or be released for minor crimes.

585
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,800
This is a good deal.

586
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,470
- No.
- I haven't seen it.

587

- No.
- No, I haven't seen it.

588

589
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,350
It is...

590
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,830
Blood Sword.

591
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,230
Blood Sword?

592
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,800
You saw this before?

593
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,590
Blood Sword is cut-throat.

594
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,110
Anyone who sees it will be killed.

595
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,950

596

What has happened?

597
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,520
Fifteen years ago,

598
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,680
my buddies and I

599
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,590
were stationed in the southern mountains

600
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,710
and lived off robberies.

601
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,070
We were notorious.

602
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,350
One day,

603
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,760
after we robbed a caravan

604
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,070
and went to the town to celebrate,

605
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,070
unexpectedly,

606
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,160
we ran into a killer.

607
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,710
That person drew blood

608
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,160
to cultivate the sword.

609
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,640
It was just a tale.

610
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,830
But I saw it with my eyes that night.

611
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,680
That person was killing in the night

612
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,950
as if he were the Grim Reaper.

613
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,160
That scene

614
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,070
is still vivid in my mind.

615
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,310
I wonder who the person is.

616
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I know.

00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,160
The former top killer in Heyang,

618
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,350
now the leader of Relief Hall, Gu Yong.

619
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,880
Mr. Pan, since we know it was Gu Yong,

620
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,230
is there anything you find suspicious?

621
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,520
Gu Yong is very fastidious
in his daily life.

622
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,640
He sent his men to other places
for lavish purchases every quarter.

Mr. Pan said you found something.

682
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,630
He asked me to follow up.

What is it about?

684
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,390
Mr. Pan asked me about the stolen token.

685
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,800
He told me to find Constable Sun,
who was in charge back then.

686
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,190
Finally, I found him.

687
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,600
That's great. Let's go.

00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,040

the evidence of the Lantern Festival Case.

697
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,670
Do you remember

698
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,600
the token with a ripple pattern?

699
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,760
I will never forget.

700
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,000
If I hadn't lost that token,

701
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,520
I wouldn't have been dismissed

702
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,560
and become a waiter.

703
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,000
Could you tell us in detail?

704
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,430
At that time, everyone was anxious
about the evil wyvern.

705
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,950
The Four Greats also pressed

706
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,190
the county yamen
to solve the case within the time limit

707
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,390
and give everyone an answer.

708
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,600
We worked day and night.

709
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,630
But the only evidence we got

710
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,710
was the token with a ripple pattern

711
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,950
the suspect dropped at the scene.

712
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,760
I knew how important it was,

713
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,040
so I was extremely careful.

714
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,950
The county yamen
was also heavily guarded.

715
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,520
However, one night,

716
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,710
someone came to steal the token.

717
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,670
I noticed that

718
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,630
and fought with the intruder.

719
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,630
Due to my poor skills,

720
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,190
I couldn't fight him and let him get away.

721
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,630
Do you remember the person's face?

722
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,280
He was in black clothes and masked.

723
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,520
I could only judge from his eyes
and strength

724
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,800
to conclude that he was a young man.

725
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,120
Besides, he wasn't tall.

726
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,870
A person who took a big risk
to steal the token

727
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,000
must be the culprit.

728
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,430
A young man?

729
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,040
It is not Gu Yong.

730
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,430

also led you to Relief Hall.

Mr. Pan, you are fast, too.

735
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,760
I heard that Silver Rain Terrace
and Relief Hall

are the earliest two powerful forces
in Heyang.

737
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,630
I guess you must have

deep connections in private.

739
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,390

to fish something out of me?

Don't read into this.
