[Episode 26]

19
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,740
When men fall in love, they can
get away from it whenever they want.

20
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,160
When women fall in love,
they are infatuated.

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,040
Miss Yang, you are too confident.

22
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,080
It's not about confidence.
It's about trust.

23
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,000
Now that it has come to this,

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,190
I don't think
this is within your control anymore.

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,230
I've given you a choice.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,800
It's best if you let go of him.

What if I don't?

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,800
Then, just drink this wine

and die again.

31
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,630
It seems Your Highness has done a lot

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
in testing me with this poisonous wine.

33
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,000
Miss Yang, you're indeed extraordinary.

34
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,880
How is it?

35
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,030
How did you find the Snowy Jade Wine
from the capital?

36
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,600
I drank it so quickly
that I didn't even taste it.

37
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,600
How did you know
there was no poison in this wine?

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,080
Your Highness,
you are in an exalted position,

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,550
yet you are willing to sacrifice
your chastity

40
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,630
to capture the nation's enemy
with Pan Yue.

41
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,830
How could a woman so righteous,

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,160

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,030

Passionate, righteous, courageous,
and resourceful.

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,830
I envied you
for having Pan Yue at first.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,830
Now, I envy Pan Yue for having you.

53
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,390
I'm undeserving of such praise.

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,630
I was deliberately testing you.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,080
For that, I apologize to you, Miss Yang.

Yes, definitely.

Your Highness, what brings you here?

Were you comfortable during your stay
at the Shangguan Mansion yesterday?

84
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,480
Her Highness just told me

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,440
that some were finding fault with you
at Fengya Garden.

86
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,640
Did you get picked on?

87
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,640
Do I look like someone
who swallows her anger?

88
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,950
Instead, I was worried about you.

When you were dealing
with those in the palace,

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,160
did Her Majesty

Hey, you two.

00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
You were just separated for one day,

93
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,440
was it so difficult?

94
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,480
Do you have to be so lovey-dovey?

95
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,760
Previously, you were separated
for ten years.

96
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,600
Didn't you get used to it already?

97
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,550
I'll never

98
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,510

99
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160

Let's get down to business.

103
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,640
Your Highness, we have found out

104
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,510
that the group of people has
a mysterious stronghold in the capital.

105
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,600
Every year, they would send
a large number of performers

106
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,920
from the Hundred Flowers Court
in Heyang.

107
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,600
They are stirring up trouble
in the imperial court.

108
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,320
It's true that their power
cannot be underestimated.

109
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,270
When in the capital,
you are under their influence.

110
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,440
You have to be extra cautious
in every step you take.

111
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,270
Don't worry, we'll meet up
with Qing Di right away

112
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,790
and come up with a sound strategy.

113
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,880
Investigate everything quickly

114
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,390
and find out the mastermind.

115
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,440
Yes.

116
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,350
This is the Third Mansion
of Willow Street.

117
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,720
You two, please come with me.

118
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,790
Please, come inside.

119
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,390
Mistress,
Mr. Pan and the others are here.

120
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,440
Miss Qing.

121
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,790
What kind of dance were they performing?

122
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,670
It was so unique.

123
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,040
It's called Dancing Among the Clouds.

124
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,000
It was arranged by me and Yunchang
back then.

125
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,550
It's the Hundred Flowers Court's
secret technique.

126
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,720
The key to this dance

127
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,480
is on the waist, abdomen, and ankles.

128
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,040
Without years of practice,

129
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,000
one cannot perform it.

130
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,230
I finally understand why the mastermind
in the capital

131
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,030
wants to cooperate
with the Hundred Flowers Court in Heyang.

132
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,030
This is my confidant, Yun.

133
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,880
When they come to pick her up,

134
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,960
she will leave clues along the way

135
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,670
and cooperate with you in secret.

136
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,550
Greetings, Mr. Pan.

137
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Miss Yun, this journey is perilous.

138
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,550
Are you aware of it?

139
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,400
Yes.

140
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,110
However, I'm willing to risk it

141
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,470
for Miss Qing.

142
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,790
When will they arrive?

143
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,790
According to the convention,

144
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,150
they will inform us two days in advance.

145
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,790
When the girls have rested

146
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,710
and well adjusted,

147
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,790
someone will come to examine them
and take them away.

148
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,880
If they don't pass the examination,

149
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,230
the girls could be rejected.

150
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,640
If so, we will follow the plan.

151
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,840
Notify me as soon as there is any news.

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,760
Don't worry, Mr. Pan.

153
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,840
Well, I will go back to Shangguan Mansion
and wait for the news.

154
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,440
It's not easy for us to meet.

155
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,110
Why don't you stay with me
a little longer?

156
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,840
I'm afraid of being seen by others.

157
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,670
People would be gossiping
about you again.

158
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,840
Come, I'll take you somewhere.

159
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,030
Where?

160
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,880
Is this the peach blossom forest
we went to when we were children?

161
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,030
Yes, a memory exclusive to you and me.

162
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,150
Pan Yue.

163
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,640
Pan Yue, I know you are here.

164
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,400
Pan Yue, come out.

165
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,320
Pan Yue.

166
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,550
Who did you fight with again?

167
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,230
Ze is looking for you
all over the place.

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,880
No matter what nonsense others say,

169
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,670
just ignore them.

170
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
It's not worth being angry with them.

171
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,590
Are my father and brothers
considered as "others"?

172
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
The Pan Mansion is not my home.

173
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,030
I won't go back again.

174
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,280
Alright.

175
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,400
If you don't go home, I won't either.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,710
We will stay right here.

177
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,140
When these peach blossoms wilt

178
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,470
and bear peaches,

179
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,960
we will eat the peaches
and plant the pits.

180
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,400
That way, we will get more peaches.

181
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,080

374
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,710
I've completed

375
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,880
what you told me to.

376
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,070
Who is

377
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,400
the woman inside?

378
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,000
She has nothing to do with this.

379
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,190
Master has agreed to see you.

380
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,230
Three days later,
at the entrance of Liu's Pawnshop.

381
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,160
A carriage will be there to pick you up.

382
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,830
Is he the one you've been looking for?

383
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,110
I…

384
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,880
It's not my business.

385
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,800
I know.

386
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,520
I just think

387
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,110
that he doesn't look like a kind person.

388
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,000
I want you to be careful.

389
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,040
What happened last night…

390
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,470
It was consensual.

391
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,760
There's nothing much to say.

392
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,920
I know you're doing something dangerous.

393
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,800
Even if you are full of evil

394
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,520
and everyone in the world
wants to kill you,

395
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,560
I don't care.

396
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,190
Because I like you.

397
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,400
No matter what you do,

398
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,710
I will like you all the same.

399
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,400
I am Qing Di
of the Hundred Flowers Court.

400
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,310
Welcome, Madam Wan.

401
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,760
Madam Wan,

402
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,350
these are
the carefully selected courtesans

403
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,230
from the Hundred Flowers Court.

404
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,800
Please take a look, Madam Wan.

405
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,770
Well,

406
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,800
take a few steps.

407
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,400
Enchanting acts.

408
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,470
Bewitching expressions.

409
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,280
Qing Di, you have trained them well.

410
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,800
Thank you for your praise, Madam Wan.

411
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,200
Shoulder, one chi and three cun wide.

412
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,830
Hips, two cun narrower
than the shoulder.

413
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,800
Waist, the breadth of a hand's grip.

414
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,590
Great.

415
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,800
Differently colored eyebrows.

416
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,830
Unlucky.

417
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,230
If your mole had grown
between your eyebrows,

418
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,040
there would still be hope.

419
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,110
But your mole is on your temple.

420
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,950
That's a sinister position.

421
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,070
Other than this girl,

422
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,040
I will take

423
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,070
all the other girls.

424
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,470
Yun is the leading dancer
of Dancing Among the Clouds.

425
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,800
Besides, she is more beautiful
than anyone else.

426
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,310
She is my chosen one.

427
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,880
Madam Wan,
please bend the rules a little.

428
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,880
In previous years,
I could have let her pass.

429
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,680
But face reading is popular
in the capital this year.

430
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,310
Our guests

431
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,040
are no exception.

432
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,520
I'll pick the girls up in three days.

433
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,470
If you can find someone to replace her,

434
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,230
I will do another examination.

435
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,800
Farewell.

436
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,070
Let's follow her.

437
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,680
No.

438
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,110
Why?

439
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,950
From the front door, the path is open
in all directions.

440
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,590
There is a teahouse across the river.

441
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,470
The first floor overlooks
the entire street.

442
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,920
If you follow her rashly,

443
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,070
not only is it easy to lose her,

444
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,400
you could be easily discovered.

445
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,310
I'll think of another way.

446
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,070
Our plans were foiled by destiny.

447
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,830
I never thought

448
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,470
they would use this excuse
to reject Yun.

449
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,870
Are there any other courtesans

450
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,000
that could be used as a spy?

451
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,470
No.

452
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,230
This is a highly risky job.

453
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,800
I can't entrust this to anyone else.

454
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,710
Let me do it.

455
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,470
You?

456
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,230
Yes.

457
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,630
Don't forget,

458
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,230
I learned how to dance
when I was a child.

459
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,340
I even performed
for His Majesty and Her Majesty

460
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,160
at the Mid-Autumn banquet.

461
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,040
As the saying goes,

462
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,560
perfection takes years of practice.

463
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,840
How can you do it now?

464
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,390
Miss Shangguan, Mr. Pan is right.

465
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,190
If you are not properly trained,

466
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,230
others will see through it at a glance.

467
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,150
I do have a way.

468
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,630
But I have to trouble you
to train me for a few days.

469
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,150
Maybe

470
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,560
I can still muddle through.

471
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,040
Here's the thing.

472
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,390
I remembered something.

473
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,280
Wasn't I collecting corpses
in the Coffin House before?

474
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,630
Those unclaimed corpses

475
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,760
were all buried by the Coffin House.

476
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,910
After Master went crazy,
I continued to do it alone.

477
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,150
I would often encounter
tomb robbers at night.

478
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,360
I was afraid of being harmed by them,

479
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,520
and I wanted to protect the tombs.

480
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,000
So I thought of a way.

481
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,080
Ghost!

482
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,840
Ghost!

483
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,430
I'll scare you to death.

484
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,320
I lit up some green foxtail

485
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,360
to make some smoke.

486
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,190
Finally, I put some iron pieces
in my shoes

487
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,000
and walked on tiptoe in the grass

488
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,710
to make it look like
I was above the ground.

489
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
But this is a performance,

490
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,470
and those sitting before you
are high officials and nobles,

491
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,430
not tomb robbers.

492
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,230
I'm worried that something might go wrong
if you dance like that.

493
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,360
Stop looking down on me.

494
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,600
Aren't carrying corpses
and dancing both physical tasks?

495
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,800
It takes more effort to carry corpses.

496
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,710
Okay, that's enough.

497
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,840
I won't let you go. It's too dangerous.

498
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,430
You said you would always support me.

499
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,150
I did say
that I would always support you,

500
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,190
but I also said I would protect you.

501
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,310
I can't possibly put you in danger
without doing anything.

502
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,230
Pan Yue!

503
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,120
Yang Caiwei.

504
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,600
The good fortune of finding what I lost,

505
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,190
I dare not ask it for a third time.

506
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,430
It was scary, and I've had enough of it.

507
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,390
Your luck is gone,

508
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,800
but there's still mine.

509
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,430
Look what I've been through
in the past 20-odd years.

510
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,150
I was even almost killed.

511
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,000
It's my turn

512
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,710
to get some good luck.

513
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,670
- But…
- Don't worry.

514
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,800
I will definitely be more careful.

515
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,670
Besides, aren't you here to protect me?

516
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,950
Everything will go smoothly, right?

517
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,190
It's hard to lie forever.

518
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,670
It's easy to cheat for a moment.

519
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,470
Let's give it a try.

520
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
Miss Shangguan,

521
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,800
you will stay here
for the next three days.

522
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,360
We'll practice hard

523
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,950
and be as prepared as possible.

524
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,040
Yes.

525
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,760
Make up an excuse
to explain it to my brother.

526
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,710
Don't worry.

527
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,080
Miss Qing,

528
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,670
Shangguan Zhi
will be in your care, then.

529
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,660
Dancing Among the Clouds was created

530
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,040
by Yunchang and me.

531
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,230
It has swaying steps,
and the dancer's figures are fleeting.

532
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,710
It's sensual but not obscene.
It's hard to put into words.

533
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,390
It's an exquisite dance.

534
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,390
Good, open up your hips.

535
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Straighten your upper body.

536
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,120
Pull yourself upward.

537
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:12,870
Yes.

538
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,600
Steady...

539
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,520
Steady.

540
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,710
This dance is not easy to learn.

541
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,840
Even those with extraordinary talents

542
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,800
need to practice hard.

543
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,280
Get up and come again.

544
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,950
Stand up.

545
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,600
Come again.

546
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,430
Back then, Yunchang and I

547
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,710
practiced for many days, until our feet
went unbearably sore.

548
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,280
We could only put our feet in the snow

549
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,520
to temporarily relieve our pain.

550
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,840
Miss Shangguan, are you okay?

551
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,800
I'm fine.

552
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,320
Dancing Among the Clouds
is indeed a bit difficult.

553
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,120
You only have a few days to master it.

554
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,190
It's really tough on you.

555
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,320
It's weird.

556
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,360
No matter how difficult this dance is,

557
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,430
Yun can't be the only one
to master it, right?

558
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,760
It's not that they can't master it,

559
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,190
but I refused to teach them.

560
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,760
Why?

561
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,710
Since Yunchang's death,

562
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,320
I no longer have the courage
to do this dance.

563
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,600
If it weren't
for Yun's extraordinary talent

564
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,910
and how similar

565
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,950
she and Yunchang looked,

566
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,190
I wouldn't have taught her this dance.

567
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,630
Thus, except for Yun,

568
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,390
Dancing Among the Clouds

569
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,710
can be considered a lost art

570
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,630
in this world.

571
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,520
Don't worry,

572
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,080
Mr. Pan and I can definitely

573
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,000
catch the mastermind behind the scenes

574
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,120
and seek justice for your friends.

575
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,520
Well, I'll try it again.
