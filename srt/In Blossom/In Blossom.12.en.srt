[Relief Hall]

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,760
I apologize for not
receiving you from the outside.

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,190
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,680
You two

23
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,910
look so familiar.

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,480
You...

25
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,510
That means

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,830
we're fit for business.

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,910
That's true.

28
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,110
Are you sure you want Mr. Pan's life?

29
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,190
Yes.

30
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,240
The price of taking Mr. Pan's life
is high.

31
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,800
No bargain. Five hundred taels.

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,320
No questions asked?

33
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,830
Taking a man's life doesn't need a reason.

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,320
Five hundred taels.

35
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,600
You're paying in gold?

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,030
That's good.

37
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,880
Good, good.

38
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,080
I've heard that Relief Hall

39
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,320
not only helps its customers to kill,

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,910
but also kills

41
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,720
in any way they want.

42
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,080
That's for sure.

43
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,550
Our mission is to kill people and
take their lives, to eliminate grudges

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,160
and promote peace in the world.

45
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,550
The methods are as varied as

46
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,390
chopping, sawing,
axing, burning, drowning,

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,550
and plucking out hearts and livers.

48
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,190
There's only what you can't think of,

49
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,440
not what we can't do.

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,550
However, such special requests

51
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,000
are subject to additional charges.

52
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,080
Okay.

53
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,670
I'll pay another 500 taels.

54
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,600
You have special requests? No problem.

55
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,670
Here you go.

56
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,960
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,080
It's okay.

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,550
What special requests do you have?

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Can you kill Mr. Pan

60
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,390
with the Blood Sword

61
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,600
like the victims

62
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,440
at the Lantern Festival?

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,080
Where's this nonsense coming from?

64
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,510
What does the Blood Sword have to do
with the Lantern Festival Case?

65
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,950
I've sheathed my sword for years.

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
These tasks

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
are done by my disciples.

68
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,480
I don't even know
how to use a sword anymore.

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,440
You're a fake, of course you don't.

70
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,880
Get the real Gu Yong to talk to us.

71
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,640
What do you mean?

72
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,600
If you don't need our services,

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,920
I shall take my leave.

74
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,040
How did you know he's a fake?

75
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,350
The top assassin of Heyang

76
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,920
doesn't have the alertness
of an assassin at all.

77
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,720
And his feet are big,

78
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,790
but he walks strangely.

79
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,670
I originally thought
he had problems with his feet,

80
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,830
but then I found out

81
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,230
from the account book of Relief Hall

82
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,760
that he bought two sets of

83
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,320
clothes and shoes of the same style.

84
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,550
That raised my suspicions.

85
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,390
Tell me,

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,270
where is the real Gu Yong?

87
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,550
Guards.

88
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,640
How dare you mess around in Relief Hall.

89
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,720
You should have known
what you were capable of.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,640
Take them down.

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,070
This is Mr. Pan.

92
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,640
Mind what you're doing.

93
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,790
This is Young Master Zhuo.

94
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,350
Mind your manners.

95
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,880
Mr. Pan, Young Master Zhuo.

96
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,720
Mr. Gu would like to
talk to you two inside.

97
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,000
Mr. Gu, I've heard a lot about you.

98
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,000
Young Master Zhuo, Mr. Pan.

99
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,160
We've finally met.

100
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
So you've got a fake

101
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,390
to brush me off all these years?

102
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,440
Mr. Gu, you don't
take the Silver Rain Terrace seriously,

103
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,600
do you?

104
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,270
For every person I kill,

105
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,200
there's at least one more person
who wants to take revenge on me.

106
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,230
So it's not like
I've been brushing you for these years.

107
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Every puppet's words

108
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,760
are my words.

109
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,670
So I don't suppose
any of these doubles of yours

110
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,320
have learned to use
the Blood Sword, have they?

111
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,000
The Blood Sword
is a secret of the Gu family.

112
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,270
I know

113
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,790
what you two are here for.

114
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,480
I have nothing to do

115
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,350
with the Lantern Festival Case.

116
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,920
May I have a look at the Blood Sword?

117
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,510
Are you sure you want to do so?

118
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,550
Okay, I'll show it to you.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,070
Guard, bring me the Blood Sword.

120
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,480
Those who practice using the Blood Sword

121
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,790
need to be very familiar
with the human bloodline.

122
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,230
Once the tip of the sword
pierces the blood veins,

123
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,790
a large amount of blood
will rush into the windpipe,

124
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,040
and that person will suffocate to death.

125
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,550
The Four Greats were all concerned
about the Lantern Festival Case.

126
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,280
Why didn't you say anything back then?

127
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,110
It's got nothing to do with me.
What should I say?

128
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,400
So when you knew I was
going to reopen the case,

129
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,040
you made up
the story about the evil wyvern

130
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,110
to mislead the county yamen.

131
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,960
I have nothing to do

132
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,910
with the lantern festival
or the evil wyvern.

133
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,110
You don't have to believe me,

134
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,880
but you have to believe this, right?

135
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,470
Your hands...

136
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,350
I stopped playing with swords
after my enemies cut off

137
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,590
the tendons of my hand over a decade ago.

138
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,200
After the Lantern Festival Case,

139
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,470
I also suspected that someone would
plant evidence on me.

140
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,670
I went to check on the body.

141
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,910
The wound was made by the right hand.

142
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,840
I saw that the wound on the body

143
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,760
was to the left of the Tiantu acupoint.

144
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,080
And the direction of stabbing
was from left to right.

145
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,670
That's why I guessed

146
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,280
the murderer was holding the sword
in his right hand.

147
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,440
Does anyone else in the Gu family
know how to use the Blood Sword?

148
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,910
My only son, Gu Shan, does.

149
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,030
Your son?

150
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,230
He died of illness five years ago.

151
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,000
Young Master Zhuo,
you knew about this, right?

152
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,840
I did hear about it.

153
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,470
All right.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,110
For the sake of Mr. Zhuo,

155
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,960
I've told you enough.

156
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,470
Sorry for being abrupt.

157
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,590
Mr. Gu, we'll take our leave now.

158
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,840
Stop there.

159
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,230
Young Master Zhuo, you may leave.

160
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,640
Mr. Pan, you have to stay.

161
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,960
According to the rules of Relief Hall,

162
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,440
we have to kill after receiving money.

163
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,520
You're the one who paid us to kill him.

164
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,350
I've changed my mind.
I want to keep him alive for now.

165
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,960
It's too late.
The Blood Sword will kill when it's out.

166
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,350
If you don't move aside,

167
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,960
I can't guarantee your safety.

168
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,400
Mr. Gu, you don't really think

169
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,440
Young Master Zhuo would break into
the Relief Hall

170
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,280
unprepared, do you?

171
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,280
If you don't stop,

172
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,080
I'm afraid the next thing you'll see

173
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,200
is Silver Rain Terrace
attacking Relief Hall.

174
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,790
Are you going to fall out with me

175
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,590
because of an outsider?

176
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,550
I think you've heard

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,280
that I am doing all this for a woman.

178
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,030
This woman is going to be

179
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,200
the young madam of Silver Rain Terrace.

180
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,470
Do you think she's an outsider
or an insider?

181
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,880
Nonsense.

182
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,760
If you have to kill him today,

183
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,590
I'll be the first to die.

184
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,960
I won't return the money. Leave now.

185
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,710
We will take our leave.

186
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,030
Young Master Zhuo, thanks for your help.

187
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,880
Did you find out anything?

188
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,030
It's a flawless story.

189
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,550
I'm sure it's all been prepared.

190
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,030
Gu Yong is the murderer.

191
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,550
Gu Yong is the murderer.

192
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,440
Gu Yong is the murderer.

193
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,840
Gu Yong is the murderer.

194
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,200
Gu Yong is the murderer.

195
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,590
Madam,

196
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,470
why are you running around again?

197
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,960
- Madam, time to take your medicine.
- Gu Yong is the murderer.

198
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,910
Gu Yong is the murderer.

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,080
Madam.

200
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,880
Let's go, Madam.

201
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,590
Gu Yong is the murderer!

202
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,910
What's wrong with Madam Gu?

203
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,640
Ever since the Young Master's death,

204
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,520
Madam Gu has been delirious,

205
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,200
talking nonsense all day long.

206
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,110
Young Master Zhuo, just ignore it.

207
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
This way, please.

208
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,200
Why hasn't Mr. Pan come back yet?

209
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,440
Could something have happened?

210
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,550
Young Master, you're finally back.

211
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,320
Why are you two together?

212
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,110
I didn't take the initiative
to come here today.

213
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,200
It's Mr. Pan who begged me to come here

214
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,590
to help analyze the case.

215
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,780
Yong Master Zhuo is keen
on investigating the case.

216
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,640
It's a waste

217
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,710
to not use the free labor.

218
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,200
All right.

219
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,520
Well, stop the riddles.

220
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,910
Say something we can understand.

221
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,740
[Court]

222
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,470
[Heyang Magistrate's Office]

223
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,350
In that case,

224
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,710
the Blood Sword fits most of the criteria
of the Lantern Festival Case.

225
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,230
What about the blue-violet wound?

226
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,200
It is not yet known.

227
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,710
But we have found out

228
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,030
that Gu Yong's right hand is disabled.

229
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,880
And the murderer killed
with his right hand.

230
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,000
So

231
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,590
Gu Yong's is cleared of suspicion.

232
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,760
I don't really understand.

233
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,670
Gu Yong could've kept his mouth shut.

234
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,350
Wasn't that a favor to you?

235
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,550
Do you think

236
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,000
he cares to do me a favor?

237
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,440
There's another possibility.

238
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,150
Gu Yong seems to be confessing

239
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,230
to divert attention

240
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,670
and hide the truth.

241
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,960
Do you remember when we left,

242
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,470
Gu Yong's wife yelled,

243
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,910
"Gu Yong is the murderer"?

244
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,150
Maybe his wife knows something.

245
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,320
This woman's out of her mind.

246
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,280
I'm afraid it's hard
to get anything out of her.

247
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,440
Mr. Pan, Young Lady, the dinner is ready.

248
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,590
Let's go. I'm hungry too.

249
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,880
And I'll have to warm up
a pot of hot wine for you, no?

250
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,200
You guys go ahead.

251
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll be right there after getting changed.

252
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,790
You have to get changed for dinner?

253
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,000
How pretentious.

254
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,710
Young Master, I can't believe

255
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,230
Miss Shangguan and Young Master Zhuo

256
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,520
are getting along so well.

257
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,520
Do you think Zhuo Lanjiang is sincere

258
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,670
with Shangguan Zhi?

259
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,030
I think so.

260
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
He's a Young Master,

261
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,110
but he always comes
to the magistrate's office

262
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,640
and helps us investigate the case.

263
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,760
If it's just for flirting,

264
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,280
then he's doing too much, right?

265
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,320
Zhuo Lanjiang may seem impetuous,

266
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,030
but he's been in charge of
the Silver Rain Terrace for years.

267
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,030
He can't be that reckless.

268
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,910
But there's something strange
about him offering a gift

269
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,280
after just two meetings.

270
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,440
What is strange?

271
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,520
If I could think of it,
it wouldn't be strange.

272
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,670
Young Master,

273
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,200
why are you so concerned

274
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,200
about Miss Shangguan?

275
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,110
Is it possible that you're really
what Ling said you were?

276
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,400
What did she say?

277
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,150
You like Miss Shangguan

278
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,670
as much as Young Master Zhuo does.

279
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

280
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,640
I'm the magistrate
and she works in the county yamen.

281
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,640
I'm concerned about
everyone in the county yamen.

282
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,030
That's true.

283
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,710
Anyway,

284
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,080
Miss Shangguan is close
to Young Master Zhuo.

285
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,760
If Miss Shangguan agrees to be his wife

286
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,790
and become the young madam of the gang,

287
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,470
Young Master Shangguan
won't be able to accept it.

288
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,030
The young madam of the gang?

289
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,230
We're just a couple

290
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,760
doing a small business.

291
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,440
Mr. Pan, why do you care?

292
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,000
As the saying goes, a local gangster
is above the law.

293
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,030
If you want to stay in Heyang,

294
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,960
you have to get permission
from the Silver Rain Terrace.

295
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,350
Mr. Pan is so stingy, huh?

296
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,920
I just spent 1,000 taels for him

297
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,040
and he treats me to these.

298
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,350
Why are you gawking?

299
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,280
I'd like to go to the Relief Hall

300
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,520
to meet that crazy woman.

301
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,230
Why do you want to meet her?

302
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,830
My master suffers from madness too.

303
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,760
After years of being with him,

304
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,880
I have experience
in dealing with such people.

305
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,470
I might be able to get some clues.

306
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,160
Gu Yong's house

307
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,070
is very heavily guarded.

308
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,520
As you know, we made a scene today

309
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,520
and alerted him.

310
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,160
It's not easy for us to get in.

311
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,110
You're struggling.

312
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,760
So you've got a plan?

313
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,880
I saw a back door on my way out

314
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,310
of the backyard.

315
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,830
If all goes well,

316
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,310
I can get you in.

317
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,350
Then, we'll distract the guards

318
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,040
and sneak into the inner courtyard.

319
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,470
Who's there?

320
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,000
Yes.

321
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,920
Oh, come on. Don't you
know lightness skills?

322
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,190
Why do you want to use the dog hole?

323
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,190
What are you talking about?

324
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,640
We're talking about how I can
sneak into the Relief Hall at night

325
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,310
to meet that crazy woman.

326
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,590
You?

327
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm a woman.

328
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,000
Maybe it'll be easier to ask her.

329
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,760
Mr. Pan.

330
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,920
You're not mad at me for acting on our own

331
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,760
with your subordinate, are you?

332
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,590
She's just working at the county yamen.

333
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,950
She didn't sell herself to me.

334
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,920
She's free to go where she wants

335
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,310
and do what she wants.

336
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,280
But I advise you

337
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,230
to keep Shangguan Zhi safe.

338
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,520
My buddy's got a bad temper.

339
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,310
That's for sure.

340
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,040
As you know, the key to the problem is

341
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,430
how to distract Gu Yong.

342
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,880
We have to come up with
a plan to slow him down.

343
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,560
Let me do it.

344
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,520
After all, as the head of the Four Greats,

345
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,040
I can slow him down.

346
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,040
Okay.

347
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,940
But if I go, who will take you in?

348
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah, how am I going to get in?

349
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,760
Don't count me in on your plan.

350
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,880
You can't just sit back
and let the opportunity

351
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,520
to investigate the Relief Hall
pass you by, can you?

352
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,040
I'm leaving her in your hands.

353
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,470
If a single hair on her head is missing,

354
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,640
you're dead meat.

355
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,200
To be precise, our safety

356
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,520
is in your hands.

357
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,560
We agreed on two hours, not a second less.

358
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,760
I have asked Xiaosheng out.

359
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,590
Let's meet at the usual place
when we're done.

360
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,040
Let's go.

361
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,560
You two have a great chemistry.

362
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,310
Young Master Zhuo is a straightforward man
with a passionate heart.

363
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,350
In the case of Gu Yong,

364
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,350
he helps us
despite the awkwardness of his position.

365
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,880
He's a righteous man indeed.

366
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,160
It's gone.

367
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,000
I remember you used
to have a dog, didn't you?

368
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,680
Why are you so afraid now?

369
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,230
I was bitten by a dog in Heyang.

370
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,800
Mr. Pan, you may enter
with your lightness skills.

371
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,560
I'll enter from here.

372
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,400
Let's meet inside.

373
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,830
You're really willing
to endure humiliation for a great cause.

374
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,640
You're quite like the sage.

375
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,640
I can yield for the sake of the case.

376
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,160
Look, different routes
lead to the same destination.

377
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,280
You should stay here.

378
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,190
And you need to be here.

379
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,310
Master, Young Master Zhuo
seeks an audience.

380
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,040
Ask him to leave.

381
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,070
I told him you weren't home,

382
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,280
but he wouldn't leave,

383
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,710
saying he wanted to talk to you

384
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,190
about a serious issue that affects

385
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,190
the survival of the Four Greats.

386
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,880
I'll put you here. Here.

387
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,470
Put that away for her.

388
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,590
Madam, please drink it.

389
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,880
This is the last of it.

390
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,800
I don't want it. It's poisonous.

391
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,350
It's the Master's order.

392
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,760
If you don't drink it,

393
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,470
I'll be buried in the back garden.

394
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,590
Please drink it.

395
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,310
It seems Madam Gu's madness

396
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,310
is caused by Gu Yong's drugs.

397
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,560
Come on, let's go in.

398
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,230
The delirious

399
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,470
are immersed in their own worlds.

400
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,830
The reaction will be more real. Let's see.

401
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,230
What's she kneading there?

402
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,110
She's cooking.

403
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,760
Cooking?

404
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,950
And I suppose she's cooking

405
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,560
for someone she really cares about.

406
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,920
Look at how satisfied she is.

407
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,110
Let's go.

408
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,110
Mr. Gu, you're too magnanimous

409
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,470
to close your door to me.

410
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,590
Young Master Zhuo, did you come
in the middle of the night

411
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,230
because you weren't satisfied with
the answers I gave you during the day

412
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,350
or because you didn't fight enough?

413
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,920
Let's not talk about
what happened during the day.

414
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,070
Because of my abruptness,

415
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,470
the elders of Silver Rain Terrace

416
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,760
advised me

417
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,070
that I should know

418
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,520
who our friends are and who our foes are.

419
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,400
The more I thought about it,
the more I felt bad about offending you.

420
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,230
So I had to come over to apologize to you.

421
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,470
No matter what, I'm a junior.

422
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,560
I can't let this

423
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,230
affect the relationship between
Relief Hall and Silver Rain Terrace.

424
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,110
Is this the serious issue
concerning the Four Greats

425
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,110
that you brought up?

426
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,400
Our families are among
the greatest in Heyang.

427
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,560
If we don't get along,

428
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,400
we're going to fall into disarray.

429
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,000
It's over,

430
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,430
let's not talk about it anymore.

431
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,160
Mr. Gu, you are truly magnanimous.

432
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,310
But as a junior,

433
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,230
I can't be disrespectful to my senior.

434
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,400
I came here at this hour

435
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,830
to offer my sincere apologies.

436
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,470
Fu,

437
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,680
I know that you're
very particular about everything.

438
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,190
This is my private collection
of Wenjun Wine.

439
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,430
I was thinking of drinking it
on my wedding day,

440
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,760
but I'll open it up today

441
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,950
as an apology to you, Mr. Gu.

442
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,070
That's not necessary.

443
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,680
Mr. Gu, I don't think
you should refuse to accept this toast.

444
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,400
Madam, why are you
in the back garden again?

445
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,340
- Madam.
- If Master finds out, he'll scold you.

446
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,280
- I don't want to go back.
- Madam.

447
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,880
Be careful.

448
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,190
- Walk slowly.
- Madam.

449
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,160
Madam, come on.

450
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,070
Slowly...

451
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,920
Let go of me. I don't want to go back.

452
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,400
It's just a garden, isn't it?

453
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,280
There's nothing special about it.

454
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,950
Shouldn't there be a door that opens?

455
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,560
That's how it's written in the books.

456
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,680
Here it is.

457
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,190
Let's go.

458
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,520
What is this place?

459
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,280
It looks like a dungeon.

460
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,710
Be careful.

461
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,110
Look at this.

462
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,470
These marks

463
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,110
are the same as the wounds of the victims
of the Lantern Festival Case.

464
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,310
What's wrong?

465
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,470
Are you okay?

466
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,830
I... I sprained my ankle.

467
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,160
Come on, give me the candle.

468
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,160
It can even break the chain.

469
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,040
Is it really an evil wyvern?

470
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,520
Boy.

471
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,680
For the sake of this glass of wine,

472
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,590
I'd like to remind you

473
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,160
that getting involved
with the county yamen

474
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,680
will lead to a lot of trouble
in the future.

475
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,640
You're right.

476
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,280
I came to drink with you today

477
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,280
to remind you

478
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,710
that if Relief Hall

479
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,280
is really involved
in the Lantern Festival Murder,

480
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,310
you must tell me.

481
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,710
If Pan Yue finds out the truth first,

482
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,190
it will be too late.

483
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Looks like you're still suspicious

484
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,110
of my involvement
in the Lantern Festival Case.

485
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,280
No, it's not a suspicion.

486
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,190
It's just you and me now.

487
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,470
I want to hear if you have
any unspeakable reasons.

488
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,000
No such things.

489
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I've made it clear during the day

490
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,680
that Relief Hall is
in the business of killing people.

491
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,230
We take money and kill people.

492
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,710
We do not need the evil wyvern as a cover.

493
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,230
Really?

494
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,350
Okay, since you've said so,

495
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,310
I'll trust you.

496
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,800
Since this has nothing
to do with the Relief Hall,

497
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,230
Then I'll investigate it
without any worries.

498
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,280
It's getting late.
I won't ask you to stay longer, then.

499
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,230
See the guest out.

500
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,800
Wait, there's one more thing.

501
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,560
I came here today
for a personal reason, too.

502
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,350
What's it?

503
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,800
It's about my father.

504
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,110
Whatever used to be locked up here

505
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,230
has escaped.

506
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,800
Give me the candle.

507
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,710
Look at this.

508
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,880
This looks like a palm print.

509
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,110
Looks like it's a human being,

510
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,800
not an evil wyvern.

511
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,110
He's in chains.

512
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,310
He's struggling madly,

513
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,160
scratching the ground with blood.

514
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,430
One day, he broke the chains and escaped.

515
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Yeah, that must be it.

516
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,350
Your mother hanged herself in shame
because she gave birth to

517
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,590
an illegitimate child like you.

518
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,470
Yes, you're an illegitimate child.

519
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,280
Leave! Go away!

520
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,520
- Illegitimate child.
- Yeah.

521
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
- You're an illegitimate child.
- Go away!

522
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,070
What's wrong with you?

523
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,310
Mr. Pan.

524
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,950
Mr. Pan, are you okay?

525
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,040
Mr. Pan!

526
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,280
Could he be...

527
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,830
Why is Pan Yue not here yet?

528
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,110
We promised to go to the Peach Forest
and fly kites together.

529
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,430
Let go of me.

530
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,880
Pan Yue, where are you going?

531
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,110
Don't go.

532
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,560
We're not done with this.

533
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,400
Pan, what are you so proud of?

534
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,000
You're just an illegitimate child.

535
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,350
Sima Liang, stop talking nonsense.

536
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,280
I'm not talking nonsense.

537
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,880
Well, from head to toe,

538
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,190
which part of him
do you think is like his father's?

539
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,680
Your mother hanged herself in shame
because she gave birth to

540
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,000
an illegitimate child like you.

541
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,350
Pan Yue.

542
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,920
I said, stop it!

543
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Pan Yue.

544
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,950
Let go of him, Pan Yue!

545
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,350
Let go of him, Pan Yue!

546
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,640
Pan Yue, let go of him!

547
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,710
He's dying.

548
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,800
Pan Yue.

549
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,400
Pan Yue, let go of him!

550
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,350
Do you have any idea how big
of a trouble you've caused me?

551
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,760
I wasn't wrong. He insulted my mother.

552
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,800
He deserves it.

553
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,950
You're so stubborn.

554
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,590
I'll ask again, were you wrong?

555
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,310
No!

556
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,110
Were you wrong?

557
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,280
No!

558
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,350
No!

559
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,560
I wasn't wrong!

560
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,150
Help me. Somebody.

561
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,470
Help me.

562
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,630
Pan Yue!

563
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,390
Pan Yue, it's me.

564
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,280
Pan Yue.

565
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,520
Pan Yue, wake up.

566
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,520
No...

567
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,040
No...

568
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,430
Pan Yue.

569
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,670
Pan Yue, it's me.

570
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,760
Get up first.

571
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,500
Pan Yue.

572
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,280
Pan Yue,

573
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,950
do you remember the nursery rhyme
you taught me?

574
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,000
You said you'd sing it
when you were scared

575
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,320
so you wouldn't be scared.

576
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,630
Teardrop Monster, Teardrop Monster.

577
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,950
He's afraid of wind, rain, and thunder.

578
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,120
Teardrop Monster, Teardrop Monster.

579
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,670
He's afraid of wind, rain, and thunder.

580
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,950
Teardrop Monster is terrified.

581
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,190
Sob, sob.

582
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,760
There are three big bowls of teardrops.

583
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,910
He knocked over a clothes rack at dawn

584
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,710
and dropped hats and coats

585
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,800
with his four heads and three legs.

586
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,710
Look at me.

587
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,150
Pan Yue, look at me.

588
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,840
It's all right.

589
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,910
Look at me.

590
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,230
It's all right.

591
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,840
Calm down.

592
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,840
Adjust your breathing.

593
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Take a deep breath.

594
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,520
Take a deep breath.

595
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,000
It's all right now.

596
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,190
