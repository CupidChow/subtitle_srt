You can call me whatever you like.

Yes, Jiang does sound better.

I came to Heyang from the capital
to take over Silver Rain Terrace.

That was the darkest moment

of my life.

35
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,670
In order to protect the sect
that my father had created,

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,440
I forced myself
to be a cold and ruthless leader.

37
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,240
I had no one to lament
about the death of my father.

Initially,

52
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,470
I thought I was already
used to such a life.

that I should help the weak

one's life and death.

But it was such a shame.

185
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,520
A kind person like him was killed
by the evil wyvern.

186
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,550
It makes me sad when I think about it.

187
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Is that all?

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes.

189
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,150
Mr. Pan, have you made up your mind
about who to pick?

190
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,640
You can stay.

191
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,550
So, Mr. Pan prefers girls like her, huh?

192
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,200
Why are you nodding?

193
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
And you.

194
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,200
What's with that reaction? Lie down.

195
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,000
This is Young Master Zhuo.

196
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,520
This is Miss Shangguan.

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,230
They will ask you questions.
You'd better answer them.

198
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,000
San, he's going to eat me alive!

199
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,080
Don't be scared. He's just teasing you.

200
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,670
You can have some dates.

201
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,320
Miss San,

202
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,520
we came here today to ask you

203
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
about your father's death.

204
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,400
We don't harbor any ill will.
Please don't hold it against us.

205
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,030
So,

206
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,470
Silver Rain Terrace locked us up

207
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,590
just so Miss Shangguan could
ask us some questions, huh?

208
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,320
Out with it.

209
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,640
My iced beverages will melt
if we stay here any longer.

210
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,400
Mr. Qiang was murdered

211
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,030
five years ago, right?

212
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,280
It occurred during the Lantern Festival
five years ago.

213
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,280
I've already read
the records in the dossier.

214
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,030
I want to ask you

215
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,280
if you can recall anything abnormal

216
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
about the case.

217
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,840
Or is it possible that he made
any enemies before his passing?

218
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,670
We retrieve and keep our ice
during winter.

219
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,790
And we sell them during summer.

220
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,350
We already had our hands full
trying to make a living.

221
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,640
We never made any enemies.

222
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,470
What about Mr. Qiang, then?

223
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,470
Was there anything abnormal about him
before his murder?

224
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,320
No.

225
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,030
The period
right before the Lantern Festival

226
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,550
was always our busiest period.

227
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,840
Back then, Shuang was only five years old.

228
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,400
We had to look after her
and work at the same time.

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,880
Everything was ordinary.

230
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,230
But I didn't expect
that incident to happen.

231
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,550
He left his ice cart

232
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,280
and his two daughters behind.

233
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,230
May I know where Mr. Qiang was buried?

234
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
I wish to take a look.

235
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,590
There's no body.

236
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,710
But why?

237
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,640
A few days after my father was buried,

238
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,350
some animal carcasses

239
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,910
appeared beside his grave.

240
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,230
The dead animals had the same wound
as my father's.

241
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,640
I reported this to the county yamen.

242
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,110
But they ignored me.

243
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,670
After that, people were murdered
in the following Lantern Festival.

244
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,110
All of their graves
were in the same situation.

245
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,670
Our fear increased gradually.

246
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,200
Rumors of the evil wyvern
were getting out of hand.

247
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,960
Therefore, the magistrate ordered his men

248
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,710
to dig out the bodies
of all of the victims

249
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,440
and dump them into the river
to appease the evil wyvern.

250
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,000
Sir, is this amount of strength okay?

251
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,960
What's your name?

252
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,550
Cui.

253
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,000
Cui, tell me, then.

254
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,910
What were you guys
trying to hide just now?

255
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,520
We didn't hide anything.

256
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,590
Mr. Pan, why do you say so?

257
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,760
Your tears were genuine.

258
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,840
You didn't want other people to see it.

259
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,880
Therefore, you wiped your tears away
in an exaggerated manner

260
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,230
to cover your pain.

261
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,960
If I'm not mistaken,

262
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,710
you had a special relationship

263
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,670
with Tian Hua.

264
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,790
You were very upset

265
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
about his death,

266
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,030
yet you dared not
let anyone know about it.

267
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,150
Am I right?

268
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,760
There's no one else here.

269
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,320
You can be honest with me.

270
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,000
Mr. Pan, Tian Hua and I

271
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,520
were on great terms before this.

272
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,760
Back then, he was the one who took me in

273
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,150
and provided me with shelter.

274
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,030
Therefore, I felt sad
when I thought about his passing.

275
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,520
However, he...

276
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,670
He wasn't as nice

277
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,470
as they said.

278
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,640
He had a short temper.
He was violent to the people around him.

279
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,840
The entire beauty parlor
was scared of him.

280
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,200
However, he was the young master.

281
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,840
We couldn't do anything about him.

282
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,440
Therefore, when he died,

283
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,960
everyone thought
that he got his just deserts.

284
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,520
And we were afraid that the investigation

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,320
might implicate us.

286
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,440
That's why we made that story up.

287
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,840
Mr. Pan.

288
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,590
Mr. Pan.

289
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,880
Don't you think my skin is glowing now?

290
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,840
Let's head to the crime scene.

291
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:41,960
All right.

292
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,710
Why would animal carcasses
with the same wounds

293
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,520
appear beside their graves?

294
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,000
This is getting more and more bizarre.

295
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,760
There must be something evil at work
behind these bizarre occurrences.

296
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,200
It's likely that someone is behind this.

297
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,520
Our investigation won't be
efficient enough if we keep this up.

298
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,590
Why don't I ask the other three
about the case?

299
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,110
I'll see if they know anything
about the case.

300
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,110
They wouldn't need
to hide themselves in Heyang

301
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,030
for over a decade
if that method was useful.

302
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,350
It'll alert the culprit
of our presence instead.

303
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,910
Over a decade?

304
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,760
The death of my parents

305
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,590
might be related to them too.

306
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,710
Don't worry.

307
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,550
I'll definitely locate the culprits

308
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
and uphold justice for you.

309
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,760
Come on. It's been so long
since we drank together.

310
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,590
I'll buy you a drink today.

311
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,470
I still need to report back for duty.

312
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,960
It won't take up too much of your time.
Come on.

313
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,550
Caiwei!

314
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,350
Who's there?

315
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,030
Xiaosheng?

316
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,080
Let go of me!

317
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,350
Miss Shangguan, save me!

318
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,760
This Little Liar said that I was a rogue.

319
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,670
And she was an ingrate too.

320
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,350
She said Yang Caiwei involved herself
with a bad company like me.

321
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,150
Miss Shangguan, tell me.

322
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,280
How should I deal with her?

323
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,710
You!

324
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
He's just scaring you.

325
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,000
Jiang and I already
acknowledged each other.

326
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,840
Xiaosheng, what are you doing here?

327
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,550
It's all because of this rogue.

328
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,030
He forced me to tell him about
our relationship in the Ghost Market.

329
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,790
I was afraid that you might be in trouble.

330
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,590
I wanted to tell you about it,

331
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,680
but I didn't have the chance.

332
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,880
I didn't expect him to be
the young master of Silver Rain Terrace.

333
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,070
I followed you here as I was worried
that you might be in trouble.

334
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,760
It must've been tough.

335
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,430
Jiang said he was buying me a drink.

336
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,560
Will you join us?

337
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,470
What are you staring at?

338
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,400
Caiwei invited me, you know?

339
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,070
Caiwei, let's go.

340
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,590
Let's go.

341
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,350
Mr. Pan,

342
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,280
this is the crime scene
of the first murder.

343
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
The other cases occurred along the river.

344
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,040
Over there too.

345
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,430
This is a remote area.

346
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,950
And there were no signs
of bodies being dragged here.

347
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,230
Why did the victims travel
to such a place on their own?

348
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,310
We thought it was bizarre too.

349
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,000
There was no way to explain the phenomenon

350
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,590
if it wasn't the work of an evil wyvern.

351
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,310
Look!

352
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,070
It's in the river!

353
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,460
It's a monster!

354
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,840
It jumped into the river!

355
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,640
The boat is going to sink!

356
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,950
Go and save them.
I'll go after the monster.

357
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,560
All right!

358
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,590
Help!

359
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,920
Help!

360
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,920
Someone!

361
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,640
He was pretty ruthless.

362
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,470
No wonder people say that
the young master of Silver Rain Terrace

363
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,160
started consuming blood
when he was one month old.

364
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,800
Caiwei, listen.

365
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,430
You must be wary of him,

366
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,470
no matter why he approached you.

367
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,040
I'm sure he's a bad egg.

368
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,590
He's not what you think.

369
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,470
All those rumors
are just baseless accusations.

370
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,520
That's not true.

371
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,590
I started doing business
in the Ghost Market a decade ago.

372
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,350
Although I don't make much,

373
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,280
I still need to "donate"
to Silver Rain Terrace every month.

374
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,230
One time, I didn't have enough
to pay them off.

375
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,400
They came and messed up my stall.

376
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,230
They destroyed all of my accessories.

377
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,430
Are you saying that he has no idea,
even though he's the young master?

378
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,680
I'll never believe that.

379
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,190
Anyway, back then, I swore

380
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,400
that if I ever saw him again,

381
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,520
I would...

382
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,830
What would you do?

383
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,520
What? Do you only dare
to badmouth people behind their backs?

384
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,190
I would do the same in front of you too.

385
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,640
I'm going to teach you
how to be a decent person

386
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,950
and teach you a lesson.

387
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,350
What was that just now?

388
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,560
Let's drink.

389
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's drink.

390
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,520
Mr. Pan,

391
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,400
this is the summary
of our investigation today.

392
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,310
Please take a look.

393
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,160
Someone is missing.

394
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,190
What...

395
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,000
Miss Shangguan isn't back yet.

396
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,880
She's not back yet?

397
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,920
Mr. Pan, should we look for her?

398
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,470
There's no need for that.

399
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,070
You guys are officers of the county yamen,

400
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,040
not housekeepers of the Shangguan family.

401
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,110
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,190
What does that mean?

403
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,760
I thought Mr. Pan had already reconciled

404
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,470
with Miss Shangguan.

405
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,560
Why are they doing this again?

406
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,350
Buddy,

407
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,190
I suppose you have no idea.

408
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,040
He's trying to distance himself from her.

409
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,520
Young Master Zhuo already confessed

410
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,760
to Miss Shangguan, after all.

411
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,280
Maybe

412
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
she's already been sent to...

413
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,310
Be careful.

414
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,040
Maybe she was sent to Silver Rain Terrace
to be the young master's wife.

415
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,540
[Court]

416
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,950
Where are the records
related to the corpses?

417
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,310
Shangguan...

418
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,880
Young Master, I'm sorry.

419
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,760
Zhuo Lanjiang's subordinates

420
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,880
cleared the streets when I reached
Silver Rain Terrace's territory.

421
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,560
Initially, I was keeping an eye on her
from afar.

422
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,070
However, Miss Shangguan
went to the riverbank

423
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,560
after dark.

424
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,000
After that, I lost her.

425
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,950
What?

426
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,590
I couldn't find her
after searching that area.

427
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,190
That's why I came back to report to you.

428
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,590
Mr. Pan, we're in trouble!

429
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,710
Mr. Pan, we found this
at the riverbank just now.

430
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,950
It must be the Wyvern Deity.

431
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,800
- The Wyvern Deity?
- The Wyvern Deity?

432
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,560
Send it to the morgue
for an immediate autopsy.

433
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,560
Hurry!

434
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,350
Yes, sir.

435
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,000
Chen San.

436
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,680
Chen San!

437
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,160
Go!

438
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,680
Just go.

439
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,640
Yes, Mr. Pan.

440
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,040
Constable Liu.

441
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,520
Yes, sir.

442
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,560
Gather the rest

443
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,190
and bring Shangguan Zhi back immediately.

444
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,680
Search the area near Silver Rain Street.

445
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,760
Ze, search the riverbank.

446
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,710
I'll search Silver Rain Terrace.

447
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,430
Let's split up.

448
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,880
Report to me immediately
if you receive any news.

449
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,590
Yes, sir.

450
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,040
Be careful.

451
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
What does this mean?

452
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,040
Are you guys welcoming me with a parade?

453
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,110
Mr. Pan, you mobilized
all your men for this, huh?

454
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,560
Were you afraid that I might abduct her?

455
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,520
Young Master, you should head back.
It's getting late.

456
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,590
All right. You should rest early too.

457
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,680
You guys can head back first.

458
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,430
Yes, sir.

459
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,640
Let's go. Stop looking.

460
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,430
Let's go.

461
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,190
Okay.

462
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
Did you drink?

463
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,560
Only a little.

464
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,950
I only drank a little.
It didn't affect the case progress.

465
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,400
Look.

466
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,000
Jiang made these for me.

467
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,230
These are the statements
of the victims' family members.

468
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,830
Young Lady!

469
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,470
Look.

470
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,310
Young Lady.

471
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,920
With Young Master Zhuo as your backer,

472
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,590
naturally, you can
go anywhere you like in Heyang.

473
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,040
Seems like I was worried for nothing.

474
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,640
What does he mean by that?

475
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,710
Did he wake up
on the wrong side of the bed?

476
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,800
Young Lady,

477
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,590
I heard from Ze

478
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,040
that after Mr. Pan found out

479
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,590
that you went out with Young Master Zhuo,

480
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,640
he sent him to protect you in secret

481
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,760
as he was worried
that you might be in danger.

482
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,160
However, Ze couldn't find you.

483
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,350
And they heard that a wyvern
had appeared at the riverbank

484
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,430
and killed someone.

485
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,710
Mr. Pan was so anxious,

486
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,560
so he gathered everyone
just to look for you.

487
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,590
He even prepared to storm
Silver Rain Terrace just to get you back.

488
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,190
Really?

489
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,760
Let's split up.

490
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,310
Report to me immediately
if you receive any news.

491
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,430
Mr. Pan, that was careless of you.

492
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,590
Your wound reopened again
just when it was about to heal.

493
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,230
I'll prepare more medicine
for you tomorrow.

494
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,950
That Shangguan Zhi,

495
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,110
nothing good happens when she is around.

496
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,430
It's not entirely Miss Shangguan's fault.

497
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,760
She did so for the investigation.

498
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,880
I thought you never liked her.

499
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,760
Since when did you start
to speak up for her?

500
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,280
You're right.

501
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,950
For some reason,

502
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,950
she didn't seem as detestable now.

503
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,760
She's even likable to a certain extent.

504
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,640
This is strange.

505
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,760
Can a person truly change this much

506
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,760
within such a short period?

507
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,280
[Bun Stall]

508
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
Have you guys heard about it?

509
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,760
The evil wyvern appeared
at the riverbank again yesterday.

510
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
Of course. I saw it myself.

511
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,520
The evil wyvern bit someone
with its huge jaws.

512
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,560
Its fangs were this long.

513
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,880
They were sharp and terrifying.

514
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,520
I heard that someone died yesterday.

515
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,070
Why did the monster strike again

516
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,280
before the Lantern Festival was held?

517
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,590
You guys have no idea.

518
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,040
The county yamen intends to reopen
the Lantern Festival Case.

519
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm sure the evil wyvern
was furious about that.

520
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,400
That's why it's striking us now.

521
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,590
What should we do, then?

522
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,000
Let's hurry and leave.

523
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,040
Look.

524
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,000
Jiang made these for me.

525
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,800
These are the statements
of the victims' family members.

526
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,400
Don't tell me it happened back then?

527
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,040
Mr. Pan,

528
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,880
is your old back wound acting up again?

529
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,350
You don't need to worry about me.

530
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,320
Mr. Pan, what are you writing?

531
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,680
Just tell me. I'll write for you.

532
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,640
There's no need for that.

533
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,560
Shangguan Zhi, you...

534
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,830
Writing on your behalf

535
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,280
is my duty as the registrar.

536
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,070
The statements of the victims' families
match the reporters' statements.

537
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,800
After that?

538
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,760
There were no signs

539
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,400
of a struggle or bodies being dragged
to the crime scene.

540
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,000
The victims traveled to a remote area
by themselves.

541
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,430
I suspect that it was the work
of the people they knew.

542
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,430
The county yamen already inquired

543
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,040
about the ties the victims had
before their passing,

544
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,190
especially their enemies or those who

I'm just doing it...

562
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,070

Mr. Pan,

579
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,950
I've done an autopsy
on the corpse we found yesterday.

580
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,110
How was it?

581
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,070
It has the same wound as the victims
of the Lantern Festival Case.

582
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,640
I'm sure it was the evil wyvern.

583
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,710
It has the same wound?

584
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,000
But I remember that the victim
from yesterday had a bloody wound

585
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,190
while the victims
of the Lantern Festival Case didn't.

586
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,230
Could it be

587
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,640
that the Wyvern Deity
sucked their blood dry

588
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,640
before anyone saw them?

589
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,920
But since someone was
watching over the body this time, it...

590
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,350
Enough.

591
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,040
Stop your deductions. Go now.

592
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,520
Yes, sir.

593
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,640
Mr. Pan!

594
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,680
Mr. Pan, we're begging you!

595
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,000
Mr. Pan, we won't be able to survive
if you keep this up!

596
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,400
We have to calm them down somehow.

597
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,070
Chen San is in a state of shock.

598
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,800
His autopsy result cannot be trusted.

599
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,000
Let's compare them one by one
according to the dossier.

600
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,350
The location of the wound is the same
as the one in the dossier.

601
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,470
However, if we take a closer look,

602
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,710
the difference is kind of obvious.

603
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,560
According to the dossier,
the victims had even wounds.

604
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,160
But this body has a bloody wound.

605
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
And the skin surrounding the wound
is brown.

606
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,430
But according to the dossier, it was
violet blue for the previous victims.

607
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,950
Did they make it look like
it was the evil wyvern's doing?

608
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,830
They did so to instill fear and panic

609
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,430
so that the county yamen
couldn't continue the investigation.

610
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,400
I was chasing after
the evil wyvern yesterday.

611
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,830
Seems like someone was trying
to cover things up

612
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,190
using such a method.

613
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,760
Don't you think this method

614
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,280
seems familiar?

615
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,800
Is it the same method
as the one they employed

616
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,430
to kill Cai Sheng's concubine?

617
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,070
That's right.

618
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,710
Seems like someone is getting impatient.

619
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,040
They're keeping an eye on us

620
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,040

626
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,590
Chen San, I can forgive them
if it's anyone else.

627
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,520
But you're our coroner.

628
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,350
Not only did you not inspect the body

629

to locate leads related to the culprit,

630
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,110
but you're also holding a ritual
in the county yamen?

631
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,160
Mr. Pan, it's not
that I don't want to investigate the case.

632
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,230
But the culprit is the Wyvern Deity.

633
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,350
How can I proceed with the investigation?

634
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,680
And, speaking of which,

635
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,350
I'm not doing this for my own sake.

636
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,680
I did this so that you and my colleagues

637
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,110
wouldn't be cursed by the heavens.

638
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,190

652
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,040
I was thinking

653
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,000
that it might be unwise for me
to resume the investigation

Although that's the case,

657
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,040
I already made a promise
to the people of Heyang.

Wouldn't that make me
an dishonourable man?

660

So, I'm caught in a dilemma

661
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,710
whether I should
resume the investigation or not.

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,760
as the victims
of the Lantern Festival Case,

725
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,000
there was a clear difference
between the modus operandi, timing,

726
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,230
and the wound

727
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,320
on the body.

728
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,230
I think someone did this on purpose
to disrupt our investigation.

729
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,670
Therefore, we should focus our attention

730
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,870
on the Lantern Festival Case.

731
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,910
The investigation
has been going on for a few days.

732
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,710
You guys can tell us about how you feel.

733
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,120
Constable Liu, you can go first.

734
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,600
Yes, sir.

735
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,120
The county yamen reinvestigated

736
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,670
the enemies and past grudges
that the victims had against other people.

737
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
After our serious
and thorough investigation,

738
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,150
we found out that the suspects

739
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,080
had no time to commit the crimes.

740
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,910
Those who had the time
to commit the crimes

741
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,230
were in no condition to do so.

742
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,040
Even if they had a motive
to kill a certain individual,

743
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,600
they didn't have motives
to kill all of them.

744
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,710
Judging from the culprit's motive,

745
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,000
I infer

746
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,710
that the suspect

747
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,560
is a lunatic.

748
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,150
Constable Liu,
you're not taking this seriously at all.

749
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,520
Even I feel sorry for Mr. Pan.

750
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Just shut up.

751
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,470
That's definitely a possibility.

752
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,760
However, to put it strictly,

753
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
the culprit might be someone
with a normal mental state

754
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,120
and a twisted mind.

755
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,080
He might be randomly killing

756
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,630
for some kind of thrill

757
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,430
or obsession.

758
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,470
Therefore, what we need to do now

759
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,710
is to find out the similarities
between the victims.

760
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,230
The similarities, huh?

761
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,710
So, Mr. Pan, what are the similarities?

762
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,150
I know now.

763
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,360
Their similarity
is that all of them are from Heyang.

764
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,670
Heyang was punished by Heaven
as they cut into a mountain just to fish.

765
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,280
That's why...

766
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,910
If the culprit has an obsession,

767
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,000
I think the Lantern Festival
is special to him

768
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,840
since he chose to murder
during that particular festival.

769
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,840
What if the festival

770
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,040
isn't the thing that's special to him?

771
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,360
Get me all the records of cases
that happened

772
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,390
during last year's summer solstice.

773
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,800
Last year?

774
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,150
All of them?

775
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,040
That's right.

776
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,950
If the summer solstice is something

777
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,230
that's special to him,

778
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,710
even if the Lantern Festival is canceled,

779
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,760
there are still many unreported cases.

780
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,320
After that, we can find the similarities.

781
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,630
For example, a quiet riverbank.

782
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,360
Or a wounded Tiantu acupoint.

783
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,280
By then, we can find out who got away.

784
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,760
I shall go immediately.

785
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,560
San, why do I feel like

786
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,040
Miss Shangguan is better at this

787
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,320
than most of us?

788
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,470
Enough already.

789
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,670
She's just a woman. She knows nothing.

790
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,230
She's just good at guessing

791
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,470
Mr. Pan's intention.

792
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,390
Ling, Mr. Pan said
we would be working overtime today.

793
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,630
He wants you to send food
to the second hall once they're ready.

794
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:50,280
All right.

795
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,390
And make a few more dishes.

796
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,320
But a lot of people
are having their meals here today.

797
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,760
Dinner time might be later than usual.

798
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,280
I'm free anyway. I can help you out.

799
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,760
Is the sun rising from the west today?

800
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,000
Do you even know how to cook?

801
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,430
Don't make things worse for me.

802
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,430
Don't worry.

803
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,120
I used to help my mother out

804
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,560
when she was cooking.

805
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,800
Why are you looking at me?

806
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,080
I wasn't.

807
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:23,840
Mr. Pan.

808
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,500
[Old Cases Archive of Heyang County]

809
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,520
Time for dinner.

810
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,670
Dinner is finally ready!
I'm starving! Hurry!

811
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,120
I can eat three bowls of rice

812
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,710
with the dishes that Miss Ling makes.

813
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,840
Miss Ling, you're so good at cooking.

814
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,360
Mr. Pan, what do you want?
I'll get them for you.

815
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,670
There's no need for that.
I'm not hungry.

816
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,430
You have to eat.

817
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,710
If not, you won't recover
from your injury.

818
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,390
Don't tell me you want me
to keep taking care of you?

819
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,390
What has that got to do with my injury...

820
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,230
Just eat up.

821
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,280
Come here.

822
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,670
Did you realize...

823
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,150
And this.

824
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,950
that Mr. Pan and Young Lady

825
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,870
were acting differently?

826
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,520
Really?

827
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,040
Look at you.

828
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,120
Can you pay more attention to Mr. Pan?

829
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,190
I did pay him a lot of attention.

830
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,870
We found nine murder cases in total.

831
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,080
However, the culprit wasn't
stated specifically in the death records.

832
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:06,120
So, we don't know
who the one that got away.

833
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,190
Mr. Pan, I know these cases.

834
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,800
The previous magistrate

835
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,430
said that we shouldn't cause trouble
for ourselves

836
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,390
when the Lantern Festival
was finally canceled.

837
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,870
That's why the details
weren't written down.

838
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,230
No one even checked them.

839
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,710
It'll take us at least a few months

840
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,190
to investigate them one by one.

841
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,120
