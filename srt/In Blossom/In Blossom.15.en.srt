00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,590
Fine.

184
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,470
I'll ask something that you know.

185
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,710
The people whom you killed,

186
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,350
their wounds were bluish-purple.

187
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,280
Your Blood Sword is made
entirely of Xuan metal,

188
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,910
so it wouldn't have left this scar.

189
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,320
What is

190
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,400
the secret behind this?

191
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,440
Why should I tell you?

192
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,030
Anyway, I am now in your hands.

193
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,590
You can do whatever you want with me.

194
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,960
He has hidden his identity
for so many years.

195
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,910
Why did he confess his real identity
without hesitation,

196
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,910
yet obscure the explanation
for all the other information?

197
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,350
Actually,

198
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,910
you don't have to be so wary of me.

199
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,000
I've been to the dungeon
where your father kept you.

200
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,590
I feel sympathy
for what you have gone through.

201
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,790
I'm also aware

202
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,320
that the reason why you killed people

203
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,400
is due to that particular experience.

204
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,280
Good that you knew.

205
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,470
However,

206
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,760
you still have a mother
who loves you dearly.

207
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,710
She was the one
who opened the stone door for you, right?

208
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,470
So what if that's true?

209
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,470
Young Master,

210
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
did Gu Yong really hire someone
to take the blame for his son?

211
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,710
It's not to take the blame,
it's to confuse us.

212
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,840
He wants to find Gu Shan before we do.

213
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,280
If that's true, wouldn't Gu Shan be...

214
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,030
Oh no.

215
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,640
Shangguan Zhi is in danger.

216
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,350
Lantern Festival. Riverside.

217
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,030
Alone in a secluded place.

218
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,150
Miss San!

219
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,080
Watch out!

220
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,280
It's you!

221
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,840
Are you Gu Shan?

222
00:14:59,470 --> 00:14:59,880
Yes.

223
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,670
It's me.

224
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,200
I bet you didn't expect it.

225
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,150
The son of Gu Yong
that you have been trying to track down

226
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,960
is actually his daughter.

227
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,550
Are you tired of living?

228
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,280
Let go of me!

229
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,880
Yes.

230
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
I can walk on my own.

231
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,550
I'm under the protection
of Young Master Zhuo.

232
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,640
I'll hit whoever I want.

233
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,000
Even if I kill someone,
what can you do to me?

234
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,710
A dog bone.

235
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,150
Whoever wants to grab it can do so.

236
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,960
I'm not interested at all.

237
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,350
What are you looking at?

238
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,440
If you keep looking,
I'll slap your faces.

239
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,590
The culprit that you caught
at the Lantern Festival

240
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,670
was a scapegoat hired by Gu Yong.

241
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,910
He sent this killer after you,

242
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,200
waiting patiently for you
to fall into the trap

243
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,760
so that he could find me
before Pan Yue does.

244
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,200
How interesting.

245
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,440
I was standing right in front of him,

246
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,320
but he couldn't even recognize me.

247
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,640
While the people whom I wanted to kill

248
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,440
could never escape from me.

249
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,400
Young Lady!

250
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,350
Young Lady!

251
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,350
Young Lady!

252
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,710
Is Shangguan Zhi not with you?

253
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,110
I thought she went to find you?

254
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,110
What happened?

255
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,680
Gu Yong tricked us.

256
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,400
The one we just arrested
was pretending to be Gu Shan.

257
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,190
Shangguan Zhi is in danger now.

258
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:21,920
Zhuo Lanjiang,

259
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,160
gather the men

260
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,470
and search in the direction
where you came from.

261
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,470
I'll lead the rest to search forward.

262
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,590
Alright.

263
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,190
Young Lady!

264
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,040
What do I do?

265
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,680
I must stall for time

266
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,350
in order to survive.

267
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,920
Gu Shan,

268
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,310
you thought you hid it well,

269
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,230
but we knew all along.

270
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,430
Impossible.

271
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,590
When you first arrived
at the county yamen,

272
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,430
pretending to be casual,

273
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,950
you were trying to gather information.

274
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,350
Since the murder cases,
the Lantern Festival has been suspended.

275
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,560
There are fewer people
walking around at night.

276
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,110
Our business has declined.

277
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,520
We really look forward

278
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,190
to you catching the murderer.

279
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,070
Miss, don't you worry.

280
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,590
Mr. Pan has been investigating the cases
day and night.

281
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,430
Even the cases from last year
are being looked into.

282
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,590
We brought back the Lantern Festival

283
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,160
just to make you show up.

284
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,310
Mr. Pan is nearby

285
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,830
and will be here very soon.

286
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,430
Miss Shangguan!

287
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,830
Young Lady!

288
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,430
- Shangguan Zhi!
- Miss Shangguan!

289
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,310
Caiwei!

290
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,830
Miss Shangguan!

291
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,470
Shangguan Zhi!

292
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,070
Young Lady!

293
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,110
- Shuang, have you seen Miss Shangguan?
- Young Lady!

294
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,000
Miss Shangguan was just here
having an iced dessert.

295
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,800
I don't know where she went.

296
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,800
When did that happen?

297
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,350
It was during the lighting ceremony.

298
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,700
[Ice Stall, Mr. Qiang, Wuyou]

299
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,230
The file says the wound is smooth,

300
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,830
yet the blood and flesh are indistinct
as shown here.

301
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,310
It is flesh-colored near the wound,

302
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,640
yet the file

303
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,000
says it's bluish-purple.

304
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Bluish-purple?

305
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,350
Ice?

306
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,040
Could it be...

307
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,110
Shuang, where is your sister now?

308
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,160
My sister said she had to leave early
to attend to some business.

309
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,520
She told me to guard the cart.

310
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
That's enough.

311
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,310
You're just stalling for time.

312
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,070
It's a futile attempt.

313
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,400
Did you know?

314
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,430
When I first met you
in Silver Rain Street,

315
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,280
I already wanted to kill you.

316
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,110
People like you

317
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,560
rely on the power that they wield

318
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,950
to trample others.

319
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,040
It wouldn't be a pity for you
to die ten thousand times.

320
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,920
Gu Shan,

321
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,350
what you're doing

322
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,920
is no different from your father's act.

323
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,470
What did you say?

324
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,590
I know what happened to you
in the dungeon,

325
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,880
but that's not a reason for you to kill.

326
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,830
Since you despise violence,

327
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,310
why are you resorting to the same thing,

328
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,590
which is to punish violence
through violence?

329
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,400
Shut up!

330
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,920
You are a self-righteous young lady

331
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,920
who has no idea what I've been through.

332
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,040
Indeed, I do not understand.

333
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,280
I believe it's not easy
for anyone to understand

334
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,310
what it feels like to be hated

335
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,190
by one's flesh and blood.

336
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,280
Gu Yong is very controlling.

337
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,590
Even when he kills someone,

338
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,070
he wants to use the Blood Sword,
a weapon of extreme precision,

339
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,560
because he enjoys the thrill
of controlling one's life

340
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,350
within a hair's breadth.

341
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,830
You are his only daughter.

342
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,950
There is no son to inherit

343
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,430
such a vast family fortune
as the Relief Hall.

344
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,640
He was unwilling to accept the reality.

345
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,110
He... He raised you as a son,

346
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,190
but you refused to submit.

347
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,950
So he tortured you
in such a cruel manner

348
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,800
to make you yield.

349
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,590
You are right.

350
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,110
He never regarded me as his close one,

351
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,310
nor did he see me as a person.

352
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,950
He forced me to dress up as a man,

353
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,430
manage the Relief Hall,

354
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,520
and inherit the mantle of the Gu family.

355
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,710
But I don't like it.

356
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,830
I like beautiful things.

357
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,880
I like the fragrance sachet
bought by the maid

358
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,920
and colorful lanterns.

359
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,160
I like beautiful clothes.

360
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,190
I was supposed to be like this.

361
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,040
How did that become
an unrealistic fantasy?

362
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,710
Although my life is mine,

363
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,350
I can't decide for myself.

364
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,520
Shan.

365
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,830
Stop hitting her. Stop!

366
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,400
Admit your mistake to your father.

367
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,680
Your father will forgive you.

368
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,470
I did nothing wrong.

369
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,230
Which law did I break? Which law?

370
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,560
I did nothing wrong!

371
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,280
Your disobedience towards your father
and the lack of filial piety is wrong.

372
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,830
How did you do nothing wrong?

373
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,920
Stop hitting her!

374
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,230
Take her away!

375
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,190
I am begging you, Shan!

376
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,590
Just admit your mistake to your father!

377
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,560
As you were born into the Gu family,

378
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,470
your life belongs to the Gu family!

379
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,520
I am the rule imposed on you!

380
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,470
I am the law imposed on you!

381
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,110
I am the law imposed on you!

382
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,160
What an unfilial child!

383
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,470
If you weren't worried
about your mother,

384
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,680
after escaping from the dungeon,

385
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,560
you wouldn't have risked your life
staying in Heyang.

386
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:15,920
Yet,

387
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,070
why did you choose
to stay with Mr. Qiang?

388
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,110
You knew what kind of a person he was.

389
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,800
A person? He was contemptible.

390
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,920
His life was not going well,

391
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,800
and he took it out on Shuang
when he came home.

392
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,400
When I first met her...

393
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,070
Cry? What is there to cry about?

394
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,880
- She had injuries in her face and body.
- Stand there and don't move!

395
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,760
I said, stay still!

396
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,880
How dare you move!

397
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,280
She was still crying,

398
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,070
yet she handed me
the only candy she had.

399
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,590
Although we are not related by blood,

400
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,800
she really treats me as her sister.

401
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,680
So I have to protect her.

402
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,520
Thus, while he was busy
with the Lantern Festival,

403
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,760
you drugged Mr. Qiang's water.

404
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,880
When he went to the river, you used
a Blood Sword made out of an icicle

405
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,160
and drove it
through his Tiantu acupoint.

406
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,000
Blood gushed into his throat,
he couldn't breathe.

407
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,230
That's why all the victims
died of suffocation.

408
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,430
The cold icicle caused frostbite,

409
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,830
so the area around the wound
was bluish-purple.

410
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,520
Whenever you killed someone,

411
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,070
you would do it somewhere secluded.

412
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,710
By the time the body was discovered,

413
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,350
the icicle would have melted.

414
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,280
That is why you
committed this crime repeatedly,

415
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,880
yet the county yamen
could not find the weapon used.

416
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,070
From then on,

417
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,560
during every summer solstice,

418
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,310
you would be reminded
of these painful memories

419
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,710
that made you fail

420
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,280
to resist the urge to murder people.

421
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,710
Therefore,

422
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,230
whenever you saw the weak and the small

423
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,470
being bullied,

424
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,950
you would lock your eyes on your targets

425
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,950
and kill every one of them
using the same method.

426
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,470
How rare this is.

427
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,880
It is rare to meet someone
who knows how they would die.

428
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,680
But there's one thing
I don't understand.

429
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,280
Since you hate your father so much,

430
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,470
why did you take away his Ripple Token

431
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,520
and keep it by your side?

432
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,160
As a dying person,

433
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,590
I don't think you need to
care about all this.

434
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,720
You might think that you are
performing acts of justice,

435
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,710
but you are no different
from your father.

436
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,680
You are just relying on
your martial arts skills,

437
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,520
and you're bullying me
because I have none.

438
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,000
You are imposing your rules upon me.

439
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,280
That makes you nothing
but a pitiful murderer.

440
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,070
Shut up!

441
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,710
I'm pitiful?

442
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,160
Does someone as arrogant,
overbearing, and selfish as you are

443
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,760
even have the right to accuse me?

444
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,190
I'm pitiful?

445
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,430
Fine.

446
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,710
Let us see

447
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,240
how pitiful you would look

448
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,710
when you are choked

449
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,590
on your blood

450
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,230
and on the brink of death.

451
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,710
Meet your demise.

452
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,680
Why is there a fire by the river?

453
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,160
So what?

454
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,040
Even if the whole Heyang is burnt down,

455
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,470
that's none of my business.

456
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,190
I'm leaving.

457
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,110
There is another game
of gambling tonight.

458
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,880
Qing Di, I'm not feeling well.

459
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,830
I'll take my leave now.

460
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
What are you laughing at, Miss Qing?

461
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,310
He left in haste.

462
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,680
I guess his plans didn't work out
as how he wanted them to be.

463
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,760
These men

464
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,800
thought everything
was within their control,

465
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,310
but they didn't know

466
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,310
arrogance could only make them go blind.

467
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,760
[Tower of Joy]

468
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,520
Mr. Gu.

469
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,070
What's going on out there?

470
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,400
The county yamen officers are looking for
Shangguan Zhi all over the streets.

471
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,400
The person that we planted

472
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,520
might have given himself away.

473
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,710
I never really expected this guy

474
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,070
to keep his mouth shut for long.

475
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,160
Seems like Ba made a mistake.

476
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,640
I underestimated that unfilial child.

477
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,560
What do we do next?

478
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,160
Keep an eye on Pan Yue.

479
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,470
And bring my wife.

480
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,160
Yes, Mr. Gu.

481
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,430
You're awake.

482
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,640
Jiang.

483
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,760
Caiwei, are you okay?

484
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,430
I am fine.

485
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,560
Young Lady!

486
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,470
Young Lady, I finally found you!

487
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,310
I was so scared.

488
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,710
I thought I would never see you again.

489
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,430
Fortunately,
Young Master Zhuo came in time.

490
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,950
You saved me?

491
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,310
You were just lucky.

492
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,070
Where is Mr. Pan?

493
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
He is watching over the criminal.

494
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,230
Young Lady,

495
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,230
does he not care for you?

496
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,310
Something major happened to you,

497
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,710
yet he isn't here
showing you any concern.

498
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,800
Was that a dream?

499
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,520
Stay still, and don't move!

500
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,160
Are you hurt?

501
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,470
It's a pity that I couldn't kill you
with my own hands.

502
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,590
Do you want to live a life

503
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,560
where you keep on killing people?

504
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,950
Gu Yong's desire for control

505
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,640
ruined your life before this.

506
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,110
You managed to escape from him,

507
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,070
but you are yet again trapped
in the extreme shackles of murder.

508
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,920
Isn't your behavior a form of obsession?

509
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,560
Take her back.

510
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,350
Yes, Mr. Pan.

511
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,230
I'm afraid that Gu Yong won't give up.

512
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,710
Let me join them
and escort Gu Shan together.

513
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,110
You can rest for a while
before heading back to the county yamen.

514
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,680
Fu, stay and protect her.

515
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,430
Yes, Young Master.

516
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,430
Four of you at the back, stay back.
The rest of you, come with me.

517
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,350
Mr. Gu, they arrested Gu Shan.

518
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,310
We shall proceed
according to the original plan.

519
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,830
We cannot let her leave alive.

520
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,430
Yes, Mr. Gu.

521
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,920
Isn't that Miss San
who sold iced desserts?

522
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,950
What did she do?

523
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,040
I heard

524
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,680
that she is the real culprit
behind the Lantern Festival Case.

525
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,800
They brought back the Lantern Festival
in order to catch her.

526
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,590
You caught my daughter,
so I am here to see her.

527
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
That is not illegal, right?

528
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,420
What?

529
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,760
No way.

530
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,000
How could she be Mr. Gu's daughter?

531
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,310
Didn't Mr. Gu have only a son

532
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,830
who died five years ago?

533
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,280
I bought iced desserts from her
last time.

534
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,760
When did he have a daughter?

535
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,430
- Well, this is unbelievable.
- I don't know.

536
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,160
She killed so many people. How scary.

537
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,070
Indeed.

538
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,160
Mr. Gu's son is actually...

539
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,920
How unexpected.

540
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,710
Yes.

541
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,590
To be worthy of carrying
the Gu family's bloodline,

542
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,230
I deserved to be locked up

543
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,640
in a pitch-dark dungeon

544
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,680
and beaten to a pulp every day.

545
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,880
To you,

546
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,590
if I can't be the way that you want,

547
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,760
I don't deserve
to exist in this world at all.

548
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,950
The Gu family doesn't have trash
like you.

549
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,760
I can, as a woman,

550
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,560
wander around this world.

551
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,040
I feel extremely at ease.

552
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,590
Living like this for one day

553
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,830
is better than living
for ten years before.

554
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,560
Mr. Gu,

555
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,710
you can't control me anymore.

556
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,800
Are both of you

557
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,470
protecting this murderer?

558
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,950
Gu Shan is a murderer,

559
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,920
so she will receive the punishment
that she deserves.

560
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,280
However, as a father,

561
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,070
you have never regarded her
as your own flesh and blood.

562
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,560
You confined her and tortured her.

563
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,470
Out of everyone here,

564
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,040
the one least qualified
to say anything about her

565
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,760
would be you.

566
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,710
If you don't get out of the way,
I will have to resort to force.

567
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,430
He didn't come here
to teach me a lesson.

568
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,280
He is afraid that I will reveal

569
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,470
the secret behind the token.

570
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,910
How dare you!

571
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,600
Mr. Pan,

572
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,040
I'll tell you now.

573
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,950
This arrogant Mr. Gu

574
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,670
has done many shady stuff
behind everyone's back.

575
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,120
Shan.

576
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,950
Shan.

577
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,430
Mother.

578
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,080
If you are not afraid of
implicating your mother,

579
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,230
then tell everyone.

580
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,520
Shan.

581
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,150
Let go of my mother!

582
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,840
What a bunch of beasts!
Let go of my mother!

583
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,600
Gu Yong,

584
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,560
I advise you not to act recklessly!

585
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,150
I gave her life,

586
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,800
so she will have to obey me
until the day she dies.

587
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,950
I won't do anything.

588
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,280
Shan.

589
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,800
Think about it.

590
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,000
I beg of you.

591
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,800
Consider this as you fulfilling
your filial duties

592
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,120
to your parents for one last time.

593
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:18,760
Well...

594
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,230
Do you insist on taking the Gu family
to the grave with you?

595
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,760
Mother.

596
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,190
Let my mother go.

597
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,710
You have my promise.

598
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,520
Gu Shan.

599
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,710
Shan,

600
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,600
don't end up like me,

601
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,320
who has always been controlled
by this man.

602
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,320
Living such a life is no different

603
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,710
from being dead.

604
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,560
Shut your mouth!

605
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,910
Shan, remember,

606
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,470
you will always be
my most precious child.

607
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,000
Always.

608
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,120
Mother!

609
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,280
Madam Gu!

610
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,320
Gu Shan!

611
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,080
Gu Shan!

612
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,230
Gu Shan! Gu Shan.

613
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,320
Gu Shan.

614
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,670
Don't die, Gu Shan.

615
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,430
Gu Shan.

616
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,420
[Four]

617
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,630
Gu Shan.

618
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,800
Shan!

619
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,040
Shuang...

620
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,430
Shan.

621
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,390
Shan.

622
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,080
Shan.

623
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,600
Shan.

624
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,080
I know.

625
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,320
Shan.

626
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,710
I will help you
take good care of Shuang.

627
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,630
Shan!

628
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,800
Shan.

629
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,520
Shan.

630
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,390
- Shuang.
- Shan!

631
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,320
Shuang.

632
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,000
Shan.

633
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,800
Shan, wake up! Shan!

634
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,870
What is the secret
behind the Ripple Token

635
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,630
that it was worth killing your child

636
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,560
to keep it?

637
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,360
Tell me!

638
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,630
Ze, take him back.

639
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,360
Yes, Mr. Pan! Come with me.

640
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,670
Stay still!

641
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,000
The Gold Water Sect's appearance
is not a coincidence.

642
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:34,630
Could it be

643
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,390
that they are in cahoots
with the Ripple Organization?

644
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,000
I'll go back
to the Silver Rain Terrace first.

645
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,520
Looks like Mr. Pan is a reliable man.

646
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,230
Since he could catch Gu Yong,

647
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,320
he is not far
from finding out the truth.

648
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,870
