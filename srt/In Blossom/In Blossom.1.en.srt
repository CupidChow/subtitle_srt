The silver plate turned black.
It means poison is found in the mouth.

191

But there are no traces of poisoning
in the stomach.

Lividity spread across the ends
of the upper and lower limbs,

199
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,080
indicating that the victim
didn't die from poisoning

200
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,550
but was hanged by the murderer.

00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,160
I might as well throw it away.

376
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,880
You!

377
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,110
You are right.

378
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,560
Since this is an abandoned jade pendant,

379
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
it's better to throw it away.

380
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,590
This is for the medicine.

381
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,830
Thank you for saving me.

382
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,070
I should leave now.

383
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,680
Mr. Pan, why is she leaving?

384
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,680
You are not asking her to stay?

385
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,460
It has been ten years.

386
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,680
Why did he suddenly come to me?

387
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,070
It was him...

388
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,320
Master.

389
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,750
Master.

390
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,430
It is confessing now.

391
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,070
Well.

392
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,160
Fess up.

393
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,590
Master, take a seat.

394
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,230
Let's stop here.

395
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,560
I will prepare the medicine for you.

396
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,110
Another lead has gone cold.

397
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,400
What should I do?

398
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,230
If I stay out of this case,

399
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,590
the boy and his family

400
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,230
would die unjustly.

401
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,880
Mr. Pan, Miss Yang went out.

402
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,070
Does she come to find the jade pendant?

403
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,430
No, she went to the Li Mansion.

404
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,310
They were poisoned.

405
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,520
What kind of poison

406
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,280
wouldn't kill

407
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,640
but force them to kill themselves?

408
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,830
So many people were poisoned
at the same time.

409
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,310
The greatest possibility is...

410
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,160
The food is clean.

411
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,830
You never changed.

412
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,760
You always like

413
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,800
to hide below something.

414
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,260
Sir.

415
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,400
It seems that you are suspicious.

416
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,520
Do you sneak in here

417
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,470
to destroy the evidence?

418
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,350
I...

419
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,880
Of course not.

420
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,950
I'm coming out.

421
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,110
I want to seek justice for the victims

422
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,800
and also prove my innocence.

423
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,800
That sounds reasonable.

424
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,070
But even if you find the truth,

425
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,110
that corrupt county magistrate
won't give you justice.

426
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,430
Whether it works or not,

427
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,830
it's not up to me.

428
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,280
But I get to decide
whether I do it or not.

429
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,310
Perhaps

430
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,400
a just magistrate will come
to Heyang one day

431
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,710
and procure justice

432
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,680
for all the wronged people.

433
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,190
Well. I will help you.

434
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:16,880
No.

435
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,310
Not so fast.

436
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,560
First of all,

437
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,920
as the official,

438
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,880
I'm responsible for serving the people.

439
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,350
Besides,

440
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,350
If I were to leave today,

441
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,160
do you think you could survive
to find the truth

442
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,400
when the magistrate framed you again?

443
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,590
I'm going to perform an autopsy later.

444
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,880
It's an unpleasant sight for you.

445
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,110
Autopsy?

446
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,760
Go ahead.

447
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,920
You block my way.

448
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,110
These bodies have been found
to be poisoned.

449
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,800
Now, I need to find
the source of the poison

450
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,950
to trace it back to the murderer.

451
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,710
I'm going to cut open his stomach now.

452
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,920
This is the beef residue in his stomach.

453
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,470
It wasn't served on the table.

454
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,830
I'm afraid this is the source.

455
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,310
Judging from its color and shape,

456
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,310
the victim was poisoned to death

457
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,430
in less than half an hour
after eating it.

458
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,710
Look at this, sir.

459
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,640
Sir.

460
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,800
Sir, are you all right?

461
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:57,920
I'm good.

462
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,760
Brilliant deduction.

463
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,520
Thank you, sir.

464
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,310
There are rumors in Heyang

465
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,070
about the haunting peddler drum
and evil spirits that hunt for lives.

466
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,000
But where does this drum sound

467
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,190
come from?

468
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,000
I don't know either.

469
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,520
There can't be any evil spirits
in this world.

470
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,310
Someone must be playing tricks.

471
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,760
But this person should
know invisibility skills

472
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,110
to play tricks in the air.

473
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,400
However, the drum sound

474
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,490
is much weaker

475
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,640
than the first time I came here.

476
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,070
Could it be that someone is trapped here

477
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,110
and now has exhausted?

478
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,670
I see.

479
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,360
Let's go.

480
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:22,950
Watch out!

481
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,760
Step back.

482
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,630
Be careful.

483
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,040
Sir, look out!

484
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,190
Let's go.

485
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,670
Come.

486
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,800
Hold me tightly if you want to survive.

487
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,190
We are safe now.

488
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,760
Do you know

489
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,470
who was hunting us down just now?

490
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,670
I found it from the assassin.

491
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,870
[Silver Rain Terrace]

492
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,710
Silver Rain Terrace?

493
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,630
The magistrate said that Mr. Sun
requested to re-examine this case.

494
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,080
Apparently,

495
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,630
someone among them doesn't want
this investigation to continue.

496
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,760
We get on Silver Rain Terrace's bad side.

497
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,230
We are in trouble now.

498
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,280
It's you, not me.

499
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,870
You still have time to pack your things

500
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,760
and leave tonight.

501
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,040
No.

502
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,280
I can't escape being accused of murder.

503
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,280
But it's Silver Rain Terrace
you are against.

504
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,280
You might lose your life

505
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,800
before finding the murderer.

506
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,150
Sir, you said

507
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,710
you are the official

508
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,950
and you should be responsible
to the people.

509
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,600
As Imperial Censor,

510
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,320
you wouldn't ignore an injustice, right?

511
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,950
This isn't the duty
of the imperial censor.

512
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,040
But I can keep you safe.

513
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,120
The thing is...

514
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,430
What is it?

515
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,280
I have one...

516
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,520
No, two conditions for you.

517
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,800
My life is at stake now.

518
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,470
Yet you are negotiating terms with me?

519
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,760
Fine. Call it off, then.

520
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,000
Wait.

521
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,360
Tell me your conditions.

522
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,080
I want you to get back

523
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,950
the jade pendant you threw away.

524
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,710
You...

525
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,150
Sir, I found...

526
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,350
It is getting late.

527
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,950
You can continue tomorrow.

528
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,710
That won't do.

529
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,430
I gave you my words.

530
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,600
So I must find it.

531
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,710
She is so stubborn.

532
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,760
Like she used to be when she was a kid.

533
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,600
I found it, Sir.

534
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,950
Look, I found the jade pendant.

535
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,770
You shouldn't have thrown it away
in the first place.

536
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,760
Let's start with the investigation.

537
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,030
Sir, what is your second condition?

538
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,800
I will tell you
after we catch the culprit.

539
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,410
Mr. Pan, Silver Rain Terrace
sets up a memorial at Li Mansion.

540
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,850
[Li Mansion]
All the big names are there.

541
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,490
The place is heavily guarded.

542
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,540
Take the busiest route

543
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,730
to Li Mansion.

544
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,430
All right.

545
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,000
Look, it's Mr. Pan from the capital.

546
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,360
Really? Is he Mr. Pan?

547
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,120
Isn't that the ugly woman?

548
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,320
How could she sit beside Mr. Pan?

549
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,470
Tell me about it.

550
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,630
I have told you

551
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,560
that you shouldn't sit with

552
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,630
someone like me.

553
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,710
What kind of person

554
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,000
are you?

555
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,710
Whether or not a person
is beautiful and respectable,

556
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,630
it is judged by their character,
not appearance.

557
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,520
Did you forget

558
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,120
what you said?

559
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,470
Whether or not a person
is beautiful and respectable,

560
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,190
it can't be judged solely
by their appearance.

561
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,800
