Thank you, Your Highness.

21
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,750
I loved the portrait

22
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,110
that you painted for me.

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,470
The palace artists

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,390
have drawn many portraits of me,

25
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,880
but they have never been able

26
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,550
to capture my spirit as well as you do.

27
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,440
I feel honored
that you like the portrait,

Your Highness.

29
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,750
I thought that Mr. Pan, the Minister
of Justice, only had one son.

30
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,390
And I didn't expect
he had a child like you.

However, I am engaged to someone else.

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,520
This was a tactical move

37
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,240
to force my father

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,750

of my wife-to-be.

According to what that madam has said,

Shen Yan was born with the ability
to control bugs.

184

So the reason why Chen Fu and the others
leaped off the cliff unconsciously

185
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
was that Shen Yan sent
some poisonous bugs their way.

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,230
If so,

187
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,880
Shen Yan's motive for the killing
and modus operandi have been made clear.

188
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
However, what does this have to do

189
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
with the Ripple Organization?

190
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,400
What is it about the Ghost Forest

191
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,640
that is laden with traps?

192
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,440
I guess

193
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,590
whoever caused the problem should be
the one to solve it.

194
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,030
Let's head back.

195
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,900
[Heyang Magistrate's Office]

196
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,790
Mr. Pan.

197
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,320
Miss Shangguan.

198
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,470
We meet again.

199
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,960
I think this would be

200
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,760
our first time meeting each other,

201
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,880
Shen Yan.

202
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,590
You don't seem surprised.

203
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
If there is a will,

204
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,230
it wouldn't be difficult
to find out who I am.

205
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,710
You are born with special abilities
to control bugs.

206
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,760
You blamed Chen Fu
for having refused to help

207
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,880
and caused Shen Ci's death,

208
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,640
so you took on his identity

209
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,880
and sought revenge with poisonous bugs.

210
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,790
Do you know why I like bugs?

211
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,760
Because they come in swarms

212
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,880
and will never abandon their companions.

213
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,150
Humans, on the other hand,

214
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,710
only think about themselves.

215
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,880
But

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,280
this is not the truth.

217
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,440
I know the reason why you are
investigating this case.

218
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,670
It's because of the Ripple Organization.

219
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,520
I can tell you everything

220
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,710
that I know.

221
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,280
But there is one condition.

222
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,760
What is it?

223
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,880
Get rid of Chen Fu.

224
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,670
Are you trying to instigate
an imperial court official

225
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,790
to kill someone for you?

226
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,400
He is useless to anyone now.

227
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,110
There is no point

228
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,470
in keeping him alive.

229
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,230
Besides, it is not difficult
to kill him.

230
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,080
Why not make full use of this situation?

231
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,320
Why did he say
that this is not the truth?

232
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,400
What clue are we missing here?

233
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,470
It's fine.

234
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,590
At least we have confirmed

235
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,280
that Chen Fu was poisoned by bugs.

236
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,590
As long as we figure out the antidote,

237
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,000
we shall then get the truth.

238
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,350
Indeed.

239
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,880
If Chen Fu could regain consciousness,

240
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
we might be able to get a breakthrough
in this case through him.

241
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,710
I'll head back
to check the treatises of techniques

242
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,760
and see if there is a solution.

243
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,830
You should eat even when you're busy.

244
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,710
You've been traveling long distances
these few days,

245
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,790
enduring tiring hardships along the way.

246
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,880
You're getting thinner.

247
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,400
I'll ask the cook to make
some of your favorite dishes

248
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,710
to make sure you are well nourished.

249
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,150
No...

250
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,710
I have to go.

251
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,590
Let me send you home.

252
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,640
Don't call my name...

253
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,320
If you have this time and energy,

254
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,710
focus on investigating the case.

255
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,550
Women

256
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,230
are enigmas.

257
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,470
I can't be nice to her,

258
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,230
and I can't be mean to her, either.

259
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,110
What do you think
is going through her mind?

260
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,710
I have a thought,

261
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,110
but I dare not say.

262
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,320
Is there anything that you wouldn't say?

263
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,200
Tell me.

264
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,710
Since Miss Shangguan entered
the county yamen,

265
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,150
I used to think

266
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,030
that she was uncertain
of her attitude towards you.

267
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,910
Yet, judging from her recent behavior,

268
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,150
I am afraid that she...

269
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,030
What is it?

270
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,670
She dislikes you.

271
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,470
Think about it, Young Master.

272
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,230
It is only when you dislike someone

273
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,350
that you feel annoyed
and want to avoid them.

274
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,150
You would find fault with them,

275
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,280
and you would run when you saw them.

276
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,590
You wouldn't want to be around them
any longer than you need to.

277
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,080
Am I right?

278
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,320
Are you right?

279
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,470
If you don't know what to say,
just keep quiet.

280
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,000
Leave. Go.

281
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,790
Just leave.

282
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,000
You were the one
who asked for my opinion.

283
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,110
Dislike me?

284
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,080
How is that possible?

285
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,670
She is married to me.

286
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,550
How could she dislike me?

287
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,280
Hold on.

288
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,550
The one present at the wedding
is Shangguan Zhi,

289
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,110
but it does not
reflect Yang Caiwei's intentions.

290
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,000
When she came back as Shangguan Zhi,

291
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,550
I was her first suspect
for murdering her.

292
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Now, she is such a close friend
of Bai Xiaosheng and Zhuo Lanjiang.

293
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,640
I guess she told them about the secret

294
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,790
of her identity,

295
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,760
yet she would tell me nothing.

296
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,200
The nicer I am towards her,

297
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,710
the more she dislikes it.

298
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,400
Could it be

299
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,110
that she really dislikes me?

300
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,230
Young Lady, why are you home?

301
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,150
I am afraid
that if I had stayed any longer,

302
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,030
I wouldn't be able to control myself.

303
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,880
But I am not myself,

304
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,550
so how could I indulge myself?

305
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,640
What are you talking about?

306
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,470
Are you doing a tongue twister,
Young Lady?

307
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,960
It's nothing.

308
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,350
My tongue is likely twisted.

309
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,960
By the way, Young Lady,

310
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,350
Young Master Zhuo had Fu
send you a message.

311
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,030
What did he say?

312
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,320
He said he would get to the bottom

313
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
of the Silver Rain Terrace case,

314
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,200
so please rest assured.

315
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,230
Young Master,

316
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,110
take a look at this.

317
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,430
What is this?

318
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,800
This is a jade toad.

319
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,230
It's a very precious medicinal herb.

320
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,880
It is said to be able to regenerate
flesh and skin.

321
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,040
Why would Mr. Sun keep this in his room?

322
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,560
This was stored well,

323
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,590
so it must be very important to him.

324
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,160
Miss Bai.

325
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,520
Our Young Master's asking you
to meet him by the river of Ghost Market

326
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,590
at the hour of Shen.

327
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,680
Your Young Master

328
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,190
wants to see me?

329
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,800
Yes.

330
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,680
Please be there on time.

331
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,920
I'll take my leave now.

332
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,800
We've seen each other a few days before.
Why is he asking to meet me?

333
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,160
And we are going to the riverside.

334
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,310
Could it be...

335
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,830
No way.

336
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,710
How much is this bracelet?

337
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,070
How much
are you selling this bracelet for?

338
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,760
I am in a good mood today,

339
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,160
so pay as you wish.

340
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,190
- What is wrong with this person?
- I have no idea.

341
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,400
She looks so happy.

342
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,400
Feel free to take a look.

343
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,400
This looks pretty nice, right?

344
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,920
Yes.

345
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,640
Miss,

346
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,420
I... I'm not selling anymore.
I am closing up.

347
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,520
Later tonight, I...

348
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,350
We are not done looking.

349
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,880
What is up with you?

350
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,190
I am going to meet someone.

351
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,230
Would you please come another day?

352
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,590
Please come another day.

353
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,160
What is up with her?

354
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,760
Have you told Miss Bai?

355
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,680
Got the time and place all correct?

356
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,880
Yes.

357
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,400
Could it be that we didn't come on time

358
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,710
and she left?

359
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,500
♪Who hummed a tune of the azure sky?♪

360
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,860
♪Who carved the green out of duckweed?♪

361
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,140
♪Whose heart got filled with memories♪

♪Clouds painted by flying geese♪

364
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,950
Little Liar.

365
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,400
What's up?

366
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,680
It has only been days,

367
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,830
but you don't know me anymore?

368
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,070
It's not the Lantern Festival today,

369
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,680
but why are you dressed like a lantern?

370
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,400
What is your business?
Why did you ask me to see you here?

371
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,040
Oh, right. I do have a favor to ask.

372
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,710
I knew you wouldn't look for me
if there wasn't anything.

373
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,310
Take a look at this.

374
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,110
A jade toad?

375
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,590
I knew you had an eye for this.

376
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,350
This jade toad is only sold
in the Ghost Market.

377
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,430
Help me look out for the people

378
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,560
who would buy this jade toad

379
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,800
at the Ghost Market.

380
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,590
Did anything happen?

381
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,590
Why are you looking into this?

382
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,400
You don't have to care about this.

383
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,430
Just do as I said.

384
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,190
You will get some benefits out of this.

385
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,640
Why?

386
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,680
So this is your impression of me,

387
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,710
that I am just someone
who values money over people, right?

388
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,400
Am I wrong about that?

389
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,040
Yes, you are!

390
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,640
Alright, I am just messing with you.

391
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,880
I know that money is not
the only thing that you think about.

392
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,280
You think about me too.

393
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,680
Well,

394
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,040
I'll leave the jade toad in your hands.

395
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,880
Thank you for all the trouble.

396
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,190
That's nothing.

397
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,640
The Huanming Bug originated
in Southern Tibet.

398
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,470
Originally born out of ordinary maggots,

399
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,760
it was then bred by
Southern Tibetan witches.

400
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,160
After biting humans,

401
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,590
it will live in one's bloodstream
by entering through the wounds.

402
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,760
Once it's become parasitic,

403
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,110
the human will lose consciousness
and their eyesight.

404
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,000
On top of that,
this bug is drawn to light.

405
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,590
The host would be drawn
to light as well.

406
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,400
They are attracted to brightness.

407
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,110
This is it.

408
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,900
The Huanming Bug will melt

409
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,190
when it comes in contact
with Snow Lily Water.

410
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,070
I am not entirely sure,

411
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,160
but I think we can give it a try.

412
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,310
Be careful.

413
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,040
I guess Ze was right,

414
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,040
she does dislike me.

415
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,880
That was close.

416
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,350
I almost held onto him.

417
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,920
Administer silver needles on
Yushang, Yuyao,

418
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,920
Jianming, Sizhu,

419
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,400
Sibai, Qingming, these six acupoints.

420
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,760
After that, drip in warm
Snow Lily Water,

421
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,470
to get rid of the poisonous bugs.

422
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,040
There is only one chance
to treat this right.

423
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,680
Otherwise, he will never be cured.

424
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,400
Hold him down.

425
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,470
- Chen Fu.
- Fu.

426
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,230
Don't let him touch his eyes.

427
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,040
Fu. Fu.

428
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,920
You have to endure it through, Fu.

429
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,680
Fu.

430
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,070
Watch him tight.

431
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,230
I will administer another needle
in an hour,

432
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,190
then he will regain consciousness.

433
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,310
Alright. Thank you, Miss Shangguan.

434
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,070
We need to wait for another hour.

435
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,040
I'll take a walk in the courtyard.

436
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,160
Do you really dislike being around me?

437
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,110
Fine.

438
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,280
If you really think

439
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,310
that it is torturous to stay by my side,

440
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,190
after the investigation is over,

441
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
I should respect your wishes

442
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,430
and let you go.

443
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,800
Is it just me?

444
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,950
Why do I feel

445
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,310
that they are looking at me strangely?

446
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,000
Is anyone out there?

447
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
Help!

448
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,350
Is anyone out there?

449
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,880
Open the door for me!

450
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,800
Who ambushed me?

451
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,400
They will get it once I catch them.

452
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,640
Medicinal oil?

453
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,590
I guess this person
only wants to trap me.

454
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,400
They don't want to hurt me.

455
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,280
Stomach... Stomachache.

456
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,350
Is... Is anyone out there?

457
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,880
I have a severe stomachache!

458
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,280
Oh no, I am dying of pain!

459
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,430
Oh no, oh no!

460
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,830
My stomach is in so much pain!

461
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,560
Is anyone out there?

462
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,310
Miss Shangguan?

463
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,680
Miss Shangguan?

464
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,110
You!

465
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,680
I...

466
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,000
Why did you lock me up in here?

467
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,280
I... I...

468
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,160
You are all worried
that I will wake Chen Fu up.

469
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,280
Are you the accomplice of Shen Yan?

470
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,230
No... We are not... Not at all...

471
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,110
You are not telling me?

472
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,000
Come and see Mr. Chen with me.

473
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
No, no, no.
Miss Shangguan, Miss Shangguan.

474
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:13,830
I'll tell you.

475
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,280
I'll tell you.

476
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,070
Miss Shangguan,

477
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,430
you will understand everything

478
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,350
once you read this.

479
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,020
[Fifteenth day of the third month.
Dog dared talk back.]

480
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,320
[I put a red-hot piece of coal
into his mouth.]

481
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,460
[Third day of the ninth month.
Sheep dared report on me in secret.]

482
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,460
[I beat him with a thorny stick
all the way]

483
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,450
[to the Ghost Forest.]

484
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,660
[We met a ghost in the forest
who took Sheep away.]

485
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,800
The third day of the ninth month?

486
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
Isn't it the day
when Shen Ci went to the woods?

487
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,830
So Pig,

488
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,110
Dog,

489
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,590
Cow, and Sheep are...

490
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,680
You're right.

491
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,110
They are us,

492
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,430
the poor and powerless students.

493
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,950
Chen Fu, Zhou Ge, and Liu Shi

494
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,160
are the bullies of the academy.

495
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,190
Whoever they dislike

496
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,640
will be hit or scolded.

497
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,560
They even treat us like animals for fun.

498
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,400
Chen Fu,

499
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,880
he recorded all of it in this booklet.

500
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,470
He had all of us read it

501
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,590
as an attempt to intimidate us.

502
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,110
You are quite tough, aren't you?

503
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,160
You had the guts to talk back
to my father.

504
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,680
So stubborn, aren't you?

505
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,760
Pee lying on your stomach, then.

506
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,430
Come, remove his trousers.

507
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,560
What are you looking at?

508
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,190
Do you want to pee
lying on your stomach?

509
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,310
Get lost!

510
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,230
How preposterous!

511
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,160
Why did you not complain about him?

512
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,470
There's no use for that.

513
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,230
Mr. Chen is protective of his son.

514
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,710
He threatened us to not spread it out.

515
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,350
We all came from humble backgrounds.

516
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,800
We studied so hard for ten years,

517
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,430
and everyone wants
to be rich and famous.

518
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,280
If we go against the headmaster,

519
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,470
we will lose the chance
for recommendations.

520
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,830
Our future will go down the drain.

521
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,920
Which is why everyone...

522
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,710
No one dared say anything.

523
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,280
Everyone wanted to just grind through,

524
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,000
with hopes that once they leave,

525
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,880
everything will become better.

526
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,830
Right now,

527
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,310
if you save Chen Fu,

528
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,230
I'm afraid

529
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,760
we will be at their beck and call again.

530
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,920
That is why we did this.

531
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,310
Miss Shangguan,

532
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,110
I beg of you.

533
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,520
Please do not tell anyone

534
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,070
that I told you this.

535
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,680
Do you know the reason why I like bugs?

536
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,190
Because they come in swarms

537
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,040
and will never abandon their companions.

538
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,110
Humans, on the other hand,
only think about themselves.

539
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,590
One hour is up.

540
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,470
Where did Miss Shangguan go?

541
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,430
What took you so long?

542
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,470
I couldn't find my way back.

543
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,590
Miss Shangguan,

544
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,800
please treat him now.

545
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,800
Miss Shangguan,

546
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,070
why are you not treating him?

547
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,230
Is anything wrong?

548
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Father.

549
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,640
Fu!

550
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,680
Fu!

551
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,000
You are finally awake!

552
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,350
Tell me,

553
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,060
was it Shen Ci who hurt you?

554
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,710
It has to be him.

555
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,760
He made those bugs bite me.

556
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,310
Not long after, I started going blind.

557
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,830
Fu,

558
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,040
you have suffered too much.

559
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,430
Mr. Pan,

560
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,230
please seek justice for my son!

561
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,430
No wonder you reacted so strangely.

562
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,920
The thought of that person
saying the word justice

563
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,350
makes me sick.

564
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,640
All our efforts were put into

565
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,920
saving such a devil.

566
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,470
Those who were oppressed
couldn't voice their grievances.

567
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,230
I almost considered

568
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,040
taking up Shen Yan's deal.

569
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,110
That way, I would have the chance to

570
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,520
just stab him
with a needle and kill him.

571
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,470
Of course, I only thought about it.

572
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,070
Now that Chen Fu is awake,

573
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,680
Mr. Chen will never
let Shen Yan off easily.

574
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,070
Are we going to let the evil
triumph now?

575
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,590
What are you all looking at?

576
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,680
Didn't you know?

577
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,400
There is an open hearing by Mr. Pan.

578
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,590
The Ghostly Fire Case.

579
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,800
Everyone wants to take a look.

580
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,070
- He knows witchcraft.
- Does he really know that?

581
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,710
It's true.

582
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,160
- Let's go and watch.
- Come.

583
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,940
Right? How could that be?

584
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,310
Here he comes.

585
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,920
He is the one who got hurt.

586
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,560
That's him?

587
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,620
Mr. Pan.

588
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,710
Bring the criminal in.

589
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,800
He is the academy's student.

590
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,560
He looks pretty handsome.

591
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,470
How unexpected.

592
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,280
That's him?

593
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,380
Here he is.

594
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,710
What would you know?

595
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,910
The devil wouldn't appear
in its original form.

596
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,600
Don't look at his eyes.

597
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,040
Otherwise, you will lose your soul.

598
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,950
How scary!

599
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,570
Don't get excited by the commotion.
Keep a distance.

600
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,440
Well...

601
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,390
Miss Shangguan,

602
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,800
why are you here?

603
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,150
It is Shen Ci's hearing today.

604
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,630
Are you not attending it?

605
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,520
Well...

606
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,710
It's got nothing to do with us.

607
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,230
Shen Ci resisted the person
who abused him,

608
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,560
yet he is sentenced to be beheaded.

609
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,630
This is truly unfair.

610
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,760
Moreover, all of you are victims too.

611
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,430
Your silence

612
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,870
is an accomplice to murder.

613
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,710
Miss Shangguan,

614
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,600
you were the one who saved that devil,

615
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,000
and you are now asking us
to give up our future to be a witness,

616
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,710
is that fair to us, then?

617
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,470
Our studies are more important.
We should stay out of it.

618
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,120
Let's go.

619
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,320
The wise understand

620
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,190
the boundary between life and death;

621
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,040
their interests are not swayed
by the prospect of survival or demise.

622
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,800
Noble-hearted individuals

623
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,470
seek not their own survival
at the expense of righteousness;

624
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,360
some even sacrifice themselves
to achieve righteousness.

625
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,320
Continue reading.

626
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,190
While commoners

627
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,360
readily agree to compromises,

628
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,230
they proclaim righteousness
as long as they can,

629
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,710
they face death
without longing for the world,

630
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,430
they truly comprehend
the boundary between life and death.

631
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,710
[Court]

632
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,040
This was

633
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,190
what happened.

634
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,870
Please punish the murderer, Your Honor,

635
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,670
so that my two best friends
can rest in peace.

636
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,280
Listen, the defendant.

637
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,280
You used bugs to harm others,

638
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,800
you caused two deaths and one injured,

639
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,430
the evidence is solid
and there is no mercy for your crime.

640
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,470
Do you have anything to say about it?

641
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,760
Nothing.

642
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,670
I have something to say.

643
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,950
Who is this?

644
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,710
Shangguan Zhi.

645
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,390
Why is she here?

646
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,600
Mr. Pan.

647
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,840
Shangguan Zhi,

648
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,360
do you have any objections?

649
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,520
No, sir.

650
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,320
It is all very well reasoned.
The judgments are clear and right.

651
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,000
What I wanted to say was

652
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,230
there is a murderer
who got away in this courtroom.

653
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,080
And that is Young Master Chen Fu.

654
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,670
- What?
- She said Chen Fu.

655
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,080
Really?

656
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,760
What nonsense.

657
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,520
Who did I kill?

658
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,320
You, Zhou Ge, and Liu Shi

659
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,870
attempted to kill Shen Ci.

660
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,000
Shangguan Zhi,

661
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,910
this is the courtroom.

662
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,080
If you do not have proof,

663
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,600
do not simply make accusations.

664
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,150
Sir, I do have proof.

665
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,390
I bet Young Master Chen

666
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,230
knows about this booklet.

667
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,800
You wrote all this yourself.

668
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,150
You recorded all your acts of bullying

669
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,000
when you were at Xinzheng Academy.

670
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,190
"The third day of the ninth month.

671
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,840
Sheep dared

672
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,040
to report on me in secret.

673
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,760
I beat him with a thorny stick
all the way

674
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,360
to the Ghost Forest.

675
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,430
We met a ghost in the forest

676
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,430
who took Sheep away."

677
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,630
The third day of the ninth month

678
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,520
was the day Shen Ci was murdered.

679
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,710
This means

680
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,390
that they were not having
a courage competition.

681
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,950
It was Chen Fu and his gang
who took Shen Ci away.

682
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,390
So?

683
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,950
Come on.

684
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,630
Come on now.

685
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,320
Is this fun?

686
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,910
This forest is so spooky.

687
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,710
We should play somewhere else.

688
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:58,950
I...

689
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,280
I am not afraid.

690
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,390
I have never seen a ghost,
and I wonder what it looks like.

691
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,800
He's up.

692
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,320
Get down now.

693
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,390
You better shut your mouth
when we get back.

694
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:41,840
Alright.

695
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,190
Alright.

696
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,320
Come, let's leave.

697
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,190
Young Master Chen,

698
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,390
I don't think I got anything wrong.

699
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,280
You wouldn't be unable to

700
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,280
recognize your handwriting, would you?

701
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,080
It is just a booklet,

702
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,120
how could that be the proof of murder?

703
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,630
Fu has been very imaginative
since young.

704
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,710
He was merely writing down sentences.

705
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,470
This shouldn't be taken seriously.

706
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,080
Exactly.

707
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,360
I was just making up stories.

708
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,230
This never happened.

709
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,000
Miss Shangguan,

710
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,360
you saved Fu's life,

711
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,600
and I am grateful for that.

712
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,800
However, if you keep doing this,

713
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,320
I can report you for false accusations.

714
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,520
Mr. Chen,

715
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,120
don't get worked up.

716
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,800
I have witnesses too.

717
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,000
Let them in.

718
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,600
They are all here.

719
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,800
How dare all of you join hands
and slander me.

720
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,040
Do you know the consequences of this?

721
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,560
The wise understand
the boundary between life and death;

722
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,120
their interests are not swayed
by the prospect of survival or demise.

723
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,430
I, Yang Wanming, a student
of Xinzheng Academy,

724
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,910
am willing to stake
my reputation and future

725
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,390
to be the witness for Shen Ci.

726
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,520
Chen Fu has always been a bully,

727
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,150
and Mr. Chen failed to educate him.

728
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,190
That was how this tragedy happened.

729
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,840
Please make a fair judgment, sir.

730
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,190
You...

731
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,000
Wang Bin from Xinzheng Academy
will testify as well.

732
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,470
Niu Qiang from Xinzheng Academy
will testify as well.

733
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,190
Ying Zheng from Xinzheng Academy
will testify as well.

734
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,390
We are willing to testify as a witness.

735
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,670
You... You lowly peasants.

736
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,430
Chen Fu, now that the witness
and evidence are both present,

737
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,870
what do you want to say about this?

738
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,280
Yes.

739
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,710
I did hit Shen Ci,

740
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,040
and I forced him
to venture into the Ghost Forest.

741
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,190
So what?

742
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,280
Fu.

743
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,800
What are you scared of, Father?

744
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,910
You are the headmaster.

745
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,560
Our family owns the academy.

746
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,800
I was only having some fun.

747
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,560
Isn't Shen Ci well and alright now?

748
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,600
I'll compensate him
for some medical expenses, that's all.

749
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,280
Can you convict me of a crime?

750
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:27,600
I can.

751
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,390
Coroner Chen,

752
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,280
bring the body here.

753
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,470
Now that Chen Fu regained consciousness,

754
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,040
Mr. Chen will not
let Shen Yan off easily.

755
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,230
Are we going to let the evil
triumph now?

756
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,150
Right now, apart from those working
with the county yamen,

757
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,080
no one else knows

758
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,760
the body from the hills is Shen Ci's.

759
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,280
No one else knows

760
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,000
the one locked up in jail is Shen Yan.

761
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,520
What you mean is...

762
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,470
We will let Shen Yan

763
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,320
carry on with this act
of identity switch till the end.

764
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:11,950
Coroner Chen.

765
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,870
Read the coroner's report.

766
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:14,670
Yes, Your Honor.

767
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,870
The body was found below the cliff
of the hill behind Xinzheng Academy.

768
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,520
The deceased is male,

769
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,470
nineteen years old.

770
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,390
Time of death, one year ago.

771
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:25,760
Cause of death, suffocation.

772
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,910
He is identified as
Xinzheng Academy's student, Shen Ci.

773
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,800
Shen Ci?

774
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,450
What are you saying?

775
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,870
He... He is Shen Ci?

776
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,000
Who is he, then?

777
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,760
- Exactly!
- Right, who is he, then?

778
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,630
Well, who is he?

779
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,840
You should tell them yourself.

780
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,120
I am Shen Yan.

781
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,560
Shen Ci's twin brother.

782
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,390
Impossible.

783
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:55,670
No way.

784
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,710
I have been around with bugs
since I was born.

785
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,000
Even my parents stayed away from me.

786
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,760
My brother

787
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,150
was my only source of human warmth.

788
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,840
It's our birthday today.

789
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,710
These are the longevity noodles
that Mother made.

790
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,560
Quick, eat while it's still hot.

791
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,710
Mother would never cook
longevity noodles for me.

792
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:34,950
This is yours, right?

793
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,080
What would you eat

794
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,430
if I ate your share?

795
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,600
We both came from the same mother,

796
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:42,470
so what is wrong with sharing
a bowl of noodles?

797
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:43,760
No matter how others see you,

798
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,320
I am always proud

799
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,390
to have you as my younger brother.

800
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:50,910
Thank you, Ci.

801
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,600
Up till the day I caused
a catastrophic disaster.

802
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,710
He left to study far away in Heyang.

803
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,670
I followed him in secret

804
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,430
and hid in the hills behind the academy.

805
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,670
Never have I ever thought

806
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,150
that someone as kind as my brother,

807
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,600
someone who would never hurt a bug,

808
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,910
would be abused to death

809
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,670
by these bunch of evil-doers.

810
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,230
You better shut your mouth
when we get back.

811
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,670
Come, let's leave.

813
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,800
Ci!

814
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,840
I buried my brother's body in secret

815
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,080
and returned to the academy as him.

816
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:15,670
Because I was blind,

817
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,910
no one could tell us apart.

818
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,120
You killed my brother.

819
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,710
So you had to pay for it.

820
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,710
Why can't I see anything?

821
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,190
My eyes! I can't see as well!

822
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:30,280
I am blind!

823
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,950
Fu! Fu, I can't see!

824
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,120
I can't see too!

825

Fu! Fu!

826
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,190
I used the Huanming Bug to blind them.

827
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,190
The Huanming Bug moves towards lighting.

828
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,230
I controlled the fireflies

829
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,870
and had them follow the bugs
and leap off the cliff.

830

833
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,910
how dare you conceal the identity
of this criminal on death row

834
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,230
and play tricks on me!

836
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,280

837
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,870
Did I

838
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,760
mention his name?

839
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,080
You were too dull to realize it.

840
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,800
Even so,

841
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,150

842

845

As his father,
I had not taught him well.

846
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,950
I hope that you will have mercy on him.

847
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,320
Give him a chance
to turn over a new leaf.

848
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,840
Sure.

849
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,430
According to the law of our dynasty,

850
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,630
there is no amnesty

for the harm
caused by involuntary manslaughter.

Admit your crime
and accept the punishment

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,520
is the only way to repent and reform.

your circumstances were understandable,

870
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,430
yet it is not permissible under the law.

871

You are sentenced to death for murder,

873
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:37,870

878

that the wise understand
the boundary between life and death,

and their interests are not swayed
by the prospect of survival or demise.

00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,870
that they made.

922
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,840
He chose revenge,

923
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,630
so he has to face

924
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,670
the punishment that he deserved.

925
00:51:59,280 --> 00:51:59,840
By the way,

926
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,040
how did you convince those students

927
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,190
to take the witness stand?

928
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,150
Nothing much.

929
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,040
I just made those people

930
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,390
recite outside of the window.

931
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,190
That simple?

932
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:10,360
It was that simple.

933
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,430
Shen Yan was right.

934
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,670
Humans are not that great.

935
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,120
Sometimes, they are
more piffling than bugs.

936
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,470
They only care about their gains,

937
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:20,470
so they end up becoming cowards.

938
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,430
Do you know the suspect, Shen Ci?

939
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,390
I don't. I have no idea.

940
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:26,360
Their hearts will be swayed.

941
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,150
And they will make mistakes.

942
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,040
Because of this,

943
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,670
their bravery in defying the odds

944
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,390
to seek justice really matters.

945
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,670
Don't you agree?

946
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,710
When the investigation is over,

947
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,910
should I respect your wishes

948
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:45,470
and let you go?

949
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,320
No.

950
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,040
I will never let go of

951
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:53,710
someone like you.

952
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,390
Why are you smiling?

953
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,600
Nothing.

954
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,390
After the rain came sunshine,

955
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,710
so I am in a good mood.

956
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,470
Young Master!

957
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:11,120
Young Master.

958
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:14,360
According to Shen Yan,

959
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:15,390
this is Shen Ci's diary

960
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,710
that was found under a rock

961
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,910
outside the walls of the academy.

962
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:19,600
He found a child to read it to him.

963
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:20,800
[Miao Zhuang went to the hills today]
It's the Ripple Organization.

964
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,630
The child wrote it on Shen Yan's palm,

965
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:23,800
and he memorized all of it.

966
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,950
Miao Zhuang?

967
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:27,630
Isn't this

968
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,360
