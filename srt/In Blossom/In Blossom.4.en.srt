00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Am I right, guys?

190
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,320
Yes.

191
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,280
Although I'm a registrar,

192
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,670
I never forget

193
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,910
that I'm a disciple of the sage.

194
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,910
I've advised
the former magistrate and Liu,

195
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,710
but they won't budge.

196
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,790
Fortunately, you're here, Mr. Pan,

197
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,840
so I can fulfill my ambition.

198
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,350
Good.

199
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,550
In two hours,

200
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,350
I want to see this place
look like a real county yamen.

201
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,110
Hurry up.

202
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,520
Let's go. Come on.

203
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,150
Hang in there.

204
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,960
Sir,

205
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,960
did I do a good job?

206
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,440
Is there anything else I can do?

207
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,840
Not bad.

208
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,000
It would be a shame for you

209
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,110
to be a handyman with your intelligence.

210
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,200
You need to be put to good use.

211
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,000
You flatter me.

212
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,400
I'll do anything

213
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,520
to help the magistracy.

214
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,840
Go and settle down

215
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,320
and meet me in the second hall tomorrow.

216
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,960
Put it over there.

217
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,710
Be careful.

218
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,550
Close the curtain later.

219
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,150
Okay.

220
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,470
Put this pot of flowers in.

221
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,550
It's Young Lady's favorite.

222
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,760
Be careful.

223
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,640
Women have also to go
all out chasing after men.

224
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,910
She even came
to the county yamen for him.

225
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,030
How bold of her.

226
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,960
Come on.

227
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,760
She's not to be messed with.

228
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,670
Be careful.

229
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,760
Young Lady, look.

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,080
I've tidied up a bit.

231
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,230
Are you satisfied?

232
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,520
You call that a little tidying up?

233
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,440
I haven't done it yet.

234
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,110
I'm getting to it now.

235
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,960
No.

236
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,320
I'm a lowly clerk at the county yamen,

237
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,840
not the young lady
in the Shangguan family.

238
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,030
You don't have to be so extravagant.

239
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,320
Yue didn't like me in the past, right?

240
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,400
It's all because I've been spoiled.

241
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,350
So,

242
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,960
I'm going to show him some

243
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,280
of my new hard-working self now.

244
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,030
Maybe

245
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,960
he'll grow to accept me.

246
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,110
It's like those plays

247
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,760
where the prince
doesn't like the princess at all

248
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,200
and prefers the poor girls.

249
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,640
You could interpret it that way.

250
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,790
I got it.

251
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,520
That's Yue's room?

252
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,550
Yes.

253
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,200
I can't believe it went so smoothly.

254
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,470
Pan Yue, you're not that hard
to deal with.

255
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,910
Wait and see.

256
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,550
Sooner or later,

257
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,910
I'm going to make you
pay for what you owe me.

258
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,350
Young Lady,

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,280
I've prepared a set of maid's clothes

260
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,880
as you ordered yesterday.

261
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,710
You... You're overdoing it.

262
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,030
Isn't this too conspicuously poor?

263
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,150
If it's not conspicuous,

264
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,320
how can you attract Mr. Pan's attention?

265
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,030
That's true.

266
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,350
I'm a woman
who wants to achieve something great.

267
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
Why should I be afraid
of being conspicuous?

268
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,350
I just wonder

269
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,080
what kind of job Mr. Pan

270
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,760
will assign you.

271
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,760
Based on his vindictive nature,

272
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,710
I'm sure he'll get back at me.

273
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,670
I can only play it by ear.

274
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,520
Sir.

275
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,440
What do you want me to do?

276
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,320
You don't look like

277
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,400
your usual self today.

278
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,590
I've just changed into a plain outfit.

279
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,230
It's not just the outfit.

280
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,640
It's like you're a new person.

281
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,760
I survived a catastrophe,
so I'm trying to make a fresh start.

282
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,470
Survived a catastrophe?

283
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,000
I haven't asked you

284
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,230
where you went after you made a scene

285
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,760
in my bridal chamber that night

286
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,640
and how the accident happened.

287
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,280
Shangguan Zhi
was in Sunrise Garden that night?

288
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,550
What was she doing there?

289
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,960
Why don't you say something?

290
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
That day,

291
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,400
when I saw you marry another woman,

292
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,280
I was so upset that I left

293
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,150
after writing a suicide note.

294
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,440
I wanted to find a place
to be alone for a few days,

295
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,150
but I didn't expect
to be robbed by bandits.

296
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,790
I jumped out of the carriage,

297
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,280
fell down the hill, and fainted.

298
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,550
They probably thought I was dead

299
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,280
and that's why I survived.

300
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,880
It's quite thrilling, wasn't it?

301
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,230
It's almost like a play.

302
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,440
Yes.

303
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,400
Life is like a play.

304
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,910
There are many more
dramatic stories than this.

305
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,350
This is just nothing.

306
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,550
Sir,

307
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,080
why do you suddenly care about me?

308
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,440
Nothing.

309
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
These days,

310
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,030
when I think of all the things
that have happened between you and me,

311
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,200
I've indeed let you down,

312
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,470
and that's what brought us
to this situation.

313
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,470
What does he want?

314
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,440
I shouldn't bother you
with this kind of thing.

315
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,960
No matter what happened in the past,

316
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,840
I'm in the county yamen now.

317
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,440
I'll keep my manners and work hard.

318
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,000
It seems

319
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm the one who's stuck in my ways.

320
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,520
In the past few days,
I've been trying to think

321
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,910
of a job for you.

322
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,470
I've finally come up
with something suitable.

323
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,000
But I don't know
if you're willing to do it.

324
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,710
I am.

325
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,150
Sir, I'm at your disposal.

326
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,000
The registrar is old,

327
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,030
so you'll assist him

328
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,280
by taking notes of the trial
and making announcements.

329
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,880
You mustn't leave my side

330
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,590
without any exceptional reason.

331
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm the one who's investigating him,

332
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,150
but now it's like he's watching me.

333
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,960
Sir,

334
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
this is the last month's case files

335
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,150
that have been inventoried.

336
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,710
Put them in the archive.

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yes, Sir.

338
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,110
I have to take a chance
to find the case file

339
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,670
of Shangguan Zhi's fall in the archive.

340
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,590
Sir,

341
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,030
the carriage is ready.

342
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,350
It's time for you to go to the monument.

343
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,760
What's wrong?

344
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,070
Are you not going?

345
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,400
Useless official!

346
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,880
Get out of the carriage,
you useless official!

347
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,880
What's going on?

348
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,520
What's this about?

349
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,640
Is she trying to make a scene?

350
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,430
Who is that?

351
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,070
- I have no idea.
- Let's go and take a look.

352
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,680
It's Mr. Pan.

353
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,950
It's him.

354
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,280
What's going on?

355
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,280
It's Mr. Pan.

356
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,520
- Yes.
- What's it about?

357
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,470
Who are you? Do you have any complaints?

358
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,190
I don't have any complaints.

359
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,110
I just don't like the way

360
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,710
you officials act and show off.

361
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,560
You're shameless!

362
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,760
You're a disgrace!

363
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,190
Nice curse.

364
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,800
Do you know

365
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,070
that insulting an official in public

366
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,590
is punishable by 30 strokes
of the cane and half a year in jail?

367
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,110
That's right.

368
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,040
Any other magistrate
would have arrested you.

369
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,230
Only Mr. Pan has the decency

370
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,880
not to bother with a shrew like you.

371
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,880
Leave now.

Mr. Pan, I'm Sun Wancai.

376

I'm sorry for the rudeness

377
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,680

Thank you, Mr. Pan, for forgiving us.

379

380

381

382
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,760
Take me to jail if you can.

383
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,830
Otherwise, I'll curse you day and night.

384

spread all over Heyang!

385

Don't be so hard-headed.

387

388
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,280
I think you should
punish this woman severely

389
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,280
as a warning to others.

390
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,680
You want to help her?

391
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,310

392
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,950
How could I have wanted to help her?

393
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,710
I think she's just too rude

394
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,590
and is too much of a troublemaker.

395
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,590
She must be punished severely.

396
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,040
You want to take your wife home?

397
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,950
Of course I do.

399

Is she ill?

401
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,950
According to the law,

402
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,350

from punishment.

403
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,520
Yes.

Please forgive her.

407
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,710
But I need to make it clear to you

408
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,950
that if you take her back,

409
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,710
you will be solely responsible

410
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,680
for her behavior.

411
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,190
Can you do that?

412
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400

414
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,710
I'll take full responsibility.

415
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,950
Okay, you can take her back now.

416

and your conscience eaten by dogs!

422
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,520
Do you know how many wives
were beaten to death by Sun Wancai?

423
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,760
You look so upright,
but you're an enabler!

424

425

00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,710
as I mentioned,

429
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,830
what's the punishment
for cursing an official

430
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,430
in public?

431
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,230
30 strokes of the cane
and half a year in jail.

432
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,430
The offender, Mrs. Sun, is disoriented,

433
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,230
so her behavior is
the sole responsibility of her husband,

434
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,000

435
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,430

437
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,590
Arrest him.

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,230

Do you know who I am?

442
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,520
Threatening an official
is an additional offense.

443
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,680
Fine.

444
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,640

00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,600
Flattery always works.

744
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,870
I know people

745
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,280
like you love flattery.

746
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,190
I don't believe
I can't get you drunk today.

747
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:58,840
Shangguan Zhi,

748
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,360
aren't you going to give me a toast?

749
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,000
Of course. I am.

750
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,760
I wish you fame and fortune

751
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,760
in Heyang.

752
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,840
I hope it'll be as you wish.

753
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,040
I hope you lose your reputation

754
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,800
and reap what you sow.

755
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,390
It's rare for the masters
to be so happy today.

756
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,320
I'll give you a toast too.

757
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,800
I don't drink.

758
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,470
Why don't you drink?

759
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,600
You're looking down on me

760
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,520
because I'm a girl, aren't you?

761
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,000
I didn't mean that.

762
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,560
If so, drink it.

763
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,520
Sir.

764
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,800
Sir.

765
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,520
Miss Shangguan, Mr. Pan is...

766
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,150
He's drunk.

767
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,280
I'll help him back.

768
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,040
You guys clean up this place.

769
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,390
Mr. Pan is drunk.

770
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,560
I'll send him back.

771
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,040
Sir, be careful.

772
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,040
Don't bump into anything.

773
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,430
Don't get injured.

774
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,000
There are too many mosquitoes.

775
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,080
I'll kill them for you.

776
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,860
[The Case of Miss Yang's Fall]

777
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,360
No one was in the room when she fell.

778
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,670
The autopsy showed no poison

779
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,950
and no trauma.

780
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,470
There's no sign of burglary

781
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,280
or damage to the bridal chamber,

782
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,840
except for a water stain from who knows

783
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,760
where next to the body.

784
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,430
Water stain?

785
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,520
Why is there a water stain
next to the body?

786
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,040
Mr. Pan,

787
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,390
get some rest.

788
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,470
I'll go back first.

789
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,230
The candle in the room went out once.

790
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,840
Before relighting the candle,

791
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,600
Pan Yue should
have knocked out Shangguan Zhi.

792
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,120
He used mechanism

793
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,280
to make Shangguan Zhi delay the fall

794
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,360
to create an alibi.

795
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,630
Why was there a water stain
next to the body?

796
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,120
Water?

797
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,840
Could it be...

798
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,040
If Shangguan Zhi had been knocked out
before she fell,

799
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,320
there must have been trauma on her body.

800
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,760
It's been a month.

801
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,560
Her body may have decomposed.

802
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,120
But it's also the only clue
I've got so far.

803
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,910
But where would
Pan Yue bury Shangguan Zhi?

804
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,080
Young Lady.

805
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,710
Young Lady.

806
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,230
Mr. Pan asked you to go out with him.

807
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,800
What?

808
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,360
That's great. Young Lady.

809
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,630
All your hard work

810
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,950
is finally coming to fruition.

811
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,760
I heard you sent me back
to my room last night.

812
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,360
Yes.

813
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,080
I didn't know that wine was so strong

814
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,470
that even Ze got drunk.

815
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,080
I didn't expect you

816
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,520
to be the best drinker.

817
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,840
I remember

818
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,670
you drank a lot last night, too.

819
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:43,150
Maybe I didn't feel drunk
when I met my soulmate.

820
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,320
But why do I remember in a trance

821
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,870
that you seem to treat me...

822
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,560
What?

823
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,840
What did I do to you?

824
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,280
I didn't do anything to you.

825
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,870
What is this?

826
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,190
A mosquito bite.

827
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,000
You know

828
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,670
that there are a lot of mosquitoes
at the county yamen.

829
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,710
In fact, I killed them
for a while yesterday

830
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,910
so as not to disturb your rest.

831
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,600
Well, that's very kind of you.

832
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,800
Don't mention it.

833
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:30,800
Sir,

834
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,190
where are you taking me?

835
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,870
I've searched everywhere

836
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,670
and finally found a bandit

837
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,910
who injured you a month ago.

838
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,760
Now I take you to identify him.

839
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:04,840
Let's go.

840
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,910
Lai Laosan.

841
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,950
Who are you?

842
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,080
Who are you?

843
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,600
Who let you in?

844
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:24,560
Get out.

845
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,710
This is the new magistrate, Mr. Pan.

846
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:30,360
Pan...

847
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,470
Mr. Pan.

848
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:36,230
Look at him.

849
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,710
Is he the bandit who
hurt you the other day?

850
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,560
I'm not sure.

851
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,670
The bandits were masked.

852
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,390
Masked?

853
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,800
Why didn't I think of that?

854
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,000
Looks like we'll need

855
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,040
physical evidence.

856
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,470
Lai Laosan,

857
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,190
you pawned this
at the pawnshop the other day.

858
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,000
You're a poor man.

859
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:08,630
Where did you get this?

860
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,000
This...

861
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,520
I picked it up somewhere.

862
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,800
You picked it up somewhere?

863
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,280
Where did you pick it up?

864
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,150
This jewelry is unique
to the Shangguan family's carriages.

865
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,950
Shangguan Zhi, am I right?

866
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:26,120
Is that so?

867
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,470
Tell me.

868
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,560
How did you get this?

869
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,630
You're the one who killed someone
and stole the carriage, aren't you?

870
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,080
No, I didn't.

871
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:44,800
Sir,

872
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,710
I didn't hurt anyone

873
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,630
and I wasn't a bandit.

874
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,670
Did the carriage come
to your house by itself?

875
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:52,840
Well...

876
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:55,390
I...

877
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,670
I stole it.

878
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,560
That was the day

879
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,230
you got married.

880
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,670
I lost all my money again.

881
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,470
I passed the mansion
where you were married on my way home.

882
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,710
I thought

883
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,630
that a nobleman from the capital

884
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,600
must have a lot of valuable things

885
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,230
and would be too careless
to take precautions on the wedding day.

886
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,670
So

887
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,600
I thought I'd break into the backyard

888
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,280
and steal something valuable.

889
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:27,390
I shouldn't have stolen things.

890
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,870
But I definitely didn't rob
and kill anyone.

891
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,040
Please see to it, Sir.

892
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,910
Where's the carriage now?

893
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:39,760
Sir.

894
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,630
You said you ran into bandits

895
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,600
on your way out,

896
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,280
but why was the carriage in Sunrise Garden?

897
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,280
Yes.

898
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,910
