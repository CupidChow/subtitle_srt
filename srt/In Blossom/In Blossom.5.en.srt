39
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,320
Turns out he only knows

40
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,110
that Shangguan Zhi abducted me.

41
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,030
He didn't suspect my identity.

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,270
Yes.

43
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,830
I admit

44
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,720
that I abducted Miss Yang
in the heat of the moment.

45
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,030
But she ran off and married you.

Do you want
to settle the scores with me now?

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,270
Yes, she did run away.

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,960
So you followed her to Sunrise Garden,

49
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,160
sneaked into the pleasure house

50
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,630
and pushed her down.

51
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,750
I didn't.

52
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,800
How do you explain this, then?

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,880
I found it on Yang Caiwei's body.

54
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,190
Does it jog your memory, Miss Shangguan?

55
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,030
Since Shangguan Zhi

56
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,600
intended to use my identity,

57
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,550
why did she keep this?

58
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,470

60
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,520

that you might have left something

Before heading to the Coffin House,

78
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,040
I had planned

79
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,040
to leave Miss Yang alone

80
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,670
in this abandoned mine pit.

81
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,070
I was trying to scare her off

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,640
from approaching you.

83
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,950
Unexpectedly,

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,200
a bunch of bandits followed us

85
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,390
and snatched our things.

86
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,550
They even pushed us into the pit.

87
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,000
Fortunately,

88
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,110

89
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,880
from falling to our deaths.

90
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,480
Then, we climbed out of the pit.

91
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,230
I asked her
to drive the carriage and leave.

92
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
I collapsed halfway

93
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,270
from exhaustion.

94
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,200
I doubt you would be so kind.

95
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,040
I thought you two hadn't met
each other for ten years

96
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
and had grown apart.

97
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,230
But after hearing what she said,

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,880
I realized that the bond between you two
runs so deeply.

99
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,720
Which makes my one-sided affection

100
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,790
seem rather insignificant.

101

110
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,790
Then, she ended up living
on the streets in Heyang.

111
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,000
Besides, she was insulted and mocked
because of the scar on her face.

112
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,880

that you both had already grown apart.

that I might get you involved.

195
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,470
On the night of your wedding,

196
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,520
a masked man tried to kill me.

197
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,470
Luckily,

198
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,840
I took the medicine

199
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,320
and regained consciousness.

200
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,640
I managed to escape
from the Coffin House

201
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,200
before he noticed me.

202

Did you see his face?

203

I couldn't.

that person was wearing
the groom's gown.

206

211
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,200
He did suspect me.

212
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,880
But I'm safe for the time being.

213

What is your plan?

216
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,880
I need to find Shangguan Zhi's body

217
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
and examine it.

218
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,350
Perhaps I might find evidence
against him.

All right.

220
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,710

This case is hastily closed as suicide.

While Miss Yang was working
at the Coffin House,

290
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,590
she had already been mistreated
over the years.

00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,710
If she had wanted to kill herself,

00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,920
she would have died a hundred times.

293
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,190
But why did she choose to jump
off the building on her wedding day?

294

My young master feels sorry

295
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,230

00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,950
That makes sense.

299
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,590

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,470
It seems that Silver Rain Terrace
uses this incident

But after the incident that day,

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,880

in Heyang up by doing so?

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,310
How could a murderer

become the rightful official

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,520
I will re-examine the case

335
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,640
and give you a satisfactory answer.

336
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,880

Heyang is under the protection

to reveal the truth in seven days,

00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,640
Should we

372
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,230
examine Miss Yang's body publicly?

373
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,110
I... I'm not sure about this.

374
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,880
But they claimed

375
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,110
that you impeded the investigation.

376
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,230
Why don't you examine the body publicly

377
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,830
to show that you aren't

378
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,760
hiding anything?

379
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,760
And the rumors would stop.

380
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,230
I never cared about the rumors.

381
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,920
Why are you concerned about it?

382
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,230
I will do it.

383
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:25,920
Allow me.

384
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,800
I'm thinking, if Miss Yang knows

385
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,800
that you are wronged because of her,

386
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,190
she wouldn't rest in peace.

387
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,160
Before I put you in prison,

388
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,560
I won't be at ease.

389
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,190
It seems that you pay extra attention
to her case.

390
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,760
Because

391
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,230
we have known each other
since childhood.

392
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,710
Besides, you suspect me.

393
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,190
So I'm thinking of proving my innocence.

394
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,310
There is nothing to investigate.

395
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,230
She died in an accident.

396
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,400
But seven days later...

397
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,640
I have a plan.

398
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,280
What plan?

399
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,000
Do you want to know?

400
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,830
But I don't want to tell you.

401
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,680
He seems confident.

402
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,680
I shall see what is up your sleeve.

403
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,760
Mr. Pan, here's your letter.

404
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,100
[Mr. Pan, please...]

405
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,190
Hundred Flowers Court?

406
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,740
[Hundred Flowers Court]

407
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,280
Mr. Li, let me pour for you.

408
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,190
Come on.

409
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:44,880
Here.

410
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,160
One more.

411
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,280
Sir, do you want some?

412
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,560
Sure.

413
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,560
Come.

414
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,560
Please drink.

415
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,310
Young lady, come over here.

416
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,880
Sure.

417
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,800
Coming.

418
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,470
Come hither, beauty.

419
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,110
Don't go.

420
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,190
Naughty.

421
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,160
Sir, come and get me.

422
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,310
Don't go.

423
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,230
Come. Have a drink with me.

424
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,590
Cheers.

425
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,430
We have an important guest
in the private room.

426
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,310
Hurry over.

427
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:53,800
Sure.

428
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,950
Come with me.

429
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,400
Coming.

430
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,040
Quick.

431
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,160
Hurry.

432
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,040
Hurry up.

433
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,430
Come on.

434
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,470
I wonder if I will be chosen.

435
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,040
I want to be chosen.

436
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,830
I have prepared a good tune.

437
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,160
They will definitely choose me.

438
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,350
- Let's go.
- It is our turn.

439
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,190
Come on.

440
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,310
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Pan.

441
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,590
Please pardon me.

442
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,920
I'm willing to wait for the beauties.

443
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,000
I won't blame you, Miss Qing.

444
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,590
That explains why all ladies

445
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,190
fall for you.

446
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,920
You are indeed handsome
and good-natured.

447
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,800
However,

448
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,640
the young master
of Silver Rain Terrace is targeting you.

449
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,710
You will probably

450
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,640
have a hard time in Heyang.

451
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,830
Is the young master
someone hard to deal with?

452
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,800
Zhuo Lanjiang

453
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,760
is the only son of Zhuo Shanju.

454
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,880
He had been studying in the capital.

455
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,830
Three years ago,

456
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,070
a new power arrived in Heyang,

457
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,470
Gold Water Sect.

458
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,350
They were ferocious

459
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,800
and competed
with Silver Rain Terrace for business.

460
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,000
Mr. Zhuo lost his life
in the competition.

461
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,680
The young Zhuo Lanjiang
then rushed back.

462
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,880
No one knows

463
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
what happened that night.

464
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,040
People found
that the river turned all red

465
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,310
when they woke up in the morning.

466
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,680
The heads of the Gold Water Sect members

467
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,190
were hanging on the city gate.

468
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,800
I heard that Silver Rain Terrace

469
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,710
wiped out this sect three years ago.

470
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,160
I didn't expect it to be his doing.

471
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,800
Miss Qing, you invited me over

472
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,590
to praise Silver Rain Terrace
in front of me?

473
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,400
Of course not.

474
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,310
Mr. Pan, you are dashing,

475
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,110
and I'm attracted to you at first sight.

476
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,710
I'm meeting you late at night

477
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,560
because I want to do something

478
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,310
those women wish for but dare not do.

479
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,040
Despite being a woman,

480
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,680
the Hundred Flowers Court has earned
its place among the Four Greats.

481
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,040
You are exceptionally powerful to me.

482
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,830
If I believe in such jests,

483
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,190
I would be underestimating you.

484
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,000
Anyway,

485
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,190
since I have come here
at your invitation,

486
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,710
to show my respect,

487
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,040
I will drink first.

488
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,800
All right.

489
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,560
Mr. Pan, you are straightforward.

490
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,230
I will cut right to the chase.

491
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,640
You will probably expect
a fight with the Four Greats

492
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,680
since you came to Heyang.

493
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,400
The Hundred Flowers Court
would like to be your ally

494
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,000
and assist you.

495
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,470
How do you know there will be a fight?

496
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,400
If not,

497
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,950
your effort coming to Heyang

498
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,800
would be in vain.

499
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,070
If you want to achieve something big,

500
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,430
taking down the Four Greats

501
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,950
could help you gain a big reputation.

502
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,920
It sounds reasonable.

503
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,470
However, the Four Greats
are thick as thieves.

504
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,640
How do I know

505
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,310
if this isn't a honeytrap
from the Hundred Flowers Court?

506
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,590
Among the Four Greats,

507
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,560
I'm not convinced to rank the last.

508
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,950
Silver Rain Terrace is domineering
over everything,

509
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,590
while Gu Yong of Relief Hall is greedy.

510
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,400
As long as you pay him enough money,

511
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,640
he wouldn't hesitate

512
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,560
to stab his own father.

513
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,400
Also,

514
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,920
Cai Sheng of Life and Death House
is a reckless man.

515
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,310
He is foolhardy.

516
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,280
If you are down

517
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,590
for this fight,

518
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,070
I will assist you

519
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,800
and triumph over
the rest of the Four Greats.

520
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,590
Do you think I will win?

521
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,040
I always have a good assessment

522
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,680
of men.

523
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,950
All right. I promise you.

524
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,000
These two actually gang up.

525
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,280
But words alone aren't enough.

526
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,280
Should you show some sincerity,
Miss Qing?

527
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,800
Don't worry, Mr. Pan.

528
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,590
I have prepared a gift for you.

529
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,430
Here.

530
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,830
May everything go smoothly for you
in Heyang

531
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,430
and may you get promoted.

532
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:41,190
May the Hundred Flowers Court
shine its radiance upon Heyang.

533
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,310
Change the tune.

534
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Yes.

535
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,680
You have ruined Mr. Pan's mood.

536
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,920
Go down and receive your punishment.

537
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,560
Yes.

538
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,230
Hold on.

539
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,800
Did you play the wrong note on purpose?

540
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,590
It seems that you are interested in me.

541
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,160
Come with me tonight.

542
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,950
I bid you farewell, Mr. Pan.

543
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,110
I shall take my leave.

544
00:32:59,350 --> 00:32:59,830
Miss Qing.

545
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,000
Is he the one you chose?

546
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,760
I will take this chance.

547
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,880
Perhaps he could help me

548
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,310
to achieve my wish.

549
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,760
Didn't you want
to keep your distance from me?

550
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,190
Why did you follow me there?

551
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,400
You surely have a way
to take your enemies down.

552
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,230
You joined hands
with one of the Four Greats.

553
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,310
This is impressive.

554
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,800
It seems that Heyang will soon...

555
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,640
Stop flattering me.

556
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,560
Please don't take me wrong.

557
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,830
I thought you were investigating
the falling-off-building case.

558
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,590
Had I known it was a lady's invitation,
I wouldn't have come.

559
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,350
Shangguan Zhi.

560
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,230
I don't care whether you are
investigating or doing something else.

561
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,040
Since Shangguan Lan left you in Heyang,

562
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,280
I must keep you safe.

563
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,400
If you keep messing around like this,

564
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,190
I might not be able

565
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:56,680
to help you next time.

566
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,760
Do you understand?

567
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,110
Yes.

568
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,680
Thank you for helping me.

569
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,140
[Edify through music and ritual]

570
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,470
Mr. Pan.

571
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,710
Mr. Pan.

572
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,950
The person you invited
has arrived in Heyang.

573
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:28,430
All right.

574
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,220
[Court]

575
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,710
I...

576
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,800
This is Mr. Pan's order.

577
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,520
Does he think I'm a thief?

578
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,430
Pan Yue is cautious around me.

579
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,230
I'm afraid it is difficult
to shadow him.

580
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,040
How could I find the body
of Shangguan Zhi?

581
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,910
When he probed,

582
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,430
you know,

583
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,360
and grabbed it,

584
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,390
he discovered it.

585
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,000
Oh, right!

586
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,520
You know what?

587
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,390
Many gambling houses open bets

588
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,630
on the outcome of the case
seven days later.

589
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,600
Between Young Master Zhuo and Mr. Pan,

590
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,230
if you bet on the right person,

591
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,600
you will make a fortune.

592
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,470
I knew about it.

593
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,230
Whom did you bet on?

594
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,760
Of course, Young Master Zhuo.

595
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,560
There is a saying,

596
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,390
"a powerful dragon can't defeat
the local snake."

597
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,230
I'm not like you.

598
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,520
I'm smarter.

599
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,360
I bet on both.

600
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,840
No matter who wins, I won't lose money.

601
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,000
Well.

602
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,000
Put your money on the left side
if you bet on Young Master Zhuo.

603
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,630
[Pan, Zhuo]
The right side is for Mr. Pan.

604
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,670
You will strike it rich
if you bet on the right person.

605
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,870
It must be Mr. Pan.

606
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,150
Young Master Zhuo is resolute
and a man of his word.

607
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,280
I bet on Young Master Zhuo.

608
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,320
- Me too.
- Me too.

609
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,600
Mr. Pan serves the country and its people.
He mustn't be slandered.

610
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,760
All the way Mr. Pan!

611
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,520
- Mr. Pan.
- Mr. Pan.

612
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,520
- Me too.
- Me too.

613
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,000
- Young Master Zhuo!
- Mr. Pan!

614
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,100
- Young Master Zhuo!
- Young Master Zhuo!

615
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,560
- Mr. Pan!
- Mr. Pan!

616
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,390
Madam, whom do you bet on?

617
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,320
She puts all her money
on Young Master Zhuo.

618
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,630
Why?

619
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,120
- Why did she bet on Young Master Zhuo?
- That's a lot.

620
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,760
I bet Young Master Zhuo

621
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,360
will definitely kick
Mr. Pan out of Heyang.

622
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,520
Impossible.

623
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,630
Madam.

624
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,320
Both Young Master Zhuo and Mr. Pan

625
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,000
are on an equal footing now.

626
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,670
You shouldn't put all your eggs
in one basket.

627
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm afraid you might be cleaned out.

628
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,670
That's right.

629
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,120
I wouldn't make this bet

630
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,630
if I'm not confident.

631
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,840
Madam, do you know something?

632
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,080
Could you share it with me?

633
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,460
What did she say?

634
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,320
Can you hear it?

635
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,430
She is leaving?

636
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,290
She is leaving like this?

637
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,320
I will return to claim my winnings
seven days later.

638
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,840
Sir.

639
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,040
What is it about?

640
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
Care to share it with me?

641
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,800
But she just told me.

642
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
It is not appropriate if I tell you now.

643
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,430
Take this.

644
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,910
You can have all the money.

645
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,430
Well...

646
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,670
I will only tell you.

647
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,150
What...

648
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,520
Stay back.

649
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,630
Pay me

650
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,470
if you want to know.

651
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,320
She told me

652
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,470
her husband

653
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,120
holds an important position
in Silver Rain Terrace.

654
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,910
She said

655
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,190
Young Master Zhuo has already found

656
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,430
where Mrs. Pan was buried.

657
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,390
Yes!

658
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,950
I will return to claim my winnings
seven days later.

659
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,800
What is it?

660
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,760
[Win]
What did he tell you?

661
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,710
[Huge profit]
We are buddies.

662
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,840
[Make a big fortune]
Share it with me.

663
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,760
Let me tell you.

664
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,910
I will only tell you.

665
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,280
All right.

666
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,870
Caiwei.

667
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,000
This is a wise move

668
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,190
to lure him out.

669
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,320
I bet Pan Yue won't sit tight

670
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,190
after knowing this.

671
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,280
Anyway, I will be waiting for him

672
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,280
to lead me to the body.

673
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,360
Let's go.

674
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,230
Mind your step.

675
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,950
[Liquor]

676
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,840
I don't think

677
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,150
this rain will stop soon.

678
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,230
I will go and buy an umbrella.

679
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,630
Don't go.

680
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,600
People in the county yamen might notice

681
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,800
if you get drenched.

682
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,120
I will go. I run faster.

683
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,360
Be careful.

684
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,280
Yang Caiwei.

685
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,040
How could you do that to me?

686
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,600
You promised
you would drink here every month.

687
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,430
Why are you so late?

688
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,560
- Mister.
- Jiang?

689
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,190
You got the wrong person.

690
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,000
Let go of me.

691
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,040
Yang Caiwei.

692
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,120
Yang Caiwei.

693
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,870
You said I'm living like a delinquent

694
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,280
with an unstable life.

695
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,470
You wanted me to stay alive
and come back for you.

696
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,600
Now that I'm back,

697
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,950
but you died.

698
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,150
Bugger off.

699
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,800
Don't touch me.

700
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,470
Do you know who I am?

701
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,390
Shut up.

702
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,910
You are just some

703
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,150
reckless delinquent.

704
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,950
You will die if you don't get a bandage.

705
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,800
Put up with the pain.

706
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,910
Where have you gone?

Come on.

What are you doing?

710
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,840
Stay away.

711

Misters.

712
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,230
He is my friend.

713
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,150
I'm so sorry. He is drunk.

714
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,000
I will compensate
for the things he broke.

715
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,630
Take him away now.

716
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,760
All right.

717
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,320
I'm so sorry about that.

718
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,760
- He is a bad drunk.
- Let's go.

719
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,040
- Yang Caiwei.
- Oh, my.

720
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,600
You scoundrel.

721
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,670
Why don't you come?

722
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,190
Caiwei.

723
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,950
Yang Caiwei.

724
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,470
Who is he?

725
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,910
Why do you care about this hooligan?

726
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,950
I saved his life

727
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,560
from the mass grave.

728
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,190
Both of you

729
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,120
are my only friends in Heyang.

730
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,910
Yang Caiwei.

731
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,320
Yang Caiwei.

732
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,670
He has a good-looking face.

733
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,470
His arm is injured.

734
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,390
What do we do? Should we carry him back?

735
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,520
But I don't know where his home is.

736
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,840
We will find him a place to settle down.

737
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,470
Come on.

738
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,150
Carry him.

739
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,560
Yang Caiwei.

740
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,470
Young Lady.

741
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
What is wrong with you?

742
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,390
You look listless.

743
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
Nothing.

744
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,430
Mr. Pan's clothes are washed.

745
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,760
Do you want to deliver them to him?

746
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,430
No.

747
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,390
You go.

748
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,320
I don't want to see his face.

749
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,760
I got it.

750
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,950
You are playing hard to get.

751
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,040
I understand.

752
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,840
I'm leaving.

753
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,760
Because of me,
Master has to go into hiding,

754
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,230
and Bai Xiaosheng has to act cautiously.

755
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,670
Seeing how Jiang is suffering

756
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,840
and I can't tell him the truth...

757
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,840
I must find the truth quickly

758
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,320
and end all of this.

759
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,120
Something is wrong.

760
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,630
Liu.

761
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,230
Only two days left

762
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,150
until the seven-day promise
with Silver Rain Terrace.

763
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,150
But Mr. Pan hasn't made a move.

764
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,870
Could he be conceding already?

765
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,390
I heard about it too. What is going on?

766
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,770
I think so.

767
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:18,730
Is that true?

768
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,230
I went to the gambling house
this morning

769
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,320
and changed all my bets

770
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,760
to Young Master Zhuo.

771
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,430
Do you think I'm a traitor?

772
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,390
Everyone outside is saying

773
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,710
that Silver Rain Terrace has found

774
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,120
Miss Yang's body.

775
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,000
This is going to be their game.

776
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,150
Well.

777
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,800
Isn't it obvious who the winner is?

778
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,630
Jeez.

779
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,000
If Mr. Pan loses,

780
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,280
he can just go back

781
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,230
and marry the princess, right?

782
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,080
But look at us.

783
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,230
We will lose our jobs.

784
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,560
I must take this opportunity

785
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,560
to make money before I leave.

786
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,230
Am I right?

787
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,630
Did I get it right?

788
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,320
Hey.

789
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,800
Am I right?

790
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,230
You are a good planner.

791
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,360
Being a constable
is a waste of your talent.

792
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,740
Mr. Pan.

793
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,600
Mr. Pan.

794
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,190
Please forgive me, Mr. Pan.

795
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,150
I...

796
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,280
I... I will go and receive my spanking.

797
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,230
Let's go.

798
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,280
Mr. Pan, I will count it for him.

799
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,950
Prepare the horse.
I'm going out tonight.

800
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,630
Yes.

801
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,870
Ling.

802
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,080
Ling.

803
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,390
Ling.

804
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,150
What is the matter, Young Lady?

805
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,430
Why are you in a rush?

806
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,870
Get me some cucumber flower powder.

807
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:48,710
Quick.

808
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,430
Yes.

809
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,230
Chop-chop.

810
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,080
If I were to know when I would die,

811
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,360
I would find a beautiful
peach blossom forest in advance

812
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,840
to bury myself.

813
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,910
That one looks pretty good.

814
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,190
Why is it here?

00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:33,140
