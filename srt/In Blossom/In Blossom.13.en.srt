hasn't been smooth sailing

Old Master Zhuo has left for many years.

What do you want to know?

49
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,440
My father said

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,830
you were old friends with him.

51
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,750
He wanted me to take care of Relief Hall.

52
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,360
But over the years,
I've always had this question in my mind.

53
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Since you'd been old friends,

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,110
why did our families
rarely meet each other?

55
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,670
Since your father didn't tell you,

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,750
it means he didn't want you to know.

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,750

I have no reason to reveal it.

60
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,600
It's as I thought.
There must be a reason for this.

Yes.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,880
Mr. Gu, there are
trespassers in the dungeon.

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,200
Recently, some have been investigating

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,390
the purchasing records of animal bones.

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,550
Could it be that Pan Yue knew

95
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,790
that we were making a fake wyvern?

96
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,110
No wonder Zhuo Lanjiang

97
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,880
spent so much time talking with me.

98
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,230
Pan Yue is still suspicious of me.

99
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,320
Since he's here, don't let him go.

100
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,440
Yes.

101
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,510

102
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,160

of the richest man in the world.

104
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,390
It's none of your business.

105
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,720
I'm afraid that some people

106
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,000
would use their friends as a shield
when trouble arises.

107
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,320
I only use people I hate as shields.

108
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,040
I'm afraid you can't afford
to offend those people.

109
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,670
- You…
- Waiter.

110
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,350
Sir, what would you like to eat?

111
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,920
Grilled seabass
and stir-fried cinnamon fern.

112
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,760
Chicken stew and field mustard tofu soup.

113
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,200
Grill the fish with less salt
and make sure the skin is charred.

114
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,510
The cinnamon fern
should be crispy, not soft.

115
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,230
And give us a jar of osmanthus wine.

116
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,000
Serve the wine first,
and prepare ingredients for the rest.

117
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,440
Start cooking as soon

118
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,200

119
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,760
Okay, please wait a moment.

120
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,760
These are all Caiwei's favorites.

121
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,110
Isn't this Zhuo Lanjiang

122
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,760
treating Caiwei too well?

123
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,230
He was so sad for Caiwei
that he drank a lot.

124
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,950
Later, he wanted to help Caiwei
take her revenge.

125
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,350
I didn't expect this guy

126
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,110
to be so crazy for Caiwei.

127
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,390
Why are you staring at me like that?

128
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,520
Are there flowers on my face?

129
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,520
Who is staring at you? You're shameless.

130
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,760
Tell me, what are you planning?

131
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,400
Young Master Zhuo, let's make a deal.

132
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,520
I'm not interested
in your fake jade bracelet.

133
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,030
Sure, but are you interested in Caiwei?

134
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,910
What are you trying to say?

135
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,520
You like Caiwei, don't you?

136
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,520
How direct.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,790
In business,

138
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,910
we should clearly mark the price.

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,880
I don't have time
to beat around the bush.

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,910
I like her. And?

141
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,030
I grew up with Caiwei.

142
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,200
So, I know her favorites.

143
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,590
I also know what kind of person she likes.

144
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,640
Won't you consider cooperating with me?

145
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,200
Let me help you.

146
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,400
Do you think I need your help?

147
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
As the saying goes,

148
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,760
the more friends you have,
the more options you have.

149
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,670
The fewer enemies you have,
the fewer obstacles, right?

150
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,760
If you don't cooperate with me,

151
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,200
I might bad-mouth you.

152
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,790
You are good at making a deal.

153
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,790
Tell me. What are your conditions?

154
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,000
As expected, Young Master Zhuo.

155
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,030
You are a smart, sincere,

156

lovable, and handsome client.

157
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,640
It's such a pleasure
doing business with you.

158
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
I want this.

159
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,670
You don't know how to use a sword.
What do you want it for?

160
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,350
That's my business.

161
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,590
I hope you keep your end of the deal.

162
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,880
Of course.

163
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,000
Shan.

164
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,910
Madam, why are you here again?

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,350
Come on, come with me quickly.

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,840
I want to stay with Shan here.

167
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,590
The Young Master left here five years ago.

168
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,590
Let's go quickly. Let's go.

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,470
Let's go.

170
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,150
Shan.

171
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,000
Shan.

172
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,110
It seems that Gu Shan was being held here.

173
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,400
He's not dead.

174
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,670
Gu Shan ran away.

175
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,000
There is another person in this world
who can wield the Blood Sword.

176
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,000
It seems like what the crazy madam said

177
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,400
about Gu Yong being the murderer

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,080
is about him wanting to kill his own son.

179
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,880
Even a cruel tiger
does not devour its cubs.

180
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,110
What on earth did Gu Shan do

181
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,230
to make Gu Yong punish him like this?

182
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,880
The most extreme cruelty in the world

183
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,000
is almost always imposed
in the name of family affection.

184
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,200
Five years ago,

185
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,960
the Lantern Festival Case occurred
for the first time.

186
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,320
Gu Shan is a very likely suspect.

187
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,710
But why did Gu Yong lie?

188
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,840
The reason he is hiding
the fact that Gu Shan is still alive

189
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,470
might be

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,470
related to the Ripple Token.

191
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,110
It's best not to tarry long.
Let's get out of here.

192
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,710
Sure.

193
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,940
It's locked.

194
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,840
This smell.

195
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,320
It seems Gu Yong wants us dead.

196
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,230
As appointed, it's been two hours.

197
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,550
Why hasn't Yang Caiwei come yet?

198
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Could it be that Gu Yong discovered them

199
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,840
and they started fighting?

200
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,520
Probably not.

201
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,760
I sent many scouts to camp
outside Relief Hall.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,670
If something goes wrong,

203
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,030
they will immediately come over
and notify me.

204
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,320
Could it be that they discovered something

205
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,670
and went back to the county yamen first?

206
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,790
Let's go.

207
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,470
Will we really die here?

208
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,550
Why? Do you regret coming to Heyang?

209
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,550
Do you regret it?

210
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,840
Yes.

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,110
I have been always thinking,

212
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,440
if I hadn't come to Heyang
in the first place,

213
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,590
would she have survived?

214
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,320
Actually, I…

215
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,320
I am…

216
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,710
There's wind.

217
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,200
We're underground.

218
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,520
Why is there wind?

219
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,880
The slab is loose and has gaps.

220
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,710
This was supposed
to be a ventilation opening.

221
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,790
I'll see if I can pry it open.

243
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,960
No, she hasn't, Master Zhuo.

244
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,520
Didn't you go out together?

245
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,400
Could Young Lady
be in some kind of trouble?

246
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,280
Where are you going?

247
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,670
To take them back from the Relief Hall.

248
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,790
How are you going to do that?

249
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,030
Do you have a plan?

250
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,550
It's too late to make plans.
Let's go over there first.

251
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,960
Young Master Zhuo, I'll go with you.

252
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,760
I am going, too.

253
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,560
What happened?

254
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,560
Young Lady.

255
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,640
I sprained my foot.

256
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,160
Why didn't you leave as planned?

257
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,000
What took you so long?

258
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,110
Don't blame him. I'm fine.

259
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,310
Put this on first.

260
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,590
Ling.

261
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,710
Sir.

262
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,680
Your Young Lady spent half the night
freezing in the dungeon.

263
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,070
Take her back quickly
and prepare a hot bath for her.

264
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,230
Also, make her a bowl of hot ginger soup.

265
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,040
Yes, sir.

266
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,160
Young Lady, let's go.

267
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,590
Young Master,
have a bowl of hot ginger tea.

268
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,560
Young Master,

269
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,760
did being trapped in a dungeon
trigger your old illness?

270
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,590
Then…

271
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,040
I'm fine.

272
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,160
Shangguan Zhi saved me.

273
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,950
That's great.

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,430
It's all right.

278
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,830

279
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,880

280

[Two months ago]

299
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,830
Mr. Pan.

300
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,430
We meet again.

301
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,400
Yesterday, you were
a glorious Imperial Censor.

302
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,920
How did you become a prisoner today?

303
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,280
Your Highness,

304
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,920
are you here to ridicule me?

305
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,280
I'm just thinking,

306
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,430
if you had agreed
to be my consort that day,

307
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,400
who would have dared
to lay a finger on you?

308
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,470
Being tactful is a valuable trait.

309
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,520
It's not too late for you to regret now.

310
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,230
What a pity.

311
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,830
It seems that Miss Yang

312
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,190
had died in vain.

313
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,110
What do you mean?

314
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,160
What do you know?

315
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,640
What do you know?

316
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,880
Mr. Pan,

317
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,110
I want to work with you.

318
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,920
I also learned a bit about
what happened to Yang Ji'an's family.

319
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,000
Although I don't know the specifics,

320
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,520
I knew that Yang Ji'an

321
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,830
was an upright critic.

322
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,470
He was killed on the way
after being demoted.

323
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,040
How strange.

324
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,640
Ten years after that,

325
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,520
his daughter was just found by you

326
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,040
but died from an accident.

327
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,040
It's very suspicious.

328
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,430
But to say that you are the murderer,

329
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,760
I won't believe it.

330
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,160
You rejected me for Miss Yang that day.

331
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,760
Your heart was set on her.

332
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,350
How could you kill her?

333
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,520
Someone must have framed you.

334
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,710
My father told me

335
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,160
some powerful ministers in the court

336
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,160
are growing their influence in Heyang

337
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,400
with bad intentions.

338
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,040
The murder of Yang Caiwei's family

339
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,310
is related to this.

340
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,230
So,

341
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,110
as long as we find the person
who killed Miss Yang,

342
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,800
we can follow the clues

343
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,310
and find this person's backer
in the court.

344
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,310
This is the deal I want to make with you.

345
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,280
I'll bail you out of prison,

346
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,400
and you must take this case.

347
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,880
Get to the bottom of things.

348
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,230
Do not worry.

349
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,760
I will take care of the Emperor.

350
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,040
All you have to do is find out
the truth as soon as possible

351
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,070
and eliminate the nation's traitors.

352
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,710
I, Pan Yue,

353
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,400
will not disappoint you.

354
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,590
Pan Yue,

355
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,230
you thought your love was deep-rooted,

356
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,950
looking for your old love.

357
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,280
Yet, while you have
yet to avenge your late wife,

358
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,520
you are worried
about Shangguan Zhi instead.

359
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,760
You should feel ashamed to face
Yang Caiwei who died for you,

360
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,680
Her Highness who's helping your
investigation,

361
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,560
and the friends that trust you.

362
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,710
Even more so,
you should be ashamed of yourself.

363
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,560
Didn't you say
you could settle everything?

364
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,830
Why did you let Pan Yue target the lair?

365
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,830
Are you becoming
more childlike as you age?

366
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,000
What's the reason?

367
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,430
Isn't it all because of Zhuo Lanjiang?

368
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,070
Without him being the insider,
betraying me,

369
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,710
could Pan Yue have found my dungeon?

370
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,520
That's enough.

371
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,830
Pan Yue found out about Gu Shan.

372
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,590
And how much of our affairs
does Gu Shan know?

373
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,230
He knows the relationship
between you and me,

374
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,040
and

375
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,590
the token is in his hands.

376
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,560

You don't even know me, yet you dare
to try to control Ghost Market?

387
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,710
I heard that a few days ago,

388
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,070
you confiscated
from a jade bracelet stall.

389
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,070
I am here to inform you today

390
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,190
that the stall owner
named Bai is under me.

391
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,560

and walk away from her
whenever you see her.

Good morning, sir.

Good morning.

I'm fine.

Are you still feeling uneasy
about what happened in the dungeon?

410
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,230
I will ask Ling

411
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,590
to get you some calming medicine.

412
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,920
No, it's okay.

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,470
Look at your cheeks.

Your face is red, and you seem dazzled.

417
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,800
I'll get the medicine.

418
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,950
No, I'm fine.

419

Why is he still the same
as when he was a child?

423
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,880
So stubborn.

Can we discuss this?

428
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,590
Didn't you suspect that someone
in the county yamen was a spy?

429
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,190
I asked Ze to check it,

430
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,800
but no suspicions have been found yet.

with just you and me,

433
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,230
it's utterly impossible

434
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
to find Gu Shan.

435
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,590
Gu Yong has a son named Gu Shan.

436
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,000
He may be the suspect
in this Lantern Festival Case.

437
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,160
He was imprisoned and hurt
by Gu Yong for a long time.

438
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,000
So when he witnessed violent acts,

439
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
he would be unable to restrain himself
and run amok to hurt others.

440
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,920
We need

441
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,830
to try our best to find Gu Shan.

442
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,800
Do we have Gu Shan's portrait?

443
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,000
From what we know,

444
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,070
Gu Shan

445
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,040
is thin and not tall.

446
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,230
But it's been five years
since anyone saw him,

447
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,800
so his voice and appearance

448
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,830
could have changed drastically.

449
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,830
How can we find him, then?

450
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,350
Aren't we looking
for a needle in a haystack?

451
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,830
Yes.

452
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,640
Maybe he has already left Heyang.

453
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,230
Yes.

454
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,430
There were still new victims
last summer solstice.

455
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,800
It means

456
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,070
that canceling the Lantern Festival
did not affect his crime.

457
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,830
This summer solstice,

458
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,760
he might do it again.

459
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,160
If looking for him is like
looking for a needle in a haystack,

460
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,880
then let him come to us.

461
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,190
Sir, you mean…

462
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,350
Restart the Lantern Festival
and gather the people.

463
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,430
Then, we will deliberately
create a violent incident.

464
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,560
I don't believe he could stay quiet.

465
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,800
Good idea.

466
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,830
But the summer solstice
is only three days away.

467
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,350
It's definitely too late to prepare now.

468
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,710
There's enough time.

469
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,000
There is nothing the Silver Rain Terrace
cannot do in Heyang.

470
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,350
That's right,

471
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,310
how could we have
forgotten our strongest support?

472
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,040
Thank you very much, Young Master Zhuo.

473
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,040
With our relationship,
you don't have to thank me.

474
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,830
Don't be a stranger.

475
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,680
The Lantern Festival will be organized
jointly by the Silver Rain Terrace

476
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,920
and the county yamen.

477
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,000
Mr. Pan, what do you think?

478
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,590
Even if I object to it,

479
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,470
will you not intervene?

480
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,070
Naturally, I still have to intervene.

481
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,800
If the county yamen
and Silver Rain Terrace

482
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,680
jointly organize the Lantern Festival
this year,

483
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,430
it will definitely be glamorous

484
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,710
and breathtaking.

485
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,590
No.

486
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,110
The key point
of restarting the Lantern Festival

487
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,230
is not about the lights but the people.

488
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,470
In recent years, the incidents
have troubled people one after another.

489
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,000
The people are afraid.

490
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,640
We can't hold a knife

491
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,880
to the commoner's necks

492
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,680
and force them to join
the Lantern Festival.

493
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,640
So, the top priority right now

494
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,560
is to eliminate the fear
in people's hearts.

495
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,680
Evil wyvern?

496
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,070
That's right.

497
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,070
This is easy to handle.

498
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,760
The county yamen
will post a notice that says

499
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,280
since the evil wyvern has been slain,
the Lantern Festival will be restarted.

500
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,590
Sir, Young Master,

501
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,070
with all due respect,

502
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,160
the people of Heyang are traumatized

503
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,280
by the last few Lantern Festivals.

504
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,920
Even if we tell them
that the evil wyvern has been slain,

505
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,110
they will still feel that it's unlucky.

506
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,590
After all, there is no reason to risk it

507
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,520
for a few lanterns.

508
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,830
Other than lanterns,

509
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,310
let's add something else.

510
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,110
If there were such a person in Heyang

511
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,560
who was famous

512
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,680
and had many followers,

513
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,070
we could organize a grand event

514
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,800
for him during the Lantern Festival.

515
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,190
For example, a float parade.

516
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,040
Then, using his grace as a gimmick,

517
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,950
we will create an opportunity

518
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,310
for his followers
to interact closely with him.

519
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,190
What do you think?

520
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,950
Won't everyone flock to it?

521
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,950
Well…

522
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,520
The person I'm talking about

523
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,430
is our Young Master Zhuo.

524
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,040
Me?

525
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,880
Young Master Zhuo of Silver Rain Terrace

526
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,070
is handsome and stylish.

527
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,880
No one is better than you in Heyang.

528
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,430
Not to mention,

529
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,000
you were quite low-profile in the past,

530
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,640
rarely showing your true face.

531
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,350
If you show up in public this time,

532
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,880
you will take the city by storm.

533
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,110
Although this sounds a bit awkward,

534
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,760
since you have spoken,

535
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,710
I shall

536
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,760
give it my all this time.

537
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,110
If Young Master Zhuo
is willing to show his face,

538
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,110
it will cause quite a commotion, won't it?

539
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,110
I do not deny that Young Master Zhuo
is brave and unparalleled.

540
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,040
It's a pity that there are rumors
in Heyang saying

541
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,430
that the Silver Rain Terrace Young Master
is bloodthirsty and murderous.

542
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,950
Using him as a gimmick

543
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,920
might be counterproductive.

544
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,950
What you say seems to make sense, sir.

545
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,590
But in such a short period,

546
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,520
where can we find

547
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,230
another man more attractive
than Young Master Zhuo?

548
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,950
I'm such a fool.

549
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,470
Our Mr. Pan is here!

550
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,680
Mr. Pan is indeed famous

551
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,190
and followed by many.

552
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,880
However…

553
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,040
But

554
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,680
Mr. Pan isn't one for public appearances.

555
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,640
Won't this be a trouble

556
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,560
to Mr. Pan?

557
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,680
To investigate the case,

558
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,160
I am willing

559
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,680
to sacrifice a little.

560
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,310
That's great!

561
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,230
Sir, if you show up in person,

562
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,400
I'm sure the whole of Heyang
will attend the Festival.

563
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,160
Not only is he as stubborn
as when he was a kid,

564
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,110
but he is also as easily provoked as ever.

565
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Surprisingly, Mr. Pan

566
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,680
cares about these vain titles.

567
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,880
Don't kid me, Young Master Zhuo.

568
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,710
I am doing this for the people.

569
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,590
While Mr. Pan is strategizing,

570
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,280
Young Master Zhuo organizes the plans.

571
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,110
This time, we will surely capture
the culprit and solve the case.

572
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,920
Capture the culprit and solve the case!

573
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,940
[Notice]

574
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,350
Let's go.

575
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,760
What's written on it?

576
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,640
The evil wyvern wreaked havoc in Heyang,
injuring countless people.

577
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,520
The Silver Rain Terrace
has captured the evil wyvern.

578
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,590
It was burned and ascended to heaven
at Dongguan Altar.

579
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,160
After discussion, the county yamen

580
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,560
decided to reopen the Lantern Festival
with Silver Rain Terrace

581
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,920
to entertain the people.

582
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
To share the joy with people,

583
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,400
the Lantern Festival
will include a float parade,

584
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,070
festive colored ball tossing,
and other activities.

585
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,830
The winner of the jackpot

586
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,190
will have the opportunity
to join hands with Mr. Pan

587
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,760
- to light up the sky lanterns together
- Mr. Pan.

588
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,350
and pray for Heyang.

589
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
The county yamen is going
to reopen the Lantern Festival.

590
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,470
Mr. Pan will be on the float parade
and tossing festive colored balls.

591
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,230
The Lantern Festival has reopened.

592
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,160
It's time for you to show off your skills.

593
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,830
Gu Shan.

594
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,310
Send this order.

595
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,630
Make sure
this Lantern Festival is exciting.

596
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,630
We must not let Pan Yue look down on us.

597
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,190
Yes, Young Master.

598
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,950
Young Master.

599
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,080
Young Master, something happened.

600
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,150
Someone is using your name

601
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,390
to cheat in the Ghost Market.

602
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,630
They conned a lot of money.

603
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,430
Really?

604
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,280
Fu, go to Ghost Market.

605
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,950
I'd like to see

606
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,630
who is so daring.

607
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,000
Young Master Zhuo, what a coincidence.

608
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,560
I didn't expect you to be free enough
to visit Ghost Market.

609
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,710
If I hadn't,

610
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,040
some little liar

611
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,320
would have been the king and ruler
in Ghost Market, right?

612
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,840
Who is so bold?

613
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,950
Tell me, and I will take care of him.

614
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,520
The sword I gave you

615
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,560
is not for you to pretend to be me.

616
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
It hurts.

617
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,390
I'm not pretending to be you. I am...

618
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,840
upholding justice in your name.

619
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,710
Does bluffing

620
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,840
make you just?

621
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,840
What do you know?

622
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,360
These are all my own things.

623
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,120
They were the ones bullying others.

624
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,950
They took away the savings
I had accumulated for a long time.

625
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,190
I'm just getting back my own belongings.

626
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,520
For real?

627
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,670
Yeah.

628
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,040
Didn't Caiwei say

629
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,950
that we are friends?

630
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,150
Friends don't lie to friends, right?

631
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,910
What are you doing?

632
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,080
Somebody is coming.

633
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,470
How do you know?

634
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,150
I have been hiding here and there
since I was a kid.

635
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,800
If I'm good at only one thing,
it's my hearing.

636
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,320
No way.

637
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,950
I was just getting my belongings back.

638
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,950
It's just a few ingots of silver.

639
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,910
There's no need to send an army, right?

640
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,150
Right?

641
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,470
From their footsteps,

642
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,760
they're very skilled.

643
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,190
I don't think they're here
to look for you.

644
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,360
Are they here to look for you?

645
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,520
Then,

646
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,670
I shan't get in the way
of your friendly competition.

647
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,800
Zhuo Lanjiang.

648
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,280
My sword.

649
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,230
What?

650
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,150
My sword.

651
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,280
Sword.

652
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,950
Catch.

653
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,470
Let's go.

654
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,910
Go!

655
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,040
Go!

656
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,150
Young Master.

657
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,520
