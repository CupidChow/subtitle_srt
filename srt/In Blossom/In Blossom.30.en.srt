196

Mr. Pan, if you don't get out of here,

214

we're going to have to
do something about it.

So it's Mr. Pan.

I do admire Pan Yue,

323
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,110
but Pan Yue never gave me any promise.

324
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,230

00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,400

The wound on the princess' chest

352
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,040
was a self-inflicted wound
with a dagger in her right hand.

353
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,110
The angle was from top to bottom,

354
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,160
so the wound should be narrow
on the left and wide on the right.

355
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,680
An autopsy

356
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,070

caused by multiple stabbings.

361
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,230
Is this not an act of venting anger?

362
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,880
The body must have been tampered with

363
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,830
to cover up the suicide

364
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,800

the wound would be broad,

would be visible in all areas.

374
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,860
But if a victim was stabbed after death,

375
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,610
the blood wouldn't stain the skin,
and the flesh would be dry and white.

376
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,710
If we can open the coffin
and examine the body,

377
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,280
we can prove

378
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,760
that the princess committed suicide.

379
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,760
The other stab wounds

380
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,520
were made after the death
of the princess

381
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,940
by someone who wanted to frame me.

382
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,280
Fellow officials,

383
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,040
there's more to this case
than meets the eye.

384
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,230
Should I go ahead with the judgment
in spite of the truth,

385
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,950
or should I set a new date
for the trial?

386
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,950
Mr. Pan,

387
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,680
you've gone to great lengths

388
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,590
to get Shangguan Zhi off the hook.

389
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,560
I dare not.

390
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,880
I just don't want to let you down.

391
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,310
Report.

392
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,190
Fellow officials,

393
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,310
there's a man outside

394
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,110
saying he's a witness
to the murder of the princess.

395
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,560
He asks to be summoned to the court.

396
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,920
He can prove
Shangguan Zhi's evil intentions

397
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,920
and conspiracy.

398
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,110
The only witness in Fengya Garden

399
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,800
is Sima Xuan.

400
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,400
How can there be other witnesses?
Deny him.

401
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,680
Let him in!

402
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,560
Yes.

403
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,640
Shangguan Lan,

404
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,000
what are you trying to do here?

405
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,110
Mr. Pan,

406
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,640
this person is not Shangguan Zhi.

407
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,280
She's Yang Caiwei, the undertaker
of Coffin House in Heyang.

408
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,430
The real Shangguan Zhi

409
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,950
was killed by her long ago.

410
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,040
Ling...

411
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,430
Yang Caiwei?

412
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,230
Isn't it the daughter of Yang Ji'an

413
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,590
that Mr. Pan married in Heyang
a few months ago?

414
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,000
Yang Caiwei,

415
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,760
you killed my sister

416
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,730
and used witchcraft

417
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,040
to disguise yourself as her.

418
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,830
Do you admit to this?

419
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,040
I'm a fake indeed,

420
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,800
but it's for some reason,
and I don't mean any harm.

421
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,640
Tell me.

422
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,430
Why did you kill my sister

423
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,350
and disguise yourself as her
to sneak into the capital

424
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,590
and into my house?

425
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,160
What was your plan?

426
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,040
Mr. Shangguan,

427
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,350
I...

428
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,190
I knew you wouldn't be able
to defend yourself.

429
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,640
In that case,

430
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,520
I want a life for a life!

431
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,310
- What's wrong?
- What's going on?

432
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,640
What's this?

433
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,590
The incident at Qixia Ridge

434
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,110
was due to the spouse.

435
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,250
I can't see it.

436
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,090
Is everything all right?

437
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:03,990
I'm curious.

438
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,200
Can someone tell me about it?

439
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,600
We can't let her die.
Summon the imperial physician!

440
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,080
She's lost so much blood.

441
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,470
I'm afraid it's too late
to summon the imperial physician.

442
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,840
Send her to the Imperial Medical Office
now. Quick!

443
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,840
Guards, watch out
for them taking the offender!

444
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,230
Do it now!

445
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,870
Darling, back off.

446
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,800
Leave now.

447
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,190
Retreat!

448
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,910
Don't let them get away!

449
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,460
[Honor and Justice]

450
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,870
The flagpole's down. Run!

451
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,520
Run!

452
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,950
Let's go.

453
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,900
Mr. Pan,

454
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,420
[16 hours ago]

455
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,100
why did you
provoke Grand Commandant Jia just now?

456
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,020
He put you
in charge of Miss Yang's trial

457
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,980
because he knew you wouldn't calm down

458
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,140
and wanted to drag you down.

459
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,940
Neither the cell
nor the execution ground

460
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,940
allows me a chance to save Caiwei.

461
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,740
The only opportunity for me
to take action

462
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,100
is to have her tried in public

463
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,460
and let Jia Quan make fun of me

464
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,780
and lose his guard.

465
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,020
I see.

466
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,300
Well, Mr. Pan,

467
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,220
what are you going to do?

468
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,260
Ze,

469
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,300
I need a group of martial arts talents.

470
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,300
Go and...

471
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,260
Pan Yue,

472
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,580
we've known each other for ages.

473
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,260
I believe everything you say.

474
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,780
Jia Quan killed Zhi.

475
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,220
No matter what,

476
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,500
we must do everything we can

477
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,420
to bring him down.

478
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,260
Not only me,

479
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,580
but also my followers

480
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,060
are at your disposal.

481
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,820
Two centimeters to the lower left
of the Shenque acupoint.

482
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,340
Causing chaos with a stabbing
to give you a chance to live.

483
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,580
In that case,

484
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,900
I want a life for a life!

485
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,660
I bought some medicine from outside.

486
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,620
There are six packets in total.

487
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,900
Decoct it for Caiwei.

488
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,820
Okay.

489
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,220
Caiwei, you're awake.

490
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,300
Young Lady.

491
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,420
Be careful.

492
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,980
What is this place?

493
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,580
This was originally
the courtesans' residence.

494
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,300
Ze has investigated

495
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,820
and all the people from Shiluo Garden
have left.

496
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,740
They won't guess

497
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,820
we are hiding here.

498
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,700
Where's Pan Yue?

499
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,580
He's fine.

500
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,820
He's a bit injured.

501
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,140
Ze is treating his wound,
so don't worry.

502
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,060
Let's go.

503
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,780
How are you doing?

504
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,300
Are you okay?

505
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,140
I'm fine.

506
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,220
If my vital organs are hurt,

507
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,940
I won't even have the strength
to talk to you.

508
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,140
I just didn't expect you

509
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,100
to remember that.

510
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,220
Two centimeters to the lower left
of the Shenque acupoint.

511
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,780
Fortunately, I was stabbed here.

512
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,660
As long as it's treated in time,

513
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,860
you won't die.

514
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,420
Otherwise, I can't see you again.

515
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,860
I remember everything

516
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,300
about you.

517
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,540
We have the same scar now.

518
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,820
Where is Mr. Shangguan?

519
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,860
He has left the capital

520
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,820
to let things subside.

521
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,740
I owe him

522
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,300
a favor for this.

523
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,660
We've got too many
people involved this time.

524
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,460
We must bring down Jia Quan
as soon as possible,

525
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,180
or they'll all be implicated.
