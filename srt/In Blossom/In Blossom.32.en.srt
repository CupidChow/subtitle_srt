00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,200
Ten years ago,

186
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,960
my father received
a whistleblowing letter

187
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,320
reporting an enemy spy in the court.

188
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,710
My father was killed

189
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,120
for investigating this matter.

190
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,470
I've been living in obscurity in Heyang

191
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,960
for the past ten years.

192
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,800
When Pan Yue sought me for marriage,

193
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,110
the enemy spy sent someone
to assassinate me.

194
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,880
However, they accidentally

195
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,960
killed Shangguan Zhi,
who was impersonating me.

196
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,470
Pan Yue and I investigated and found out

197
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,110
that the enemy spy
established an influence

198
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,080
to smuggle halite into Heyang.

[Maintaining the Peace]

200

He joined hands
with the brothel, Shiluo Garden,

201
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,800
for the exchange of power and sex.

202
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
[Custom Clearance Document]
They got the Custom Clearance Document

203
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,670
to smuggle halite to the Northwest

204
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,870
and sell it at a low price,

205
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,230
causing the Northwestern army
to have no pay.

206
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,400
That triggered a mutiny.

207
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,550
He ultimately framed General Lu with it.

208
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,080
And the ultimate beneficiary of all this

209
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,720
is Jia Quan.

210
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,720
He took the opportunity
to seize the military power

211
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,420
to make it easy for the Jiang clan

212
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,970
to invade.

213
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,350
How eloquent you are.

214
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,230
You're full of righteousness.

215
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,200
Pan Yue,

216
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,280
you just heard the words "Qixia Ridge"

217
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,030
from the princess,

218
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,430
and you made up

219
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,200
such an outrageous story.

220
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,400
I know

221
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,360
you're still in love

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,230
with Miss Yang.

223
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,550
You went to great lengths

224
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,400
to get her off the hook.

225
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,320
But I don't get it.

226
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,710
In Heyang,

227
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,200
you have the reputation
of being a great magistrate.

228
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,550
Why can't you distinguish
between right and wrong

229
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,550
for the sake of a witch?

230

Your Majesty,

231
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,910
they're blatantly slandering

233
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,080
They should be executed
according to the law.

Rules and discipline

please decree an immediate execution.

Mr. Sun, how do you know
I have no evidence?

Do you really think

239
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,640
you've destroyed all the evidence?

240
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,840

My name is Yunchang.

I am a performer at Shiluo Garden.

247
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,080
I am also the one

248
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,840
who wrote the whistleblowing letter
to Mr. Yang.

249
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,670
Ten years ago,

250
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,000
it was the first time I met Jia Quan.

[Secret Letter]

252
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,150
Why did you come back here?

253
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,320
We've got

254
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,280
the letter of the spy official
in communication with the enemy.

255
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,030
Besides...

256
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,350
Besides, he's very powerful in Heyang.

257
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,000
When we were discovered,

258
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,150
we were afraid we'd be silenced,

259
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,840
so we had to run away at night

260
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,440
to talk to you about what to do.

261
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,760
I knew Jia Quan wouldn't let us go,

262
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,720
so I wrote to Mr. Yang,

263
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,650
hoping he'd bring Jia Quan down.

264
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,880
But not long after,

265
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,110
we heard the news
that Mr. Yang had been demoted

266
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,460
and killed on his way to exile.

267
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,400
That's when we realized

268
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,280
how powerful this man is.

269
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,160
He has absolute authority.

270
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,720
We'd been living in seclusion in Heyang
ever since.

271
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,760
But soon after,

272
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,110
Jia Quan found out where we were

273
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,550
and sent his men to kill us.

274
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,840
In order to protect myself,

275
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,220
I teamed up

276
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,520
with Grand Commandant Jia's henchman,
Zuo Jingfei,

277
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,590

We killed three of my friends

281
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,230
and faked my own corpse

282
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,310

But how do I know

304
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,280
you didn't

305
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,710
forge this letter?

306
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,430
A letter can be forged

307
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,230
but not a fingerprint.

308
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,310
We can verify it by comparing it
with Grand Commandant Jia's fingerprint.

309
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,350
I'm an important official
of the country.

310
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,680
I can't let you, a suspect,

311
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,400
examine and humiliate me
with just a few accusations.

312
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,830
What do you think are the rules
and order of the country?

313
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,040
We'll find out

314
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,640
if it's a fabrication

315
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,400
once we verify it.

316
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,710
Grand Commandant Jia, you can't do it

317
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,560
or you dare not do it?

318
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,680
You...

319
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,640

00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,040
just take off your gloves.

323
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,160

324
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,590
Yes.

His fingers are injured.

326
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,710
- What to do?
- Yeah. That's hard to say.

327
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,710
This can't be true, can it?

328
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,520
The day before, Grand Commandant Jia
was traveling with the Emperor,

329
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,110
and the young Crown Prince
was almost run over by a carriage.

330
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,830
Grand Commandant Jia's fingers
were run over by the carriage

331
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,430
to save the Crown Prince.

332
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,190
The fact that he was trying
to cover it up

333
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,710
shows that he is guilty of something.

334
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,430
Please judge it wisely, Your Majesty.

335
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,750
Your Majesty.

336
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,310
Give a dog a bad name, then hang him.

337
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,470
Pan Yue must have known
about my injury in advance,

338
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,280
so he made up a letter of accusation

339
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,110
that I couldn't prove it wrong.

340
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,230
I have been an official
for more than ten years.

341
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,190
I dare not say
that I have made great achievements,

342
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,230
but I do believe I always

343
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,070
do my best and I have never
done anything wrong.

344
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,760
I can't prove what I haven't done.

345
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,110
If Your Majesty or any of the officials

346
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,190
still have any doubts,

347
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,800
I ask to be demoted

348
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,640
to the status of a commoner from today.

349
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,470
Please fulfill my request, Your Majesty.

350
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,950
You saved the Crown Prince's life.

351
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,590
How could I suspect you?

352
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,640
Help him up already.

353
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,560

if there's no more evidence,

356
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,590
you'll be punished as a false accuser.

Caiwei,

379
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,680
Jiang left a last message

380
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,760
saying he wanted to return
to the side of his once best friend.

381
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,040
I think he was trying to pass on
some kind of clue to you.

382
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,690
He must have tried to tell us something.

383
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,640
I'll let you have the ledger

384
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,920
before the seal-giving ceremony.

385
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
After we bring down Jia Quan,

386
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,830
let's go back to Heyang

387
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,470
with Xiaosheng.

388
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,800
Does it have anything to do
with the ledger?

389
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,070
There's nothing on him.

390
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,830
Is the key piece of evidence
you're talking about

391
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,280
a dead man?

392
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,040
Your Majesty, the dead can talk.

393
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,390
Please allow me to perform an autopsy.

394
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,560
What an outrageous request.

395
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Your Majesty.

396
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,070
Pan Yue and Yang Caiwei

397
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,520
haven't produced

398
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,160
a single piece
of substantial evidence so far.

399
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,310
And now they want to

400
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,920
desecrate an imperial ceremony

401
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,760
with an unknown corpse.

402
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,710
It's a sinister intention.

403
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,920
Yes, it's improper to conduct an autopsy
at a ceremony.

404
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,710
Exactly. That's inappropriate.

405
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,590
Indeed.

406
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,640
Your Majesty,

407
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,560
what Pan Yue and Yang Caiwei
said just now

408
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,230
is really appalling.

409
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,590
I worked with Yang Ji'an for many years,

410
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,230
and I know he was upright.

411
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,880
Nevertheless,

412
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,880
he died in mysterious circumstances.

413
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,230
This has always been a concern to me.

414
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,470
Now the new case has not been solved

415
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,040
and the old case has been reopened.

416
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,350
Your Majesty,

417
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,560
please give them another chance

418
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,470
so that no truly loyal official

419
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,430
will be wronged and be left
with no peace.

420
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:43,920
Mr. Liu.

421
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,230
Since Mr. Liu has said so,

422
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,880
it's fine, then.

423
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,520
I shall give you another chance.

424
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,400
No strange objects in the abdomen.

425
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,560
It's

426
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,110
called "Peace
in four cardinal directions".

427
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,560
My mother taught me this.

428
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,400
She said this will

429
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,830
keep me safe when I'm out there.

430
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,160
This way, you'll be safe

431
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,830
when you fight with others.

432
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,470
What have you found?

433
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,560
The wounds on Jiang's body

434
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,830
were all from whips and beatings.

435
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,950
But you can see
that these three stab wounds

436
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
look like they were inflicted
by a sharp instrument.

437
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,880
And the force was applied evenly.

438
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,760
If someone else had done the stabbings,

439
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,640
he would have avoided them
because of the pain.

440
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,520
They wouldn't be in that fine order.

441
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,590
So you're saying

442
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,350
that Jiang did all the stabbings
himself?

443
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,020
Yes.

444
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,310
But what was he trying to tell us

445
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,920
by stabbing himself?

446
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,110
Up here is the Yutang acupoint,

447
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,160
and down here is the Jianli acupoint.

448
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,190
The left Qimen acupoint is injured,

449
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,830
but the symmetrical Qimen acupoint
on the right is not.

450
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,170
The Qimen acupoint

451
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,350
is the uppermost point
of the liver meridian.

452
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,990
According to Huangdi Neijing,

453
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,160
the oriental green color
goes to the liver,

454
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,740
which is similar to grass and trees.

455
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,880
Could what he's trying to tell us

456
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,710
have anything to do with this?

457
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,800
Jiang must have been exposed
when he was looking for the ledger.

458
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,220
Oriental.

459
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,360
The green wood.

460
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,110
Could it mean where the ledger is kept?

461
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,750
That's possible.

462
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,530
Pan Yue, what have you found?

463
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,400
Your Majesty,

464
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,040
through the autopsy,

465
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,110
I suspect

466
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,830
that the ledger on the halite smuggling

467
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,710
is in one of the eastern rooms
of Grand Commandant's Residence.

468
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,280
Please allow me to lead a search.

469
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,350
Your Majesty.

470
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,190
Your Majesty.

471
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,400
It's a matter of country justice

472
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,040
and life and death.

473
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,190
It's better to be careful.

474
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,920
If my husband

475
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,680
is truly innocent,

476
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,920
I hope he can clear his name in public.

477
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,680
Eunuch Gao.

478
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,350
Yes.

479
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,800
Go with him.

480
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,110
If he can't provide evidence

481
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,280
before the incense burns out,

482
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,710
he will be executed.

483
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,190
Oh, no.

484
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,990
Pan Yue hasn't come back yet.

485
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,230
Time's almost up.

486
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,440
Green color.

487
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,070
Green color.

488
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,190
Green color.

489
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,070
It's this room.

490
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,950
Time's up.

491
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,800
Yue...

492
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,760
He checked everywhere and found nothing.

493
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,230
Take them down.

494
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,560
No one is allowed to ask for mercy.

495
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,950
I'm sorry to have made you suffer

496
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,730
for clearing up your suspicions,
Grand Commandant.

497
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,440
Your Majesty, I don't mind.

498
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,470
Loyalists uphold the highest regard
for justice.

499
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,560
As long as the truth is found,

500
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,680
it's okay for me to suffer a little.

501
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,440
Pan Yue

502
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,880
started a rumor and slander in public.

503
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,070
I'll let you decide

504
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,520
what to do about him, Grand Commandant.

505
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,400
Yes.

506
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,760
Pan Yue,

507
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,160
you've disregarded the Emperor's grace,
let the princess down,

508
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,680
and committed a great crime.

509
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,350
And you still won't repent.

510
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,190
Now,

511
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,040
I can only punish you to death

512
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,160
as a warning to others.

513
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,590
You and I both know

514
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,590
you're the one who deserves to die.

515
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,230
So what?

516
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,230
The winner takes all.

517
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,760
And now the victory has been determined.

518
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,520
It's not certain who's going to win.

519
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,520
You're right.

520
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,350
The winner takes all.

521
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,160
The victory has been determined.

522
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,190
The green wood.

523
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,230
Your Majesty.

524
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,190
A search of the study yielded nothing.

525
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,860
[Found evidence against Jia Quan,
don't alert him yet]

526
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,070
The evidence of Jia Quan's complicity
with the enemy is solid.

527
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,190
Jia Quan, what can you say about

528
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,760
your disregard for the Emperor's grace?

529
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,710
Pan Yue,

530
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,640
you're smart indeed.

531
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,640
But

532
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,640
do you think
I don't have a way to escape?

533
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,590
This...

534
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,750
What... What's with all these people?

535
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,790
Jia Quan, how dare you rebel?

536
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,510
Why not?

537
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,270
Darling!

538
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,260
Whether I rebel or not,

539
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,440
I'll die still.

540
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,250
It's not a bad thing
that I have so many honorable people

541
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,580
to die with me.

542
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,550
Grand Commandant Jia, you...

543
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,420
Let me go.

544
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,640
Or everyone will die.

545
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,590
Pan Yue!

546
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,720
Mr. Pan.

547
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,900
[Ledger]

548
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,550
Thanks to Mr. Pan's foresight,

549
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,550
he found the ledger

550
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,720
and sent someone to get help.

551
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,000
