The Grand Marshal?

187
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,390
He is one of the three
highest-ranking officials.

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,860
How could he be a spy of the Jiang clan?

189
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,090
I am also very surprised.

190
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,390
General Lu has a good reputation.

repelling the Jiang clan several times?

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,920
is not that simple.

Yes, there are.

for the Northwestern soldiers

are supplied from local salt taxes.

However, in recent years,

284
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,730
illegal salt from the Jiang clan

285
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,300
has been flooding the market.

286
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,870
Illegal salt is cheap,

287
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,140
leading to low prices for official salt

288
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,150
and difficulties
in collecting salt taxes.

accusing the commanding officer
of embezzlement.

292

The commanding officer then sent troops
to suppress the chaos.

294

366
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,800
and a few good words from her
in front of the Emperor,

367
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,150
he will definitely stand out.

368
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,670
Grand Commandant Jia
must have used Mrs. Jia

369
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,880
in pushing the wedding forward.

370
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,640
The Princess went to look for the records
at the Grand Commandant's Residence.

371
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,880
If Grand Commandant Jia catches her,

372
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,310
she will be in danger.

373
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,640
It's almost time to meet her.

374
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,120
I wonder if she's still
at the Grand Commandant's Residence.

375
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,640
You go to Fengya Garden first. I'll go
to the Grand Commandant's Residence.

376

377

Okay.

No... No.

379
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,670
I didn't find the name.

380
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,310

384
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,760
how gentle and beautiful she is.

385
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,240
I must have done something great
in my past life

386
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,070
to have been able to marry her.

387
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,760
If you don't want your sister

388

to end up like your parents,

389
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,670
you'd better behave and listen to me.

390
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,120
From the beginning,

391
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,480
was it a conspiracy

392
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,120
that you married my sister?

393
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,360
Twelve years ago,

394
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,190
I killed your parents with my own hands.

395
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,360
But

396
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,720
I spared both of you.

397
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,670
Although your sister
has had a leg problem since then,

398
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,270
she married me.

399
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,790
Consider this as repaying my mercy
for not killing her.

400
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,720
This is such a wonderful thing.

401
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,550
How could you call it a conspiracy?

402
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,720
If you dare harm me and my sister,

403
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,760
Her Majesty will never let you off!

404
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,640
I have thousands of ways
to explain to the Empress.

405

As long as I make it
look like an accident,

406
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,880
nobody will suspect me

407
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,000
since I have always been
a loving husband.

408
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,600
My sister knows nothing.

409

I beg you to spare her.

I don't want to be so ruthless.

but some trivial matter
regarding the wedding.

548
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,310
This child is so fair and tender.

549
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,160
He is sure blessed.

550
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,840
Of course I must give him a nice name.

551
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,470
Let's name him

552
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,360
Pan Yue.

553
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,710
What do you think?

554
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,880
He is my firstborn.

555
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,880
I hope our ancestors

556
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,440
will give him their blessings

557
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,880
and grant him a lifetime
of peace and joy.

558
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,680
Yue.

559
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,200
- Yue.
- Yue.

560
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,590
Master,

561
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,520
the teacher told me earlier

562
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,390
that Young Master's essay
is very well written.

563
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,870
He complimented it well.

564
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,200
He called him

565
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,830
a child with splendid future prospects

566
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,630
who will grow up to be
a brilliant young man.

567
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,390
Young Master has been waiting here

568
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,630
for you to read his essay.

569
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,790
When I was at the Pan Mansion
delivering things today,

570
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,720
I saw Mr. Pan's son.
He is really handsome.

571
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,440
He looks nothing like his father.

572
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,830
I heard from the servants
at the Pan Mansion.

573
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,870
They don't even know

574
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,110
if he is really Mr. Pan's son.

575
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,230
Got it.

576
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
Master!

577
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,440
Something bad happened! Madam is...

578
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,000
Madam!

579
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,150
Madam!

580
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,590
Madam.

581
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,240
Madam...

582
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,790
Mother!

583
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,960
The rumors hurt,
and only death can prove my innocence.

584
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,920
Our child is innocent.
Please take good care of him.

585
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,480
If I won't let you see her,

586
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,630
are you really planning to kneel
until you die?

587
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,720
This is the only thing I can do.

588
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,630
If the father and the son fight,

589
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,870
the family is not harmonious.

590
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,240
What is the meaning of me being prudent?

591
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,480
If your deceased mother knew about this,

592
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,390
she would blame me.

593
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,280
Get up.
