[Episode 21]

19
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,980
[One year ago]

20
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,080
You...

21
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,400
What happened to you?

22
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,960
What's wrong?

23
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,750
When I went to the toilet just now,

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,630
I saw Mr. Chen.

25
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,000
He went to the back mountain

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,030
while holding an unlit lantern.

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,830
I found it strange,

28
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,720
so I followed him.

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
What did you see?

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,910
The water temple
at the foot of the mountain.

31
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,720
There were a dozen ghost ships.

32
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,750
Quietly.

33
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,030
There was no sound of water.

34
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,630
On the bow of each ship,

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,270
stood a ghostly shadow.

36
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,520
All of a sudden,

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,270
the lanterns on the bows lit up at once.

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,110
There were ripple patterns
on the lanterns.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,270
Mr... Mr. Chen's lantern also lit up,

40
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,550
having the same pattern.

41
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,910
I accidentally made a noise.

42
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,470
Then, someone discovered me.

43
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,670
So I ran away quickly.

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,670
Did you see it wrong?

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,830
How could there be ships
at the back mountain?

46
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,830
I saw it wrong?

47
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,720
Yes.

48
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,440
You must have seen it wrong.

49
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,470
You were dazzled.

50
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Take a rest.

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,190
Here, take off your shoes.

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,360
Be careful.

53
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,440
Did I really see it wrong?

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,520
You've been studying all night lately.

55
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,440
You must be too tired.

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,520
Miao Zhuang.

57
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,720
Miao Zhuang, are you feeling better?

58
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,750
Miao Zhuang.

59
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,800
"Miao Zhuang
had always been in good health.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,880
How could he die suddenly for no reason?

61
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,750
I thought
there was something fishy about this.

62
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,440
But I dared not tell others

63
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,600
what Miao Zhuang said.

64
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,670
I had to get a coroner
to conduct an autopsy secretly."

65
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,720
This...

66
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,410
Where is Miao Zhuang?

67
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,640
I hired someone to conduct an autopsy.

68
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,040
Miao Zhuang was infected
with the plague.

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,920
We can't keep his body.

70
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,350
He has been incinerated.

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,160
What?

72
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,200
This...

73
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,320
Mr. Chen, this is a human life.

74
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,500
How could you
simply conclude this matter?

75
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
Shen Ci,

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,830
I know you and Miao Zhuang
came from the same place.

77
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,110
You have a strong bond with him.

78
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,110
There are so many people in the academy.

79
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,000
As the headmaster,

80
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,510
I have to be responsible
to others too, right?

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,320
"After that, I argued with Mr. Chen.

82
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Then, Chen Fu and others targeted me.

83
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,000
Since then,

84
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,670
they've taken pleasure in torturing me."

85
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,440
Anyway, Miao Zhuang

86
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,040
followed Mr. Chen to the back mountain.

87
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
So, I think Mr. Chen

88
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,270
must have something
to do with this matter.

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,040
The back mountain of Xinzheng Academy

90
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,160
is likely

91
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,040
a stronghold of the Ripple Organization.

92
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,040
That's why
they created the Ghost Forest

93
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,670
and used various mechanisms
to scare away others.

94
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,670
Miao Zhuang unintentionally

95
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,200
discovered their secret.

96
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,350
So, he was killed to prevent
their secrets from being exposed.

97
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,230
But what Miao Zhuang said
is completely unreasonable.

98
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,320
Do you think he really saw it,

99
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,600
or was it only his illusion?

100
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,040
It may sound like nonsense,

101
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,670
but every word he said
has a clear point.

102
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,230
Look.

103
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,000
Dozens of ghost ships
quietly approached.

104
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,880
This indicates
that their organization is huge.

105
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,880
The lanterns
on the bow of the ships were lit,

106
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,600
and so was the lantern
that Mr. Chen was holding.

107
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,760
This shows that they
are meticulous in their approach.

108
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,880
The lanterns

109
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,000
are their signal
to connect with each other.

110
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,640
What exactly is hidden on the ships

111
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,670
that requires such secrecy?

112
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,950
The water temple
at the foot of the mountain...

113
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,070
This back mountain seems to have

114
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,440
many places we don't know about.

115
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,830
Do you still remember

116
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,110
the day we went
to the Ghost Forest?

117
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,670
We did hear the sound of water.

118
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,390
Could it be an underground river?

119
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,040
According to Miao Zhuang's description,

120
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,200
the place he went to that night

121
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,320
should be nearby.

122
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,480
This is also
where you were taken last time.

123
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,670
Here it is.

124
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,320
Later, I'll go down first.

125
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,830
If there's no problem,

126
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,440
I'll signal you to come down
after three pulls.

127
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,040
Be careful.

128
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,600
The walls here show signs of repair.

129
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,040
Could it be that this entrance was dug?

130
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,320
This entrance

131
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,110
is likely used for ventilation.

132
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:02,720
Let's go inside.

133
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,230
Be careful.

134
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,790
The traces on the ground

135
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,910
were caused by the stacked items.

136
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,640
This place should have been
a warehouse before.

137
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,880
It seems

138
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,110
they figured out
that we found the back mountain,

139
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,200
so they urgently transported
the things here away.

140
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,640
Who's there?

141
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,080
What's wrong?

142
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,790
Do you think these are the bags
for transporting goods?

143
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,030
Take them back first
and study them later.

144
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,150
Okay.

145
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,880
Let's leave. Let's go.

146
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,470
Pan Yue.

147
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,440
Don't you like to overturn cases?

148
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,840
The Ghostly Fire Case
will add another death today.

149
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,880
Help!

150
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,670
Help!

151
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,670
Help!

152
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,230
Is there someone inside?

153
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,350
Wait.

154
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,910
I'll go.

155
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,470
It's Shen Yan's Huanming Bug.

156
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,080
How are you? Are you okay?

157
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,230
You were bitten.

158
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,640
I'm fine.

159
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,760
Let's leave first. Move.

160
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,670
Are you okay?

161
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,230
I'm okay.

162
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,200
There's something wrong with your eyes.

163
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,080
Don't worry.

164
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,440
Let's go back first.

165
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,200
Step back.

166
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,400
Be careful.

167
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,350
He can't see right now.

168
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,030
Watch out.

169
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,640
There's someone attacking
from three steps behind you!

170
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,790
Five from your right
and three from your left!

171
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,470
Ten steps from your left behind you!

172
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,790
Shangguan Zhi!

173
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,590
Shangguan Zhi!

174
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,200
Shangguan Zhi!

175
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,280
Shangguan Zhi!

176
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,000
Where are you?

177
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,350
Shangguan Zhi!

178
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,280
Where are you?

179
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,790
Why?

180
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,840
Why aren't you answering?

181
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,280
Could it be that she...

182
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,790
No.

183
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,000
It's impossible.

184
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,590
It won't happen. Don't scare me.

185
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,230
Yang Caiwei! Yang Caiwei!

186
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,030
Please speak! Yang Caiwei, come out!

187
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,880
Yang Caiwei!

my skirt hem
got into the river and got wet.

00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,470
So it means

608
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:46,840
that the things they stored in the cave

00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,230
were bags of salt.

00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:49,710
