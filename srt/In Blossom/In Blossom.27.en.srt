Mr. Pan, this house has no back door.

83
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,940
Sir,
I just asked the neighbor next door.

84
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,280
They said no one lives here.

85
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,170
- How about at night?
- I asked several families.

86
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,920
They all say this is an abandoned house.

87
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,280
No one has lived here for a long time.

88
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,350
This is bad.

89
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,790

91
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,760
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,080
Found it!

93
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,550
Well, look! I've never

94
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,470
worn such beautiful clothes in my life!

95
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,440
Yeah, look at this hairpin ring.

96
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,710
I bit it just now. It really is gold!

in the future.

Yes.

101
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,030
When Yunchang first came here,

102
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,840
she must have thought that she would be
wearing gold and jade in the future,

103
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,350
leading a life of wealth and honor.

104
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,150
Little did she know
that this magnificent Shiluo Garden

105
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,520
is actually a devil's cave
that devours people whole.

106
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,000
Stop there.

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,180

108
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,470
What are you doing here?

109
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,910
I... I want to relieve myself.

110
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,520
Shiluo Garden has its rules.

111
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,590
See what you should,

112
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,790
and don't see what you shouldn't.

113
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,760
Otherwise, you will be like her.

115
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,030
but also mute.

116
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,110
She looks pathetic now, right?

117
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,880
Ten years ago,

118
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,150
she was also the most popular girl
in Shiluo Garden.

119
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,550
Because she slapped the lead dancer,

120
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,350
she was punished by Mr. Zuo.

121
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,280
Finally,

122
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,110
she ended up like this.

123
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,710
Take a look at this sachet.

Come and take a look.

- Come and take a look at this sachet.
- Take a look at this paper umbrella.

128

Embroidered sachet.

129
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,760

131
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,960
Fill it already.

132
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,000
- Come on, sir. Let's drink.
- Come on.

133
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,280
I'll fill it for you.

134
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,760

135
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,280
Come on.

136
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,760
Beauty, come and have a drink.

137
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,880
Come on, drink.

138
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,790
This place is securely guarded.

139
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,520
Looks like there is no way
to send a message to Pan Yue.

140
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,440
I hope he can see the clues
I left behind

141
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,280
and find this place as soon as possible.

142
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,710
The guests in this room

143
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,440
are the most exalted
among our distinguished guests.

144
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,350
Perform well.

145
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,840
If something goes wrong,

146
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,230
even I can't protect you girls.

147
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,550
Yes, madam.

148
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,320
Mr. Zuo, Mr. He,

149
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,520
the girls are ready.

150
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,230
So he is the owner of Shiluo Garden.

151
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,110
Could he be the mastermind
behind the Ripple Organization?

152
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,470
Mr. Zuo,

153
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,640
we'll talk about those matters later.

154
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,030
Let's enjoy the dance now.

155
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,760
Sure.

156
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,550
Let's get started, girls.

157
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,760
Yes.

158
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,200
Good.

159
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,470
I heard that this dance
is Shiluo Garden's unique skill.

160
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,840
Sure enough, seeing it once is better
than hearing it a hundred times.

161
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,440
Thank you, Mr. Zuo.

162
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,710
Mr. He,

163
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,670
Shiluo Garden's sincerity to you

164
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,230
is not merely this dance.

165
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,320
You are asking me for a favor.

166
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,880
But until now,

167
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,760
I haven't even met your master
in person.

168
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,960
I don't know

169
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,150
who he is.

170
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,200
If an accident happens…

171
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,280
Don't worry, Mr. He.

172
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,080
The reason our master never showed up

173
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,710
is all for your safety.

174
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,760
If something happens in the future,

175
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,910
the investigations won't
find their way to you, Mr. He.

176
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,280
It seems like Mr. Zuo

177
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,520
is just the steward of Shiluo Garden.

178
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,550
There is another mastermind behind him.

179
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,590
Since you have said so, Mr. Zuo,

180
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,470
if I am to refuse again,

181
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,000
I might come off as disagreeable.

182
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,520
The thing you requested is here.

183
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,550
Thank you, Mr. He.

184
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,320
Madam Wan, serve Mr. He well.

185
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,230
Make sure Mr. He is satisfied.

186
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,030
Rest assured, Mr. Zuo.

187
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,880
It seems that the real purpose
of Shiluo Garden

188
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,790
is to collude with imperial officials

189
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,000
and do some shady businesses.

190
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,000
What exactly did Mr. He give to Mr. Zuo?

191
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,110
Zhi.

192
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,110
Madam.

193
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,440
Mr. He wanted you to serve him alone.

194
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,590
Hurry up and go in.

195
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,670
Come on.

196
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,590
A hat with seven pearl beads
inlaid on the top.

197
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,230
What? Do you want the guards
to search the streets now?

198
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,440
That's right.

199
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,030
If you search the streets now,
you will definitely alert the enemy.

200
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,910
The later we find her,

201
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,590
the more danger she would be in.

202
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,320
Okay, if your mind is set,

203
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,440
then do it.

204
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

205
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,490
Three pairs of pearl earrings,
a total of 12 beads.

206
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,280
A pair of gold bracelets.

207
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,960
A string of agate beads.

208
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Two strings of amber beads.

209
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,760
Mr. Sun.

210
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,470
The number of pearls on the gift list
seems to be wrong.

211
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,320
Who is there?

212
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,110
Your Highness!

213
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Are you okay, Your Highness?

214
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,430
I'm fine. Quickly, lead your men
to chase the assassin.

215
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,400
Mr. Sun, take care of Her Highness.

216
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,950
I will lead the imperial guards
to capture the assassin.

217
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,680
Yes.

218
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,920
Beauty, that dance you did just now

219
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,590
really took away my soul.

220
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,310
Sir, please have something to eat.

221
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,470
Mr. He.

222
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,430
The night is still young.

223
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,230
Why should you rush?

224
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,920
Why don't I play a drinking game
with you?

225
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,560
What kind of drinking game
do you want to play?

226
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,800
Why don't we play
guessing the hidden coin?

227
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,990
Sure.

228
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,310
Guess, which one?

229
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,440
Beauty, you guessed it right.

230
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,990
Mr. He, please drink.

231
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,190
It's your turn to drink this time.

232
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,400
Guess again.

233
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,640
Left side.

234
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,640
Impressive, beauty.

235
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,800
I'm just lucky. Drink up, Mr. He.

236
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,640
It's obvious
that whenever you are about to win,

237
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,760
you will slightly raise your eyebrow.

238
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,040
Come on, let's continue.

239
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,880
Mr. He, let me warm you
a few more pots of good wine.

240
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,680
How can I get in?

241
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,280
Go and warm some pots of good wine
for Mr. He.

242
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,310
Also,

243
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,830
Mr. He said he wanted something
to spice things up.

244
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,280
Yes.

245
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,520
Search every house!

246
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,440
Yes, sir!

247
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,350
Sir, let's continue.

248
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,310
Beauty, are you trying to get me drunk?

249
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,290
If you are afraid of losing
and don't want to play, just say so.

250
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,460
Why bother acting like a sore loser?

251
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,710
So what if I lose to a beauty?

252
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,560
Then let's have one game
to determine the outcome.

253
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,040
The loser has to down this pot.

254
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,300
Mr. He.

255
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,880
I want to ride a horse!

256
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,190
Sir! Are you okay, sir?

257
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,200
Go away!

258
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,480
Help!

259
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,920
- Sir!
- Somebody, help!

260
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,460
- Come quickly.
- Hurry, something happened to Mr. He.

261
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,280
- Hurry up, he is an important guest!
- Sir!

262
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,080
If something goes wrong with him,

263
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,640
we can't afford it!

264
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,440
Be careful, Mr. He.

265
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,520
Mr. He!

266
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,830
It turns out that the pattern
painted on the token

267
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,310
is not a water ripple at all.

268
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,560
It's just a part
of this ram horn totem.

269
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:51,310
Water... Water ripples are...

270
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,310
Yang...

271
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,130
Yang.

272
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,400
So, the "Yang" mentioned by Gu Yong
before he died

273
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,070
is not the surname Yang,

274
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,190
but referring to the rams.

[Custom Clearance Document]

276

[Salt Distribution Commandant,
He Hongyi, to govern the prisons.]

277
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,710
Customs clearance document?

278
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,640
Salt Distribution Commandant?

279
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,280
Could this be related to the salt

280
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,190
in the back mountains
of Xinzheng Academy?

281
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,230
Yang Caiwei, please be safe.

282
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,630
It is such
a huge underground pleasure house.

283
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,520
If it is really hidden
among the streets,

284
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,400
there must be some differences.

285
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,400
I can definitely find it.

286
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,760
I can find it for sure.

287
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,040
Keep searching.

288
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,800
Yes, sir.

289
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,710
May my god hear my call.

290

Darkness, cover me.

291

Darkness, give me godly power.

292
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,070
May the shadow of darkness
spread throughout the world.

293
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,350
May your lives
be swallowed up by darkness.

294
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,040
Master.

295
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,950
What is it?

296
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,880
Mr. He went crazy after drinking.

297
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,640
He is awake now.

298
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,990
Mr. He said

299
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,310
it was a new courtesan

300
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,640
who secretly put

301
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,190
excessive five minerals powder
in his wine.

302
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,590
I'm afraid an outsider
might have sneaked in.

Kill her.

304
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,590
Yes.

306

I'm sorry, sir.

00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
There's a thief in Shiluo Garden today.

313

Hurry up.

314
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,640
How disappointing.

- Sir, please don't be angry.
- We'll send you back.

- Yes, sir.

Nothing here either.

Nothing. Go there and have a look.

to break in here.

00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,590
Shangguan Zhi.

373
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,350
Think it over before you speak.

374
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,590
Do you want Shangguan Zhi

375
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,190
or Yang Ji'an's daughter,

376
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,640
Yang Caiwei?

377
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,520
How did you know?

378
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,680
Put down your sword
before talking to your father.

379
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,230
That day, I went to see you

380
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,110
to talk about the marriage.

381
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,800
However, I saw

382
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,990
you with her.

383
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,420
Caiwei.

384
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,830
It's good to have you here.

385
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,920
You kept calling her Caiwei

386
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,310
and talking about your childhood.

387
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,760
Recalling all the various incidents,

388
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,470
you never liked Shangguan Zhi.

389
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,280
How could you suddenly
fall in love with her?

390
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,830
Although I don't know what happened,

391
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,160
I guess

392
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,590
Yang Caiwei didn't die.

393
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,700
She's disguised
as Shangguan Zhi instead.

394
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,160
Moreover,

395
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,630
she's even investigating
Yang Ji'an's old case with you.

396
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,040
Am I right?

397
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,990
Yang Ji'an's family
was murdered back then.

398
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,150
As his friend,
you watched from the sidelines

399
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,110
without doing anything about it.

400
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,030
To this day,

401
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,720
do you still want
to be their accomplice?

402
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,680
Not sparing even Yang Ji'an's daughter?

403
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,960
Am I so despicable in your eyes?

404
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,560
If I were an accomplice,

405
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,110
Yang Caiwei would have died
a hundred times.

406
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,560
Then, why did you show up
at the Shiluo Garden?

407
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,110
I was invited there by my colleagues.

408
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,320
I have no intention
of joining any party,

409
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,750
but I have to do things accordingly.

410
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,720
I took Yang Caiwei away

411
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,800
because I was afraid
that this would implicate the Pan family.

412
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,630
I can return her to you now,

413
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,440
but

414
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,200
you have to answer my question first.

415
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,630
You and Her Highness
are getting married soon.

416
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,200
Why do you still want to be with her?

417
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,150
This matter has progressed this far.

418
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,320
You're setting yourself on fire,
did you know that?

419
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,110
Do you want to end up like Yang Ji'an?

420
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,320
I only live once.

421
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,270
So what if I die?

422
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,150
You are deceiving the Emperor!

423
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:29,960
I know.

424
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,840
That's why, a few months ago,

425
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,720
I promised you

426
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,800
to sever my ties with the Pan family.

427
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,320
So what if you could find her?

428
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,870
That's my own business.

429
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,630
I won't bother you anymore.

430
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,320
Fine.

431
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,840
I'll tell you where she is,

432
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,960
but starting from today,

433
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,870
your ties with the Pan family

434
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
will be severed.

435
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,800
It's a deal.

436
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,110
Sever your ties?

437
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,440
Fine.

438
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,200
It's my fault.

439
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,870
I tried to become associated
with the imperial families

440
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,680
but ended up
getting into this muddy water.

441
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,320
But I don't understand.

442
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,680
Why is Her Highness willing
to destroy her reputation

443
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,080
to act in this show with you?

444
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,320
Not everyone is like you, Father.

445
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,750
You only care about yourself.

446
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,230
Men,

447
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,510
bring her out.

448
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,350
Caiwei.

449
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,390
How are you? Are you okay?

450
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:43,920
I'm okay.

451
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,680
Leave.

452
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,870
Remember.

453
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,800
I've never seen you two tonight.

454
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,030
Let's go.

455
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,940
Anyway,

456
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,660
we have to thank your father
for helping me this time.

457
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,830
I know.

458
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,520
I'm very grateful to him.

459
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,920
But it seems like I can never

460
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,480
talk properly with him.

461
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,240
What are you laughing at?

462
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,180
Thank you for your good luck.

463
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:02,970
Oh, right.

464
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,930
Did you find anything inside?

465
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,110
I entered a secluded room
in Shiluo Garden.

466
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,550
There was a tapestry inside.

467
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,650
The pattern on it
was exactly the same as the ripples.

468
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,140
When put together,
it looks like a ram horn.

469
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,040
So the pattern we have been searching for
was not ripples,

470
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,000
but ram horns.

471
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,830
Ram horns pattern.

472
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,310
Does their organization

473
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,010
worship rams?

474
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,150
Oh, right.

475
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,590
I saw a middle-aged man
who was worshiping.

476
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,680
I guess

477
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,440
he might be the mastermind
behind the Ripple Organization.

478
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,870
Did you see his face clearly?

479
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,520
The room was too dark,
so I couldn't see it clearly.

480
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,240
Middle-aged man.

481
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,070
Is it the one
with the slightly yellowish right eye?

482
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,720
That is the master of Shiluo Garden,
Mr. Zuo.

483
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,920
Shiluo Garden has secret ties
with the imperial officials.

484
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,150
He is the one handling everything
personally.

485
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,940
I saw him hosting
the Salt Distribution Commandant.

486
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,200
The official gave him
a customs clearance document.

487
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,960
Salt Distribution Commandant?

488
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,680
That batch of illegal salt
in the back hill of Xinzheng Academy

489
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,040
might have something to do with them.

490
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,630
I think so too.

491
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,520
The Salt Distribution Commandant's
customs clearance document

492
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,680
allows the bearer access anywhere.

493
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,760
But where is he going to ship

494
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,440
this batch of illegal salt to?

495
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,870
How long has Pan Yue been back
in the capital?

496
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,760
How did he find the Shiluo Garden?

497
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,720
Master, I checked

498
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,970
the guest list for Shiluo Garden today.

499
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,480
I found that Pan Jin was also on it.

500
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,870
Could Pan Jin

501
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,590
be working from within?

502
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,070
Pan Jin?

503
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,040
He has been pretending to be a coward
all his life.

504
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,040
Does he even have the balls to do so?

505
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,520
Master, what should we do now?

506
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,550
Send someone to investigate

507
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,830
and find out if Pan Jin
is involved in this matter.

508
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,150
Yes.

509
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,480
By the way,
the traitor has been eliminated.

510
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,630
This is the token I found at his house.

511
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,420
Zhuo Lanjiang

512
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,440
is more direct than his father.

513
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,440
I really need to think about

514
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,520
how to use him.
