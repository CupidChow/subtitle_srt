00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,680
you don't say half a tael isn't money?

377
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,640
Exactly.

378
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,680
You were very happy to take our money.

379
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,590
Right?

380
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,710
That's right!

381
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,590
You've cheated us out of money many times.

382
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,100
That's right!

383
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,740
- We've been waiting for so long.
- Don't think about backing out now.

384
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,400
Stop dragging it out.

385
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You said this half-chip isn't a chip.

386
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,190
Where's that rule from?

387
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,400
Show us.

388
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,800
Show us!

389
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,080
Yes, show us!

390
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,800
Hurry up and show us!

391
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,130
Take it out!

392
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,400
What kind of rule is this? It's all talk.

393
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,680
You don't seem to accept to lose.

394
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,950
I think you just want us to lose.

395
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,000
If you don't give it today,

396
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,430
I'll stay here and make a fuss.

397
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,560
That's right!

398
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:39,890
Give her the money! Give her the money!

399

Hurry up, so many people are waiting!

400
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,560
All right.

401
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,400
Give her the money!

402
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,800
Hurry up, stop dragging it out.

403
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,310
Calm down, everyone!

404
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,350
Calm down!

405
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,230
[Cash Counter, Chips Exchange]
Give her the money!

406
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,710
You...

407
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,760
We've achieved the goal.

408
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,350
If we continue,
it might cause unnecessary trouble.

409
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,640
Go.

410
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,000
Go!

411
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,920
Wait and see!

412
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,190
All right, come one by one.

413
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,190
Come one by one.

414
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,160
What did she find out?

415
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,920
All right, come one by one.

416

Come one by one.

418
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,190
There are so many butterflies.

419
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,920
Shangguan Zhi, are you crazy?

420
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,880
You're so annoying. I'm not Shangguan Zhi.

421
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
Why are you talking nonsense?

422
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,920
So hot.

423
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,280
Shangguan Zhi, wake up a bit.

424
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,400
Look at me. Wake up a bit.

425
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,350
Wait.

426
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,000
What's in this tea?

427
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,040
Five minerals powder and divine herbs.

428
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,470
This is the most popular drink
in the Life and Death House.

429
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,310
Are you feeling better now?

430
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,830
You mistakenly drank
five minerals powder and divine herbs.

431
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,640
Are you feeling better?

432
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,350
I'm fine.

433
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,070
Um...

00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,470
I'll go tidy up.

435
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,950
I told you that number two would win.

436

You didn't believe me, did you?

437
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,000
Number three was so robust.

438
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,000
Who would have thought that...

439
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,830
Shangguan Zhi!

440
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,230
Shangguan Zhi!

The second round
of the competition is starting.

442
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,680
Hand over the chips to me.

443
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,070
What did Jin Liulang tell you?

444
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,560
I don't know who Jin Liulang is.

445
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,640
I only trust dead people.

446
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,430
Shangguan Zhi!

447
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,590
Be careful!

448
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,000
Be careful!

449

Let's go!

450
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,590
What's going on?

451
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,350
Let's go, quick. Don't get involved.

452
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,680
How unlucky.
Such a thing actually happened.

453
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,590
Let's go.

454
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,540
This is unlucky.

455
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,110
What happened inside?

456
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,830
Someone was killed.
Mr. Cai's favorite concubine was killed.

457
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,040
Mr. Pan.

458
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,400
How's your injury?

459
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,310
It's nothing.

460
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,470
You got injured because of me.

461
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,160
- It's nothing.
- I...

462
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,430
He was brought out by you.

463
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,520
Your effort was not entirely wasted.

464
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,560
This person

465
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,520
never speaks kindly.

466
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
Here we meet again.

467
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,640
Have we met before?

468
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,710
Oh, busy people forget so easily?

469
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,880
We met a month ago

470
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,680
at my wedding.

471
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,280
You came to congratulate me, remember?

472
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,560
Sorry.

473
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,470
If you hadn't acted so strangely,

474
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,310
I wouldn't have remembered you.

475
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Mr. Pan, the master sent...

476
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,070
You disguised yourself
as a musician and entered Sunrise Garden.

477
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,690
- During the banquet...
- Please have a seat.

478
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,240
I'll be right back.

479
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,160
You tried to distract me away.

480
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,000
All right, go ahead.

481
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,800
You took this opportunity

482
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,880
to change into the backup groom's outfit

483
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,830
and impersonated me at the Flower Tower.

484
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,000
The night provided cover,

485
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,830
and you were skilled at impersonations.

486
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,470
No one actually noticed.

487
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,350
Young Master.

488
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,800
You may leave.

489
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,520
No need to wait here.

490
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

491
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,400
Oh no, the bride fell from the building!

492
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,280
It's you who killed Yang Caiwei.

493
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,830
You should thank me.

494
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,040
At least your bride thought

495
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,110
the last person she saw in her life

496
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,470
was her beloved husband.

497
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll kill you!

498
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,920
She died without any regrets.

499
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,590
Mr. Pan.

500
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,000
Mr. Pan!

501
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,400
Mr. Pan!

502
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,710
Mr. Pan, look at me.

503
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,000
Look at me.

504
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,400
Pan Yue!

505
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,350
Look at me, Pan Yue.

506
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,640
Pan Yue, he said that to provoke you.

507
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,800
Calm down.

508
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,110
Look at me, Pan Yue!

509
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,040
Pan Yue!

510
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,680
Ever since you arrived in Heyang,

511
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,110
I've been hiding here,
trying to avoid attention.

512
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,760
I didn't expect
that you would still be able to find me.

513
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,680
If there's anyone to blame,

514
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,760
it's myself for not being careful enough.

515
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,040
I didn't even realize

516
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,710
that Jin Liulang
had hidden half a chip in his belly.

517
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,590
It was supposed to be a perfect murder.

518
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,760
Let's say someone found the gold needle.

519
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,230
But only the groom, Pan Yue,
was at the crime scene.

520
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,230
Then Jin Liulang's blind mother
could still testify

521
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,680
based on the sound

522
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,430
and say that the gold needle
was made by you.

523
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,350
Unfortunately, it failed.

524
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
What a waste.

525
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,190
What a waste.

526
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,710
Why did you kill Yang Caiwei?

527
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,560
Who instructed you?

528
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,680
Be honest.

529
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,190
I'll spare your life.

530
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,190
Guess.

531
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,640
If you guess correctly,
I'll confess everything.

532
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,430
You often visit the Life and Death House,

533
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,680
so you shouldn't lack money.

534
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,160
In Heyang, someone
who can afford to hire you

535
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,350
must be wealthier
and more influential than you.

536
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,470
In Heyang,

537
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,830
it's none other than
the four famous families.

538
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,350
The mastermind must be
from one of the four families.

539
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,160
Not bad, carry on.

540
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,280
Silver Rain Terrace.

541
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,680
Mr. Pan, why did you say that?

542
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,230
The young master of Silver Rain Terrace
is against me openly.

543
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,280
There must be a reason.

544
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,470
So, it's not him.

You lost.

He hid poison in his teeth!

547
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:18,710
Tell me.

Who ordered you?

Tell me!

550
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,560
You've offended
someone you shouldn't have.

551
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,430
You'll end up worse off than me.

552
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,040
Tell me! Who ordered you?

553
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,800
Tell me!

554
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,320
Tell me!

555
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,670
Tell me!

556
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,800
Tell me! Speak!

557
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,710
Tell me! Speak!

558
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,600
He's dead.

00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:52,640
Hurry up.

562
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,380
Leave here, quick.

563
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,430
Mr. Cai,

564
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,230
the people who entered the wolf's cage

565
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,560
were a man and a woman
from Private Room A4.

566
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,630
They used someone else's cards.

567
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,760
The dagger belongs to the man.

568
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,080
Unexpectedly, he killed...

569
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,190
In two hours,

570
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,390
I want to see these two people.

571
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:28,120
Otherwise, your fate
will be the same as his.

572
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,320
Yes.

573
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,390
We went through
a lot of trouble to find this clue,

574
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,430
but it ended here.

575
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,000
There isn't anything special.

576
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,470
What's wrong?

577
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,040
Something's wrong with the injury.

578
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,000
Jiang?

579
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,390
Leave now.

580
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,870
Someone killed Cai Sheng's concubine

581
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,630
and wants to frame you.

582
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,520
Cai Sheng found this place
through the invitation cards

583
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,800
and is on his way here with his people.

584
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,360
Who are you?

585
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,150
Why should we trust you?

586
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,040
I just don't want the two of you

587
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,080
to die here.

588
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,910
Quick, search this place!

589
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,190
They came here for us.

590
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,360
This has nothing to do with you.

591
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,280
Let's split up.

592
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,000
All right, then, be careful.

593
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,840
Although he has a strange temper,

594
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,520
he is somewhat righteous.

595
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,000
So we can't let him injure himself

596
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,870
because of us.

597
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,390
Injure himself?

598
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,320
What's wrong?

599
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,000
The body can speak.

600
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,600
If we don't ask now,
we won't have a chance.

601
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,470
These bodies all tested
positive for poison.

602
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,760
I need to find the source of the poison

603
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:53,950
to trace

604
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,000
the murderer.

605
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,390
I need to cut open his stomach now.

606
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,670
Mr. Pan.

607
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,950
Come and take a look.

608
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,760
This is a token.

609
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,040
How did you know
there was something hidden inside?

610
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,630
This wound,

611
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,760
from its location, direction, and depth,

612
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,520
could only be self-inflicted.

613
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,520
Moreover, the wound
felt hard in the middle,

614
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,000
unlike normal skin texture.

615
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,520
So I suspected

616
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,630
he hid something in his own body.

617
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,000
How come?

618
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:43,800
I must be crazy.

619
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,190
Mr. Pan.

620
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:48,630
Are you all right?

621
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,320
It's nothing.

622
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,390
Good job.

623
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,700
[Six]

624
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,840
Father,

625
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,040
what is this?

626
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,470
The ripple pattern

627
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,840
represents an evil organization.

628
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,600
Their identities are very mysterious,

629
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,910
and they have done many bad things.

630
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,390
So,

631
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,630
I want to find them all

632
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,840
one by one through some clues

633
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
and then catch them all at once.

634
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,040
Do you understand?

635
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,710
Why would an assassin have such a token?

636
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,600
Could it be that the deaths
of Shangguan Zhi

637
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,280
and my parents

638
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,670
are related to this ripple organization?

639
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
What is this?

640
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,950
Ripple?

641
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,230
The organization behind this token

642
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,080
should be the mastermind
behind the murder of Miss Yang.

643
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,800
We need to leave quickly.

644
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,430
Let's go.

645
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:23,800
Mr. Cai.

646
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,150
The room that the guests
of Private Room A4 checked in

647
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,910
was the one on the far left
on the second floor.

648
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,800
You could've survived,
but you chose to come into the trap.

649
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,520
Who are you?

650
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,600
How dare you come to
my Life and Death House and make a fuss?

651
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,670
Mr. Pan, what do we do now?

652
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
I don't want to...

653
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,950
Die.

654
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,040
