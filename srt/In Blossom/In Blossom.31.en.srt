[Episode 31]

19
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,940
Darling,

20
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,410
I asked the servants to make you
a bowl of mind-soothing soup.

21
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,170
You should drink some.

22
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,530
Has the culprit been caught yet?

23
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,620
Don't worry, Darling.

24
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,380
The city gate has been blocked.

25
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,420
And the imperial guards
are conducting a citywide search.

26
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,370
They have nowhere to run.

27
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,570
There will be no escape.

28
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,980
The incident at Qixia Ridge

29
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,670
is due to the spouse.

30
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,140
Madam.

31
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,730
Are you still thinking about
what the guilty woman of the Yang family

32
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,370
said in court today?

33
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,170
Back then,

34
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,700
my parents were killed in Luoxi.

35
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,340
I broke my leg there too.

36
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,220
From then on, it's been
a pain in my heart.

37
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,860
All these years,

38
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,060
Jing and I

39
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,370
have called each other Qixia Ridge,
which is a place from an opera.

40
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,010
I've never told anyone

41
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,220
about this matter.

42
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,260
If it wasn't Jing who told her that,

43
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,170
how would Yang Caiwei know?

44
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,860
I think

45
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,010
Pan Yue must have known
about Qixia Ridge

46
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,450
from Jing by chance.

47
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,500
He made up a story with this

48
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,140
in order to save this Yang Caiwei.

49
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,900
The two of them were in cahoots.

50
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,220
I think Pan Yue

51
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,140
must be related to Jing's death.

52
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,420
Darling, don't worry.

53
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,060
When I catch them both,

54
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,340
they must pay for Jing's life.

55
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,730
I didn't expect
that Pan Yue would take the risk

56
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,930
and reveal Yang Caiwei's
identity in court.

57
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,290
It's a shame that he escaped this time.

58
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,570
When animals are caged,
they struggle more ferociously.

59
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,170
It's true that I underestimated him.

60
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,540
They are both fugitive murderers.

61
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,340
I don't think they could
cause any major trouble.

62
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,540
Zhuo Lanjiang was at the scene today.

63
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,250
Was there anything unusual with him?

64
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,060
I didn't notice anything strange.

65
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,970
Do you think
there's something wrong with him?

66
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,540
It's best if there's nothing wrong.

67
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,290
Before I became the Grand Marshal,

68
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,730
make sure nothing goes wrong.

69
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,820
Send a message to the Commander-in-Chief
of the imperial guards.

70
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,900
If they see Pan Yue and Yang Caiwei,

71
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,730
no need to arrest or interrogate them.

72
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,380
Behead them on the spot.

73
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,170
Yes.

74
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,940
Here you go.

75
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,860
Your complexion

76
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,380
looks a lot better now.

77
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,770
When I finish
the medicine prepared by Xiaosheng,

78
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,100
[Panax ginseng, Astragalus]
I might gain a lot of weight.

79
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,450
Speaking of which,

80
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,670
I haven't seen Xiaosheng all morning.

81
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,230
She went back to the courtyard.

82
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,110
She was worried that Jiang might
miss her when he came back.

83
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,320
Xiaosheng is usually happy-go-lucky

84
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,480
and carefree.

85
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I've never seen her

86
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,320
like this before.

87
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,920
Oh, right. I think
Zhuo Lanjiang was

88
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,320
at the Law Enforcement Office that day.

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,550
Really?

90
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,270
But the situation was urgent,

91
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,830
I didn't have time to talk to him.

92
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,070
We have to find a way
to locate him quickly.

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,600
The longer it takes,
the more dangerous it gets.

94
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,440
Indeed.

95
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,500
Young Lady, Mr. Pan.

96
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,230
Miss Qing is here.

97
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,230
Mr. Pan.

98
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,060
Didn't you leave?

99
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:10,940
Why are you here again?

100
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,410
Not long after we left the capital,

101
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,410
we knew something happened to you.

102
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,500
I think it must be
done by the mastermind.

103
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,130
So we turned back

104
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,660
to see what we can do to help you.

105
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,540
We originally planned to stay here first

106
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,850
before asking around about you guys.

107
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,450
Unexpectedly, We saw Ze guarding
the entrance of the alley.

108
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,730
That's how we found out
that you were here too.

109
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,130
There are pursuers everywhere outside.

110
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,690
It is better to hide than to run away.

111
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,620
I should call you Miss Yang, right?

112
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,250
I had no choice
but to conceal my identity before.

113
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,120
Please forgive me, Miss Qing.

114
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,380
An informant letter
from Yunchang back then

115
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,780
got Mr. Yang involved in the matter.

116
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,380
It caused your family to be broken,

117
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,500
and you to wander for years.

118
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,380
If I can do something for you,

119
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,340
it can be regarded as an atonement

120
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,010
on Yunchang's behalf.

121
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,490
Thank you.

122
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,970
[Yang Caiwei, Pan Yue]
Have you seen this man and woman?

123
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,940
No.

124
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,100
Has there been anyone suspicious

125
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,500
nearby today?

126
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,380
There was a girl this morning

127
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,450
who looked quite beautiful.

128
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,660
We've never seen her around here then.

129
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,060
She bought a lot of buns.

130
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,570
I saw her entering
the Third Mansion of Willow Street.

131
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:27,940
Are you sure?

132
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,690
Yes.

133

[Buns]

134
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,620
Steamed buns!

135
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,130
Mr. Pan, the imperial guards are nearby.

136
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,010
Mr. Pan, Miss Yang,

137
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,390
leave through the back door now.

138
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,620
What about you?

139
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,100
Don't worry, I know what to do.

140
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,940
Go now.

141
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,250
Be careful.

142
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,290
Let's go.

143
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,450
Search the place!

144
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,220
Who are you?

145
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,450
What gives you the right
to break into a private residence?

146
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,410
We are under orders
to capture fugitives.

147
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,170
Fugitives?

148
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,060
Are the two of you
the only residents here?

149
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,690
Yes, my friend and I came to the capital
to perform as entertainers.

150
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,410
We just settled down here yesterday.

151
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,130
It's just both of you.
Why did you buy so many buns?

152
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,130
Yesterday, several children came
to beg for food.

153
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,410
I felt pity for them,

154
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,820
so I asked my friend

155
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,380
to buy some food for them.

156
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,540
Why? Are good deeds illegal now?

157
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,370
Sir, we found nothing.

158
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,450
Sir, we didn't find them.

159
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,490
Let's go.

160
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,570
Hold on.

161
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,740
Let's go.

162
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,420
Let's go.

163
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,690
Next.

164
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:05,860
Let's go.

165
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,740
Out of the way!

166
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Come with me.

167
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,420
Let's go.

168
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,780
No one will search here.

169
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,370
Hide here for a while before leaving.

170
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,610
Jia Quan has given the imperial guards
a killing order.

171
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,900
Be extra cautious.

172
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,690
Jiang.

173
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,690
Since you are willing to help us,

174
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,980
why don't you reveal yourself?

175
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,420
Zhuo Lanjiang,

176
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,540
I know you want to avenge your father.

177
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,980
But Jia Quan is a meticulous person.

178
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,900
His methods are vicious.

179
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,220
You might not be able
to assassinate him.

180
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,900
Even if you get away with it,

181
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,450
it's hard for you to escape unscathed.

182
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,910
I came to the capital

183
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,590
with the determination
to throw my life away.

184
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,880
What about Xiaosheng?

185
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,030
Have you ever considered her feelings?

186
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,560
She is still waiting for you.

187
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,150
Do you have the heart to abandon her

188
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,680
and us? We are your friends.

189
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,030
What about Xiaosheng?

190
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,320
Have you ever considered her feelings?

191
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,710
She is still waiting for you.

192
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,150
Zhuo Lanjiang.

193
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,760
You big liar.

194
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,910
Today

195
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,880
is the 16th day I couldn't see you.

196
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,080
When will you come back?

197
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,560
Good people don't live long,

198
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,030
but disasters last thousands of years.

199
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Heavens,

200
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,440
please bless that big liar.

201
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,640
Let him be safe.

202
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,640
Return him to me intact.

203
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,710
Mr. Pan, Miss Yang.

204
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,470
I'm relieved that you're okay.

205
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,880
What's it? Does your wound hurt again?

206
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,340
No, it must be because I walked
for a long time.

207
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,500
It's okay. My ankle just hurts a little.

208
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,290
Are your feet hurt

209
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,440
due to the practice
of Dancing Among the Clouds?

210
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,220
I think so.

211
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,790
Because since then,

212
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,230
every time I walk too much,

213
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,400
my ankles will be a little painful.

214
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,760
This is the consequence of practicing
Dancing Among the Clouds.

215
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,290
Its damage to the ankles is extreme.

216
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,940
Previously, I practiced
until my ankle bones were deformed.

217
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,910
Slowly, I no longer feel anything there.

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,740
Your skin and flesh must be swollen.

219
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,440
You'll be fine after two days of rest.

220
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,590
So anyone who has practiced
Dancing Among the Clouds for a long time

221
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,230
will have damaged ankles?

222
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,790
Yes, without exception.

223
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,350
But the four skeletons

224
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,550
have normal ankles.

225
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,280
That means

226
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,000
Yunchang

227
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,080
wasn't among those four corpses.

228
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,470
I knew it.

229
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,230
If Zuo Jingfei wanted to silence her,

230
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,430
why did he go through all the trouble

231
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,550
to imitate
the Heavenly Master Murder Case?

232
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,280
Those women died in Heyang
unbeknownst to others,

233
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
it was nothing unusual.

234
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,030
So he imitated Lu Aige
and caused an uproar in the city.

235
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,520
Finally, he even cast the body
in molten copper

236
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,470
not because he was afraid
of being investigated by the court.

237
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,550
He just wanted to hide the truth.

238
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,960
He tried to make people think

239
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,320
that Yunchang was dead.

240
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,060
Let me out. Don't kill me!

241
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,820
Let me out!

242
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,430
Let me out!

243
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,230
Don't kill me!

244
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,370
Help... Help me!

245
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,710
Let me out!

246
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,030
Help!

247
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,790
No!

248
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,280
No!

249
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,080
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

250
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,350
Yunchang and I are like sisters.

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,270
She's nothing but pure-hearted.

252
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,800
She would never do such a thing

253
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,910
to deceive me.

254
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,860
Miss Qing,

255
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,960
I know you are good friends
with Yunchang.

256
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,320
However,

257
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,640
do you really know her?

258
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,790
Why don't you move
to the Hundred Flowers Court

259
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,910
and live with me?

260
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,000
- If something happens…
- No.

261
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,910
You've helped me more than enough.

262
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,080
I can't trouble you anymore.

263
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,110
Di, I'm gifting you this handkerchief.

264
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,080
The Taoba pattern on it
was embroidered by me.

265
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,030
I hope it can protect you
from sickness and misfortunes.

266
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,030
When I'm gone,

267
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,470
you can take a look at it

268
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,420
if you miss me.

269
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,250
Could it be that Yunchang really…

270
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,320
Of course,

271
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,670
this is just our speculation.

272
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,420
Well, I bet everyone has had a long day.

273
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,740
Why don't we retire now?

274
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,780
Let's go, Miss Qing.

275
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,660
If this were the truth,

276
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,810
wouldn't it be too cruel?

277
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,220
If it's the truth,

278
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,220
she has the right to know it.

279
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,100
Oh, right.

280
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,220
Did you have something to say just now?

281
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,150
Miss Qing once said

282
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,440
the last time Yunchang saw her,

283
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,510
she mentioned a man who admired her
in the capital.

284
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,120
And when I sneaked
into the Shiluo Garden,

285
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,560
Madam Wan said something too.

286
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,080
She might look sorry now.

287
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,120
However, ten years ago,

288
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,880
she was a very popular girl
here in Shiluo Garden.

289
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,320
Because she slapped the lead dancer,

290
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,150
she was punished by Mr. Zuo.

291
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,440
Finally,

292
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,240
she ended up like this.

293
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,200
The lead dancer from ten years ago

294
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,470
must've been Yunchang.

295
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,450
Zuo Jingfei supported her strongly.

296
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
She must be really close to Zuo Jingfei.

297
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,710
If so,

298
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,760
it all makes sense.

299
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,320
Jia Quan must trust
Zuo Jingfei very much.

300
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,560
That's why he entrusted

301
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,590
a confidential place
like Shiluo Garden to him.

302
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,950
When Yunchang fled to Heyang,

303
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,240
Zuo Jingfei was ordered
to go after and kill her.

304
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,120
On one hand, he couldn't bear

305
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,950
to kill the woman he loved.

306
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,880
On the other hand,

307
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,910
he dared not betray Jia Quan.

308
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,800
That's why he thought of

309
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,320
this plan to fake her death
with a replacement.

310
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,470
We have to find Yunchang.

311
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,950
She is the most powerful witness
to bring down Jia Quan.

312
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,640
Who's that?

313
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,950
Me.

314
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,710
Jiang?

315
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:01,950
On the 15th of this month,

316
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,440
Jia Quan will receive the seal
at the Grand Commandant's Residence

317
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,240
and be named Grand Marshall.

318
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,350
Seven days left.

319
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,910
Once he receives military power,

320
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,910
everything will be irreversible.

321
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:11,800
Jiang,

322
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,180
do you know a person named Zuo Jingfei?

323
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,570
He is a close confidant of Jia Quan.

324
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,180
He's in the Grand Commandant's
Residence. Why?

325
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,010
We are looking
for a courtesan named Yunchang.

326
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,130
She is

327
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,720
the key witness in the whistleblower
letter to my father.

328
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,420
Zuo Jingfei has
a close relationship with her.

329
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,440
Have you seen her?

330
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,060
No. As far as I know,

331
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,900
there are no women around Zuo Jingfei.

332
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,050
It seems that he acts very covertly,

333
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,490
even Jia Quan doesn't know about it.

334
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,980
It will not be that easy

335
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:36,860
to find her.

336
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,540
It's okay.

337
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,810
Now that Zuo Jingfei is our target,

338
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,370
as long as Yunchang is still alive,

339
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,560
we will definitely be able to get clues.

340
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,250
By the way,
when you raided Xinzheng Academy,

341
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,100
you said Mr. Chen took away a ledger.

342
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,130
Yes. It records

343
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,780
the accounts of the smuggled halite.

344
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,300
Mr. Chen is hiding
in Jia Quan's mansion.

345
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,370
The ledger must be in Jia Quan's hands.

346
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,650
That means

347
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,430
if we can find the ledger,

348
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,330
we will have evidence.

349
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,660
I will look for opportunities

350
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,250
to search every room
in Jia Quan's residence.

351
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,170
There will definitely be clues.

352
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,820
No, that is too dangerous.

353
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,940
You took a blow from me before.

354
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,250
Jia Quan still trusts me.

355
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,250
I have been lurking beside him
for so long.

356
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,660
I must make use of my position.

357
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,060
- Jiang...
- I have made up my mind.

358
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,780
I'm not doing it just for you guys.

359
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:31,940
It's for me as well.

360
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,780
If I don't try my best on this matter,

361
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,300
I would let myself down

362
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,330
and couldn't call myself
your friend anymore.

363
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,060
Before the seal-giving ceremony,

364
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,460
I will hand you the ledger.

365
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,250
After we bring down Jia Quan,

366
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,250

00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,660
You are still too impatient.

551
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,490
You endured humiliation

552
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,300
and stayed hidden for so long

553
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,730
just for it?

554
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,010
What a pity.

555
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,180
So what if you found it?

556
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,940
It's on your hands,

557
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,060
but you can't send it out.

558
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,180
Catch him alive.

559
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,210
Yes!

560
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,210
Jiang.

561
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,700
What happened today

562
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,900
was your fault.

563
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,780
Don't blame me

564
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,580
for turning against our old ties.

565
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,060
For your father's sake,

566
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,250
if you tell me

567
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,460
the whereabouts
of Pan Yue and Yang Caiwei,

568
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,060
I can let you go.

569
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,850
After all,

570
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,940
your father lived pathetically
for so many years

571
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,700
just to protect your puny life.

572
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,130
Why do you bother

573
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,730
sacrificing your own life

574
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,900
for two unrelated persons?

575
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,820
I thought you were smarter
than your father.

576
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,660
I did not expect you

577
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,060
to be more ignorant than him.

578
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,130
I guess you just don't get it.

579
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,330
You will never understand

580
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,370
why one is willing

581
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,820
to die for some unrelated person.

582
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,820
Because all you do

583
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,010
is deception,

584
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,820
threatening,

585
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,940
and taking advantage of others.

586
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,660
You think you are great,

587
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,850
standing above many.

588
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,660
But you are just

589
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,970
a dog of the Jiang clan.

590
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,130
How could a dog

591
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,090
deserve to call my father "brother"?

592
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,330
Even acting like an elder brother.

593
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,090
What a joke!

594
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:08,810
Good.

595
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,740
Very good.

596
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,260
Since you want to be a hero,

597
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,090
I shall grant your wish.

598
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,700
Jia Quan,

599
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,940
you're nothing but a lackey.

600
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,530
Go on.

601
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,460
He's passed out, but still alive.

602
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,260
It's okay.

603
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,500
I have plenty of time
to torture him slowly.

604
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:18,700
Sir,

605
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,180
a boy from the herbal medicine shop
sent a letter.

606
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,660
He said he has an urgent matter,
and he would like to see Mr. Zuo.

607
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:23,700
Master,

608
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,330
I've been having a bad headache lately.

609
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,220
Perhaps the apothecary has found
a cure for my disease.

610
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,130
Di.

611
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,610
Di.

612
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,090
No matter how you blame me,

613
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,180
I deserve it all.

614
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,850
You used to treat me like a sister.

615
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,260
No matter what mistakes I made,

616
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,700
you would forgive me.

617
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,530
But now,

618
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,420
you won't even say a word to me?

619
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,370
In the past nine years,

620
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,850
I have imagined countless times

621
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,460
how great it would be

622
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:33,940
if you were still alive.

623
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,090
If you were still alive,

624
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,460
we could dance together

625
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,850
and have heart-to-heart talks.

626
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,500
I have so much to say to you.

627
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,290
But looking at you now,

628
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,530
I feel like you are a stranger.

629
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,330
All these years,

630
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,740
I feel guilty
and blame myself all the time.

631
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,660
Countless times, I dreamt

632
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,460
of the struggles and cries
of our friends.

633
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,610
But what could I have done?

634
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,900
Even if

635
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,260
I rejected Zuo Jingfei's proposal
at first,

636
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,940
he would've just killed me
along with them.

637
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,050
I couldn't save them.

638
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,420
I ever thought
of telling you everything.

639
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,700
But that would only

640
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,090
drag you into the quagmire.

641
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,130
That's why

642
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,850
I could only lie to you,

643
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,570
even if you blame me and hate me.

644
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,460
You…

645
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:47,570
You…

646
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,020
You…

647
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:03,850
Di,

648
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,260
I'm sorry.

649
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,500
But I must see this through.

650
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,700
Why did she disappear for no reason?

651
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,370
I... I don't know either.

652
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,940
When I sent her dinner last night,

653
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,050
I found out that she was gone.

654
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,700
Where... Where have you been?

655
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,420
Pan Yue and the others
discovered my identity.

656
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,980
We have to leave the capital at once.

657
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,090
If Jia Quan knew about this matter,

658
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,850
both of us would die.

659
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,130
Honey, hesitate no more.

660
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,330
Why are you doing this?

661
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,460
Look at how pathetic you are.

662
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,610
Shanju will not feel at ease
in the afterlife.

663
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,900
I'm an unfilial child.

664
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,370
I could not

665
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,610
avenge my father.

666
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Your father
just wanted you to live well.

667
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:45,180
Back then I was just a poor scholar.

668
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,050
Your father picked me
with his discerning eye,

669
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,290
giving me everything I have today.

670
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:59,530
I really can't bear to see his only son
end up like this.

671
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,660
Young Master,

672
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,700
please hand over Pan Yue and the others.

673
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,220
I'll help you plead with Jia Quan.

674
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,940
My father

675
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,290
risked his life and did so much
for Jia Quan for so many years.

676
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,900
But he was easily

677
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,370
abandoned,

678
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,220
not to mention me.

679
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,020
In fact, you know it very well,
don't you?

680
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,130
Even if

681
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,020
I tell you everything,

682
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,260
he will still get rid of me.

683
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,570
Sir,

684
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,900
since you and my father

685
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,330
were sworn brothers,

686
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:18,770
can…

687
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,850
Can you grant me

688
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,020
this last request of mine?

689
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:45,850
Men.

690
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,020
Sir, what are your orders?

691
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,740
Why is it you?

692
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,180
Where is Zuo Jingfei?

693
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,740
I haven't seen him since this afternoon.

694
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,530
Send someone to investigate

695
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,770
the clinic he frequents.

696
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,980
We cannot have any accidents
before the conferral ceremony.

697
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,020
Yes, sir.

698
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,610
Sir, Zhuo Lanjiang
can't stand it anymore.

699
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,660
He is willing to speak.

700
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,940
Great.

701
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,460
How's it going, Jiang?

702
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,090
Have you thought it through?

703
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,700
I am my father's only son.

704
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,980
I can't die yet.

705
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,180
That's right.

706
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,980
Only those who compromise

707
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,130
can achieve great things.

708
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,610
Now that you've come around to it,
tell me.

709
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:14,530
Pan Yue is in the capital.

710
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,090
A place very close to you.

711
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,180
Where is he?

712
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:31,890
Pan Yue

713
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,700
is at…

714
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:36,900
Where is he?

715
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,610
On the way to kill you.

716
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:21,570
Miss Qing.

717
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,090
Miss Qing?

718
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,940
Miss Qing. Miss Qing!

719
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,460
Mr. Pan! This is bad, Mr. Pan.

720
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,570
Miss Qing!

721
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,700
Mr. Pan!

722
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,700
Mr. Pan, look!

723
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,530
Miss Qing, are you okay?

724
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:13,940
Zuo Jingfei.

725
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,090
Master noticed
that something was not right with you.

726
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:17,460
What a surprise.

727
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,770
How dare you hide
the woman Master wants to kill!

728
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,020
Traitor.

729
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,500
You know the consequences.

730
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,090
Ze, follow them.

731
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,420
You are wise, Master.

732
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,090
I have taken care of Zuo Jingfei.

733
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,290
Pan Yue, Pan Yue.

734
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,460
Let's see

735
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,420
how else you will fight me.

736
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:09,780
♪Like the dew, we wait for the glimmer
of light to greet the morning♪

737
