00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,150
was the only person
in the room back then.

165
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,110
After that, the county magistrate
even launched an investigation.

166
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,150
Even so, there was
nothing abnormal about it.

167
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,230
That's why everyone was speculating

168
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,550
that Miss Yang took her own life

169
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,110

171

back to the capital?

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,550
At first, Mr. Shangguan
wanted to help them out.

175

But Mr. Pan said

176
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,350
that Miss Yang was already buried.

177
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,520
That quickly?

And they were being secretive too.

179
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,710
Could it be that Pan Yue was afraid
that he left some evidence behind?

180
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,320

182
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,000
This is the prescription given to you
by the witch healer.

You have to drink it every night.

cooked with plain water.

189
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,790
I just feel like

190
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,440
I already had a narrow escape.

191
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,960
There's no need for me to torture myself

192
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,640
with such weird items.

193
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,400
You can take it away.

194
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,520
Yes, Young Lady.

195
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,350
What kind of rule is this?

196
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,790
Do you want a reward?

197
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,150
I deserve to die!

198
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,150
Young Lady, please punish me!

199
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,000
It's wrong again.

200
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,960
That's right! It's all my fault
for getting it wrong!

201
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,230
I wasn't referring to you.

202
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,000
It was me.

203
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,000
Why did you extend your hand?

204
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,590
Young Lady, you can only sleep

205
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
after taking off your clothes

206
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,280
before you sleep, right?

207
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,440
I was waiting for your clothing.

208
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,910
I feel unwell today.

209
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,790
I'll keep my clothing on.

210
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,400
You can head back first.

211
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,080
- Go now.
- Yes, Young Lady.

212
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,590
What kind of life
does Shangguan Zhi actually lead?

213
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,280
If I keep up the act,

214
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,440
I think my identity will be revealed
one way or another.

215
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,230
By then, I'll end up like her.

216
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,950
There's Master too.

217
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,470
I'm sure he suffered a huge blow

218
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,560
after hearing about my death.

219
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,190
I have to find him.

220
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,190
I need to leave this place by tomorrow

221
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,830
no matter what.

222
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,470
Zhi?

223
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,070
Zhi,

224
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,070
you look much better now.

225
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,470
Do you still feel uncomfortable
anywhere in particular?

226
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,070
I've fully recovered.

227
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,830
Please...

228
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,680
Lan, please don't worry about me.

229
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,680
I'm glad to hear that.

230
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,830
Zhi,

231
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,880
you were in a sorry state

232
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,710
when I saved you.

233
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,350
Who landed you in that plight?

234
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,470
I can't remember.

235
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,590
Anyway, my head hurts

236
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,160
when I try to recall the incident.

237
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,800
All right, then.

238
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,070
You don't need to recall it.

239
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,190
I shouldn't have asked you about it.

240
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,160
I was just concerned about you.

241
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,310
What are they doing?

242
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Lan, are you leaving?

243
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,950
Of course we're leaving together.

244
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,190
Me too?

245
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,230
Zhi, after I gave it some thought,

246
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,830
I think I should bring you
back to the capital with me.

247
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,160
I'll hire a famous physician
to help regulate your health.

248
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,920
I've packed most of our belongings.

249
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,560
We'll depart today.

250
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,280
I cannot leave.

251
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,920
Zhi,

252
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,470
Heyang reminds you
of the tragedy you experienced.

253
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,190
I always listened to you in the past.

254
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,000
Can you listen to me

255
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,280
this time?

256
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,350
Don't worry.

257
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,110
The journey will be slow.

258
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,590
It won't tire you out.

259
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,710
Zhi,

260
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
be a good girl.

261
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,230
Lan, you kept me company
in Heyang for one month.

262
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,710
I'm sure many things were delayed.

263
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,470
It must've been tough.

264
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,110
I can make money anytime.

265
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,920
However, I only have one sister.

266
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,710
Stop the carriage.

267
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,560
Why are you stopping the carriage?

268
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,950
I have an emergency to attend to.

269
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,190
All right. I'll join you.

270
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,920
I have a stomach ache.

271
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,430
Lan, are you sure you want to join me?

272
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,000
Ling,

273
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,280

00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,640
It's pretty good.

278

Where are my earrings?

279
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,680
It was here just now.
Help me look for it.

280
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,590
Yes, Young Lady.

281
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,760
Hurry and look for it.

282
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,220
How was it? Did you find any clues?

283
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,200
Yeah.

284
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,200
Great.

285
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,250
You should've told me earlier.

286
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,470
Young Lady.

287
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,760
Young Lady?

[Coffin Home]

289

There's blood on the ground.

295
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,800
Don't tell me Master was harmed too?

296
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,160
I think this looks nice.

297
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,350
It looks better than the other one.

298
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,640
- This does look exquisite.
- Yeah, right?

299

Have you heard?

300
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,590
The new magistrate
will assume his position today.

301
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,190
The entire Heyang knows about it.

302
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
I even heard

303
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,280
that the new magistrate
is the future prince consort.

304
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,310
How did you find out?

305
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,760
The entire Heyang is talking about it.

306
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,880
How could you not know?

307
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,310
What are they looking at?

308
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,040
Who is that?

309
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,000
Is that Mr. Pan?

310
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,470
Mr. Pan?

311
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,000
That's Mr. Pan!

312
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,190
Mr. Pan is actually in Heyang.

313
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,830
Mr. Pan actually dyed his hair white.

314
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,070
He's the new magistrate?

315
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,400
Wasn't Mr. Pan impeached
for forcibly taking a woman

316
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,760
and causing his new wife
to take her own life?

317
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,800
How did he become

318
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,470
the magistrate of Heyang?

319
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,430
You have no idea.

320
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,350
I just came back from the capital.

321
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,310
I heard that he made acquaintances
with the princess long ago.

322
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,830
However, he couldn't marry her
as he had a marriage granted

323
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,830
by the late emperor.

324
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,680
Now, they're engaged.

325
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,590
The princess told several
important subjects to recommend him

326
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,190
to be a magistrate in Heyang
as a figurehead

327
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,310

we cannot address him as Mr. Pan.

330
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,880
You're right.

331
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,520
We have to address him
as prince consort by then.

00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,160
No wonder.

00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,110
He's just waiting for
his rise to prominence.

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,920
He'll be a prince consort
when he goes back.

335
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,680
So, he married me and killed me

336
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,710
to end the marriage granted
by the late emperor.

You were in a hurry
to bring me back to the capital

because you knew Yue was going
to be the new magistrate.

not long ago.

I know you have deep feelings
for Pan Yue.

374
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,400
However, some relationships
can't be forced.

375
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,470
There's no need to repeat your mistake.

I'm sorry,

378

But no matter what,

387
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,710
you must promise me

388
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,430
that you won't run away from home

389
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,070

00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,830
I cannot forgive you

394
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,470
for what you've done.

395
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,310
However, it wasn't my wish
for you to perish

396
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,000
because of that.

397
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,520
Now, I'm using your identity.

I know

399
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,680
this is unfair to your elder brother,

400
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,470
but I have no choice.

401
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,760
I can only approach Pan Yue

You bought the dye
from the Ghost Market.

It's fine if you don't want
to buy my wares.

to the rumors out there.

After all, they don't know you well.

492
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,880
She's already gone. There's no need
to mention her name again.

493
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,230
Heyang is notorious for its hostility.

494
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,430

But you came here of your own accord.

499
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,800
Do you have other plans in mind?

500
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,880
Indeed. There's something
I must do here.

501
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,710
However, it's a long story.

502
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,350
You can return to the capital

503
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,710
and manage your business first.

504

506
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,830
Just tell me

Tell me, then.

What are you doing here?

517
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,680
We have to return to the capital
tomorrow morning.

518
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,400
You should rest well now.

519
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,470
Lan, don't worry.

520
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,470
I wish to speak with Yue

521
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,830
before we leave.

522
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,800
Okay.

523
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,430
Go ahead, then.

524
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,800
I've managed to escape from death
and reflect upon my actions.

525
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,470
I've figured most of the things out.

526
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,430
Some relationships cannot be forced.

527
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,040
I feel ashamed
for all the ridiculous things

528
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,520
that I've done.

529
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,600
I shouldn't have been obsessed with love

530
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,280
and been willful

531
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,520
without considering
other people's feelings.

532
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,230
Therefore,

533
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,840
I hereby apologize to you.

534
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,600
I accept your apology.

535
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:26,950
Please go back.

536
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,950
No.

537
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,520
I don't think an apology is enough.

538
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,600
[Lusted for men, I was willful]

539
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,400
[I had no virtues,
and my life was empty]

540
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,020
[Now, I've been reborn]

541
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,020
[I shall punish the evil
and praise the good]

542
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,600
In the past, I was
too stubborn to change.

543
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,150
You won't believe me
no matter what I tell you.

544
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,000
Therefore, this time,

545
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,870
I've written them down
with my blood to prove my sincerity.

546
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,120
Each of your words was filled
with your blood and tears, huh?

547
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,600
You did put a lot of effort into them.

548
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,630
You rested for one month,

549
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,520
yet it seemed like
you could write well now.

550
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,600
It's just

551
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,470
that the phrase "punish the evil
and praise the good" is...

552
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,800
This time, I almost died.

553
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,520
We should treat other people
as we would ourselves.

554
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,760
Plenty of disasters have occurred here,

555
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,560
and there are plenty
of dead bodies uncared for.

556
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,280
Yue,

557
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,120
I know you came here

558
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,320
to rectify Heyang.

559
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,000
Therefore,

560
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,000
I wish to join the county office
and help you out.

561
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,150
I wish to contribute to your cause.

562
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,950
If crooks can be brought to justice

563
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,080
and the people can live in peace,

564
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,280
my revival will be worth it.

565
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,910
Yue,

566
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,430
Mr. Pan,

567
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,560
please give me a chance.

568
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,600
I don't care even if I have
to become an errand girl.

569
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,950
I'll surely put down the past

570
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,040
and not cause trouble for you two again.

571
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,870
I'm touched

572
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,840
by Zhi's resolve.

573
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,080
Initially, I wanted to bring

574
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,470
her back to the capital with me
tomorrow morning.

575
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,230
But Zhi is truly sincere about this.

576
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Even the heavens

577
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,760
can bear witness to her sincerity.

578
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,470
No matter how heartless you are,

579
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,320
you should be shaken by that.

580
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,080
You're right.

581
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,120
She's sincere indeed.

582
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,190
No matter how heartless I am,

583
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,430
I have to be shaken by her speech.

584
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,360
Every dog has its day indeed.

585
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:35,950
Come.

586
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,000
Here's a toast to you.

587
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,760
It's my token of sincerity.

588
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,560
No need for that.

589
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,600
This is necessary.

590
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,080
No need...

591
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,150
You should go back
and improve your blood letter.

592
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,230
At least the first four sentences

593
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,390
were concise and impactful.

594
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,080
Thank you for the hospitality.

595
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,520
I shall take my leave now.

596
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,760
May you have a smooth trip tomorrow.

597
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,280
Ling.

598
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,600
Let them finish their conversation.

599
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,520
Pan Yue.

600
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,670
Pan Yue, you mustn't leave.

601
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,840
I have a question for you.

602
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,910
You're avoiding me

603
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,150
all because you want
to marry the princess, right?

604
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,520
What did you say?

605
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,630
Am I wrong?

606
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,000
You're showing me the cold shoulder

607
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,080
while you bow to the princess

608
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,150
and please her in any way you can.

609
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,800
You said

610
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,870
you didn't care
about beauty or wealth, huh?

611
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,430
I didn't expect you to desire something
that was even more vulgar.

612
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,520
It's a shame that I wasn't born
into the imperial family.

613
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,320
I couldn't help you to ascend the ranks.

614
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,760
It's a shame that Yang Caiwei
has to become your stepping stone,

615
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,150
even though she died not long ago.

616
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,630
You're just better-looking than average.

617
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,080
What gives you the right
to bully people?

618
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,190
You trampled upon my feelings for you

619
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,910
and acted nonchalantly about it.

620
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,000
You may look like a glorious person,

621
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,670
but you're a rotten egg inside!

622
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,630
Pan Yue, what did I do

623
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,760
for you to treat me like this?

624
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,150
I was leading a great life before this.

625
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,150
Why did you have to appear
in front of me?

626
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,430
Why must you treat me like this?

627
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,950
Why?

628
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,910
Shangguan Zhi,

629
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,760
I didn't know

630
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,630
that you had such a sharp tongue.

631
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,230
Diplomacy before violence, huh?

632
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,150
What did you expect to get from me

633
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,800
with this devious plot of yours?

634
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,040
I just want to help you out
in the county office.

635
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,710
Can you even believe your own words?

636
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,630
Listen.

637
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,760
You better return
to the capital immediately.

638
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,320
Do not mention her name again.

639
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,670
Don't try to challenge my patience.

640
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,040
If not,

641
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,360
even I don't know what I'll do to you.

642
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,430
Zhi.

643
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,950
- Young Lady!
- Are you okay?

644
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,000
- Young Lady!
- Zhi!

645
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,710
Are you okay?

646
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,520
Pan Yue,

647
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,710
you crossed the line.

648
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,230
I deserved it.

649
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,470
It's not his fault.

650
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,430
Although Zhi has a hasty temper,

651
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,390
she only has admiration for you.

652
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,190
It's not like she's a villain.

653
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,670
Why are you treating her like this?

654
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,040
Pan Yue,

655
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,520
you know this too.

656
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,360
She's my only sister.

657
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,320
I gave her everything she wanted
since young.

658
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,800
You know fully well

659
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,390
how I treated her with care.

660
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,280
She was indeed insensible
when she was young.

661
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,870
But now, she's all grown up.

662
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,950
She's willing to turn over a new leaf.

663
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,470
Can't you just give her a chance?

664
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,560
And

665
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,040
she just recovered not long ago.

666
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,320
How could you make her

667
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,560
this agitated?

668
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,360
Will you be able to sleep in peace

669
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,710
if something happens to her?

670
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,600
Fine.

671
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,390
Since you already said that,

672
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,190
I'll give her one last chance.

673
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,840
Ling,

674
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,040
go and treat the Young Lady's wound.

675
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,430
Yes, Mr. Shangguan.

676
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,630
