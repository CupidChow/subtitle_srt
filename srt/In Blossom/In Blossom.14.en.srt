Ze! Have you lost your mind?

21
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,680
Ze, stop chasing!

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,310
Stop right there!

23
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,190
Ze, calm down!

24
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't move!

25

Your Young Lady

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,830
has once entangled with my Young Master.

27
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,830
Now she is doing the same thing
with another man.

28
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,550
No, both of you are the same.

29
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,270
You're busy delivering food to me

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,470

I must vent my anger today!

You're such a...

That's enough!

35
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,110
Ze, this is already the fifth attempt!

36
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,750
The accusations you made earlier

37
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,190
were emotionless.

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,630
You need to be more worked up!

39
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,600
You need to be more impulsive!

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,080
You should at least
have uncontrollable anger!

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,630
You need to make people feel,

00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,670

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,830
Come on, do it again.

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,440
Miss Shangguan,
please don't make it difficult for me.

46
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,800
I really don't have such talent.

47
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,030
Young Lady, I agree.

48
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,240
Look at Ze,

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,080
he's so kind

50
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,270
and upright.

51
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,550
He can't play the villain at all.

52
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,630
I'm not as good as you claim.

53
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,960
Anyway, you show your anger

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,880
when you're saying

55
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,830
I have entangled with someone

56
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,190
and am doing it with another person.

57
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,630
Ze, do you have a problem with me?

58
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,800
No, I don't!

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,800
Miss Shangguan, please spare me.

60
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,440
Alright.

61
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,320
Let's change the subject
and try one last time.

62
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,270
You grab her hand like this.

63
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,080
The other hand too.

64
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,240
Look at Ling
and put on an imposing manner.

65
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,440
Tell her.

You belong to me in life and in death.

68
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll break your legs!

69
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,030

If you dare look at other men,

00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,360
I'll break my own legs!

75
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,750
With this acting,

76
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,600
you won't lure out the culprit.

77
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh my goodness, that's so funny!

78
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,600
I think you'll only lure out

79
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,640
those old ladies who are watching.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,760
How dare you!

81
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,550
Indeed.

82
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,350
Why would I miss out on
someone readily available?

83
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,720
I can't stop laughing.

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,350

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,390
Come.

89
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,390
I have let go of the past

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,440
and turned over a new leaf.

91
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,270
I'm not

92
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,390
the same person I used to be.

93
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,070
For a person to grow,

94
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,830
how much misunderstanding and suspicion
must one go through?

95
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,950
Forget about it, then.

96
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,480
For the sake of the people of Heyang,

97
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,670
I will endure

98
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,880
this grievance!

99
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,480
Could you stop pacing around?

100
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,920
You're making me dizzy.

101
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,760
Where on earth is this?

102
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,760
A temporary shelter

103
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,200
in case of emergencies.

104
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,000
Like a shell for the turtle to hide in.

105
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,480
How annoying.

106
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,070
If it weren't for you,

107
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,510
there wouldn't be people
trying to kill me.

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,950
How could you blame me for this?

109
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,040
If you didn't

110
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,320
swindle at that place,

111
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,670
I wouldn't have ventured
into the Ghost Market.

112
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,110
I even suspect
you're in cahoots with them.

113
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,670
You led me over for a purpose.

114
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,320
Wait... I led you there?

115
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,480
Did I send a letter asking you to come?

116
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,480
You're funny. Don't blame other people

117
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,950
for the trouble
you brought upon yourself.

118
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,270

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,510
What is it?

121
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,830
Mr. Sun.

122
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,350
Young Master.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,640
How's it going?

124
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,110
As you expected,

125
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,550
it was the Gold Water Sect's doing.

126
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,110
By the river in the Ghost Market,

127
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
a tattoo of a golden-tailed dragon
was found

128
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,200
on the murderer's body.

129
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,880
These people used swords,

130
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,320
but their martial arts techniques

131
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,230
were somehow related
to the Gold Water Sect's Emei Piercers.

132
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,830
These rats from the sewers

133
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,040
have been hiding for so long.

134
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,040
What makes them suddenly emerge?

135
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,040
The remnants of the Gold Water Sect
are still up to no good.

136
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,720
They're secretly plotting revenge
against you.

137
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,550
I also found a note on the bodies.

138
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,160
Young Master, please take a look.

139
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,940
[Leave the Silver Rain Terrace
and head to the Ghost Market at noon]

140
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,350
There really is a mole

141
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,790
in the Silver Rain Terrace.

142
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,920
I told you so.

143
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,390
I...

144
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,110
Young Master.

145
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
For your safety,

146
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,830
you can't go back for now.

147
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,040
You'll have to stay here for a few days.

148
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,070
It's just some remnants
of the Gold Water Sect.

149
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,350
I won't stay
in this turtle shell for them.

150
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,270
Young Master!

151
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,950
The Gold Water Sect
is ruthless and treacherous.

152
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,830
Three years ago,

153
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,720
the former master fell victim
to their schemes.

154
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,440
You mustn't let your guard down.

155
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,830
Young Master, be cautious!

156
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,790
Get up!

157
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,070
If you don't agree,

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,830
we won't get up.

159
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,030
Enough.

160
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,710
As long as the traitor
is not dealt with,

161
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,000
I will stay here.

162
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,150
Get up.

163
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,670
Well...

164
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,440
It's none of my business.

165
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,470
Can... Can I go back first?

166
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,520
You can't leave.

167
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
In my opinion,

168
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,230
you can't get away with this matter.

169
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,080
What?

170
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,640
Me?

171
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,760
The person who knows the hiding place
of the Silver Rain Terrace

172
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,200
can't leave alive.

173
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,520
I won't tell a soul.

174
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,790
Zhuo Lanjiang.

175
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,110
Just let her go.

176
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,760
Young Master,
the human heart is unpredictable.

177
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,910
She's a notorious little swindler
in the Ghost Market.

178
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,000
She'd do anything for money.

179
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,790
Young Master, you can't trust her.

180
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,590
I trust her.

181
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,280
Young Master...

182
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,760
Didn't you say so?

183
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,670
She's just a little swindler.

184
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,640
Even if she really deceives me,

185
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,840
it won't be a problem for me.

186
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,350
Young Master, your noodles.

187
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,790
Young Master,

188
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,590
Ling has made
many delicious dishes today.

189
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,670
Why didn't you go to the dining hall?

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,400
Out of sight, out of mind.

191
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,760
You may go.

192
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

193
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,110
I think

194
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,000
Mr. Pan has been
acting strangely lately.

195
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,440
Yeah, it's quite strange.

196
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,440
And he's basically nowhere to be seen.

197
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,400
When I asked him
to join the lantern parade

198
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,590
on behalf of Jiang,
he was quite enthusiastic.

199
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,230
What's wrong with him now?

200
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,440
Young Lady, do you think
Mr. Pan is nervous

201
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,400
and secretly preparing
for the Lantern Festival?

202
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,520
Why would he be nervous?

203
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,910
Competition among men is fierce.

204
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,670
If the result doesn't meet expectations,

205
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,080
wouldn't he be a loss, a failure,

206
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,710
and a big joke to Master Zhuo?

207
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,590
Is it that serious?

208
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,520
Of course.

209
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,200
Moreover,

210
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,670
it happens in front of the girl
he likes.

211
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
His self-respect
matters more than anything.

212
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,320
Stop making up stories already.

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,080
But come to think of it,

214
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,000
why haven't I seen Jiang
for these two days?

215
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,150
Yeah.

216
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,470
Young Lady,

217
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,200
here's a letter for you.

218
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,470
These words represent me.

219
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,910
[Jiang]
Recently, I've been busy

220
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,790
[Jiang]
with terrace affairs,

221
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,230
I leave the preparations
for the Lantern Festival

222
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,520
to you and Mr. Pan.

223
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,200
I'll try to come early tomorrow

224
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,470
to help you both.

225
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,880
How much longer do we have to stay here?

226
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,080
I told you to leave but you didn't.

227
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,230
What if I go out

228
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,790
and they still won't let me go?

229
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,520
What if they put a knife on my neck

230
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,710
and ask for your location?

231
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,550
If I tell them,
it is considered as betraying you.

232
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,000
If I don't tell them, then I will die.

233
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,470
Thus, after some consideration,

234
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,880
I think it's safer to stay here.

235
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,790
Why do you trust me?

236
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,710
When I was questioning you
at the Ghost Market,

237
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,960
you were so scared,

238
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,030
yet you didn't betray your friend.

239
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,550
I think you're trustworthy.

240
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,470
That's because of Caiwei.

241
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,350
This house seems quite old.

242
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,440
When was it built?

243
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
When I was little,

244
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,550
my father built it with me.

245
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,140
I've heard the rumors

246
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,590
that the Gold Water Sect
killed your father

247
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,400
and you massacred the Gold Water Sect.

248
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,000
I even heard the river
turned red at that time.

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,880
Is it true?

250
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,520
Have you really killed so many people?

251
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,640
They deserved it.

252
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,080
How dare a bunch of rats
from the underworld

253
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,910
covet the status
of our Silver Rain Terrace.

254
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,320
The weak are the prey of the strong
in the martial world,

255
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,960
but they made such despicable acts.

256
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,760
Please.

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,580
[Maintaining the Peace]

258
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,230
Master, be careful!

259
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,670
That fire was extremely big.

260
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,280
My father was burned to ashes.

261
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,080
On that day,

262
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,080
I was supposed to enter the academy.

263
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,590
I gave up my official career,

264
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,280
but engaged in martial arts.

265
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,960
Father!

266
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,470
I've avenged you.

267
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,150
Since you have wiped out
the whole Gold Water Sect,

268
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,590
where did the assassins from earlier
come from?

269
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,350
They are the remnants.

270
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,230
They suddenly appeared two months ago.

271
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,910
After some investigation,

272
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,590
the clues pointed to Jiangnan Teahouse.

273
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,280
When I made my way there
following the trail,

274
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,550
they seemed to disappear into thin air,

275
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,550
like rats scrambling into a hole.

276
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,960
They left behind no trace.

277
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,030
Two months ago,

278
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Caiwei was hurt too.

279
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,840
If it weren't for them,

280
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,880
how could I have left Heyang?

281
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,520
Yang Caiwei wouldn't get hurt either.

282
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,680
If I get to catch them,

283
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,710
those old and new grudges,

284
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,110

Seriously? This easy?

314
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,920
Are the Silver Rain Terrace's guards

315
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,400
so lax and easily deceived?

316
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,310
It's easy for me

but not for you.

a more complicated plan.

Young Master, something's happened.

365
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,230
Someone is using your name

to swindle in the Ghost Market.

367
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,680
That person has swindled people
out of quite a lot of money.

Xiaosheng's words

369
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,800
hit the mark.

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,800
I led you there?

371
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,590
Did I send a letter asking you to come?

372
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
I've always had Fu
keeping an eye on you.

373
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,070
I just came out,

374
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,680
and the Gold Water Sect
immediately arrived.

375
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,190
Looks like
you were watching pretty closely.

376
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,640
I don't want bloodshed today.

377
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,590
Sun Zhen.

378
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:42,800
I'm here.

379
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,000
Take them all back
to the Silver Rain Terrace.

380
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,310
After the Lantern Festival,

381
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,000
question them further.

382
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,920
Yes.

383
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,400
Take them away.

384
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,520
Move.

385
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,520
Move.

386
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,040
What's the matter?

387
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,160
Were you struck
by my brilliance and handsomeness?

388
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,110
I nearly lost my life just now.

389
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,110
I'm still scared.

390
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,680
Nobody thinks you're handsome.

391
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,950
Rest assured.

392
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,950
If I can't even protect my own people,

393
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,680
how can I still live in Heyang?

394
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,110
Who are you calling your own?

395
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,560
We should go help Yang Caiwei
at the Lantern Festival.

396
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,590
Help Caiwei? Then I'm coming too.

397
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,230
Let's go.

398
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,040
Mr. Pan really kept his promise.

399
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,830
He really did organize
the Lantern Festival.

400
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,760
With the help

401
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,830
of the Silver Rain Terrace's
Young Master,

402
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,520
what else can't he accomplish?

403
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,800
Mr. Gu, I noticed something unusual

404
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,000
about you today.

405
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,830
You're quite well-informed.

406
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,760
What happened
at the Relief Hall the other day,

407
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,830
don't you know about it?

408
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,040
I've suspected it before.

409
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,470
Mr. Gu, as a grandmaster
in your own right,

410
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,400
you're supposed
to have an extraordinary demeanor.

411
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,070
But why are you acting
like you did before?

412
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,680
Mr. Gu, you haven't shown up
in a long time.

413
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,110
Don't tell me you're here tonight
just to see the lanterns.

414
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,430
What do you think?

415
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,430
I think...

416
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,470
Your presence this time

417
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,430
is definitely related to Pan Yue's case.

418
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:50,800
Want to bet on it?

419
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,310
Mr. Pan!

420
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,310
Mr. Pan!

421
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,880
Hurry up and throw the colored ball!

422
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,070
Yes, Mr. Pan.

423
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,070
Hurry up and throw it!

424
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,560
Hurry up and go grab the colored ball,
it's an auspicious thing to do!

425
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:09,760
Here we go!

426
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,110
The ceremony is about to start.

427
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,350
Why isn't Constable Liu here yet?

428
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,560
Young Lady.

429
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,160
What's wrong with you?

430
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,590
I don't know what's going on either.

431
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,400
Whenever I get nervous,
I get stomachache.

432
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,950
You're really...

433
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,430
Take him to see a physician.

434
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,350
Yes, Young Master.

435
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,000
Let's go.

436
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,070
Mr. Pan!

437
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,640
Mr. Pan!

438
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,640
Throw it to me!

439
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,400
Throw it further!

440
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,470
This way!

441
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,190
Mr. Pan shall throw the colored ball!

442
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,070
Throw it to me!

443
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,880
Throw it to me!

444
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,430
Give me some good luck!

445
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,760
Today's good luck is all mine!

446
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,110
I got it!

447
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,950
I got it!

448
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,110
I got it!

449
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,310
I got it!

450
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,430
Why isn't Constable Liu here yet?

451
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
I don't know.

452
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,040
Is there something wrong?

453
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,160
Sir, what should we do next?

454
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,310
Light the lanterns with me.

455
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,430
Sure.

456
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,680
Step aside!

457
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,190
Step aside!

458
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,190
What are you doing?

459
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,230
Who are you?

460
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,470
Shangguan Zhi?

461
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,310
What does she want?

462
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,560
I don't know.

463
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,560
Why is it her?

464
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,830
Pan Yue,

465
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,920
do you really like me?

466
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Who is this woman?

467
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,190
Who does she think she is
to light the lanterns with you?

468
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,710
Shangguan Zhi.

469
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,830
The rules of the Lantern Festival
were set in advance.

470
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,830
The first prize has already been won.

471
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,950
Stop making a fuss and go down quickly.

472
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,110
Sorry, Miss.

473
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,470
Give me the first prize!

474
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,110
I... I won't!

475
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,190
You're overestimating yourself.

476
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,590
Then don't blame me for being impolite.

477
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,400
How dare you throw away the first prize
given by Mr. Pan.

478
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,830
Are you tired of living?

479
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,680
Look at her. I thought she had changed.

480
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,880
A leopard can't change its spots.

481
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,800
Indeed. It seems like she was just
pretending all this time.

482
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,400
This is her true colors.

483
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,680
She's terrifying indeed.

484
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,830
I agree.

485
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,800
Shangguan Zhi,

486
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
stop fooling around.

487
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,800
Ze, take her away.

488
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,160
Yes!

489
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,280
Let go of me. I can walk on my own.

490
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:14,880
Pan Yue,

491
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,230
from now on, I won't bother you anymore.

492
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,680
You can't order me either.

493
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,710
I'm under the protection
of Young Master Zhuo.

494
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,800
I'll hit whoever I want.

495
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,000
Even if I kill someone,
what can you do to me?

496
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,560
I was wrong about you before.

497
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,680
Now that I see, you're nothing special.

498
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,470
Compared to Young Master Zhuo,
you're far behind.

499
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,950
A dog bone.

500
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,830
Whoever wants to grab it can grab it.

501
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,470
I'm not interested at all.

502
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,310
Sir...

503
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,520
I'm sorry to have you involved.

504
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,040
It's okay, Mr. Pan.

505
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,190
Shangguan Zhi's aim from earlier
wasn't good.

506
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,590
She didn't hit me.

507
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,280
As long as you're fine.

508
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,760
What are you looking at?

509
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,840
If you keep looking,
I'll slap your faces.

510
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,470
Shangguan Zhi is too arrogant!

511
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,230
She is scary.

512
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,000
Exactly.

513
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,950
It's time to pray.

514
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,070
It's begun.

515
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,310
It's begun.

516
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,560
Here we go.

517
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,000
Let's pray together.

518
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,400
Let's hope
for a bountiful harvest this year.

519
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,040
This dragon lantern looks really nice.

520
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,190
Yeah.

521
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,590
It looks really nice.

522
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,760
Are you Gu Shan?

523
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,590
Miss Shangguan!

524
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,470
Are you okay?

525
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,520
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

526
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,280
Let me check on you.

527
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,760
I'm really okay.

528
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,590
That gave me a fright.

529
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,710
Sir.

530
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,230
He is not dead yet.
He's just gotten a hard hit.

531
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,310
He may not come around in a while.

532
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,430
This person is as strong as an ox,
the situation was urgent.

533
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,560
I had to knock him out.

534
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,190
I caught him red-handed.

535
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,110
Ze,

536
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,280
take him to see a nearby physician.

537
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,280
Take all the manpower
and watch him closely.

538
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,000
Yes.

539
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,880
- Take him away.
- Yes.

540
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,840
Are you worried about Gu Yong?

541
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,710
He has been obstructing
our investigation before,

542
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,320
how could he just let us
take him away like this?

543
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,560
I'm worried he might kill him
to cover it up.

544
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,800
You acted so brave earlier,
are you scared now?

545
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,040
I've never thought

546
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,320
that brave people should be fearless.

547
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,560
Okay. Tonight,

548
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,600
Miss Shangguan is the great hero

549
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,320
and the greatest contributor.

550
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,000
But there can't be a next time.

551
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,710
Got it.

552
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,040
Where was that girl earlier?

553
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,230
I need to apologize to her.

554
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,390
I've already explained to her.

555
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,710
She said she could help
the county yamen with the investigation.

556
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,560
Not only did she not mind,
she was actually happy about it.

557
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,390
That's just because she respects you.

558
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,280
How could that be?

559
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,630
After all,
compared to Young Master Zhuo,

560
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,040
I'm far behind.

561
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,760
To accomplish the mission,

562
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,040
I made it all up.

563
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,520
Well... Doesn't Heyang look

564
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,190
quite beautiful today, Miss Shangguan?

565
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,520
We haven't had a chance to explore yet.

566
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,000
How about we go have a walk now?

567
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,150
Sure.

568
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,120
Let's go, Miss Shangguan.

569
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,560
Okay.

570
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,230
Sir, why don't you join us?

571
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,710
Join us?

572
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,910
Sure.

573
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,670
Let's go.

574
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,320
It's really nice!

575
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,150
Let's see over here.

576
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,520
It's nice!

577
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
There are more over there.

578
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,390
Look over there.

579
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,670
How beautiful.

580
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,000
Let's check out that side.
There are more over there.

581
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,950
Let's go!

582
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,620
[The Capital's Famous Fruits]

583
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,760
I didn't feel this way earlier.

584
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,800
After catching Gu Shan,

585
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,230
I found that Heyang is indeed beautiful.

586
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,630
Heyang hasn't been this lively
in a long time.

587
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,710
We have to thank Mr. Pan for this.

588
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,080
Let's not forget Young Master Zhuo too.

589
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,870
You two usually

590
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,800
seem quite imposing.

591
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,560
But when you meet each other,

592
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,800
both of you act differently.

593
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,670
- No way!
- No way!

594
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,360
I have the answer to this question.

595
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,870
There can't be two tigers
on one mountain.

596
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,080
We have two tigers here.

597
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,710
Make way!

598
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,360
Be careful. You're acting like a kid.

599
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,150
It's okay. Thanks.

600
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,600
You guys go ahead and enjoy yourselves.

601
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'll go find Ze.

602
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,470
Why is he leaving again?

603
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,430
I guess it's because of a black tiger.

604
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,870
The other tiger is leaving too.

605
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,600
Are you leaving too?

606
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,150
Tonight, I'm going to
express my feelings

607
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,320
to my beloved one.

608
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
You have a beloved,
and you didn't tell me about this?

609
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,910
Who is she?

610
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,870
It's because you usually

611
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,470
would only focus on the investigation

612
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,800
and care about me no more.

613
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,120
I will hang the lantern
in the middle of the bridge.

614
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,840
When the time comes,

615
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,320
remember to come
and show me some support.

616
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,600
I'll go hang the lantern now.

617
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,360
