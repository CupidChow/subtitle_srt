Was she dead before she fell?

That was just to create
an illusion of committing suicide.

stab someone to death?

00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,230
It will take many needles.

Constable Liu,

168
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,200
a long needle can hurt someone.

169
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,790
But if a gold needle

170
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,230
is as thin as cow hair,

171
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,590
it will bend
before it penetrates the human body.

172
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,230
An ordinary person
can't make a weapon like that.

173
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,230
I don't believe it.

174
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,710

any skilled goldsmiths in Heyang?

177
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,320
Let me ask them.

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,440

00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,440
There's a little progress.

188
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,760
I can't wear such a plain outfit

189
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,840
if I want to go to a gold shop.

190
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,670
You are walking quickly.

191
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,960
Where are you heading to?

192
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm going to buy some lady items.

193
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,550
I can't really tell you.

194
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,080
What is this place?

195
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,150
If I don't dress your wound, you'll die.

196
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,880
Endure it.

197
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,320
An orchid knot?

198
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,400
Those on top! We have two new guests!

199
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,230
Serve them!

200
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,320
Who sent me here?

201
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,520
It was a madam.

202
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,080
The other customers didn't say anything

203
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,760
and I didn't ask them.

204
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,520
What...

205
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,670
What did she look like?

206
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,790
She wore a white curtained hat.

207
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,230
She paid
and left the place heading south.

208
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,500
[Yake Inn]

209
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,170
Let me wrap it for you.

210
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,330
Take care.

211
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,580
[Huasheng]

212
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,520
Miss, please come inside.

213
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,110
Thank you, Miss.

214
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,840
Miss,

215
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,150
I am the manager of the shop.

216
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,230
If you want to buy any accessories,
just tell me.

217
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,110
Bring me your best gold accessories.

218
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,710
I want the ones
with the best workmanship.

219
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,590
Sure.

220
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,280
I'll go bring them for you.

221
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,440
Please wait for a moment.

222
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,670
Shangguan Zhi.

223
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,400
Mr. Pan,

224
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,470
why are you here?

225
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
I saw you leaving in a hurry

226
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,230
and was worried
that you might not bring any money.

227
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,880
I promised your brother

228
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,640
to take good care of you after all.

229
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,710
Is this the lady item you spoke about?

230
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,110
Yes.

231
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,640
However, they are ordinary.

232
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,760
There's nothing nice about them.

233
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,840
Miss.

234
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,590
The accessories you asked for
will be arriving soon.

235
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,440
I'm sure you are satisfied with them.

236
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,710
Isn't this Mr. Pan?

237
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,760
Welcome.

238
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,280
You didn't even take a look.

239
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,200
How do you know
that they are not satisfactory?

240
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,550
Miss, please take a look.

241
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,110
This.

242
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,280
This arm cuff is not bad.

243
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,030
It's very ordinary.

244
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,030
I think

245
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,280
this Chinese Crabapple Flower Hair Stick

246
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,030
matches Miss Shangguan.

247
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,080
Here.

248
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
Let me put it on for you.

249
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,590
Why?

250
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,470
Don't you like it?

251
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,960
I'm just putting the hair stick on you.

252
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,400
Why are you so nervous?

253
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,030
What do you think?

254
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,910
Mr. Pan, you have good taste.

255
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,400
A crabapple hair stick is elegant.

256
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,400
It looks nice,

257
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,880
but the Chinese crabapple flower is also
known as the Heartbreaking Flower.

258
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,200
It sounds inauspicious.

259
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,590
Especially when
this hair stick is so thin.

260
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,520
Wouldn't it be dangerous

261
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,440
if it stabs your head?

262
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,590
That's...

263
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,560
Mr. Pan, I'm sure you are joking.

264
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,070
Women are used

265
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,800
to using hair sticks since young.

266
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,470
No one will be so careless.

267
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,760
It seems like

268
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Miss Shangguan is not satisfied

269
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,800
with your shop's accessories.

270
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,070
You went there purposely to shop,

271
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,920
but why didn't you buy anything?

272
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,830
The hair stick was nice

273
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,950
but I can't wear it to work every day.

274
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,230
It's also expensive.

275
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,800
Isn't it nice to help you save money?

276
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,640
Were you trying to save money

277
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,950
or did you not find the gold needle
you were looking for?

278
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,470
I examined Yang Caiwei's body.

279
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,350
There was a wound on top of her head.

280
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,470
There were also traces
of you examining the body.

281
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,070
I also knew

282
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,190
that you enquired with Constable Liu
regarding gold needle weapons.

283
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,000
Gold needles that are as thin
as cow hair.

284
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,880
You went to the shop
to look for gold accessories only.

285
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,280
Bring me your best gold accessories.

286
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,310
Wasn't that obvious enough?

287
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,040
Shangguan Zhi.

288
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,000
The crime of hiding evidence
and obstruction of justice

289
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,000
can be serious.

290
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,590
Have you considered it?

291
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,470
Mr. Pan, you have a keen eye.

292
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,190
Nothing gets past you.

293
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,800
How did you find it?

294
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,280
I...

295
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,760
I wanted to become pretty

296
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,430
and studied books about bone structures

297
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,400
and meridians.

298
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,310
I know the skin structure well.

299
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,110
I saw Miss Yang's face was stiff,

300
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,470
so I followed the clues
and found this needle.

301
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,800
Why didn't you tell me about it?

302
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,040
Are you suspecting me?

303
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,710
No.

304
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,590
There are too many rumors

305
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,760
out there.

306
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,870
I can't accept the fact

307
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,190
that the person I've admired for years

308
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,710
is being called a heartless murderer

309
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,520
by the people out there.

310
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,000
So, I had to investigate it myself.

311
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,280
All right.

312
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,830
What did you find

313
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,400
on this trip?

314
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,800
What is he trying to do?

315
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,040
He is trying to find out what I know.

316
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,400
I can only take this one step at a time.

317
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,400
The hair stick

318
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,230
has an exquisite tip,

319
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,190
but it's not thin enough.

320
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,070
I don't think this shop can make

321
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,800
the gold needle on Miss Yang's head.

322
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,310
Huasheng is
the best accessory shop in Heyang.

323
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,830
If they can't make it,

324
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,590
other shops can't.

325
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,590
Huasheng is the largest shop,

326
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,000
but it might not be the best.

327
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,640
Heyang has so many accessory shops.

328
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,280
All of them
can sustain their business here.

329
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,040
That means
they each have their own specialities.

330
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,520
Are you planning
to investigate one by one?

331
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,350
We are buying books!

332
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,680
Buying out-of-print books
from the previous era at a high price!

333
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,920
Those who are interested,
please send them to Xinzheng Academy!

334
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,520
We are buying books!

335
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,400
Buying out-of-press books
from the previous era at a high price!

336
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,040
Those who are interested,
please send them to Xinzheng Academy!

337
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,520
Mr. Pan, I have an idea.

338
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,800
Why do we come here?

339
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,230
Mr. Pan, please sit for a while.

340
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
I will investigate

341
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,280
all the gold shops in Heyang
within two hours.

342
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,470
Mr. Pan,

343
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,710
what do you want to drink?

344
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,040
Isn't this the drunk kid from yesterday?

345
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,400
What?

346
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Are you trying to
cause trouble again today?

347
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,180
[Wine]

348
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,710
Let me ask you a question.

349
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,470
Yes, sir.

350
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,800
After I got drunk yesterday,

351
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,000
who took me away?

352
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,880
A man and a woman.

353
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,110
I couldn't recognize

354
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,520
the man.

355
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,640
His outfit looked like a young master's.

356
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,590
The woman looked like a noble lady.

357
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,160
We don't know much about it.

358
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,350
Calm down.

359
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,070
I know.

360
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,430
The silver she paid
is weight a whole tael.

361
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,950
You can only obtain that silver
in the capital.

362
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,350
It's easy.

363
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,350
If you investigate

364
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,280
all the women
who came here from the capital,

365
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,280
you will be able to find her.

366
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,070
Young Warrior.

367
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,950
[Heyang Magistrate's Office]

368
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,470
Is she here now?

369
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,400
She went out.

370
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,070
Young Warrior, I asked about it.

371
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,520
There's a woman from the capital

372
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,230
called Miss Shangguan
at the county yamen.

373
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,040
However, she's not there right now.

374
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,430
I'll wait.

375
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,920
Have you given up so soon?

376
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,070
Calm down, Mr. Pan.

377
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm learning from you.

378
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,920
Sitting and waiting.

379
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,760
This must be Jiangnan Teahouse.

380
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,880
- Over here!
- This is the place!

381
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,520
Mr. Pan!

382
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,000
Let's go.

383
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,830
Mr. Pan!

384
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,400
Mr. Pan, take a look.

385
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,520
Take a look at mine.

386
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,590
- Mr. Pan.
- Mr. Pan.

387
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,470
Don't rush!

388
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,640
- Don't rush!
- Look at mine!

389
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,190
Me first!

390
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,560
- Mr. Pan!
- Mr. Pan!

391
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,710
How did you do it?

392
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,280
No one gets up early with no benefits.

393
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,680
I just offered a huge reward.

394
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,110
Line up. Don't rush.

395
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,160
My accessories are in a mess.

396
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,110
Go and line up.

397
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,280
Mr. Pan.

398
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,560
Mr. Pan, look.

399
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,830
I'm sure
the princess will like my accessory.

400
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,680
The princess?

401
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,340
[Notice, The magistrate, Mr. Pan, is
choosing an accessory for the princess.]

402
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,840
[He needs a golden hair stick
which requires fine craftsmanship.]

403
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,940
[The chosen craftsman will be invited
to attend the royal wedding.]

404
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,000
You are trying to achieve your goal
by hook or by crook.

405
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,070
Thank you for your praise.

406
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,760
Next.

407
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,070
Mr. Pan, take a look.

408
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,710
Next.

409
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,640
That's enough. Leave.

410
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,950
Mr. Pan,

411
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,830
these are the best hair sticks
in our shop.

412
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,640
Take a look.

413
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,520
Thank you, Miss.

414
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,070
Next.

415
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,880
Yours won't do.

416
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,880
Here, Mr. Pan.

417
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,040
Take a look at mine.

418
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,950
I have all the best products.

419
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,350
Look at the craftsmanship.

420
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,560
Right?

421
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,680
Next.

422
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,590
Thank you.

423
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,830
Mr. Pan, take a look at mine.

424
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,000
Mr. Pan, please take a look.

425
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,000
Which craftsman made this piece?

426
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,680
The product is made by Jin Liulang,

427
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,190
the best craftsman in Heyang.

428
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,470
Jin Liulang?

429
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,760
Who is he?

430
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,560
Jin Liulang is a genius.

431
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
He is ingenious.

432
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,310
No one in Heyang can compare to him

433
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,110
when it comes to fine craftsmanship.

434
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,190
Where is he now?

435
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,560
He was a fine craftsman.

436
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,070
Unfortunately,
he had an accident last month.

437
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,110
He's dead.

438
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,350
Dead?

439
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,560
Is anybody home?

440
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,190
Is anybody home?

441
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,640
Coming.

442
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,950
Who is it?

443
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,560
Is this Jin Liulang's house?

444
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,430
Who are you?

445
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,830
Granny,

446
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,230
he is the new magistrate,
Pan Yue, Mr. Pan.

447
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,110
He suspected something was wrong
with Liulang's death

448
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,880
so he came to investigate.

449
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,640
Mr. Pan?

450
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,280
Yes.

451
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,640
We are just going to ask
a couple of questions.

452
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,760
We'll leave after that.

453
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,230
We won't disturb you for too long.

454
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,560
Don't worry. We are not bad people.

455
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,040
All right. Come inside.

456
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,520
Granny, be careful.

457
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,160
Granny, please sit.

458
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,590
Granny,

459
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,950
the room is so dark.

460
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,070
Why won't you light the lamps?

461
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,280
These lamps

462
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,040
were made by Liulang.

463
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,160
He was ingenious.

464
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,230
He knew I had bad eyesight

465
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,640
and couldn't see a thing

466
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,280
when it was dim,

467
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,070
so he made these lamps.

468
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,800
When I pulled this rope,

469
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,560
all the lamps would be lit.

470
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,110
However,

471
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,230
after his death,

472
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,590
all the lamps were broken.

473
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,710
They could no longer be used.

474
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,000
Granny,

475
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,350
let me help you take a look.

476
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,160
Granny,

477
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,400
the lamp cannot be lit
because it has run out of oil.

478
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,590
Wait for a while.

479
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,640
All right, Granny. They can be used now.

480
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,470
Miss, thank you.

481
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,110
Thank you.

482
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,230
Granny,

483
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,400
which day did Liulang die?

484
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,110
The 17th day of last month.

485
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,310
A day before the wedding.

486
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,400
Can you tell us

487
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,040
what happened?

488
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,040
No one can predict anything

489
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,230
in life.

490
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,680
That day,

491
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,190
Liulang accepted a large amount of money

492
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,640
and worked all day at home.

493
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,400
He made the accessory

494
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,470
and sent it to his customer.

495
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,920
Mother.

496
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,470
Before he left,

497
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,760
he said the amount of money he received
was enough for us to spend for a year.

498
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,110
We had to drink some wine to celebrate.

499
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,830
I even felt happy for him.

500
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,160
However,

501
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,280
he didn't come back even until midnight.

502
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,310
The next day,

503
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,310
the fishermen by the river

504
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,400
said they discovered
a drowned body in the river.

505
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,350
It was Liulang.

506
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,310
What accessory did Liulang make?

507
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,310
I didn't see it clearly.

508
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,830
Granny,

509
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,110
do you know
who is Liulang's new customer?

510
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,280
The new customer
hasn't visited this house.

511
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,280
Did you report it to the officials?

512
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,880
Did the magistrate
find anything back then?

513
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
He did.

514
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,680
He said he got drunk and drowned.

515
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,110
I'm just a blind old woman.

516
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,920
I had no choice
but to accept his explanation.

517
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,430
Where is Liulang buried now?

518
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,760
Granny,

519
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,680
this is really fishy.

520
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,350
We want to investigate it.

521
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,880
We hope you can agree to it.

522
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,430
Fine.

towards you, Mr. Pan.

She is not the only one

527
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,950
reflect on yourself then?

at the county yamen.

Why do you have to die?

532

You've become a wandering spirit

When people die,

536
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,280
they don't become immortals

537

00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,560
There's one thing

559
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,230
that I want to tell you alone.

560
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Actually,

561
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,000
Liulang's new customer

562
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,560
came to visit.

563
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,640
Is this Jin Liulang's house?

564
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,590
Yes.

565
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,920
What is it?

566
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,710
I want to make something.

567
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,830
I need it tomorrow.

568
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,160
I still have some work to do.

569
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,800
I don't think I can make it tomorrow.

570
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,400
I'll pay you 100 taels of silver.

571
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,950
Liulang never drinks much.

572
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,920
Why would he get drunk
and fall into the lake?

573
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,160
I'm guessing

574
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,950
that it was the new customer
who didn't want to pay him

575
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,560
so he murdered Liulang

576
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,560
and threw his body into the lake.

577
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,070
The previous magistrate
was too lazy to put in an effort.

578
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,160
He asked me to find clues.

579
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,880
He said I had to find a suspect

580
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,190
before I could report it.

581
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,310
There are so many people.

582
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,950
Where can I find a suspect?

583
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,310
Until today,

584
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,950
I heard the voice again.

585
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,070
Granny, are you saying...

586
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,640
I suspect

587
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,880
the murderer is Mr. Pan.

588
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,560
Granny,

589
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,640
did you make a mistake?

590
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,280
I can't see well

591
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,560
but I have a good sense of hearing.

592
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,710
Mr. Pan and that man

593
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,960
said the same thing.

594
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,430
Is this Jin Liulang's house?

595
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,640
Their voice and tone

596
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,670
were similar.

597
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,670
I will never forget the voice

598
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,760
even if I die.

599
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,760
It's him indeed.

600
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,950
I must examine the body quickly

601
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,360
and leave this place.

602
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,540
[Jin Liulang's Grave]

603
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,760
Mr. Pan.

604
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,670
You've returned so quickly.

605
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,910
I asked the cart driver to return
to the office to make a report.

606
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,080
You are digging the body up so soon.

607
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,470
Yes.

608
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,470
You are quite strong.

609
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,630
Are you not going to come up?

610
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,390
The county yamen
will send someone to dig it up.

611
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,870
You don't need to do it.

612
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,320
Thank you.

613
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,040
You are very afraid of me.

614
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,190
No.

615
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,840
I'm scared because
it is my first time digging a grave.

616
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,190
That is why I'm feeling restless.
Well...

617
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,430
I'll be going back.

618
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,910
Shangguan Zhi.

619
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,800
What are you hiding?

620
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,430
I thought you got excited

621
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,870
and wanted to play a game
of investigating a case

622
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,520
but not only did you lie to me

623
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,840
but you also hid evidence.

624
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,230
You are also afraid of me now.

625
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,840
The shock at that moment

626
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,320
was your true reaction, right?

627
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,520
I'll risk it.

628
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,600
That's right.

629
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,710
I am afraid of you

630
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:23,840
because

631
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,710
I suspect you are the murderer
who killed Miss Yang.

632
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,080
You also killed Jin Liulang.

633
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,470
However,

634
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,600
you can't kill me.

635
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,710
I left a letter.

636
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,870
If I don't go back

637
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,520
and Ling reads my letter,

638
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,390
she will expose what you did

639
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,430
to the public.

640
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,470
My brother won't forgive you as well.

641
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,760
Why are you laughing?

642
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,040
You went to the stone house
in the peach blossom forest.

643
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,390
If I am the murderer,

644
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,910
why would I preserve the body

645
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,760
and leave the gold needle

646
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,710
for you to find?

647
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,800
You prioritize reputation.

648
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,670
You want everyone to think

649
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,230
that you are someone
who values a relationship

650
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,080
and not an ungrateful jerk

651
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,630
who only wants the princess.

652
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,150
Otherwise, why wouldn't you
find a coroner to examine the body

653
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,600
even after Silver Rain Terrace
reported it?

654
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,200
The previous coroner examined it.

655
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,360
He didn't find anything.

656
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,430
After I became the magistrate,

657
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,150
I spoke with Chen San

658
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,800
to see if he was a reliable person.

659
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,840
However, Chen San

660
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,470
is not capable.

661
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,190
He is unreliable.

662
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,230
So, I invited a famous coroner
from the capital.

663
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,710
He was poisoned
when he arrived in Heyang yesterday.

664
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,710
Ze is still trying to cure him.

665
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,710
Mr. Pan, the man you invited
has arrived in Heyang.

666
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,150
I've always thought
Yang Caiwei's death was weird,

667
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,950
but I couldn't find any clues

668
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,080
until this problem

669
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,120
was solved by you

670
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,560
who was interested in skin care.

671
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,670
You even found the gold needle.

672
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
You solved the doubts in my mind.

673
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,670
If you still think I am the murderer,

674
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,000
suit yourself.

675
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,870
I won't stop you.

676
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,840
- Mr. Pan.
- Mr. Pan.

677
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,710
Dig.

678
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,710
Do it.

679
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,360
Yes.

680
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,080
Mr. Pan,

681
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,320
there's no sand in the body's throat.

682
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
There are also no signs of struggle
after he fell into the water.

683
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,390
He was thrown into the water
after he died.

684
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,080
It's a murder.

685
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,910
What about the real cause of death?

686
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,470
Mr. Pan,

687
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,520
the body is rotten.

688
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,910
I can't find the cause.

689
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,560
Why is his stomach bloated?

690
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,910
The victim was soaked in the water

691
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,840
and swallowed a lot of water.

692
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,560
Isn't it normal
to have a bloated stomach?

693
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,280
Why did I hear

694
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,870
that a person wouldn't swallow water
if he was dead inside the water?

695
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,280
Miss Shangguan.

696
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,190
You are a woman. You know nothing.

697
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,950
I've been a coroner
for more than a decade.

698
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,470
Trust me...

699
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,190
What?

700
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,430
Cut the body open.

701
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,000
Yes, Mr. Pan.

702
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,190
What is this?

703
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,840
Mr. Pan, it's silver.

704
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,600
Mr. Pan,

705
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,430
the victim was forced by the murderer

706
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,000
to swallow these silver pieces.

707
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
He died because his intestines ruptured.

708
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
Are you not afraid of me now?

709
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,000
1,000 taels?

710
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,520
I think this is a chip
from Life and Death House.

711
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,280
Why is it inside Jin Liulang's stomach?

712
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,430
Swallow them!

713
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,630
Hurry!

714
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,230
Otherwise,
I'll kill your blind mother too!

715
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,430
- Hurry!
- I'll swallow them.

716
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,950
Don't kill my mother.

717
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,390
I'll swallow them.

718
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,150
Jin Liulang was forced
to swallow the silver.

719
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,080
He knew he couldn't escape death

720
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,760
so he swallowed this into his stomach

721
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,760
before the murderer could realize.

722
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,150
Jin Liulang was aggrieved

723
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,670
and left a piece of evidence

724
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,120
that pointed to the murderer
before his death.

725
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,950
Whether it was killing Jin Liulang

726
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,670
or Miss Yang,

727
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,230
the murderer made them
look like an accident.

728
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,520
That means the murderer
is hoping for a perfect crime.

729
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
If a person like this

730
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,520
knows that he left evidence behind,

731
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,080
he would surely do something.

732
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,150
The value of the chip is high.

733
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,670
The murderer might be a regular
at the Life and Death House.

734
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,280
Mr. Pan,

735
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,080
we need to go there.

736
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,040
It's me.

737
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,520
Not us.

738
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,840
I've said what I have to.

739
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,080
Just do what you should

740
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,430
and don't meddle

741
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,910
in other things.

742
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,190
Mr. Pan.

743
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,670
Did I really misunderstand him?

744
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,520
[Heyang Magistrate's Office]

745
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:57,950
Mr. Pan.

746
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,280
Look carefully.

747
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,280
Was she the one who paid you?

748
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,520
Yes.

749
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:05,910
It was her.

750
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,150
Miss Shangguan.

751
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,520
Why would a noble lady from the capital

752
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,760
help me?

753
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,630
Why would she know
Yang Caiwei's orchid knot?

754
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:35,710
Miss.

755
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:39,520
Miss,

756
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,560
aren't these a coroner's tools?

757
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,390
Why do you have them?

758
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,600
I've been helping Mr. Pan
investigate the case recently, right?

759
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,470
So I'm learning some coroner's skills.

760
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,360
But these tools are used on dead people.

761
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,470
How scary.

762
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,670
Wasn't Miss Yang a coroner?

763
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,390
Since Mr. Pan married her,

764
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,840
that means it's his type,

765
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,280
so

766
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,190
I have to be like her.

767
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,120
Miss,

768
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,710
you really like Mr. Pan so much.

769
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,120
Oh, Ling.

770
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,760
Did you see Ze yesterday?

771
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,470
We live in the same house.

772
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,840
It's hard not to meet him.

773
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,430
I heard

774
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,190
he went to meet someone yesterday.

775
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,760
Do you know who he went to meet?

776
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,520
Or do you think

777
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,430
he was acting weirdly?

778
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,710
Last night...

779
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,910
Sorry.

780
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,800
Why is there so much medicine?

781
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,080
Are you sick?

782
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,600
It all matches.

783
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,320
If what Pan Yue said was true,

784
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,910
what's going on with the groom I saw?

785
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,040
Why would Jin Liulang's mother say

786
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,950
she heard Pan Yue's voice before?

787
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,710
Yang Caiwei,

788
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,000
