00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,840
I'm eating and sleeping well.

186
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,880
There's no one to order me around

187
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,960
and I don't have to be scolded.

188
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,110
It's free and comfortable.

189
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,000
I heard you went to the pier
with Young Master Zhuo two days ago.

190
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,110
We got into some trouble.

191
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,280
It's quite good.

192
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,400
Quite good?

193
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Do you think it's quite good
for me to get into trouble?

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,520
I meant it's quite good
that the trouble was resolved

195
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,590
and you could come back
to investigate the case.

196
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,110
Mr. Pan,

197
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,910
do you feel uncomfortable
and keep trying to find a topic

198
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,960
because I'm in the carriage?

199
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,030
No. It has been a long time
since we met each other,

200
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,320
so I was showing some concern.

201
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,760
We just met yesterday.

202
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,180
[Xinzheng Academy]

203
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,150
Mr. Pan,
I didn't know you would be visiting,

204
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,110
[Xinzheng Academy]
Sorry for not welcoming you.

205
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,550
Please forgive me.

206
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,760
Mr. Chen, you are too polite.

207
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,790
Xinzheng Academy is
the official academy of Heyang.

208
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,400
It nurtures many talents.

209
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,910
It is the holy sanctuary
for Heyang's scholars.

210
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,760
I've always wanted to visit

211
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,200
and immerse myself
in the academic atmosphere.

212
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Xinzheng Academy is honored
to welcome Mr. Pan.

213
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,030
Please come inside.

214
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,280
This way, please.

215
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,150
Even the servants

216
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,880
of Xinzheng Academy are well-mannered.

217
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,400
That's too much praise.

218
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,880
They have been here for a long time

219
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,320
and influenced by scholars
of the academy.

220
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,280
Hence, the people of the world

221
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,550
listened

222
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,350
and stood firm,

223
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,710
and stayed silent in fear.

224
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,000
The three rulers lost their way.

225
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,030
Loyal officers do not give advice
and strategists do not give ideas.

226
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,110
Hence, the people of the world

227
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,520
listened,

228
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,790
stood firm,

229
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,000
and stayed silent in fear.

230
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,910
The three rulers lost their way.

231
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,790
Loyal officers do not give advice
and strategists do not give ideas.

232
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,030
Mr. Pan. This way, please.

233
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,150
Mr. Pan.

234
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,320
These are articles

235
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,550
written by our academy's students.

236
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,710
Please take a look at them.

237
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,640
The three rulers lost their way.

238
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,280
Loyal officers do not give advice
and strategists do not give ideas.

239
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,960
All of them are insightful.

240
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,880
Xinzheng Academy is indeed amazing.

241
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,150
That's too much praise.

242
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,550
Stood firm,

243
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,760
and stayed silent in fear.

244
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,670
The three rulers lost their way.

245
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,320
Loyal officers do not give advice
and strategists do not give ideas.

246
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,030
Mr. Chen,

247
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,790
Which student wrote this article?

248
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,150
Mr. Pan, please take a look.

249
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,910
Stood firm,

250
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,000
and stayed silent in fear.

251
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,350
The three rulers lost their way.

252
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,320
Loyal officers do not give advice
and strategists do not give ideas.

253
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,840
Hence, the people of the world

254
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,400
listened...

255
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,550
Excuse me.

256
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,110
I want to ask you about someone.

257
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,950
Who?

258
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,470
There was a Ghostly Fire Case before.

259
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,430
Do you know the suspect, Shen Ci?

260
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,040
I don't know him.

261
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,880
Why is this room covered
with black cloth during the day?

262
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,350
This is...

263
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,110
This is my son's room.

264
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,470
I've heard about your son.

265
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,590
It is really unfortunate.

266
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,350
Since my son became blind,

267
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,280
he became delirious
and always walked towards the light.

268
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,760
To be safe,

269
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,520
I have no choice
but to cover the room with black cloth.

270
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,830
Can I go inside and take a look?

271
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,800
Go ahead.

272
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,190
Mr. Chen,

273
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,110
Miss Shangguan is well-versed in curses.

274
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,280
Why don't you let her take a look?

275
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,430
Thank you, Miss Shangguan.

276
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,710
Here.

277
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,920
Come here.

278
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,880
As far as I know,

279
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,830
the suspect is a scholar.

280
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,400
He is currently imprisoned
in the county yamen's jail.

281
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,760
I want to know

282
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,830
how a weak scholar

283
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,350
can do all these.

284
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,430
As a student of Confucianism,

285
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,430
we don't talk about the supernatural.

286
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,590
I don't know how he did it.

287
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,310
But when this happened to my son,

288
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,560
he kept repeating his name.

289
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,310
It can be no one else but him.

290
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,350
I pity my son for suffering.

291
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,110
In order to keep my son alive,

292
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,000
I went to the prison
to beg the murderer a few times

293
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,800
to spare my son.

294
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,560
However, he was heartless

295
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,110
and wouldn't budge.

296
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,430
I think the academy is weird.

297
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,110
When I asked a student,

298
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,710
he was terrified and ran away

299
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,230
when I mentioned

300
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,160
Shen Ci's name.

301
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,070
I think someone silenced them.

302
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,560
Mr. Pan, why do you say that?

303
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,000
The students were acting uniformly.

304
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,640
It didn't feel normal.

305
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,470
It seemed
as if everything had been rehearsed.

306
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,280
Besides,

307
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,070
Did you hear what they were reciting?

308
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,800
Hence, the people of the world

309
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,830
listened,

310
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,640
stood firm...

311
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,190
The Faults of Qin?

312
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,800
Yes.

313
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,110
That article spoke about

314
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,950
people of the world
who could only listen

315
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,160
but couldn't speak.

316
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,400
Then...

317
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,830
Who silenced them?

318
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,920
It might be Shen Ci's classmate

319
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,470
or Mr. Chen.

320
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,310
Mr. Chen is a victim.

321
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,470
Reasonably speaking,
he would want the case to be solved

322
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,800
and punish Shen Ci for his crimes.

323
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,110
There is no reason for him to do that.

324
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,950
Mr. Pan, let's go to the hill.

325
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,590
I have a feeling

326
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,160
that the forest haunting is weird.

327
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,740
[Maintaining the Peace]

328
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,160
Young Master.

329
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,040
We found the person
who escaped from prison.

330
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,640
When I chased him here,

331
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,110
someone arrived before me

332
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,590
and killed him.

333
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,680
Did you see that person's face?

334
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,830
I didn't see his face,

335
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,680
but when he killed with his sword,

336
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,560
there was something odd
about his right shoulder.

337
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,230
Young Master, we found
remnants of the Gold Water Sect.

338
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,560
To be safe,

339
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,470
you can't go back for now.

340
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,400
I have to bother you
to stay here for a few days.

341
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,040
The Gold Water Sect

342
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,000
is not enough
to make me hide in this shell.

343
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,160
Young Master.

344
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,640
Gold Water Sect is cruel
and uses despicable methods.

345
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,000
Three years ago,

346
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,310
The old chief was plotted against.

347
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,430
Young Master must never be careless.

348
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,640
Young Master, please be cautious!

349
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,430
If you don't agree to it,

350
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
I will kneel forever.

351
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,070
Young Master, why did you call me here?

352
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,110
Young Master.

353
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,000
It has been a long time
since we sparred against each other.

354
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,190
After so many years,

355
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,110
you still haven't changed your habit
of shrugging your shoulders.

356
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,670
When I learned sword techniques
from my master,

357
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,400
I always made mistakes

358
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,470
and my Master would whip
my right shoulder.

359
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,760
Perhaps it was traumatic for me.

360
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,070
I can't even change it now.

361
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,760
I ask you to come here

362
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,760
because I want to ask you

363
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,070
if you've investigated the escape

364
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,160
of Gold Water Sect's remnants.

365
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,800
I have.

366
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,960
The spy relied on
his close relationship with the guard

367
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,590
and attracted the guard's attention

If you are talking about
failure in leading subordinates,

I'm the one who should be blamed.

in romantic relationships

But he was the old chief's foster son.

386

to Silver Rain Terrace.

with the Gold Water Sect.

389
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,520
Perhaps it is due to our relationship

390
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,680
that he only distracted me

391
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,950
or held me back usually

392

with the Ripple Organization's matters.

What is this?

413

The reason why this forest
is called the Haunting Forest

414
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,760
is because people who come here
can't get out.

00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,470
Male.

554
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,600
His age

555
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,670
is between 20 to 25.

556
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,470
No signs of poisoning.

557
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,230
The teeth did not fall completely.

558
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,470
This tooth...

559
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,870
Mr. Pan, are you looking for me?

560
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,430
Eat. Don't say that I'm mistreating you.

561
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,320
It seems like this new cook
has impressed you.

562
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,150
Miss Shangguan.

563
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,360
Jiang, why are you here?

564
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,670
Just leave it here.

565
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,560
Sure.

566
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,800
This is...

567
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,150
I heard from Ling
that you've come back to work here.

568
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,040
I'm worried
that someone might mistreat you,

569
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,600
so I asked her to make some dishes.

570
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,120
It seems like my timing is right.

571
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,760
Mr. Pan, let's eat together.

572
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,190
Mr. Pan is annoyed when he sees us.

573
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,840
I think he wants some peace.

574
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,710
Let's eat.

575
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,760
Come. Eat first.

576
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,360
Eat. They are all your favorite dishes.

577
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,120
This.

578
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,520
Mr. Pan, I've warmed the wine.

579
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,600
There are so many dishes.

580
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,190
Can you finish them alone?

581
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,840
It wasn't supposed to be for me.

582
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,360
You've worked hard doing rounds.
This is your reward.

583
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,080
Really? Thank you, Mr. Pan.

584
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,150
Can you be mindful when you eat?

585
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,470
You have rice on your face!

586
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,630
You ruined my appetite.

587
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,190
Sorry, Mr. Pan.

588
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,430
Did Pan Yue show you a long face today?

589
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,670
Why? Are you going to defend me?

590
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,230
Yes.

591
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,080
If he makes you cry again,

592
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,080
I will kill him.

593
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,040
Stop joking.

594
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,430
He didn't show me a long face,

595
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,280
but it felt weird.

596
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,390
It felt like he was trying
to find faults with me.

597
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,040
However...

598
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,320
We won't get separated by doing this.

599
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,320
Young Master, we are here.

600
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,000
What is it?

601
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,840
It's nothing.

602
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,390
I'm tired from running around.

603
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,320
I'm going back to sleep.

604
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,430
You should rest early.

605
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,800
He didn't show me a long face,

606
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,230
but it felt weird.

607
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,520
It felt like he was
trying to find faults with me.

608
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,150
However...

609
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,760
Why are you drinking alone here?

610
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,870
Great timing. Join me.

611
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,670
Are you drinking out of sadness

612
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,230
after you got rejected by Caiwei?

613
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,320
Are you underestimating me?

614
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm not afraid to be rejected by her.

615
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,470
I'm afraid

616
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,150
that she already has

617
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:08,800
someone else in her heart.

618
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,670
Forget it. You won't understand.

619
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,520
Of course I do.

620
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,950
What? Do you have someone you like too?

621
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:32,630
I am different from all of you.

622
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,840
You only know about love.

623
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,140
Isn't it similar to a customer
visiting your shop,

624
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,670
talking to you for half a day,
and negotiating three times

625
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,560
before buying from someone else?

626
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,080
If she doesn't appreciate you,
there will be someone who does.

627
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,130
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

628
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,040
Forget it. Let's drink.

629
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,150
Do you want to eat?

630
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,600
The glutinous rice balls sold
by the lady over there are delicious.

631
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,630
Let me buy you a bowl.

632
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:16,670
It's my treat.

633
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,800
Lady, give me a bowl
of glutinous rice balls.

634
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:25,670
Sure.

635
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,360
I'm leaving the money here.

636
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:47,120
Xiaosheng?

637
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,560
We haven't met for years.

638
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,390
I didn't recognize you
as you look so pretty now.

639
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,470
If I knew this,

640
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,320
I would not let you go back then.

641
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,670
Don't be in a rush to leave.

642
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,950
I'm not done yet.

643
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,430
I have nothing to say to you. Let go.

644
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,470
Why are you acting arrogantly?

645
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,800
Think about it.

646
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,320
You would've been dead

647
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,150
if it wasn't for me.

648
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,870
Let go.

649
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:17,760
Help!

650
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,390
How dare you!

651
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,680
Help!

652
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:20,840
Help!

653
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,040
Do you have a death wish?

654
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,360
Stop. Don't kill him.

655
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,600
Zhuo Lanjiang, let him leave!

656
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,040
Zhuo Lanjiang, let him leave!

657
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,150
I'll leave!

658
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:39,600
I'll leave!

659
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,840
Why aren't you asking anything?

660
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,430
If you won't tell me,

661
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,630
I won't ask.

662
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:28,560
If you want to tell me,

663
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,320
I'll listen.

664
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:58,560
I lost my father when I was young.

665
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:02,430
My mother was a gambler.

666
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,320
Whenever I woke up,

667
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:13,670
there would be
debt collectors at my house.

668
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,080
One day, my mother told me

669
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,600
he could take me away from Heyang

670
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:24,390
to rely on a rich cousin.

671
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,360
She said

672
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,040
we could begin a new life there.

673
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,390
You didn't know
how happy I was back then.

674
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,470
Mother, where are we going?

675
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,470
To a very good place.

676
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,000
There will no longer be debt collectors

677
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:58,910
and you won't need to worry
about food and clothing anymore.

678
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,280
How long does it take to get there?

679
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,320
Xiaosheng, sleep for now.

680
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:05,320
I'll wake you up when we arrive.

681
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:13,760
When I woke up,

682
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,150
we did arrive at a place.

683
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:22,230
The place looked rich,

684
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,560
but it wasn't my cousin.

685
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,710
It was a place where my mother sold me

686
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,950
for ten taels of silver.

687
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,670
She abandoned me

688
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,950
and never came back.

689
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,000
I was only ten years old that year.

690
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:48,470
Later,

691
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,560
I found an opportunity to escape.

692
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,190
I begged and stole

693
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,390
to feed myself.

694
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,670
When I had some savings,

695
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,950
I started a small business.

696
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:04,910
Anyway,

697
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,360
I spent ten times the money

698
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,280
to redeem myself.

699
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,230
This is the reason

700
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,280
why you like making money so much.

701
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:25,840
Even my mother was not reliable.

702
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,280
Money is the most important thing.

703
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,000
It's fine.

704
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:34,910
It's bustling when there's profit.

705
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,230
It's empty when profit goes away.

706
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,230
Isn't it the same for people as well?

707
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:44,710
You lie to me and I lie to you.

708
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,040
Let me teach you a trick.

709
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,280
Whenever you are sad,

710
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,190
just eat something sweet.

711
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,150
When you feel sad in the future,

712
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,470
you will remember

713
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:06,840
the sweetness in your mouth.

714
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,470
It will wash away your sadness.

715
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,800
Are you coaxing a child?

716
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,000
Besides, I'm not sad now.

717
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,520
Think of it

718
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,080
as giving to the ten-year-old Xiaosheng.

719
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,840
You are so foolish.

720
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,900
[Heyang Magistrate's Office]

721
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:06,390
Mr. Pan.

722
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,000
Wait until everyone's here.

723
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,630
Mr. Pan, are you waiting
for Miss Shangguan?

724
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,190
I'm waiting for Constable Liu.

725
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,200
[The filling of the molar is made
from tin and silver foil.]

726
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,500
[It is a common method to repair
a decayed tooth in the Yongqi period.]

727
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,080
Why isn't she here yet?

728
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,280
Did Zhuo Lanjiang do something

729
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,190
to stop her from coming?

730
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:40,120
Mr. Pan.

731
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:42,080
Mr. Pan,

732
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,230
I examined the body

733
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:45,520
and found a black molar

734
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,430
on the body.

735
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,230
I spent a lot of effort

736
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,000
cleaning it with tooth powder

737
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,120
and discovered that the center
of the molar is filled with tin and...

738
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,080
Tin and...

739
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,430
And silver foil, right?

740
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,040
That's right. Silver foil.

741
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,430
I met Shuang on the way.

742
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,520
I especially bought it for you.

743
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,630
Especially for me?

744
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:16,910
Mr. Pan.

745
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:18,600
Time to have some iced beverages.

746
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,710
All right. Thank you.

747
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:22,840
Here you go.

748
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:25,190
Delicious.

749
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,560
It's quite delicious.

750
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:38,710
Chen San.

751
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,320
Keep talking.

752
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,150
Mr. Pan, the center of the molar

753
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,000
is an amalgam made from
tin, silver foil, and mercury.

754
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,000
Physicians among the folk use this

755
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,430
to fill the space in a tooth.

756
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:53,000
However, the silver foil
turns black easily when it is buried

757
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,000
for too long.

758
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:56,950
Turns black?

759
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,840
Are you saying

760
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:03,230
that the victim had his molar restored
when he was alive?

761
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,710
That's right.

762
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,520
Mr. Pan, from the condition
of the amalgam's wear and tear,

763
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,710
it hadn't been used for too long.

764
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,670
It should be used for
about a year or two.

765
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,190
Find every physician who knows
how to restore a tooth in Heyang.

766
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,430
We must find out this person's identity.

767
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:19,080
Yes!

768
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,230
That's right. I restored this tooth.

769
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,720
I always add a little mercury
to the teeth I've restored.

770
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,430
Not many physicians in Heyang

771
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,560
are willing to use mercury.

772
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:35,230
Do you still remember who the person is?

773
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:39,320
I can't remember which person
from Xinzheng Academy came,

774
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,470
but I always keep a record
whenever I go for house calls.

775
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,390
Perhaps there's a record on the ledger.

776
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:53,630
Found it.

777
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,600
Two years ago,
I restored a decayed tooth.

778
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,230
The fee was two taels of silver.

779
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,870
The patient's name was

780
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:01,360
Shen Ci.

781
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,460

782

[Tooth decay treatment,
treatment fee, two taels of silver]

783
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,870

00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,040
