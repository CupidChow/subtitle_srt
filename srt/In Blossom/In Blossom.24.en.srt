From the wounds
and binding marks on the body,

[Xun, Wind]
it can be concluded

33
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,910
that when the victim was alive,

34
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,240
the victim was bound, bled to death,

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,030
and turned into a mummy.

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,000

She must have been killed elsewhere.

Her body was then placed
in a liquor vat.

Master,

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,390
since you have conducted

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
a detailed investigation at that time,

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,520
why aren't these records

in the dossier?

44
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,440
At that time,
murders happened frequently.

45
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,240
All autopsies were simply done.

46
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,630
We had to rush
to the next crime scene after that.

After the magistrate closed the case,

I still couldn't forget these cases.

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,160
So I secretly did some investigations

50

00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,880
Let's stay here for now.

187
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,840
I'll try him again
when there's a chance.

188
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,200
Give me your hand.

189
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,760
What are you doing?

190
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,440
Master said

191
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,880
you'd easily get cold.

192
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,320
At night,

193
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,760
your hands and feet would feel cold.

194
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,080
I did some research.

195
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,760
Pressing these acupoints

196
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,840
helps you get rid of the cold qi.

197
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,150
Is this the point?

198
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,880
That's the point. Press harder.

199
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,440
Here?

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,640
Dear,

201
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,350
are you pleased?

202
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,640
Not bad.

203
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,030
Then...

204
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,470
Can I get some rewards?

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,590
Who's there?

206
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,760
Excuse me,

207
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,440
it is prohibited
to walk around Luoyun Sect at night.

208
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,710
You two must not leave your room.

209
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,440
This isn't a prison.

210
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,960
Why is there such a rule?

211
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,440
Master Xue chants scriptures
at the hour of Zi every day.

212
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,000
The power of the Heavenly Master
has no bounds.

213
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,280
Encountering him might affect
your fortune and lifespan.

214
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,000
Is this Menghua Incense?

215
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,080
This incense
makes people lose themselves.

216
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,710
Why would a sect master
use such incense?

How was it?

255
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,790
In Xue Jianli's room,

256
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,080
there's a secret chamber
with a mechanism.

257
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,640
Someone is chanting inside.

258
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,590
A master chanting in a secret chamber...

259
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,790
This is weird.

260
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,320
I'll investigate more tomorrow.

261
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Jiang,

262
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,840
that person from the capital
is vengeful.

263
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,400
You can stay alive

264
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,910
only if I die.

265
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,960
Father!

266
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,550
You're awake.

267
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,520
Are you hungry?
I cooked something for you.

268
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,590
Why haven't you left yet?

269
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,550
I came to the capital for businesses.

270
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,030
I haven't found a place to stay yet.

271
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,350
Yesterday, I saw this house
and thought it was nice.

272
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,000
So, I contacted the landlord

273
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,320
to rent the east wing room.

274
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,710
Bai Xiaosheng,

275
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,550
I'm not here for fun.

276
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,550
You're only asking for trouble.

277
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,550
What?

278
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,080
I'm not even bothering you.

279
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,550
This house is not yours.

280
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,880
Do you want to eat?

281
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,350
- Here.
- Here.

282
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,790
These flowers are growing so well.

283
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,150
It means

284
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,110
our Young Lady
has been away for several days.

285
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,230
Miss Shangguan is with Mr. Pan.

286
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,200
There's nothing to worry about.

287
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,320
Ze,

288
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,400
do you think Mr. Pan and our Young Lady

289
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,880
will end up together?

290
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,280
Will they get married?

291
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,150
Why bring this up all of a sudden?

292
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,320
Nothing.

293
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,280
It just suddenly popped into my head.

294
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,280
Mr. Pan had relationships with Miss Yang
and the princess.

295
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,350
I wonder what he thinks

296
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,520
about our Young Lady.

297
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,190
I'm just worrying about our Young Lady.

298
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,560
Having a peaceful mind,

299
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,520
accepting fate,

300
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,070
having no worries,

301
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,880
being free and unrestrained.

302
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,830
As distractions fade,

303
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,640
the universe expands,

304
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,100
minds connect,

305
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,020
resonating with the heavens and earth.

306
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,920
Although Xue Jianli is not in his room,

307
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,190
there are two disciples
guarding outside his room.

308
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,160
It won't be easy
to sneak in without alarming him.

309
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,800
We'll have to wait
until nightfall to take action.

310
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,920
Here's the plan.

311
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,800
I'll get someone
to send a message to the county yamen.

312
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,040
We'll split up.

313
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,000
You try to find a way

314
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,400
to distract Xue Jianli.

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,780
[Heavenly Blessings]

316
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,640
Master,

317
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,190
I have doubts in my heart
that I can't figure out.

318
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,760
Please enlighten me.

319
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,920
What's on your mind?

320
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,710
My husband and I
have been to Luoyun Sect five times.

321
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,070
We've been praying for a child,
but it didn't work.

322
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,310
You have to be sincere when praying.

323
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,230
It will work if you believe in it,

324
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
and it won't if you don't.

325
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,430
Master,

326
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,400
my husband and I are both sincere

327
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,400
believers of you.

328
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,190
My sister

329
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,230
was sacrificed
to resurrect the Heavenly Master.

330
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,920
The neighbors

331
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,110
said that we couldn't get a child

332
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,920
because I got married
right after her death.

333
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,920
My sister blamed me
for disrespecting her.

334
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,190
They said her vengeful spirit
was making this trouble.

335
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,920
This is our destined misfortune.

336
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,190
Which deceased is your sister?

337
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,520
The sixth one.

338
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,230
She suddenly burst into flames
on the street.

339
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Only later did we learn

340
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,230
it's called "fire represents Li".

341
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,430
It's the Li Hexagram.

342
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,350
The dead are gone,
and the living are innocent.

343
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,920
I wonder if you can help us

344
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,310
to solve this problem.

345
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,760
Do you have any resentment
in your heart?

346
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,000
In recent years,

347
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,040
have you offended the gods?

348
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,470
No, we didn't.

349
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,350
My husband and I sincerely believe

350
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,190
that my sister's sacrifice
is a blessing.

351
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,640
It's her blessing.

352
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,070
Don't be impatient.

353
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,230
When fate comes,
it will eventually happen.

354
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,400
Otherwise, there's no need to force it.

355
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,710
Go find the person in charge.

356
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,040
He will explain the details to you.

357
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,920
Li.

358
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,400
Master.

359
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,880
This disciple is troubled.

360
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,160
Please help her to clear her doubts.

361
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,590
Yes, Master.

362
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,680
Master.

363
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,280
This way, please.

364
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,830
Wake up.

365
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,880
Wake up.

366
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,470
Why are you lying on the ground again?

367
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,880
Blame me if you want,
hate me if you like,

368
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,710
but you shouldn't
ruin your body like this.

369
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,830
Master, there's no one else here.

370
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,560
Stop pretending.

371
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,470
Master...

372
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,520
Is she Lu Aige?

373
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,160
I thought she was dead.

374
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,710
If you had listened to me earlier,

375
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,950
you wouldn't have been
in this situation.

376
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,950
Stop talking.

377
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,560
If you still care
about our master-disciple relationship,

378
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,680
just kill me.

379
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,640
Aige,

380
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,950
you're my disciple.

381
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,160
How can I bear to kill you?

382
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,950
Xue Jianli,

383
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,070
stop thinking
you can control everything,

384
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,190
you hypocrite.

385
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,640
It's time for you to take the medicine.

386
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,040
Master.

387
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,830
Aige,

388
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,760
let me teach you
to chant scriptures, all right?

389
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,710
Yes.

390
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,590
The medicine Xue Jianli gave her

391
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,110
should be a pill made
from the Menghua Incense.

392
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,190
But why did he imprison her like this?

393
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,680
Living through eight calamities,

394
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,040
serving gods with a sincere heart.

395
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,070
Attaining freedom in the afterlife,

396
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,230
seeking purity in the next life.

397
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,800
Living through eight calamities,

398
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,710
serving gods with a sincere heart.

399
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,280
Attaining freedom in the afterlife,

400
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,310
seeking purity in the next life.

401
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,110
There's fire!

402
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,230
Hurry up!

403
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,280
There's fire!

404
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,000
There's fire! Hurry!

405
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,280
It seems something
is disturbing our cultivation again.

406
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,920
I'll go have a look.

407
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Rest early.

408
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,190
She is...

409
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,920
She's Lu Aige.

410
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,880
I found her
in Xue Jianli's secret chamber.

411
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,710
She's still alive.

412
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,760
Let's leave first.

413
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,560
Okay.

414
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,640
Hold the sword. I'll carry her.

415
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,110
Who are you?

416
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,470
Where are you taking me?

417
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,230
Don't be afraid, we're not bad people.

418
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,000
This is Mr. Pan, the magistrate.

419
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,350
We're here to investigate the Resurrection
of the Heavenly Master Case.

420
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,190
Mr. Pan?

421
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,230
- Sir.
- Mr. Pan.

422
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,230
Mr. Pan.

423
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,470
- Sir.
- Is she all right?

424
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,280
She is fine.

425
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,040
Mr. Pan, please take me away quickly.

426
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,800
I don't want to go back there again.

427
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,350
I don't want to see him again.

428
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,760
All right.

429
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,230
Help her.

430
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

431
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,800
Thank you.

432
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,110
Thank you.

[Court]

434
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,310
Do you know

435
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,710
how the eight victims of the Resurrection
of the Heavenly Master Case

436
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,310
were killed?

437
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,190
Is there any secret?

438
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,470
Aige and Jianli

439
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,040
indicate nobody between us.

440
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,160
If I'm not mistaken,

441
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,520
your relationship with Xue Jianli

442
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,880
should be more
than just master and disciple.

443
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,040
You're right.

444
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,190
He was once my beloved in this world.

445
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,070
Since that glance when I was 16,

446
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,950
I have fallen in love
with Xue Jianli at first sight.

447
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,110
Then, I joined the Luoyun Sect.

448
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,640
At first,

449
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,110
he treated me nicely.

450
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,950
He taught me everything he knew.

451
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,310
We were together day and night.

455
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,280
When I expressed my love,

456
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,920
he said we were only
a master and a disciple.

457
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,560
Considering the views of other people,

458
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,000
he rejected me.

459
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,400
I didn't want to let him go,

460
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,230
so I changed my name.

461
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,400
I'm not afraid
to let others know my thoughts.

462
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,280
I loved only him.

463
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,280
Later, he suffered
internal injuries in training.

464
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,230
He didn't have much life left.

465
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,160
I stayed up day and night
organizing ancient books.

466
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
[Record of Concealment and Reversal]
I hoped to find a way to heal him.

467
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,710
So I organized
the Record of Concealment and Reversal.

468
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,760
At that time, I thought

469
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,800
he had feelings for me too.

470
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,950
He just didn't have the courage
to admit it.

471
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,040
But human sacrifice,

472
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,160
this method is evil.

473
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,110
He and I agreed

474
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,760
that we must never use it
in our lifetime.

475
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,560
But who would have thought...

476
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,000
Master!

477
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,470
Master, you promised!

478
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,920
This method is evil.
We must never use it in our lifetime.

479
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,590
I have no choice.

480
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,520
But that doesn't mean
you can sacrifice lives.

481
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,190
Master, trust me.

482
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,350
There must be another way
to cure your injury.

483
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,000
Please?

484
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,000
All right.

485
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,280
Then I'll go
to the ancient book hall now.

486
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,800
I'll attract attention
if I disappear out of thin air.

487
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,760
Xue Jianli used the Breath-Pausing Pill

488
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,310
to fake my death.

489
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,640
He even went too far

490
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,830
where he intentionally
left some clues at the murder scene.

491
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,800
He cast all the suspicion

492
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,040
onto me, a dead person.

493
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,640
He locked me in the dungeon

494
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,760
and used pills made of Menghua Incense
to control me.

495
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,880
Only then did I realize

496
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,470
he never loved me.

497
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,040
He only cared about himself.

498
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,710
Why did he lock you up?

499
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,310
Was he afraid you'd report him?

500
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,520
It's not that.

501
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,400
Because I'm proficient in immortality.

502
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,400
He spared my life

503
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,760
to force me

504
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,830
to study
the method of immortality with him.

505
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,280
Especially
after he killed the eight women,

506
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,760
he didn't ascend to immortality,

507
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,190
so he couldn't afford to let me die.

508
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,110
I didn't want to help him,

509
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,800
so he used pills to control my mind.

510
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,640
By the way,

511
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Xue Jianli chose
these eight women as sacrifices.

512
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,560
Are there any reasons?

513
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,830
According to ancient records,

514
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,040
only women are required as sacrifices.

515
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,830
So, Miss Shang, the last deceased,

516
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,760
was also chosen for this reason?

517
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,230
Yes.

518
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,160
If that's the case,

519
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,590
Miss Shang was just chosen
as a sacrifice.

520
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,000
We can't figure out her identity anymore

521
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,430

522
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,710
I'm sorry.

523
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,830
There's nothing I can do to help you.

524
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,800
It's okay.

525
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,310
We'll continue
to pursue and arrest Xue Jianli.

526
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,880
Miss Lu, what are your plans next?

527
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,280
I have a house on the city outskirts.

528
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,950
So many people died because of me.

529
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,710
I need to bear my responsibility.

530
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I plan to hide myself

531
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,350

00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,360
Isn't this a character from the symbols?

557
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,000
Shenshen,

558
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,760
today's interpretation of this scripture

559
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,360
is too deviant.

560
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,080
Don't think about it again.

561
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,120
This doesn't
sound like self-admonition either.

562
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,320
It's more like Xue Jianli
was hinting at someone.

563
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,120
Then who was he hinting at?

564
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,630
[Aige and Jianli
indicate nobody between us]

565
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,630
Lu Aige?

566
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,800
So Lu Shenshen is her original name.

567
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,280
The "Li Shen" on the symbol

568
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,470
refers to Xue Jianli and Lu Aige.

569
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,150
Lu Aige is also involved in this matter.

570
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,040
She's lying.

571
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:21,800
Then...

572
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,080
Ling is in danger!

573
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,710
I interrupted the nine-year sacrifice.

574
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,910
I can finally start over.

575
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,080
Don't be afraid.

576
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,360
You're my fifth sacrifice.

577
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,190
It's lucky for you to be chosen by me.

578

To thank you
for helping me regain my freedom,

You're right.

596
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,430
You faked your death not to
attract believers for the resurrection

597
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,120
but to kill people!

598
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,560
You promised me!

599
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,470
This method is evil.
We must never use it in our lifetime!

601
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,600

you don't want bloodshed.

602
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,630
I'll handle these.

603
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,080
You just need to sit back
and enjoy the results.

604
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,910
Once I complete the sacrifice,

605
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,000
your injury won't be a problem anymore.

606
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
We can be together forever and ever.

607

Nothing can ever separate us.

608

Do you know

609
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,950
that murder demands a life in return?

610
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,600
That's why
I took the Breath-Pausing Pill

611

you were cruel and hypocritical.

00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,040
Court Master, Mr. Pan
and Miss Shangguan want to see you.

743
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,840
Mr. Pan, Miss Shangguan,

744
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,560
welcome.

745
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,320
Why didn't you inform me in advance

746
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,000
so that I could organize something

747
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,670
to give you good hospitality?

748
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,910
Miss Qing, that's courteous of you.

749
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:56,520
We're not here today

750
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,910
to just have a small talk with you.

751
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,840
What brings you two here today?

752
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,470
I guess you are not the culprit.

753
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:20,840
Otherwise,

754
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,600
you wouldn't care about

755
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:23,870
the next lives of the deceased.

756
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,950
The person who led me to the death row

757
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,320
and gave me clues
about the Ghostly Fire Case

758
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,000
was you, right?

759
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,670
Wet straw?

760
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,360
I had no intention of standing out.

761
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,840
Mr. Pan,

762
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,910
why did you reveal it?

763
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,000
Miss Qing,

764
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,190
please tell us everything you know.

765
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,000
Don't you want to see
their injustices addressed?

766
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,040
Please, follow me.

767
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,190
This way.

768
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,320
[Yunshu of Hundred Flowers Court]

769
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,870
[Yunhua of Hundred Flowers Court]
It's a pity

770
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,800
that only alias
could be written on their tombs.

771
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,360
[Yunchang of Hundred Flowers Court]

772
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,470
These are their real names.

773
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:35,800
[Yunqing of Hundred Flowers Court]

774
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,670
Throughout these years,

775
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,430
my subordinate, Yunque,

776
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,080
has been collecting information
on those people.

777
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,080
Just to seek revenge for them.

778
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,390
So when I said

779
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:52,910
I was willing to work with you,

780
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,280
I really meant it.

781
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,840
However,

782
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:57,280
this matter is dangerous.

783
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,950
So, I can't really disclose it.

784
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,280
I hope you understand.

785
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,950
What's your relationship
with the Ripple Organization?

786
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,360
Why are you seeking revenge?

787
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,320
They were all performers
that I had personally trained.

788
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,080
Especially Yunchang,

[Yunchang of Hundred Flowers Court]
the eighth victim,

790
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,230
Miss Shang.

791
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,760
I treated her like a sister.

792
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,470
Every year, Hundred Flowers Court

793
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,520
would nurture
a group of outstanding individuals

794
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:37,390
to be sent to a high-ranking official
in the capital.

795
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:39,230
That year,

796
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,150
they were chosen.

797
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,080
Yunchang was full of hope,

798
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,870
thinking she could finally
live a good life.

799
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,230
But who'd have thought

800
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:50,670
that in less than half a year,

801
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,600
all of them secretly came back to me?

802
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,760
Miss Qing, you must save us.

803
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:58,870
What exactly happened?

804
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,320
Why did you secretly come back?

805
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,360
We found

806
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,430
evidence of the corrupted official
colluding with an enemy nation.

807
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,190
Besides...

808
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,520
Besides, he has people
working for him in Heyang too.

809
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,150
We were discovered.

810
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,320
Afraid of being killed and silenced,

811
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,000
we had to escape overnight

812
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,800
and come to further discuss with you.

813
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:18,120
I can't believe such a thing happened.

814
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:21,950
Don't worry.

815
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,520
He probably didn't expect you

816
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,190
to have returned to Heyang.

817
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,560
That's what we thought too.

818
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:30,320
The most dangerous place
might actually be safe.

819
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,190
In that case,

820
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,800
during this time,

821
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,910
hide your identities

822
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,670
and take cover in Heyang for a while.

823
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,600
If anything happens,

824
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,150
I can also take care of you.

825
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,000
Yunchang thought

826
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,360
they couldn't
keep hiding like this anymore.

827
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,560
She wrote a report to Mr. Yang,

828
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,630
hoping he could punish those people.

829
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,710
Yunchang was very cautious.

830
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,950
But somehow,

831
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,630
some people still found out about it.

832
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,390
Not long after,

833
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
we heard that Mr. Yang and his family

834
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,080
had been killed.

835
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,360
Later, we found out

836
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,080
that those people were well-connected.

837
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,120
There was nothing
we could do about them.

838
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,600
Yunchang and the others
were very scared.

839
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:32,190
They had to live in Heyang
while hiding their identities.

840
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,760
We thought that after a year,

841
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,430
those people would let them go.

842
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:52,800
Unexpectedly,

843
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,430
in the Resurrection
of the Heavenly Master Case,

844
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,520
one of them was killed.

845
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,950
The remaining three were very scared.

846
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,430
They weren't sure
if she was killed by the Heavenly Master

847
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,800
or if the Ripple Organization
had found them.

848
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:06,120
Soon,

849
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:10,000
the other two were also killed.

850
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,280
Yunchang was very scared.

851
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:13,630
She was afraid

852
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,230
that she

853
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,230
would be next.

854
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,670
It must be because of the report I wrote

855
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,280
those people were able to find us.

856
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,910
It's my fault.

857
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,670
They died because of me.

858
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,950
Don't overthink it.

859
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:30,120
I'm sure

860
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,470
I'll be the next one to die.

861
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,950
Those people will definitely find me.

862
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,120
Why don't you move
to the Hundred Flowers Court

863
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,150
and live with me?

864
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,600
In case something happens...

865
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,080
No, you've already helped me
more than enough.

866
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,000
I can't burden you anymore.

867
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,390
Lately,

868
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,910
I've often dreamed
about my days in the capital.

869
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,560
I lived the most luxurious life there.

870
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:55,040
There were people
who genuinely loved me there, too.

871
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:57,190
At that time, I thought

872
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,390
I was the happiest person in the world.

873
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,080
Looking back now,

874
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,280
it feels like a lifetime ago.

875
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,800
I have moved on.

876
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,670
Whether I live or die,

877
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,600
it's up to fate.

878
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,800
Miss, I'm giving you this handkerchief.

879
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,710
I embroidered the Taoba on it myself.

880
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,600
I hope it will bless you
with good health and safety.

881
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:27,600
When I'm no longer here,

882
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,190
you can look at it

883
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,390
when you miss me.

884
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,630
Since I met Yunchang that day,

885
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,600
I've sent people

886
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,190
secretly watching
the tea house where she worked.

887
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,080
They didn't find anything unusual.

888
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,190
However, the next day,

889
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,000
after Yunchang left,

890
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,560
she disappeared.

891
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,080
Until...

892
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,280
she was found on the back mountain.

893
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,800
When she was found,

894
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,280
someone had poured molten copper on her

895
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,560
and turned her into a copper status.

896
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,800
The official she mentioned,

897
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,190
do you know who it is?

898
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:20,870
Yunchang didn't tell me,

899
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,560
so I dared not ask.

900
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,120
Knowing about such things

901
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,520
is dangerous.

902
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:31,670
Since that incident,

903
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,190
for so many years,

904
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,040
just like usual,

905
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:38,280
I've been sending performers
to the capital every year.

906
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,760
Because I'm afraid
that someone might suspect me.

907
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,760
Do you know

908
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,800
where these performers were sent to?

909
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,470
I don't know the exact address.

910
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,630
They operate very mysteriously.

911
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,710
They always sent a middleman
to come pick them up.

912
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,670
You said

913
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,670
performers would be sent
to the capital every year.

914
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,150
Does that include this year?

915
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:59,600
Yes.

916
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,280
In a few days,

917
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,800
we will send the performers
to the capital.

918
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:06,470
All right.

919
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:07,760
This year,

920
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:09,560
