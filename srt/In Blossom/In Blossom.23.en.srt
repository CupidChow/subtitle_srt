190
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,520
Mr. Yang, seeing these words
is as good as seeing me.

191
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,400
There is a highly influential figure
in the court

192
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,760
who is a spy for the enemy nation.

193
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,710
They are secretly building their power,

194
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,030
accumulating wealth,

195
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,520
and communicating with the enemy.

196
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,910
They are using Heyang as their base

197
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
and this symbol as a means of contact.

198
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,640
In the capital,

199
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,670
I've heard that Mr. Yang
from the Law Enforcement Office

200
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,200
is impartial

201
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,400
and has never joined any faction.

202
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,150
I therefore write to seek your help.

203
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,150
I hope Mr. Yang will take the time
to investigate thoroughly.

204
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,400
I will be waiting for Mr. Yang

205
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
at the Wangyue Bridge
in the east of Heyang.

206
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,880
I will provide further details
when we meet.

207
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,710
This is the tip-off
my father received back then.

208
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,520
It seems that Zhuo Shanju

209
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,590
found this letter

210
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,520
after sending Gu Yong
to kill your parents.

211
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,760
I guess

212
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
he must have wanted
to leave himself some way out,

213
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,280
so he didn't hand over this letter

214
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,520
to the mastermind.

215
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,350
Father!

216
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,030
Are you okay?

217
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,710
I'm fine.

218
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,590
It's just that when I think

219
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,960
about how the change in my family's fate

220
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,520
started with this letter,

221

I'm a little...

222

This letter

223
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,350
is back in our hands now.

224
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,670
I guess it's our destiny

225
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,520
to fulfill

226
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,520

I can't believe you let a young rascal
find out about you,

Our foundation in Heyang was ruined.

234

We were incompetent.

Please punish us, Big Brother.

236
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,840
When we became sworn brothers, we agreed

237

to share our weals and woes.

238
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,550
Zhuo Shanju's death is no big deal.

239
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,640

You've suffered

251
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,030
in order to catch the spy.

252

I know you did it on purpose, sir.

Did I reveal any flaws?

No, you didn't.

255
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,840
During the Lantern Festival Case,

256
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,320
as soon as the county yamen
investigated it,

257
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,880
someone secretly made up
the story of an evil wyvern

258
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,910
to confuse people.

259
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,710
Since then,

260
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,880
I've suspected that there's a spy
in the county yamen.

261
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,320
After catching Gu Yong,

262
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,030
I was afraid the spy would hinder us,

263
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,440
so I secretly investigated.

264
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,590

without Mr. Pan's instruction.

268

The new official has only been here
for a short time,

269
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,880
and you're already
calling him so respectfully.

270
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,080
Why? Using the new official
to intimidate me?

271
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,320
After Gu Yong was killed,

272
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,030
I began to suspect the registrar.

273
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,880
But unfortunately,
there's no direct evidence.

274
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,200
That night,
when you invited us for drinks,

275
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,550
the registrar went back to rest first.

276
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,000
I intended to follow him secretly.

277

Where are you going?

278
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,670
The registrar is old.

Are you old too?

281
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,910
and talked to me.

When I chased after him,

283
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,640
he was already gone.

00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,760
In the end,

285
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,200
I was framed by him instead.

286
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,760
Then why didn't you defend yourself?

287

You have foresight, sir.

288
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,790
You must have made a plan.

373
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,640
It's been so long.

374
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,280
How did you remember it so well?

375
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,880
I couldn't forget it,
even if I wanted to.

376
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,000
That Miss Shang

377
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,110
was really too beautiful.

378
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,310
I've never seen
such a beautiful woman before.

379
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,760
My wife gets jealous easily.

380
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,470
I just glanced at Miss Shang
a few more times,

381
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,310
and my wife had a big fight with me.

382
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,040
It's been so many years,

383
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,230
but she still brings it up to scold me.

384
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,040
You mentioned earlier

385
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,190
that she wrote
about the scenery outside.

386
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,430
That's why I thought
it must be this Miss Shang.

387
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,350
At that time, she used to drink tea
on the second floor

388
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,400
and stare at the Wangyue Bridge
outside every day

389
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,230
as if she were waiting for someone.

390
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,830
Do you know where she went afterward?

391
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,800
Afterward,

392
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,760
she rented a house
on the opposite street.

393
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,160
She usually worked in a tea house

394
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,040
and made a living
by brewing tea for people.

395
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,190
Such a beautiful woman.

396
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,590
What a pity.

397
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,950
Did something happen to her?

398
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,350
Nine years ago, in Heyang,

399
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,430
there was a famous case

400
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,640
called "Resurrection
of the Heavenly Master".

401
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:06,000
She was one
of the eight deceased in that case.

402

[Laifeng Inn]

403
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,470
Mr. Pan, take care.

404
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,160
Take care.

405
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,800
Look at how you were just now.

406
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,400
I told you not to say it earlier.

407
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,110
What's wrong with you?

408
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,710
Don't you know not to get into trouble?

409
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,400
I felt something was off with you

410
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,040
when you mentioned that case earlier.

411
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,950
When the Heavenly Master Case happened,

412
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,760
I had just been in Heyang for a year.

413
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,430
At that time, Master was still
the coroner of the county yamen.

414
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,110
I went to the murder scene
with him before.

415
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,350
Although I couldn't understand it
at that time,

416
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,310
I saw the deaths of many people.

417
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,800
I had nightmares every night back then.

418
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,230
I even dared not go out alone
for several months.

419
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,760
So bizarre?

420
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,950
Have you ever heard

421
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,640
of someone killing people as sacrifices

422
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,040
in order to become immortal?

423
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,710
The most bizarre thing about this case

424
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,400
is that the murderer had died,

425
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,710
but his chosen targets

426
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,160
continued to be killed incessantly.

427
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,190
Let's go.

428
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,710
Go back to the county yamen
and check the dossier.

429
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,000
Sir,

430
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,470
it's here.

431
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,760
You looked quite handsome just now.

432
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,880
[Resurrection of the Heavenly Master Case]
Since the 13th day of the fourth month,

433
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,560
eight women have died consecutively
in Heyang.

434
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,520
Their death was horrifying.

435
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,920
They died in eight positions,

436
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,110
and it was secretly
in line with the eight hexagrams

437
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,070
of Qian, Kun, Xun, Zhen,
Kan, Li, Gen, and Dui.

What is this?

441
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,190
I don't know either.

442
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,070
It was like this when I dug it up.

443
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,310

444
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,000

It's here!

[Gen represents Mountain]

457
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,680
After these people died consecutively,

458
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,230
there was panic
among the people of Heyang.

459
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,710
Women dared not go out alone.

460
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,830
Miss Shang was burned to death
by molten copper.

461
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,880
I saw it with my own eyes.

462
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,190
I never expected

463
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,430
that she was the one
who wrote the tip-off to my father.

464
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,640
Nor did I expect

465
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,430
it would be the beginning
of the change in my family's fate.

466
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,430
Everything has passed.

467
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,710
We will definitely find the masterminds
behind these

468
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,710
and let them get the punishment
they deserve.

469
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,590
Was there any conclusion

470
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,710
from the county yamen's investigation
back then?

471
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,040
These women were killed
one after another

472
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,280
within three months.

473
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,760
The murderer didn't seem interested
in money or lust.

474
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,710
Similar to the Lantern Festival Case,

475
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,590
there was no connection
between the victims.

476
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,950
But what's more complicated
than the Lantern Festival Case

477
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,400
is that their causes of death
were all different,

478
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,520
and we couldn't find
a single similar murder weapon.

479
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,560
But someone said

480
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,680
that he once saw the murderer's figure

481
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,070
at the crime scene.

482
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,190
It seemed to be a disciple
of the Luoyun Sect.

483
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,110
It's said she used eight women
as sacrifices

484

The sect leader is called Xue Jianli.

488
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,590
Yes, he's a high priest in Heyang.

489
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,950
In the beginning, he pursued
the cultivation of the body and mind,

490
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,590
but afterward, for unknown reasons,

491
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,110
he started to cultivate immortality.

492
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,800
There's a female disciple under him
named Lu Aige.

[Luoyun Sect]

494
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,520
Lu Aige had an extraordinary talent

and had mastered
many ancient cultivation techniques.

496
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,800
She quickly became a prominent figure

on par with Xue Jianli
in the Luoyun Sect.

498
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,070
She was quite popular
among the people of Heyang.

500
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,430
Because a witness had identified her,

501
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,470
officers from the county yamen
searched her place.

502
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,230
Sure enough, a secret manual
was found in her room.

503
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
A so-called way to immortality
was written on it.

Using the eight trigrams,

506

[Contents of the record]
sacrifice eight women with yin bodies,

507

and one can achieve immortality.

508
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,760
The method recorded in the secret manual

509
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,350
completely matches the deaths
of the eight victims.

510
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,430
Wasn't the murderer obvious, then?

511
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,160
Instead, it was even more baffling.

512
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,160
Because
before the first victim appeared,

513
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,560
Lu Aige was already dead.

514
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,310
She died of golden elixir poisoning.

515
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,190
All the disciples of the Luoyun Sect

516
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,710
attended her funeral.

517
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,640
She was already dead,

518
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,190
but she was seen at the crime scene.

519
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,040
That's why rumors of the Heavenly Master

520
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,190
resurrecting and killing people
circulated after that.

521
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,190
But indeed, after eight people died,

522
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,680
there were no more similar cases.

523
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,230
So the county yamen

524
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,560
hastily concluded
that the Heavenly Master

525
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,470
resurrected and killed people.

526
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,680
If these are all the content
of the dossier,

527
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,400

back then.

00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,230
Hurry up.

553
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,710
Master.

554
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,560
Master!

555
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,880
Master!

556
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,880
Has he gone out?

557
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
The main gate wasn't locked,
so he should be nearby.

558
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,830
You sit here. I'll go find him.

559
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,520
All right.

560
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,950
Master!

561
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,760
Master!

562
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,680
Master!

563
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,230
I...

564
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,470
I'll beat you to death,
you unfaithful scoundrel!

565
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,560
Calm down, Mr. Jiang.

566
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,400
I'll beat you to death!

567
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,190
You killed Caiwei.

568
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,710
I'll kill you, you unfaithful scoundrel!

569
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,350
Stop it!

570
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,350
I'll kill you!

571
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,280
Master, stop hitting!

572
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,310
Master!

573
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,470
- I'll kill you!
- Master!

574
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,280
Master!

575
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,430
Master, stop hitting!

576
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,230
- Don't stop me.
- Stop hitting!

577
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,470
- I'll kill you, you unfaithful scoundrel!
- It's all a misunderstanding!

578
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,920
Stop, Master!

579
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,000
Stop!

580
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,470
I'll beat you to death!

581
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,590
You've misunderstood me.

582
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,680
I'll beat you to death!

583
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,190
It still hurts, doesn't it?

584
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,040
It's tolerable.

585
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,310
Master, why did you hit him

586
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,560
without making things clear?

587
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,590
You little brat.

588
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,070
So much had happened,

589
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,710
and you didn't tell me anything.

590
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,310
I have been nice enough
not to stab him with a knife.

591
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,070
I was going to say it.

592
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,280
I hadn't even opened my mouth,

593
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,430
and your rod was already hitting him.

594
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:13,830
Caiwei.

595
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,520
Come here.

596
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,880
Hold this yourself.

597
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,710
Come here, come here.

598
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,520
Come here.

599
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,070
I'm asking you.

600
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
What's your relationship
with this rascal now?

601
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,590
It's just like that.

602
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,350
"Like that"? What do you mean
by "like that"?

603
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,950
Master.

604
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,070
Let me tell you.

605
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,520
He is now engaged to the princess.

606
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,560
He's making you stay with him
without a clear reason.

607
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,350
In other people's eyes,

608
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,310
what would you become?

609
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,590
We explained it just now.

610
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,400
He did that to investigate
the mastermind behind the scenes.

611
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,710
I don't care about the reason.

612
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,430
If he really cared about you,

613
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,160
he should have sorted out
these relationships first

614
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,310
before being with you.

615
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,310
It should not be the way it is now.

616
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,430
You, you.

617
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,560
All right, all right.

618
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,190
Mr. Pan,

619
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
I was reckless just now.

620
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,560
Please don't take offense.

621
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,520
Mr. Jiang,

622
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,070
it was nothing.
It was all a misunderstanding.

623
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,590
Mr. Jiang, just call me Pan Yue
from now on.

624
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,830
What you just said

625
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,040
is the Resurrection
of the Heavenly Master Case, right?

626
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,040
I did handle

627
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,350
this case back then.

628
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,950
But it's been so many years.

629
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,230
I need to recall the details carefully

630
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,110
before explaining them clearly to you.

631
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,710
It's okay. Take your time to recall.

632
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,350
There's no rush.

633
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,870
But...

634
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,120
I promised my neighbor next door
to water the garden today.

635
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,230
It's okay, I'll go.

636
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,000
Then I'll go with you.

637
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,150
Caiwei,

638
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,800
I can't remember many details
about the Heavenly Master Case.

639
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,080
Caiwei, you have to help me remember.

640
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,190
I'll go by myself.

641
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,190
You haven't seen your master
for a long time.

642
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,390
Spend some time with him.

643
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,000
Go now.

644
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,000
All right.

645
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,800
Close the door.

646
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,360
All right, all right.

647
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
Master.

648
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,950
After dinner,

649
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,320
can you tell us
about the Heavenly Master Case?

650
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,710
I'm a bit tired today.

651
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,760
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

652
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
Tonight,

653
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,320
you'll stay here.

654
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,120
Caiwei.

655
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,320
You like to stay at the east end, right?

656
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,560
I've cleaned up the room
on the east side.

657
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,800
You'll sleep there tonight.

658
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,950
Thank you, Master.

659
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,000
You like to stay at the east end?

660
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,630
It's a habit I formed
back at Coffin House.

661
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,470
I just feel

662
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,600
that if I can see the sun
when I wake up every day,

663
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,000
I'll only feel alive.

664
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,230
It's not really important.

665
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,150
There is no need to tell you.

666
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,600
Caiwei.

667
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,430
These are your favorite
five-spice taro shoots.

668
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,560
Eat more.

669
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,870
It's been a long time since I had them.

670
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,360
Are they especially delicious?

671
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,120
Have some.

672
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,760
Have some, have some.

673
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,280
It seems like I won't be able
to sleep tonight.

674
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,360
If only I had a pot of liquor right now.

675
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,040
Can't sleep?

676
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,910
You can't either?

677
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,390
Go out?

678
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,520
Sure.

679
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,630
Master's snores are loud.

680
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,840
I was afraid you couldn't sleep.

681
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,670
I've prepared this for you.

682
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,190
You understand me well.
I was thinking about this.

683
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,470
Actually, my master

684
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
is very reasonable

685
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,600
and easy to talk to.

686
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,230
It's just that he regards me
as his daughter,

687
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,670
so he is anxious about me.

688
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,280
I know.

689
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,430
How did you get adopted by your master?

690
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,120
Everyone, take a look!

691
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,390
Let's make a judgment!

692
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,560
Such a young child
has already learned to steal!

693
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,000
I didn't eat the food!

694
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,800
I really didn't eat the food.

695
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,670
It wasn't you who ate it?

696
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,120
Who can prove it wasn't you who ate it?

697
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,360
Unless you open up your stomach
and show me,

698
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,080
compensate me with ten times the money!

699
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,190
I didn't eat the food.

700
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,470
You're still lying?

701
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,600
It's actually quite simple to prove

702
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,840
whether she ate the food or not.

703
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,800
Why bother
with cutting open her stomach?

704
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,320
Let her go.

705
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,120
Carps and licorice are incompatible.

706
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,710
If eaten together,

707
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,870
it can lead to vomiting and diarrhea,

708
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,360
or even death.

709
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,000
Girl, do you dare to eat it?

710
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,800
It definitely wasn't her.

711
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,950
Your turn.

712
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,800
Why should I eat it?

713
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,710
If you were set a trap,
you should have done it well.

714
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,120
Look at your sleeve cuff.

715
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,390
There's carp soup on it.

716
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,150
So it was him.

717
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,870
It's truly despicable

718
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,840
to make things so difficult for a child.

719
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,520
Girl, it's all right now.

720
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,020
[Coffin House]

721
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,520
Why do you keep following me?

722
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,520
Please accept me as your disciple,
Master.

723
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,040
Girl,

724
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,710
it would be fine if you were a boy.

725
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,520
But how can a girl become a coroner?

726
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,630
No way, no way.

727
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,600
You've examined so many corpses.

728
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,120
May I ask, does a woman
have one less heart than a man

729
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,710
or one less gallbladder?

730
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,600
You haven't even tried,

731
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,800
so how do you know a woman can't do it?

732
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,280
Anyway, later on,

733
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,280
Master relented.

734
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,000
He said he would accept me
as his disciple

735
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,560
