whatever you want to tell him.

188
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
It's better to regret it

189
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,080
than miss the regret.

190
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,000
It's better to regret it

191
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,030
than miss the regret.

192
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,150
How are your eyes?

193
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,030
I'm fine.

194
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,640
Why do you look so nervous?

195
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,230
This is very dangerous.

196
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm afraid that I...

197
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,200
I haven't seen enough of you yet.

198
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,760
Don't worry.

199
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,400
Everything will be all right.

200
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,910
Old Master Zhuo, Pan Yue has arrived.

201
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,960
How many people does he bring?

202
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,470
Just himself.

203
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,710
[Maintaining the Peace]

204
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,840
Mr. Pan, you have quite some nerve

205
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,150
to come here alone.

206
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,640
I know this is not a simple banquet.

207
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,440
But I was expecting a drink at least.

208
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,080
Mr. Sun, you are kind of impatient.

209
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,670
Why do you dare to come

210
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,910
since you know it isn't simple?

211
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,470
Whether the invitation was sent
by Young Master Zhuo

212
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,910
or Old Master Zhuo,

213
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,230
it's the same.

214
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,910
Anyway, it's good to have a chat.

215
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,400
How did you know?

216
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,960
Show Mr. Pan in.

217
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,320
This place is clear.

218
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,230
Proceed as planned. Let's split.

219
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,640
I will go steal the keys,
and you go to the kitchen.

220
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,400
Be careful.

221
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,710
Old Master Zhuo.

222
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,880
I have heard a lot about you.

223
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,760
Mr. Pan, how do you know I'm still alive?

224
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,470
Silver Rain Terrace
is behind Xinzheng Academy.

225
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,960
Sun Zhen isn't capable
of managing all these.

226
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,000
He sent someone to the Ghost Market
to buy the jade toad

227
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,080
and delivered it to the mountains
behind Silver Rain Terrace.

228
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,910
Jade toad is widely known

229
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,520
to be the cure for burns.

230
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
And, Old Master Zhuo,

231
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,230
you coincidentally died in a fire

232
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,590
three years ago.

233
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,840
You suspected a dead man
with merely these.

234
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,880
Isn't that

235
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,640
a hasty judgment?

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,550
If it weren't for your good friend,
Gu Yong,

237
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,400
who said something before he died,

238
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,710
I wouldn't have confirmed it.

239
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,640
Gu Yong?

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,230
He lives like a ghost

241
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,000
for a useless son.

242
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,200
He might as well die.

243
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,080
I had wondered

244
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,960
who the ghost

245
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,910
he mentioned was.

246
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,470
Until yesterday,

247
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,110
I figured that out.

248
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,110
In that fire three years ago,

249
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,880
you were lucky enough to survive,

250
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,910
but you were also badly injured.

251
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,710
During these days,

252
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,280
you must have suffered in pain, right?

253
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,710
Mr. Pan, you could make that out
from just a sentence.

254
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,520
You indeed live up to your expectations.

255
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,710
However,

256
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,790
even if I'm badly injured,

257
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,910
killing you

258
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,350
is easy.

259
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,710
Mr. Pan, you are bold

260
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,320
to come here alone.

261
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,640
Do you see me as nothing?

262
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,910
I don't.

263
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,230
I respect you

264
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,640
as a powerful master

265
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,280
who leads thousands of members
of Silver Rain Terrace.

266
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,230
However, a hero

267
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,280
has to live like a ghost for three years.

268
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,760
I suppose

269
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,470
this is not your choice.

270
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,230
Young Master, it has been three days.

271
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,790
Please eat some.

272
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,840
Your body won't hold up if you don't eat.

273
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,000
I didn't expect

274
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,200
that you would betray me.

275
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,910
I... I didn't.

276
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,030
He's Old Master Zhuo.

277
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,000
You know this.

278
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,080
I have never dared
to defy him since I was young.

279
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,200
Get lost.

280
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,790
Yes.

281
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,910
It is called

282
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,590
peace in four cardinal directions.

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,150
My mother taught me.

284
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,790
If you poke four holes,

285
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,520
it will keep you safe outdoors.

286
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,670
You will be safe and sound

287
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,550
when you get into fights with anyone.

288
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,880
Eat up.

289
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,670
Peace in four cardinal directions.

290
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,200
Eagles should soar in the sky,

291
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,760
but you are willing to be reduced
to a domesticated fowl.

292
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,550
I guess

293
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,640
that person must've found your weak spot

294
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
and forced you into doing this.

295
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,910
Your weak spot is Zhuo Lanjiang, right?

296
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,710
Since you serve him under duress,

297
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,520
there is still room

298
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,520
for us to negotiate.

299
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,230
It's useless.

300
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,110
Only if you die

301
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,840
can Silver Rain Terrace survive.

302
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,320
Flammable paint?

303
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,840
It is.

304
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,200
Three years ago,

305
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,000
I survived the fire.

306
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,230
But three years later...

307
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,280
This seems

308
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,840
to be my destiny.

309
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,560
You want to die with me here?

310
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,800
With a talented young man
like you accompanying me,

311
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,040
I won't be lonely

312
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,880
six feet under.

313
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,230
There's no need to look around.

314
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,470
The windows are made of bronze.

315
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,680
They were sealed

316
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,710
before you came in.

317
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,040
The main gate is three chi thick.

318
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,040
No one can enter or leave here.

319
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,710
Only I can turn on the mechanism.

320
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,760
Jiang.

321
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,830
I knew it was you.

322
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,190
It's Xiaosheng's idea.

323
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,710
You are natural

324
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,310
at such sneaky tricks, Little Liar.

325
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,640
I was helping you.

326
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,830
Jiang, Pan Yue is in the hall.
He might be in danger.

327
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,070
My father wants to kill him.
Let's go there now.

328
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,680
Let's go.

329
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,680
Since we are going to die together,

330
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,400
Old Master Zhuo,

331
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,560
here's to you.

332
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,000
There aren't many people I admire
throughout my life.

333
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,230
You are one of them, Mr. Pan.

334
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,760
Since you have been hiding
all these years,

335
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,430
why did you want to burn us together

336
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,310
when you revealed yourself?

337
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,350
You have already found out

338
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,560
everything Silver Rain Terrace did.

339
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,280
Now that I'm exposed,

340
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,280
my life

341
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,640
holds no value anymore.

342
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,350
But death isn't necessarily
your sole choice.

343
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,280
Good.

344
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,830
Impressive.

345
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,280
Being young and full of spirit

346
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,110
is not a bad thing.

347
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,070
But you should know your limitations.

348
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,880
You

349
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,350
are no match for him.

350
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,230
No ones know yet.

351
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
But do you really think

352
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,350
you can keep Zhuo Lanjiang safe

353
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,520
by doing so?

354
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,160
It's not up to you

355
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,040
to decide how he would be.

356
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,310
You sent him away from Heyang
when he was young,

357
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,110
hoping he could stay away

358
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,760
from the dirty business
of Silver Rain Terrace.

359
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,110
When Silver Rain Terrace was in trouble

360
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,430
and he returned to Heyang,

361
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,110
you would rather fake your death

362
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,040
than have him involved

363
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,520
with the Ripple Organization.

364
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,000
I guess you bear everything

365
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,710
because you want
to keep Zhuo Lanjiang out of trouble.

366
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,280
What are you trying to get at?

367
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,280
You are using the way you think it's right

368
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,560
to protect him,

369
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,400
which he doesn't need at all.

370
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,470
Zhuo Lanjiang is proud,

371
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,160
and he won't allow any humiliation.

372
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,520
Do you think

373

00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,120
What's it about?

751
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,910
[Announcement]
Over years of domination,

752
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,560
Silver Rain Terrace has committed numerous
murders, smuggling, and crimes,

753
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,120
which is unforgivable.

754
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,670
The main culprit, Zhuo Shanju,
has committed suicide.

755
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,470
His sin will not extend to his family.

756
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,560
If the members of Silver Rain Terrace
will change and repent,

757
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,080
their past will not be pursued.

758
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,050
They won't be punished.

759
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,710
I didn't expect

760
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,470
to witness the collapse
of Silver Rain Terrace

761
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,280
after 30 years of domination.

762
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,390
Exactly.

763
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,230
I heard

764
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,080
that Silver Rain Terrace
has lost its master

765
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,080
after Young Master Zhuo went missing.

766
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,360
Except for Mr. Sun

767
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,800
who voluntarily stays guard
at Zhuo Shanju's tomb,

768
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,950
the rest have dismissed

769
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,950
and returned home.

770
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,150
From now on,

771
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,190
Silver Rain Terrace
will disappear from Heyang.

772
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,390
Mr. Pan is impressive.

773
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,840
I used to think he was delusional

774
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,000
when he said he wanted to reform Heyang.

775
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,470
In just three months,

776
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,760
he took down Relief Hall
and Silver Rain Terrace consecutively.

777
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:25,080
It seems that we may live a peaceful life.

778
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,560
Exactly.

779
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:29,390
Mr. Pan, why make such a fuss

780
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,120
about sealing Silver Rain Terrace
when Zhuo Shanju is already dead?

781
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,630
This is my promise to Old Master Zhuo.

782
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,840
That way,

783
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,120
the Ripple Organization will believe

784
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,670
we have stopped the investigation.

785
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,190
This is also the only way

786
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,320
to keep Zhuo Lanjiang safe

787
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,520
and make Zhuo Shanju's death worth it.

788
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:05,600
Miss Qing.

789
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,430
Mr. Pan instructed his men
to seal Silver Rain Terrace.

790
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,800
He shows resolute determination

791
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,470
and courage.

792
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,910
I knew I made the right choice.

793
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,430
Should we give him another shove?

794
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,470
If we do,

795
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,360
we are very likely to push ourselves

796
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,910
into the abyss.

797
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,670
The case is closed.

798
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,760
We should act like we are happy.

799
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,390
Don't forget

800
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,080
the spy

801
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,630
is still around us.

802
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:14,670
I know.

803
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,190
But I'm worried

804
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,470
about Jiang.

805
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,390
This is a heavy blow for him.

806
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,360
He might not make it through.

807
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,230
Given Zhuo Lanjiang's character,

808
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,040
we should trust him

809
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,000
to make the right decision.

810
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,800
Once everything is clear,

811
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,800
let's go and find him.

812
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:36,840
Xiaosheng is with him now.

813
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,430
He will be all right.

814
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,630
It's a shame that Zhuo Shanju burned
all the letters.

815
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,910
No clues are left.

816
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,470
Have you found anything
from the search for Mr. Chen?

817
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,000
He has probably fled Heyang.

818
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,150
How are we going to investigate
without any clues?

819
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,760
Someone misled us

820
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,670
into the Ghostly Fire Case.

821
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,000
Perhaps there will be new leads

822
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,520
if we find him.

823
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:07,320
But

824
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,040
we are totally clueless now.

825
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:15,710
By the way,

826
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,320
Gu Yong mouthed the surname "Yang"
before he died.

827
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,150
Should we go to the capital

828
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,390
to look for officials with surname Yang?

829
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,520
This surname

830
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,840
can refer to too many things.

831
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,560
I'm afraid

832
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,760
it's not a fruitful trip

833
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,710
to the capital.

834
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,040
Who is there?

00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,040
Perhaps

838
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,390
