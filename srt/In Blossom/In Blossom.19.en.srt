00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,640
We didn't expect the inns
around here to be full.

366
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,830
And now, it's raining heavily.

367
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,110
Can you just get us someplace

368
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,350
to spend the night?

369
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,280
Well...

370
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,640
We can make do
with the stables or the woodshed.

371
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,190
Well...

372
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,000
Here you go.

373
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,230
Thank you.

374
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,190
Please help us.

375
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,920
Then, you'll have to make do
with the stables.

376
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,400
Okay, thank you.

377
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,160
All right.

378
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,520
What's wrong?

379
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,520
Are you okay?

380
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,190
You guys scared me.

381
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,000
What? Why are you so nervous?

382
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,830
We came by to check up on you.

383
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,560
Are you hiding something from me?

384
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,710
Then, you should go back
to your room now.

385
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,830
I'm going to bed.

386
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Since we can't sleep,
let's have a drink.

387
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,350
Okay.

388
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,160
I heard you used to study
in the capital,

389
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,760
but you gave up your studies halfway
and took over Silver Rain Terrace.

390
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,710
That's quite a change.

391
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,800
My father had high hopes for me,

392
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,760
hoping I wouldn't grow up

393
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,430
to kill like him.

394
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,000
But it didn't work out the way
he wanted.

395
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
After my father's death,

396
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,680
Silver Rain Terrace
has been in a state of collapse.

397
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,430
I don't want to see the sect he built

398
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,880
go to ruin.

399
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
As a son, I'm sure you'd do the same

400
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,280
if you were me.

401
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,400
Not everyone is as lucky

402
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,350
as you.

403
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,920
All my father ever hoped
for from my childhood

404
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,760
was

405
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,190
that I'd never be born,

406
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,280
and the best thing I could do for him

407
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,000
was to disappoint him.

408
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,000
Anyway,

409
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,590
you're a man of martial spirit.

410
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,230
Why are you so attracted

411
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,110
to Miss Shangguan Zhi from the capital?

412
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,640
I heard you disliked Miss Shangguan

413
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,040
a lot before,

414
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,880
but I'm puzzled

415
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,230
by your change of attitude.

416
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,190
It seems you and I have discovered

417
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,590
something about Shangguan Zhi.

418
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,070
For example?

419
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,470
For example?

420
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,800
For example,
she's an interesting person.

421
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,560
It's true. There aren't many
interesting people in Heyang.

422
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,800
Actually, you're one of them.

423
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,070
I didn't know

424
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,590
you had

425
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,920
such a high opinion of me.

426
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,920
If you and I

427
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,640
didn't like the same woman,

428
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,590
we could have been good friends.

429
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,310
Maybe.

430
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,920
Come on. Let's toast
to the potential friend.

431
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,880
There are

432
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,350
a lot of rich outsiders
living here today.

433
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,800
Tie them all up.

434
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,190
Report it to the authorities.

435
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,880
If you trust me,

436
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,110
escort Shangguan Zhi to leave now.

437
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,160
I'll give you
a satisfactory explanation.

438
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,680
All right.

439
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,430
You have a death wish.

440
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,040
You have a death wish, don't you?

441
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,680
Attack.

442
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,800
Those people out there are after us.

443
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,590
They're from the Ripple Organization.

444
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,190
You leave first, I'll watch your back.

445
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,520
Be careful.

446
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,640
I need to get rid of them.

447
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,430
What's wrong?

448
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,950
Pan Yue. Pan Yue.

449
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,470
Pan Yue.

450
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,280
Take a strand of someone's hair
and wrap it around the bottom of a cup.

451
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,040
The cup is filled
with green plum wine. Drink it,

452
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,520
and then recite the name
of the person 17 times,

453
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,640
and the person will appear.

454
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,430
Remember,

455
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,560
if you need me,

456
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,640
say my name 17 times.

457
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,430
Pan Yue.

458
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,400
Pan Yue.

459
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,470
Pan Yue.

460
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,070
Pan Yue.

461
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,230
Pan Yue.

462
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,470
Pan Yue.

463
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,710
Are you OK? Are any parts hurt?

464
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,190
You're really here.

465
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,190
It's really you.

466
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,950
Young Master Zhuo.

467
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,560
Mr. Sun, are you trying to rebel?

468
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,520
Sun Zhen,

469
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,560
I know you're still grateful
for the Zhuo family's kindness.

470
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,280
Why did you betray Silver Rain Terrace?

471
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,160
Who's behind this?

472
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,920
Young Master Zhuo,

473
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,000
there are some things

474
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,880
you'd better not know.

475
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,680
Young Master, Miss Shangguan.

476
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,520
Young Master, you were right.

477
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,800
Those people
are all from Silver Rain Terrace.

478
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,000
The one leading the attack

479
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,350
is the head, Sun Zhen.

480
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,190
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

481
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,950
It's okay. I think I caught a cold.

482
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Your forehead is burning.

483
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,800
Ze, find a place to stop.

484
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,800
Okay.

485
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,400
Let's go.

486
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:22,950
Quick.

487
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,110
Get on your knees.

488
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,560
Get on your knees.

489
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,880
Young Master Zhuo,
we've been searching all day,

490
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,590
but there's still no trace of Mr. Sun.

491
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Let's return to Heyang.

492
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,590
You must find him,

493
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,070
no matter what it takes.

494
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,190
Yes.

495
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,230
Young Master.

496
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,190
Come on, give it to me.

497
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,520
Go to the nearest herb shop
and get some herbs.

498
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,190
Yes.

499
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,070
Shangguan Zhi.

500
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,310
Shangguan Zhi.

501
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,280

watching me all night?

517
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,910
Young Master, the medicine is ready.

518
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,800
What is this?

519
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,910
Pan Yue kissed me?

520
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,190
Pan Yue kissed me.

521
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,390
Why did he kiss me?

522
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,230
Does it mean he...

523
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,800
That's impossible.

524
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,120
You're awake.

525
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,670
Come on, drink your medicine.

526
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,190
Let me drink it myself.

527
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,840
Thank you.

528
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,120
Illusion.

529
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,360
It must be an illusion.

530
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,560
Or I was just dreaming.

531
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,950
I must be dreaming.

532
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,190
I must not have woken up.

533
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,840
I must be dreaming.

534
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,710
Young Master, everything's packed.

535
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,710
Slow down a bit on the way.

536
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,230
There's no need to rush.

537
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,040
Shangguan Zhi is just feeling better.

538
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,150
Stop making her feel the bumps.

539
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,950
Young Master, I've been
with you for a long time,

540
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,800
and I've never seen you so attentive

541
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,120
and considerate to anyone.

542
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:13,840
You still won't admit

543
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,520
you have fallen for Miss Shangguan?

544
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,230
What? Can't I fall in love
with Shangguan Zhi?

545
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,230
Pan Yue likes me?

546
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,190
He really fell in love with me?

547
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,840
No wonder he asked me
to accompany him to Shen Ci's hometown

548
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,760
and was so attentive to me
all the way there.

549
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,000
That's why he just did that...

550
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,760
No. That's not right.

551
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,320
I'm now Shangguan Zhi.

552
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,470
He likes the fake Shangguan Zhi,

553
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,840
not me, Yang Caiwei.

554
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,910
No. That's not right.

555
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,910
The fake Shangguan Zhi is Yang Caiwei.

556
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,760
What's taking her

557
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,600
so long?

558
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,670
I'm done. We can depart now.

559
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,840
A month after my accident,

560
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,760
he's engaged to the princess,

561
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,870
and now he's in love with Shangguan Zhi.

562
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,470
What is he thinking?

563
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,280
To him, are feelings just like a stone

564
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,870
that he can pick up

565
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,520
and put down at any time?

566
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,800
Thank you, Mr. Pan. I can do it myself.

567
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,430
Why is she so indifferent?

568
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,230
Did I do something wrong?

569
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,910
Thank you, Mr. Pan.
Don't trouble yourself.

570
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,320
Let me help you.

571
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,320
Thank you, Mr. Pan.
Don't trouble yourself.

572
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,390
Shangguan Zhi,

573
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,430
do you have a problem with me?

574
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,870
You're the emperor's son-in-law.

575
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,390
I don't dare to have a problem with you.

576
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,430
The emperor's son-in-law?

577
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,360
This misunderstanding needs
to be cleared up as soon as possible.

578
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,780
[To Pan Yue]

579
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,100
[To Pan Yue]

580
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,460
[To Pan Yue]

581
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,560
Young Master, the princess...

582
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,670
I didn't see anything.

583
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,430
What are you panicking about?

584
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,670
Young Master, you got a letter
from the princess.

585
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,660
[To Mr. Pan,
from Princess Changle]

586
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,280
Carrying the princess's letter with you

587
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,000
and falling in love
with Shangguan Zhi at the same time,

588
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,190
you really don't miss a beat.

589
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,150
No, no matter how curious I am,

590
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,430
I shouldn't open his letter.

591
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,080
If you're so curious,

592
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,870
why don't you open it yourself?

593
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,870
I haven't opened this letter yet.

594
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,230
Read it for me.

595
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,040
Did it say anything important?

596
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,390
My engagement to the princess

597
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,840
