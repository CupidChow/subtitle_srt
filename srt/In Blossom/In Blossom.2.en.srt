188
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,470
There's no beef in her stomach.

189
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,350
She was strangled to death from behind.

190
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,150
And the killer made it look like
she committed suicide.

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,470
You bribed the maid to poison the beef,

192
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,550
and you wanted to kill her after that.

193
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,470
She struggled to death.

194
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,590
The scratches should be on the arm.

195
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,400
The green and red inks from your skin
found under her nails

196
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,760
are unique to the Silver Rain Terrace.

197
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,550
All of you must be
very familiar with it.

198
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,880
I don't need to say much about it.

199
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,640
Mr. Chen.

200
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,030
You killed nine people of the Li family

201
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,550
and the evidence is clear now.

202
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,150
You can no longer deny it.

203
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,640
Did you try to fool me?

204
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
If I'm dead,

205
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,000
you can't live either.

206
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,200
Wait.

207
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,840
What's wrong with you?

208
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,470
I've seen too many corpses

209
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,320
dumped in the mass graves.

210
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,550
Those people lived happily

211
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,710
but died without dignity.

212
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,350
I have thought

213
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,840
if I knew the time I would die,

214
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,660
I must
find a beautiful peach blossom forest

215
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,710
in advance

216
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,320
for the burial of my body.

217
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,840
That forest looks quite good.

218
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,550
Although there are only a few trees now,

219
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,910
in another month,

220
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,790
thousands of peach blossoms will be
in full bloom, bright, and red like fire.

221
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,910
Pink peach blossoms

222
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,350
will be all over the mountain.

223
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,320
You are still the same
as when you were a child,

224
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,670
you still like peach blossoms.

225
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,520
Yes,

226
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
when I was a kid, I watched...

227
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,200
Don't need to cover it anymore,

228
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,320
I already looked into it.

229
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,550
Ten years ago,

230
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
your father was convicted and exiled.

231
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,200
He encountered robbers on the road.

232
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,640
Both of your parents died.

233
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,200
You fled to Heyang

234
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,710
and were adopted by Mr. Jiang.

235
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,550
Eight years ago,

236
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,760
you started working
as Mr. Jiang's assistant.

237
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,230
Five years ago,

238
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,280
Mr. Jiang's madness was getting worse.

239
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,960
He was dismissed from the county yamen.

240
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,960
You started working and moving bodies
at the Coffin Home.

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,080
And you've taken care of him
until this day.

242
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,960
Do you want me to continue?

243
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,350
Why were you looking for me?

244
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,030
I want you to be
the real Yang Caiwei again.

Miss Shangguan.

250
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,000
You've pursued slim beauty too much

251
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
and hurt the fundamentals.

252
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,840
Let me carefully condition your body.

253
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,760
I am willing to endure any pain for you.

Why are you here?

260
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,310
Shouldn't you attend

the tea class at this time?

262
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,400

You might catch a cold later.

I asked you to inquire
about his whereabouts before,

is there any news?

271
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,310
Don't worry.

are spread all over the world,

there should be news soon.

275
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,830
I heard that the Pan Mansion
has been closed for the past two days.

I know

277
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,400
Yue showed his good interest
in the princess

278
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,000
because he wanted to make Pan Hui angry.

279
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,710
Could it be that
the princess believes it

280
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,230
and wants to force him into a marriage?

281
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,110
Don't worry.

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,350

00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,350
He painted it blindly.

555
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,560
Blindly?

556
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,000
But the painting is quite good.

557
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
One has a scar on the face,

558
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,760
and the other
carries a wound in the heart.

559
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,590
They should have been a perfect match.

560
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,760
It's a pity.

561
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,680
Such a pity.

562
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,680
We're reaching
the end of Ghost Market.

563
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,590
Why haven't we seen
the person selling the Spirit Snake yet?

564
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,640
Xiaosheng!

565
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,830
Caiwei!

566
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,760
You're here.

567
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,230
What are you looking at?

568
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,680
[Bai Xiaosheng,
vendor in Ghost Market]

569
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,760
This man is...

570
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,830
He's our apprentice at the Coffin Home,

571
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,000
and he hasn't seen much of the world.

572
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,640
Today, I brought him here
to broaden his horizons.

573
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,760
His physique is all right.

574
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,950
Can he carry a body?

575
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,760
Yes, he can.

576
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,230
You still need more practice.

577
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,400
Don't mess things up for Miss Yang.

578
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,110
Exactly.

579
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,640
Listen to her, practice more.

580
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,000
Xiaosheng,

581
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,470
has the Spirit Snake catcher
arrived yet?

582
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,470
He's here.
I've been keeping an eye out for you.

583
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,880
But

584
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,070
the old guy

585
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,640
is quite the drinker.

586
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,070
I don't know where he is right now.

587
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
All right,

588
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,070
now even my money is on the line.

589
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,520
Here, take it.

590
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,560
Take everything you want.

591
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Just kidding.

592
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,080
We share a bond of asking for meals,

593
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,360
so how could I take your money for real?

594
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,600
That old guy is probably lounging
by the river, getting drunk.

595
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,430
I'll take you to find him.

596
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,150
All right. Let's go.

597
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,670
Move.

598
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,140
[Sunrise Garden]

599
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,840
This is Mr. Pan's residence.

600
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,230
Unauthorized people
are not allowed to disturb.

601
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,800
Leave.

602
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,800
Take a good look.

603
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Is Young Lady
an unauthorized person here?

604
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,230
Miss Shangguan.

605
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,040
Miss Shangguan.

606
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,760
Miss Shangguan.

607
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,430
What's wrong, Miss Shangguan?

608
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:16,870
Scram!

609
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,040
- Noted.
- Noted.

610
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,800
Wake up, sir.

611
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,520
It's time for business.

612
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,390
I want to buy a Spotted Spirit Snake.

613
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,520
Want to buy Spotted Spirit Snake?

614
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,040
Yes.

615
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,950
You're lucky.

616
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,360
Let me show you something.

617
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,840
This...

618
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,470
This Spotted Spirit Snake
hides in the snowy mountains,

619
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,600
only revealing itself
when the snow melts.

620
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,000
You won't find another one like this

621
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,950
in the entire Ghost Market.

622
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,840
Don't raise the price.
Just tell me how much you're selling it.

623
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,800
Fifty guan,

624
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,150
not a wen less.

625
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,870
Sir,

626
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,600
last time we agreed

627
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,710
on ten guan.

628
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,800
Ten?

629
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,360
Right.

630
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,360
Don't you remember me?

631
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,560
Circumstances change.

632
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,950
I spent over a month
in the snowy mountains

633
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,280
to catch this one,

634
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,800
and I froze my leg doing it.

635
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,080
I won't be able to go back
to the snowy mountains after this.

636
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,190
I have to make up

637
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,840
the medical expenses

638
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,150
from this, right?

639
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,560
Enough, right?

640
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,720
Yes, enough.

641
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
I don't deserve it.

642
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,470
I'll figure out my own affairs.

643
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,150
You...

644
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,080
Sir,

645
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,520
take this money first.

646
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,630
I'll make up for it

647
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,040
within a month.

648
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,120
For every day overdue,

649
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,150
I'll add another guan.

650
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,390
All right.

651
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,120
Sell it.

652
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,360
All right,

653
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,150
I'll sell it to you.

654
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,080
Here, take this snake.

655
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,150
Thank you, sir.

656
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,360
It's just some silvers.

657
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,950
Do we need to settle up so precisely?

658
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,840
It's better to settle things clearly

659
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,430
since we met by chance.

660
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,390
Who is he?

661
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,520
Come, take a look.

662
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,320
It's him.

663
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,800
He's Pan Yue,

664
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,190
the imperial censorate.

665
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,150
- Pan Yue?
- Pan Yue?

666
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,120
What's he doing here?

667
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,150
He's the Pan Yue who wants to marry you?

668
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,080
Yes.

669
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,310
Who is this guy?

670
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,230
Sir,

671
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,000
do you still want
to conceal your identity?

672
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,670
Pan Yue.

673
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,910
Who is he?

674
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,840
Ghost Market isn't for officials.

675
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,000
Put down your stuff

676
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,910
and leave quickly.

677
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,390
I came to the Ghost Market
to buy things.

678
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,120
There's nothing to do with him.

679
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,800
Give it to me.

680
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,520
Let go of me.

681
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,150
Spirit Snake.

682
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,430
Caiwei!

683
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,230
- What are you doing?
- Let go!

684
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:13,870
The Spirit Snake!

685
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,360
Are you crazy?
The river is full of knives.

686
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,120
The Spirit Snake is gone.
I can't save Master.

687
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,390
What should I do?

688
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,950
The Spirit Snake...

689
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,430
He really jumped into it.

690
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,230
Pan Yue!

691
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,320
Is he out of his mind?

692
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:30,560
So amazing.

693
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,840
He really risked his life.

694
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,800
Yes, it's so dangerous.

695
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,280
He's got guts.

696
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,800
The river has knives in it.

697
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,430
Looks like the thing
is really important to him.

698
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,360
You're right.

699
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,060
Pan Yue.

700
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,140
He's really brave.

701
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,000
No movement. Is he dead?

702
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,190
- Shut up.
- Stop it.

703
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,470
Pan Yue.

704
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,760
Pan Yue.

705
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,150
Why is there still no movement?

706
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,190
Is he all right?

707
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,360
He's out.

708
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,150
Pan Yue.

709
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,760
I got it.

710
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:54,560
He got it.

711
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,280
- Yes.
- That's amazing.

712
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,120
So brave.

713
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,560
He isn't an ordinary person.

714
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,760
- Yes.
- Right.

715
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,190
Mr. Pan,

716
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
I'm grateful

717
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
for your help,

718
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,430
but Heyang is not where you should be.

719
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,080
Ten years ago,

720
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,080
you had someone tell me
to sever ties with you.

721
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,560
We've been strangers since then.

722
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,630
Regardless of whether

723
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,910
you're here on a whim

724
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,190
or out of guilt,

725
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,760
it doesn't matter anymore.

726
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,870
Let bygones be bygones.

727
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,760
It ends here.

728
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,040
Is that all right?

729
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,360
Yang Caiwei,

730
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,670
you're not as heartless toward me

731
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,390
as you claim,

732
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,760
are you?

733
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,190
I never knew you came to me back then.

734
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,320
Whatever was said to you
by the person at my door,

735
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,760
it was probably on my father's orders.

736
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,800
Over the years,

737
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,710
I'd been searching for news
about you everywhere.

738
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,150
When I found out you were in Heyang,

739
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,760
I rushed here immediately.

740
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,520
I thought

741
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,280
