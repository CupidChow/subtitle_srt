[Episode 8]

19
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,440
Mr. Pan, what do we do now?

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,550
I don't want to...

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
die.

[Chen Qingqing,
a rich merchant's daughter from Jiangnan]

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,110
I'm good.

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,550
So what now?

26
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,190
If Cai Sheng had really wanted to kill us,

27
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,080
he could have done so.

28
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,550
Making a fuss out of this is unnecessary.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,720
Someone must have targeted us

30
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,240
before we came
into the Life and Death House.

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
They are seeking a chance to kill us

32
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,030
using someone else's hands.

33
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,750
If Cai Sheng isn't with them,

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,440
we still have a chance.

35
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,360
Mr. Cai.

36
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,190
Shall we talk before you take action?

37
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,830
Mr. Cai.

He is Pan Yue.

39
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,470
I didn't expect it to be you.

40
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,670
Anyway, even if you are the Emperor,

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,110
you have to die

42
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,000
for invading my turf and killing my woman.

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,390
You open a gambling house in Heyang.

44
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,600
As the magistrate,

45
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,720
how could you accuse me of invasion?

46
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,520
Besides,

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,000
I only gambled. I didn't kill anyone.

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,520
You didn't kill anyone?

49
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,110
Mr. Pan, it seems

50
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,600
that you don't take responsibility
for your own actions.

51
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,320
Do you want to meet your demise

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,190
or beg for forgiveness?

53
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,000
I heard that you were once
an escaped slave,

54
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,600
and you staked your life
in the beast cage gamble

55
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,880
with a dozen people.

56
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,910
Finally,

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,440
you made it out alive.

58
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,880
Not only did you gain freedom,

59
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,800
but you also got a handsome reward.

60
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,000
You made a great fortune from gambling
and bought the Life and Death House.

61
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,030
You became the most influential person
in Heyang,

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,520
right after the Silver Rain Terrace.

63
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,390
Mr. Cai.

64
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,110
Did I get that right?

65
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,000
Mr. Pan, aren't you here to gamble?

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,440
Why did you run a background on me?

67
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,440
I'm not like you.

68
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,510
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
in my mouth.

69
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,160
I was born lowly.

70
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,270
I need to earn my own reputation.

71
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,480
I would like to learn from you

72
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,920
and stake my life

73
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,720
on a bet with you.

74
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,950
What are we betting on?

75
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,110
If I'm captured today,

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,830
whether alive or not,

77
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,070
I'm responsible for it,

78
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,510
not you.

79
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,230
But if I can leave here alive...

80
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,070
What do you want?

81
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,880
Life and Death House

82
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,350
will stop gambling with people's lives,

83
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,790
will abide by laws,

84
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,230
and will stop opposing the county yamen.

85
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,640
Fine.

86
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,320
Since you choose another way to die,

87
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,480
let's bet.

88
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,160
I give you half an hour

89
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,920
to write your last letter.

90
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,670
After that,

91
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,160
the game starts.

92
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,110
Mr. Pan, are you writing the letter?

93
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,920
You made preparations.

94
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,040
I'm not like you,

95
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,000
who broke in here unprepared.

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,200
Life and Death House outnumber us,
and they are well-trained.

97
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,320
If we want to get out of here,

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
there is only one way.

99
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,160
They are after me.

100
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,390
Later, I

101
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,510
will stall them here.

102
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,000
You go to Cai Sheng's study

103
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,320
to find a fish-tailed key.

104
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,390
Once you find it,

105
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,720
we will meet on the top floor.

106
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,720
All right.

107
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:17,880
Mr. Pan,

108
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,070
be careful.

109
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,880
You too.

110
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,670
Charge!

111
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,550
Yes.

112
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Mr. Cai, that woman is gone.

113
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,950
The few of you, come with me.

114
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,790
Yes.

115
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,320
That woman is over there. Go!

116
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,910
Did you get it?

117
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,150
Yes.

118
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,910
Let's go upstairs.

119
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,960
Turns out this is the place
to refine five minerals powder.

120
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,470
No wonder there was smoke.

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,030
Isn't there a door?

122
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,150
Where is it?

123
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,060
Open the door.

124
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,470
You have sealed your fate.

125
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,960
Break open the door.

126
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,030
Mr. Pan, the dice cup is open.

127
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,520
The game is over.

128
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,320
Admit your defeat.

129
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,670
Not really.

130
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,840
Let's go.

131
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,520
Jump.

132
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Mr. Cai, they can't run fast by boat.

133
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,670
I will go after them.

134
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,000
No need.

135
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,520
This is the rule of Life and Death House.

136
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,350
He won.

137
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,200
I admit my defeat.

138
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,320
I could only use you to approach Pan Yue

139
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,670
and expose his true color.

140
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,000
I promise you.

141
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,790
The culprit will face justice

142
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,280
to let you rest in peace.

143
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,550
Jump!

144
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,110
He is not the killer.

145
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,790
He has been secretly investigating
the cause of my death.

146
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,590
I misunderstood him.

147
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,030
How do you feel now?

148
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,150
I'm fine.

149
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,670
What kind of person are you?

150
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,030
I mean,

151
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,760
we have known each other
for almost 20 years.

152
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,200
But during my days in Heyang,

153
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,030
I always feel
that I can't see you through.

154
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,000
A person has a thousand facets.

155
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,640
What you see isn't necessarily real,

156
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,470
and what you don't see
isn't necessarily fake.

157
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,000
For example, you.

158
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,080
Me?

159
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
You are so much different

160
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,350
compared to the past.

161
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,640
How am I different?

162
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,280
Corpses can give us information.

163
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,080
We will lose the chance
if we don't ask now.

164
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,880
These bodies have been found
to be poisoned.

165
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,520
I'm going to find the source
of the poison now.

166
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,670
Mr. Pan, look.

167
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,440
Look at this.

168
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,400
No idea.

169
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,640
Perhaps

170
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,320
I'm overthinking.

171
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,840
You helped me.

172
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,880
I'm very grateful to you.

173
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,550
But Heyang isn't where you should be.

174
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,230
Ten years ago,

175
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,790
you had someone convey a message
to cut ties with me.

176
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,470
We have been strangers since then.

177
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,110
Let bygones be bygones.

178
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,440
This is it.

179
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,520
If you hadn't gone looking for her,
she wouldn't have died.

180
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,840
In the end,

181
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,840
you brought harm to her.

182
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,110
Pan Yue,

183
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,710
it's not that you overthought.

184
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,470
But can I tell you everything?

185
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,910
Cheng?

186
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,640
Master, what is wrong?

187
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,030
Pan Yue took the token.

188
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,230

205

Young Lady, you actually risked your life

206

to woo a man.

207
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,520

Shangguan Zhi instead.

00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,680
You have the pleasure
to come here for a drink.

372
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,430
Yes.

373
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,400
I have finally come around to something.

374
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,350
Naturally, I'm happy.

375
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,430
You look relaxed too.

376
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,400
I have also come around to something.

377
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,520
I feel relaxed.

378
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,160
My mind is at peace,
and I feel delightful.

379
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,110
Mr. Pan, please enjoy your drink.

380
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,070
I will take my leave.

381
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,350
Mr. Pan, this is unexpected.

382
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,710
Miss Qing, you are well-informed
about everything that happened in Heyang.

383
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,350
I want you to help me

384
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,590
identify something.

385
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,800
I haven't seen it before.

386
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,950
Are you sure?

387
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,110
Even if you don't believe me,

388
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,590
there is no need to stare at me.

389
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,470
Staring at the face of a fancy lady

390
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,400
who is covered with makeup

391
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,040
and has rich experience

392
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,400
won't give you any hints.

393
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,760
Since I have formed an alliance with you,

394
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,430
I will certainly tell you anything
you want to know.

395
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,310
I won't hide it from you.

396
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,470
Speaking of our alliance,

397
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,950
tomorrow is the seventh day

398
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,230
I promised to Silver Rain Terrace.

399
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,520
Rest assured. Everything is ready.

400
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:08,900
[Gambling House]

401
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,760
Xiaosheng.

402
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,800
Caiwei.

403
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,520
I haven't seen or heard about it.

404
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,800
Caiwei, you see.

405
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,110
The pattern

406
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,640
resembles water ripples.

407
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,830
Probably, it's related to the sects
on the water.

408
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,040
As long as you pay enough money,

409
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,280
I will get whatever intel you want.

410
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,070
Don't worry about the money.

411
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,040
Go ahead and investigate.

412
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,710
You can count on me.

413
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,760
By the way,

414
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,430
how is Master?

415
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,280
He is doing well. He eats and sleeps well.

416
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,400
But he keeps mentioning you.

417
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,400
I must find the truth quickly

418
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,470
and reunite with Master.

419
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,430
The man the waiter mentioned must be him.

420
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,000
But why would a noble lady
from the capital

421
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,040
befriend a peddler
in the Ghost Market?

422
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,950
This is a treasure from the ancient Chu.

423
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,680
I'm going to make a huge profit out of it.

424
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,470
Jiang?

425
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,000
Um... It's going to rain.

426
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,110
Jeez, bad weather.

427
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,520
What are you doing?

428
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,560
Why are you running away?

429
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,230
You...

430
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,000
You are a woman.

431
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,350
Can't you tell?

432
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,070
I have something to ask.

433
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,000
I know everything happens
around this place.

434
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
As long as you pay me enough money,

435
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,430
you can inquire about anyone.

436
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,590
Is it enough?

437
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,160
Go on. Who do you want to ask about?

438
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,280
Shangguan Zhi.

439
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,040
I don't know her.

440
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,190
Hey, can you...

441
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,670
All right.

442
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,080
I might know. Ask away.

443
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Both of you took me back
to the inn a few days ago.

444
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,870
Why did you help me?

445
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,280
Also, how did she know
about the orchid knot?

446
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,360
What orchid knot?

447
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,470
My friend invented this knot.

448
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,600
No one would know about that
except for her.

449
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,910
Did you try to scare me

450
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,190
just to know about this?

451
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,590
Your friend is called Yang Caiwei, right?

452
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,120
Do you know Yang Caiwei?

453
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,230
Of course. We were close.

454
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,040
Caiwei was very kind to me.

455
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,470
She taught me how to tie the orchid knot.

456
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,600
Here's what happened that day.

457
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,430
When I passed by a tavern,

458
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,630
I saw you drunk

459
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,040
and was yelling Caiwei's name.

460
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,560
I figured you two must know each other

461
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,470
and might be friends.

462
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,080
So, I was generous enough

463
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,470
to carry you back.

464
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,520
Miss Shangguan was just helping me.

465
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,630
I didn't expect you to be so ungrateful.

466
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,040
You pointed your sword at me
and harassed me.

467
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,760
I feel sorry for Caiwei.

468
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,710
I didn't harass you.

469
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,230
What is your name?

470
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,520
Bai Xiaosheng.

471
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,430
Since you are Yang Caiwei's friend,

472
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,470
why were you with Shangguan Zhi?

473
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
I heard

474
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,390
that Shangguan Zhi
wasn't kind to Yang Caiwei.

475
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
Miss Shangguan bought jewelry from me,

476
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,190
so we got to know each other.

477
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,040
I think she isn't as obnoxious

478
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,710
as the rumors describe.

479
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,190
Hence, we...

480
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,630
Pan Yue is the one to blame.

481
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,520
He forced Caiwei to marry him
and kill her.

482
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,630
Not only that, he was also messing
with Miss Shangguan

483
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,840
and toying with her feelings.

484
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,000
Well,

485
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,800
the enemy of your enemy
is your friend, right?

486
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,080
I heard about his seven-day promise
with Silver Rain Terrace.

487
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,520
So I'm going to take this opportunity
to find clues

488
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,800
against this hypocrite.

489
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,040
Did you find anything?

490
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,390
I did.

491
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,360
I...

492
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,840
You have asked so many questions.

493
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,600
You want to know everything?

494
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,120
I didn't take your money

495
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,670
to answer your question just now.

496
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:39,950
Besides,
I need Miss Shangguan's permission

497
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,600
before I answer you.

498
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,760
Are you done? I'm leaving.

499
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,000
Bye.

00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,600
The bet is closed.

502
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,230
The result of the bet
between Mr. Pan and Young Master Zhuo

503
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,360
of Silver Rain Terrace
will be revealed tomorrow.

[Huge Profit, Make a Good Fortune]

505

Mr. Pan could settle

506
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,430
the ruthless Cai Sheng.

507
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,470
Dealing with Young Master Zhuo

508
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
is an absolute breeze to him.

509
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,560
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

510
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,760
The powerful dragon
can never suppress a local snake.

511
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,040
Despite Mr. Pan being resourceful,

512
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,950
he's not going to bring
Silver Rain Terrace down.

513
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,150
Don't be ridiculous.

514
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm going to count my winnings tomorrow.

515
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,390
Everyone.

516
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,390
Silver Rain Terrace is coming soon.

517
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,630
Yesterday, I went to the temple
to draw a lot.

518
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,710
Guess what I got.

519
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,670
An ominous sign.

520
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,080
Should we do some early preparation?

521
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,080
What is there to prepare?

522
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,280
Get ready to run.

523
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,190
Think about this.
If both sides get into a fight,

524
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,190
Young Master Zhuo

525
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,080
can kill small fish like us effortlessly.

526
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,280
Ugh.

00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,910
Constable Liu.

528
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,520
You have to make a decision.

529
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,190
Should we run away or not?

530
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,870
I have been thinking about this
last night.

531
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,360
One whole night.

532
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,600
I can't decide.

533
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,430
You see.

534
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,560
If we don't run away,

535
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,390
we might die here.

536
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,280
But if we run away,

537
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,560
we haven't received
the salary this month yet.

538
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,000
It will be a great loss for us

539
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,600
if they don't fight.

540
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,600
You...

541
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,080
You are being penny-wise
and pound-foolish.

542
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,800
Run away if you want.

543
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,600
If there were no such fight,

544
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,320
we would be living in humiliation
in Heyang.

545
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,840
I'm a foreigner.

546
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,080
Shut up.

547
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:58,910
Hold on.

548
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,430
Hearing your rumble,

00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,230
turns out you are all just a coward.

550
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,280
Run away if you want.

551
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,520
I swear I will stand with Mr. Pan

552
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,190
and fight against

553
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,080

556
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,470
you have placed all your money on Mr. Pan.

557
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,190
That's right.

558
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,360
Quit pretending to be a righteous man.

559
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,650
Registrar, this is bad!

560
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,280
The Four Greats are here.

561
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,870
Three of the Four Greats have come.

562
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,120
Mr. Pan is in the soup.

563
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,940
[Heyang Magistrate's Office]

564
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,100
What a grand gesture
from Silver Rain Terrace.

565
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,280
Are you setting an ambush

566
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,610
even before the real show starts?

567
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,040
You got the wrong idea, Mr. Pan.

568
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,150
Gathering you and Silver Rain Terrace
in the same place

569
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,910
is a rare sight in Heyang.

570
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,600
Both of us are here for this rare sight.

571
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,430
We won't interfere. Don't worry.

572
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,040
Mr. Gu is right.

573
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,430
Young Master Zhuo said

574
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,800
he wanted to kick you out of Heyang.

575
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,360
I was curious

576
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,600
what he would do to chuck you out.

577
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,870
So I came here with this anticipation.

578
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,390
Mr. Pan, today is the seventh day.

579
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,080
Yang Caiwei's falling-off-building case,

580
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,800
you need to give us an answer.

581
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,760
No rush.

582
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,280
You can't get away with it
by stalling time.

583
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,670
So what if I can't get away with this?

584
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,470
You ask me?

585
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,710
If the county yamen doesn't act
according to the law,

586
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,390
what is the point of keeping it?

587
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,840
It can be burned down.

588
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,000
Mr. Pan, the culprit of
the falling-off-building case is here.

589
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,040
Bring the person in.

590
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,190
Yes.

591
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,360
Don't worry.

592
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,390
I have prepared a gift for you.

593
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,680
So Pan Yue and Qing Di whispered

594
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,760
about finding a scapegoat.

595
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,870
That explains why he isn't worried

596
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,000
about the seven-day deadline.

597
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,870
It's you.

598
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,320
What is going on?

599
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,760
I used to serve Mr. Chen.

600
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,840
That ugly woman killed Mr. Chen.

601
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,560
I swore to avenge Mr. Chen.

602
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:43,910
So I disguised as a guest

603
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,840
and sneaked into the wedding,

604
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,390
trying to knock that ugly woman out.

605
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,950
Then,

606
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,280
I pushed her off the building.

607
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,280
I'm afraid the incident
is much more complicated.

608
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,040
Young Master Zhuo...

609
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,080
Young Master Zhuo cherishes
the people of Heyang.

610
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,190
He determined to seek the truth
for Miss Yang.

611
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,000
We are truly impressed

612
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,560
by his sincerity.

613
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,390
As for

614
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,190
this audacious murderer,

615
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,150
I believe he has nothing to do
with Silver Rain Terrace.

616
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,600
This is a misunderstanding.

617
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,430
We don't have to estrange the officials

618
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,190
for a murderer.

619
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,230
Mr. Sun, am I right?

620
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,870
Young Master Zhuo has arrived.

621
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,940
[Court]

622
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,320
Greetings, Young Master Zhuo.

623
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,190
Is he the young master
of the Silver Rain Terrace

624
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,320
who wiped out the Gold Water Sect
three years ago?

625
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,710
He has never shown his face before.

626
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,040
Jiang?

627
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,040
He's the young master
