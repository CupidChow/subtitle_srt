Greetings, Young Master.

00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,480
Is this the young master of
Silver Rain Terrace,

26
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,510
who massacred the Gold Water Sect
three years ago?

27

Did you kill Yang Caiwei?

I did.

Mr. Chen's subordinates

36
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,080
are all timid and afraid of death.

37
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,030
However, you're gutsy enough
to own up to this.

Seems like someone has the goods on you.

Let me explain.

Young Master,
you can't blame me for this.

48
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,000
You didn't attend
the patriarchal clan meetings

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,390
back then.

50
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,470
You only sent your messenger there

51
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,160
and told us not to interfere

52
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,030

Besides, the princess is his backer.

Young Master,
you're young and impulsive.

57
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,360
If you stir things up,

58
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,360
I'm afraid the foothold
the Four Greats had established in Heyang

59
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,030
will be affected.

60
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,830
Therefore, I thought

61
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,960
it was better to sacrifice

Court Master, I didn't expect you
to be so considerate.

67

but she suffered a wrongful death
because of you.

Mr. Pan, no matter what,

92
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,320
you have to give me an account today.

93

95
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,600
Of course.

96

how to make the orchid knot.

some accessories from me.

119

That's how I got to know her.

120
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,320
What is Jiang up to again?

121
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,160
Did you recognize me or not?

122
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,230
Miss Shangguan,

123
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,670
you're gutsy and bold indeed.

124
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,880
Your straight words
sounded like thunder to my ears.

125
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,950
I was reckless just now.

126
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,160
But Miss Shangguan, you said

127
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,390
I was framing the innocent.

128
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,510
Could it be that you already knew

129
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,070
who the culprit was?

130
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,270
That's right.

131
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,040
Back then, Mr. Pan and I
went to the Life and Death House

132
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,000
to capture the culprit.

133
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,270
It was kept a secret

134
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,830
because we didn't want to alert him
to our presence.

135
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,600
Even if you don't believe Mr. Pan,

136
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,880
you should believe me, no?

137
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,200
Miss Shangguan,

138
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I do believe you.

139
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,480
Young Master, Shangguan Zhi
is on Pan Yue's side.

140
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,480
We mustn't believe her.

141
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,670
I said, I believe her.

142
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,110
Since the culprit is dead,

143
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,720
the seven-day promise
between me and Mr. Pan is over.

144
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,640
But Mr. Pan, remember this.

145
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,390
You owe me one blow.

146
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,320
Wait, is he leaving already?

147
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,960
His bark was way worse than his bite.

148
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,080
That was no fun at all.

149
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,760
I'm sure he'll think that I'm being nosy

150
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,550
for what I did just now.

151
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,350
Maybe he'll use that as an excuse

152
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,520
to chase me out of the county yamen.

153
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,640
No way.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,760

as a member of the county yamen,

158
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,590
it was my duty to stand up for you.

159
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,840
Mr. Pan, please don't stand on ceremony.

160
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,400
The county yamen was in trouble
and you were maligned.

161
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,350
If I just stood idly by,

162
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
I would've wasted your kindness

163
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,960
for allowing me
to join the county yamen back then.

164
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,710
Constable Liu,

165
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,910
am I right?

166
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah.

167
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,350
Miss Shangguan,

168
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,910
you were so brave today.

169
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,080
We have to risk our lives

170
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,440
to protect Mr. Pan's dignity

171
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
and the county yamen's safety.

172
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,470
Miss Shangguan, you were unfazed
even though you were in danger.

173
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,710
You saved the county yamen
from deep trouble.

174
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,150
A girl like you has
the might of 10,000 men.

175
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,110
We were utterly impressed.

176
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,470
Yeah, utterly.

177
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,320
What did I tell you guys back then?

178
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,790
Do you guys remember?

179
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,110
Evil will never prevail against good.

180
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,520
He may be arrogant because he's
the young master of Silver Rain Terrace.

181
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,200
But no matter

182
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
how arrogant he is,
he can never best Miss Shangguan

183
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,590
and Mr. Pan.

184
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,640
That's right.

185
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,710
You flatter me.

186
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,230
You flatter me.

187
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,110
So

188
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,790
I need to thank you for this?

189
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,080
Mr. Pan, I'm your subordinate.

190
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,080
Therefore, this is my duty.

191
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,440
So you still remember your identity,
huh?

192
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,590
Who allowed you to tell other people

193
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,910
about the culprit?

194
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,110
Who allowed you

195
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,670
to start a conflict with Zhuo Lanjiang
in public?

196
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,440
But...

197
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,080
Well...

198
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,590
If you wish to remain
in the county yamen,

199
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,110
you'd better be clear
about your identity.

200
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,230
If you act on your own initiative
and take such risks again,

201
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,230
I'll instruct Ze to send you back
to your residence immediately.

202
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,840
Does that mean he won't
hold it against me?

203
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Thank you, Mr. Pan.

204
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,350
Tell our men to keep an eye on her.

205
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,910
Mr. Pan, seems like you're worried
about Miss Shangguan's safety.

206
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,550
She talked back to the young master
of Silver Rain Terrace in public.

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,110
How can I face Shangguan Lan

208
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,080
if something happens to her?

209
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,960
- Fatso Li.
- Why isn't our meal here yet?

210
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,280
Fatso Li, what are you doing?

211
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,200
Where's our food?

212
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,280
That Fatso Li. Fatso Li!

213
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,760
Fatso Li, what are you doing?

214
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,840
Are you trying to starve us to death?

215
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,670
We're in trouble!

216
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,710
Constable Liu, come and take a look!

217
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,440
What's going on?

218
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,760
We're in huge trouble!

219
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,880
Let's go and check it out.

220
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,470
- Let's go.
- Let's go and take a look.

221
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,400
Well... I'm sure he ran away

222
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,840
with our food money!

223
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,960
I was just saying, you know?
I never expected him to run away.

224
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,840
So, what will we have for lunch?

225
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,710
That's right.

226
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,350
That... That's right.

227
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,470
It's okay for us to starve.

228
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,440
But we can't just
let Miss Shangguan starve.

229
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,280
That's right.

230
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,760
I can skip one meal.
I'm used to skipping meals.

231
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,110
Young Lady, that won't do.

232
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,790
She's my missus.

233
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,760
I'll take care of her.

234
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,960
Are you sure about that?

235
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,350
Get out of the way.

236
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,230
I can do this.

237
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,440
What...

238
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,840
It must've been tough.

239
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,470
Chen San,

240
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,320
the dish she made looks much better
than what Fatso Li made.

241
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,400
It does look good.

242
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,200
But I wonder how it tastes.

243
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,080
Try it on our behalf, then.

244
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,840
I'll give it a try.

245
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,590
How is it?

246
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,200
Delicious!

247
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,230
Delicious!

248
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,640
Miss Ling,

249
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,710
you must be the God of Cooking
in your past life.

250
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,470
It smells amazing.

251
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,110
Let me try.

252
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,440
Get me my liquor!

253
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,470
Young Lady, here.

254
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,470
We finally got
to hold our heads up high today.

255
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,280
In the future,
this day of every upcoming year...

256
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,440
What's the date again?

257
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,670
It's the fourth month.

258
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,110
It's the sixth day of the fourth month.

259
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,790
That's right. In the future,
I'll have a drink

260
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,520
on the sixth day of the fourth month.

261
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,350
That's right.
We have to drink on this day.

262
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,280
That's right.
Today's the sixth day of the month.

263
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
It's the day I agreed
to drink with Jiang every month.

264
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,710
Since he already recognized me,

265
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,030
would he wait for me at the tavern?

266
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,140
[Liquor]

267
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,960
Young Master Zhuo,

268
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,470
this is Huangfeng liquor,
which has been brewed for ten years.

269
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,520
Please enjoy your drink.

270
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,000
No need for that.

271
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,350
Young Master, but...

272
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,320
This is the best liquor
we have in store.

273
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,710
I'll have

274
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,030
what I used to have here.

275
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,880
Also, do not call me Young Master
in the future.

276
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,320
Treat it
as if you don't know my identity.

277
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,080
Yes, sir.

278
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,110
Come back.

279
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,150
Take the liquor away.

280
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,640
Although Heyang is a lively place,

281
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,520
I only have you and one other friend

282
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,910
to chat and drink with.

283
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm different from you.

284
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,030
You're the only friend
I can chat and drink with.

285
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,520
You have a point.

286
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,910
What do you mean? Explain yourself.

287
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,840
Let me analyze the situation for you.

288
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,200
You see,

289
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,790
you might be a poor kid
who came from the countryside.

290
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,230
No. You might be a poor scholar too.

291
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,350
Maybe you tried to make a name
for yourself

292
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,320
after studying for a few years.

293
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,320
It's a shame that you didn't manage
to achieve anything.

294
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,470
You aren't good at anything
in particular.

295
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,230
But you heard that Heyang was
filled with opportunities.

296
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,440
That's why you wish to make
a name for yourself in this city.

297
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,030
But it's a shame

298
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,030
that Heyang is different
from what you imagined.

299
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,230
This is a city of sin.

300
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,200
Everything here

301
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,230
is monopolized by the Four Greats.

302
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,960
You don't have any resources
or connections.

303
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,550
It'll be harder for you
to achieve success here.

304
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,440
And now, you've achieved nothing.

305
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,350
However,

306
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,030
you got yourself in debt
and made enemies.

307
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,280
You hide
from those who try to hunt you down.

308
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,470
Therefore,

309
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,350
you're all by yourself even now.

310
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,880
Lower your volume.

311
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,110
We won't be able to drink in peace

312
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,080
if people find out
that I'm an undertaker of the Coffin Home.

313
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,030
How was my analysis? Was I on point?

314
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,710
I guess so.

315
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,230
This world is dangerous.

316
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,710
I have no one to depend on indeed.

317
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,550
Since that's the case,

318
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,350
why are you still here, then?

319
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Because I still have you with me.

320
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,790
You're a good friend
whom I can drink with once per month.

321
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,790
Yeah, we're good friends.

322
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,640
Young Master.

323
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,840
Young Master, I knew you would be here.

324
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,790
What's the matter?

325
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,790
Those old foxes.

326
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,520
They're getting restless

327
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,230
when they don't get their way, huh?

328
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,470
Young Master.

329
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,470
Enough.
I didn't say that I wasn't heading back.

330
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,400
Waiter.

331
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,910
Leave the pot of liquor here.

332
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,110
Someone will come and finish it later.

333
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,560
Mister,

334
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,040
your liquor has gotten cold.

335
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,190
Let me swap it for something hotter.

336
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,950
She once said
that cold liquor refreshes the heart.

337
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,710
Just leave it there.

338
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,160
Jiang does know me the best.

339
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,420
[Liquor]

340
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,710
Young Master.

341
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,560
Miss Qing,
Young Master Zhuo has arrived.

342
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,830
My fellow elders,

343
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,640
what's so important
that I have to be here in person?

344
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,830
Haven't you seen enough of me
during the daytime?

345
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,040
Didn't you say that we should

346
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
talk about our matters at home?

347
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,160
Therefore,

348
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,430
we have questions for you.

349
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,350
You called off your accusations
against Pan Yue out of the blue.

350
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,190
What exactly are you up to?

351
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,800
Mr. Gu, what are you saying?

352
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,070
Who said I called off my accusations
out of the blue?

353
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,400
Haven't they explained the case
clearly enough for you?

354
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,040
Why don't we ask Mr. Cai about it?

355
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,040
Pan Yue caused a huge ruckus in
the Life and Death House a few days ago,

356
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,430
yet he managed to escape unscathed.

357
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,590
What do you plan to do?

358
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,880
As long as Pan Yue
stops causing trouble for me,

359
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,830
the Life and Death House
won't see him as an enemy.

360
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,040
Nonsense.

361
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,830
Does that mean the Life and Death House
will stop accepting life-and-death bets?

362

540
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,590
I was the one who investigated the case.

541
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,920
I read from the records

542
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,230
that there was a token
at the crime scene.

543
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,590
Where is that token right now?

Back then, I was just a junior constable
who was in charge of the case.

548
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,310
The lead constable was called Sun Fang.

549
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,680
He was dismissed from office
as he failed to protect the evidence.

550
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,000
That's why I remember it very clearly.

551

after he left the county yamen.

Heyang was built by the water.

723
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,430
Legend has it that there was
an evil wyvern in the water.

724
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,630
Due to its injury, it wasn't able
to transform into a dragon.

725
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,000
The wyvern had a snake's body
and a tiger's head.

726
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
It was several zhang long.

727

If it sees people playing
or rowing beside the water,

728

730
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,950
Therefore, Heyang holds
the Lantern Festival

731

and a ritual every summer solstice.

732
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,230
They pray that the evil wyvern
will transform into a dragon

00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,710
a murder happened
during the Lantern Festival.

738

The body was discovered
in the forest by the lake.

00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,950
that the victim died of suffocation
after choking on his blood.

741

The wound was located
at the Tiantu acupoint.

742

It was around two to three cun deep.

743

It looked like it was caused
by the sharp fangs of an animal.

745

didn't struggle at all.
