[Episode 17]

19
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,310
Young Lady.

20
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,190
This pot of black magnolia
is very valuable.

21
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,870
Young Master had brought it
all the way here from the capital.

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,950
This is the last pot left.

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,950
If you want to pick a flower,

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,720
you should pick some other flowers
in the garden, okay?

25
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,000
Ling,

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,390
Doesn't brother own a few shops in Heyang?

27
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes, the Shangguan family's business
is spread all over the world

28
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,630
and we deal in all sorts of trade.

29
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,270
Then go and ask the shopkeepers

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,030
if they have noticed

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,390
a ripple pattern,

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,190
whether it's on an artifact
or something else.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,630
Finders will be handsomely rewarded.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,830
Also, go to a bookstore

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,800
and buy all the historical records

36
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,270
related to Heyang.

37
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,880
Yes.

38
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,670
Young Lady.

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,800
Young Lady, a fisherman
visited us just now.

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,320
He said that someone named Bai Xiaosheng

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
told him to bring a message.

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,240
Bai Xiaosheng is detained at the dock.

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,600
She hopes the Young Lady can go
rescue her quickly.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,030
You asked for two hours

45
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,360
so that your relatives could
come to see you for the last time.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,160
Now that the time is up,

47
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,360
jump.

48
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,600
Wait, sir.

49
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,470
I really don't dare to do it again.

50
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,110
Can you give me another chance?

51
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,030
How dare you bribe the boatman

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,110
and smuggle cargo on our ships?

53
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,190
Since you had the courage to do so,

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,550
you should have expected this day.

55
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,880
Stop dilly-dallying, jump now!

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,080
I beg of you, sir.

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,030
Don't…

58
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,030
It seems like

59
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,110
- you need my help.
- Stop!

60
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,720
Save me, Caiwei!

61
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,960
How much cargo did she smuggle?

62
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,160
I will compensate you ten times.

63
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,390
Where do you think you're at?

64
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,910
The rules of Silver Rain Terrace

65
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,630
will not be swayed by your coins.

66
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,720
Silver Rain Terrace?

67
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,150
I told you

68
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,080
I am really friends
with your Young Master.

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,160
Our Young Master is a wise man.

70
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,600
How could he be friends
with women like you?

71
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,750
They are indeed my friends.

72
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,080
Young Master Zhuo!

73
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,920
Young Master.

74
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,070
- Xiaosheng.
- Caiwei.

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,510
I was so scared.

76
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,790
Mr. Zhu, I presume?

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,720
You did your job faithfully, well done.

78
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,950
However,

79
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,950
please do me a favor

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,070
and let this go.

81
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,000
Young Master,

82
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,040
smuggling goods is no small deal.

83
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,390
Moreover, Silver Rain Terrace

84
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,790
has always maintained the rules.

85
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:40,920
Young Master,

86
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,950
you shouldn't break the rules
because of an outsider.

87
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,200
You're right.

88
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,790
In the future,

89
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,320
she will be the Young Madam
of Silver Rain Terrace.

90
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,760
Her words are my words.

91
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,200
My words are the rules
of Silver Rain Terrace.

92
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,070
Are you questioning

93
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,440
my words?

94
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,230
Young Master, please forgive me.
I dare not do so.

95
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,830
Young Madam.

96
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,160
Fortunately, you came in time.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,480
By the way, how did you know we were here?

98
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,160
She also sent a message to me.

99
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,790
Well, Little Liar, you really know
how to get into trouble.

100
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,000
Almost every time I see you,
there's some kind of trouble.

101
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,920
It shows that Young Master Zhuo
is a naturally gifted problem solver.

102
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,390
Let's go have a drink together tonight.

103
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,160
Let's go.

104
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,320
Well, I haven't sorted
those goods of mine.

105
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,350
Both of you go ahead.

106
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,640
Caiwei, I will meet you
in the Sunrise Garden later.

107
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,390
Instead of watching the two of you
being lovey-dovey from the sidelines,

108
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,670
I might as well jump into the river.

109
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
I'll see you later, Caiwei.

110
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,720
Why is Xiaosheng acting weird lately?

111
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,000
Hasn't she always been like this?

112
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,390
She would rather have money than life.

113
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,640
Jiang, don't do this again.

114
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,110
What?

115
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,640
Didn't I move out from the county yamen?

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,830
We won't need these pretenses anymore.

117
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,440
You don't have to hang around me all day.

118
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,270
Stop calling me Young Madam
or something like that.

119
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,830
It's really awkward for me.

120
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,950
This is not a pretense.

121
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,440
I meant it

122
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
when I said it.

123
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,040
Before,

124
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,320
I thought I regarded you as a friend.

125
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,040
Two months ago,

126
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,320
when I returned to Heyang,

127
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,510
I was joyful on my way to see you,

128
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,440
but I heard the news of your death.

129
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,040
My mind went blank.

130
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,350
Not even swords have made me
that frightened.

131
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,160
Only then did I understand

132
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,480
you were no longer just a friend

133
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,830
in my heart.

134
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,790
After your return,

135
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,510
every word I said to you,

136
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,000
every act I did,

137
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,880
was all from the heart.

138
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,110
If you are willing,

139
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,110
I'll marry you anytime.

140
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,480
Jiang,

141
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,720
I've always considered you my best friend.

142
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,480
Previously,

143
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,350
now,

144
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,830
and even in the future.

145
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,550
This

146
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,760
will never change.

147
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,720
Determined.

148
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,070
Without hesitation.

149
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,200
I did imagine this,

150
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,880
but I didn't expect it

151
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,480
to feel

152
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,790
much worse

153
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,110
than I imagined.

154
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,880
Compared to disappointment,

155
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,640
a false dawn is even more hurtful.

156
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,920
I regard you as my best friend,

157
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,550
so I can never give you false hope.

158
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,950
Young Master.

159
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,760
Young Master.

160
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,520
Gu Yong is dead
and the Relief Hall has been purged.

161
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,350
Are you still doubting the Four Greats?

162
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,320
I'm thinking about the man
behind the scenes in the capital.

163
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,000
Why is he growing his power in Heyang?

164
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Was it simply to kill people?

165
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,110
I read the accounts booklet
of Relief Hall.

166
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,200
It's true that the only recorded business
was killing.

167
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,400
So I suspect

168
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,110
there must be some of them

169
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,280
still hiding in the Four Greats.

170
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,350
Relief Hall was destroyed,

171
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,910
and there was no movement at all
in the Life and Death House.

172
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,670
Only Silver Rain Terrace
and Hundred Flowers Court are left.

173
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,000
But one of them

174
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,670
is sincerely helping Miss Shangguan.

175
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,520
Another one

176
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,960
has also allied with Young Master early on

177
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,350
to solve
the county yamen's urgent problem.

178
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,520
Well…

179
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,910
I must have missed something.

180
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,000
What is it?

181
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,670
We eat a meal bite by bite,

182
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,110
so we should investigate a case
bit by bit.

183
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,230
Mulling over it is not going to help.

184
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,590
Why don't…

185
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,150
Just tell me what you want to do.

186

- Where?
- Chen Fu.

381
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,710
Over there.

382
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,920
- Mr. Chen!
- Sir!

[Mr. Chen, Xinzheng Academy]
Here he is.

384
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,280
Look.

385
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,350
- He's dead.
- What...

386
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,230
What...

387
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,640
What... Fu.

388

Fu.

389
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,590
Shen Ci.

390
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,230
Shen Ci.

391
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,590
Fu.

392
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,230
Arrest Shen Ci!

393
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,800
It was this ingrate.

394
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,040
Instead of thanking the academy
for cultivating him,

395
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,350
he dabbled in witchcraft and killed my son

396
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,800
and two other innocent lives.

397
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,680
Sir, please judge wisely.

398
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,160
Let Shen Ci pay with his life!

399
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,430
You,

400
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,880
what else do you have to say?

401
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,880
When Chen Fu and others
were possessed by evil spirits,

402
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,950
I was studying in the academy.

403
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,710
I did not go to the back mountain.

404
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,280
Since you know witchcraft,

405
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,680
you could've easily erased your tracks.

406
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,470
You keep saying that I know witchcraft.

407
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,230
Where is the proof?

408
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,400
I have achieved a scholarly honor.

409
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,920
If you kill me unjustly without basis,

410
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,800
won't it be hard to convince the public?

411
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,660
[Ghostly Fire Case Volume 1]

412
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,000
Shen Ci.

413
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,590
So,

414
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,590
you came back to Sunrise Garden

415
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,830
because you are pissed at Mr. Pan.

416
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,520
Correction.

417
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,230
I'm not being angry,
it's about drawing a boundary.

418
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,760
From now on,

419
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,920
we will go our separate ways.

420
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,430
Really?

421
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,310
Of course.

422
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,800
That's pretty good.

423
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,560
Plenty of fish in the sea.

424
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,710
Why would you fixate on the same guy?

425
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,830
Look at the people around you.

426
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,190
Young Master Zhuo is pretty good too.

427
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,590
Did he confess to you?

428
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,640
Did he tell you?

429
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,920
I guessed it.

430
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,110
So, he really did confess to you?

431
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,950
You haven't noticed it, have you?

432
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,400
His eyes are always on you.

433
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,880
That's not how you look at a friend.

434
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,950
Now I just want
to investigate the ripple pattern,

435
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,350
so that I can be Yang Caiwei again.

436
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,920
[Court]

437
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,110
There was no evidence to prove
that Shen Ci was the murderer.

438
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,350
But he was the only suspect in the case.

439
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,110
At that time, he was sentenced
to be detained and tried later.

440
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,710
Sir, I have been handling cases
for ten years,

441
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,760
I must have arrested
about a thousand suspects.

442
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,470
I've never seen someone this weird.

443
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,560
What's weird about him?

444
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,710
When he first came in,

445
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,110
he was held with other prisoners.

446
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,190
Within a few days,

447
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,040
the vicious bandits

448
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,680
all clamored to change cells.

449
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,590
In the end, there was no option
but to hold him in solitary confinement.

450
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,710
I have observed him secretly.

451
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,070
He keeps talking to himself all day long.

452
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,230
I don't know whether he
is chanting a mantra or a curse.

453
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,950
Sir, please be careful.

454
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,230
Don't be cursed by him.

455
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,920
Come to me quickly.

456
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,350
Come to me quickly.

457
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,590
Hurry up.

458
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,920
Come to me.

459
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,310
Sir, look at him.
He is reciting a curse again.

460
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,800
No.

461
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,400
He's talking to a mouse.

462
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,640
Forgive me for my lack of etiquette.

463
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,470
I don't know who you are.

465
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,640
Oh, Mr. Pan.

466
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,590
You only have two steamed buns per meal.

467
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,640
Why are you sharing with the mice?

468
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,430
I'm imprisoned in this dark place.

469
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,430
These insects and rats are a blessing
because they keep me company.

470
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,400
I can pass the long days

471
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,280
and talk with them to express my feelings.

472
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,040
To you, it's a mouse.

473
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,680
To me,

474
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,000
it's an old friend.

475
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,680
He is already on death row.

476
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,400
Why is he still wearing
such heavy shackles?

477
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,350
Unshackle him.

478
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,830
Sir, this is a felon who knows witchcraft.

479
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
What if he escapes?

480
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,160
If he really knew witchcraft,

481
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,070
not even ten chains would bind him.

482
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,190
Unshackle him.

483
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,040
Yes.

484
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Are you not afraid of me?

485
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,800
Do I have to be?

486
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,880
The pattern on the wall.

487
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,520
Sir, you are here for this.

488
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,190
Yes.

489
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,470
Can you tell me honestly?

490
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,310
If you are determined,

491
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,310
you will find out

492
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,040
once you've solved the case.

493
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,310
Why are there so many stray cats
meowing outside?

494
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,680
Quiet at last.

495
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,460
I really want to have some chestnut cakes.

496
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,070
Chestnut cakes.

497
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Freshly baked chestnut cakes.

498
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,880
Take a look.

499
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,070
Chestnut cakes.

500
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,310
Why did the cake vendor come
at such a coincidental time?

501
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,430
The cat meowing just now

502
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,160
was also stopped suddenly.

503
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,560
Could it be?

504
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,430

505
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,640
I'm tired of eating your cooking
every day.

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,350
Today, I want to eat

with Huadiao wine.

508
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,680
Here.

509
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,190
Hurry, take it in while it's hot.

510
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,880
Yes.

511
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,470
Young Lady's guess was right.
It's really you.

512
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,310

513
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,920
Where is your Young Master?

516
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,760
You don't have to be so nice to me.

517
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,350
Didn't I tell you?

518
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,190
I take you…

519
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,590
As a friend. I know.

520
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,160
But this is how I, Zhuo Lanjiang,

521
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,310
treat my friends.

522
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,920
I…

523
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,430
Yang Caiwei.

524
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,160
When did you become so bashful?

525
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,350
How am I bashful?

526
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,400
Yes.

527
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,800
Look at this freshly roasted lamb shank
with Huadiao wine.

528
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,350
Are you going to drink it?

529
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,920
Of course. Why not?

530
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,470
The victims of the Ghostly Fire case
are two dead and one injured.

531
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,350
Shen Ci is the only suspect.

532
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,880
The key to cracking the case

533
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,590
is on him.

534
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,520
But is he really someone

535
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,760
who would use witchcraft
to harm his classmates?

536
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,760
Am I right?

537
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,640
Really.

538
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,950
Come here.

539
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,640
What's wrong?

540
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,190
Unexpectedly, Miss Shangguan has left,

541
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,070
but these plants are still not spared.

542
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,430
For his sins.

546
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,830

549
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,110
I'll go.

550
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,040
I wanted to go for a walk anyway.

551
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,470
Take a look.

552
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,590
Here's the money.

553
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,710
Okay.

Take care.

to relieve your fatigue?

557
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,430
Sure.

558
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,710
Master Pan, your iced drink.

559
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,040
Thanks.

560
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,280
Mr. Pan,

561
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,040
why didn't you

562
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,280
come with Miss Shangguan today?

563
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,360
I miss her a lot.

564
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,280
I haven't seen her in a long time.

565
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,800
I see.

566
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,910
If you want to see Miss Shangguan,
you have to go to the Silver Rain Terrace.

567
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,280
I heard that she and Young Master Zhuo
are about to get married.

568
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,760
Two days ago, they even went to the docks
to inspect their properties.

569
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,870
Really?

570
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,630
Yes.

571
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,910
How could that be possible?

572
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,630
Many were present.

573
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,520
- Miss Shangguan clearly…
- Shuang.

574
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,910
I have something else to do now,
so I'll leave first.

575
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,320
But you haven't had your iced drink yet.

576
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,150
I have a toothache, it's too sour for me.

577
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,950
Here you go.

578
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,910
What is wrong with me?

579
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,710
As soon as I heard about Shangguan Zhi,

580
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,190
I even forgot about the painting.

581
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:17,520
Teardrop Monster, Teardrop Monster.

582
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,600
He's afraid of wind, rain, and thunder.

583
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,840
Waking up at midnight and met a ghost.

584
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,840
With his four heads and three legs.

585
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,280
Teardrop Monster, Teardrop Monster.

586
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,560
He's afraid of wind, rain, and thunder.

587
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,390
Teardrop Monster, Teardrop Monster.

588
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,040
He's afraid of wind, rain, and thunder.

589
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,950
Mr. Pan.

590
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,710
This is your painting.

591
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,670
Shuang.

592
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,320
Who taught you this song?

593
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,320
Miss Shangguan.

594
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,870
Teardrop Monster is terrified.

595
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,630
Her? How could it be her?

596
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,430
There are three big bowls of teardrops.

597
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:11,220
♪Shrouded by year after year of memories♪

598
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,430
They said the Silver Rain Terrace
found the body.

599
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,320
So I waited here.

600
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,670
I did not expect

601
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,040
you to come.

602
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,910
Did you come here secretly
in the middle of the night

603
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,360
to destroy the evidence?

604
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,430
Of course not!

605
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,190
Then I have to find the murderer myself

606
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,190
so that you will formally apologize to me.

607
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Comfort the soul of the dead

608
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,320
and prove your own innocence.

609
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,390
I can't be wrongly accused by you
for nothing.

610
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,950
Corpses can talk.

611
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,760
If I don't ask now,
I won't have another chance.

612
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,670
They must have been poisoned
by something they ate.

613
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,190
I have to find out
the source of the poison now.

614
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,190
Sir, look.

615
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,150
Sir, come and see.

616
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,910
This is the source of poison.

617
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,910
Judging from the color and shape.

618
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,910
Judging from the position,
direction, and depth.

619
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,710
Self-harm is the only possibility.

620
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,080
Be careful.

621
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,840
Miss Shangguan can calm your mood.

622
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,230
Take a deep breath.

623
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,120
It's alright.

624
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,470
It's okay.

625
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,670
Sob, sob.

626
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,560
There are three big bowls of teardrops.

627
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,320
He knocked over a clothes rack at dawn.

628
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,150
Teardrop Monster is terrified.

629
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,470
Look at me, Pan Yue.

630
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,470
Look at me, sober up.

631
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,280
Stop it, I'm not Shangguan Zhi.

632
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,430
What did she tell you?

633
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,800
She believes in you.

634
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,390
At that time,

635
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,390
she really wanted to marry you.

636
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,390
I didn't lie to you, did I?

637
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,120
Ling.

638
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,120
What are you doing?

639
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,870
Young Lady, if these oil umbrellas haven't
been exposed to rain in a long time,

640
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,280
you have to wipe them
with some wet rags from time to time

641
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,760
to prevent their color from fading.

642
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,840
Let me help you with it, then.

643
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,710
I'll go get more umbrellas.

644
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,560
