my ankles hurt a little
when I walk for a long time.

185
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,880
- Don't worry.
- Caiwei.

186
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,550
Xiaosheng?

187
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,640
Mr. Pan.

188
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,200
You're here in the capital.

189
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Have you found Jiang?

190
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,840
Let's go.

191
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,640
Isn't that Miss Shangguan?

192
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,080
Who's that guy next to her?

193
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,400
Pan Yue?

194
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,080
I didn't expect you and Jiang
to come to the capital.

195
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,230
Did he leave any clues

196
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,030
when he left without telling you?

197
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,470
Nothing.

198
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,200
He just left.

199
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,670
He must have come to the capital
to avenge his father's death.

200
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,910
He must have distanced himself

201
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,400
because he didn't want to implicate you.

202
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,840
Caiwei, I'm really worried
that he's in danger.

203
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,400
Don't worry,
we'll definitely locate him.

204
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,000
What about you?
What's your plan after this?

205
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,640
I'll stay here.

206
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,590
I wouldn't want him to return

207
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,790
without me around.

208
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,230
He'll come back anyway, right?

209
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,030
It's better to regret doing something

210
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,880
than to regret missing it.

211
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,470
That's what you said.

212
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,670
Stay for dinner, okay?

213
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,740
Sure.

214
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,320
I'll head out to buy some food and wine.

215
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,710
What's the matter?

216
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,590
Why does this smell
exactly like the incense

217
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,440
that the mastermind used
during the ritual?

218
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,440
Xiaosheng, it's a rare incense.

219
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,440
Where did you get it?

220
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,590
It's poplar incense from the Jiang clan.

221
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,840
I've found
that the nobles in the capital

222
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,030
aren't into jade bracelets.

223
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,280
Instead, they prefer incense.

224
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,110
That's why I got a Jiang woman

225
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,280
to get the stock.

226
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,280
What's it?

227
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,030
Well, forget about dinner.

228
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,440
Take me to that person first.

229
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:51,840
Caiwei.

230
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,760
This is the Jiang shopkeeper

231
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,960
who sold me the poplar incense.

232
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,640
I've talked to her.

233
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,440
If you have any questions, just ask her.

234
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,470
We'd like to ask you

235
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,320
if there was a man in his forties

236
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,220
with a yellowish right eye

237
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,250
who came to you to buy poplar incense.

238
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,910
I can't remember.

239
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,400
Is there any other incense shop
in the capital

240
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,350
that sells poplar incense
apart from yours?

241
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,110
No.

242
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,710
Poplar incense is a unique incense
of the Jiang clan.

243
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,670
As far as I know,

244
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,570
mine is the only one in the capital
that sells it.

245
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,000
Can you see if this pattern

246
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,640
has anything to do with the Jiang clan?

247
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,670
Ram horn and cloud pattern?

248
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,840
Ram horn and cloud pattern?

249
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,960
Yes.

250
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,910
This pattern is the totem
of the Daohan tribe of the Jiang clan.

251
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,710
The Jiang clan worships rams.

252
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,030
Due to years of war
between the court and the Jiang clan,

253
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,760
many Jiang people from the Daohan tribe

254
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,030
crossed the border and settled in Luoxi.

255
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,840
And they became the Jiang clan in Luoxi.

256
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,640
Later, they integrated into
the local community and started farming,

257
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,400
and they are no longer different
from the Han people.

258
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,590
But there are still a few
who like to carry totems around

259
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,030
to remind themselves
of their Jiang lineage.

260
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,790
So

261
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,710
it all ties together.

262
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,150
The court was at war
with the Jiang clan for years.

263
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,520
Many Jiang people
have immigrated to Luoxi.

264
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,320
The mastermind must be one of them.

265
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,520
They use the ram horn and cloud pattern
as their emblem

266
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,840
to build up their forces in Heyang.

267
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,470
They also collude with the Jiang clan

268
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,840
and use the docks in Heyang

269
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,000
to smuggle halite into the Central Plains
for huge profits.

270
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,400
They've been in business
for over a decade.

271
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,080
And they own a steady stream of wealth
to run what they do.

272
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,230
These people should be in high office.

273
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,230
Should we look into

274
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,960
the top Luoxi officials

275
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,080
in order to figure out his identity?

276
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,440
Jiang people who moved to Luoxi

277
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,840
were registered in the army.

278
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,400
They were brave and good fighters,
so the court used them in wars.

279
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,910
But the court feared
that spies might be among them.

280
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,030
So they came up with an unwritten rule.

281
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,640
No official of Luoxi origin
could be promoted.

282
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,230
It seems likely that the mastermind

283
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,440
has secretly changed his nationality.

284
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,350
It's most likely possible.

285
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,760
According to Miss Yunchang's
whistleblower letter,

286
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,590
this official was probably transferred
to the capital ten years ago.

287
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,550
And he is very powerful.

288
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,350
It can be deduced

289
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,350
that he was called up

290
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,340
between the 10th
and 20th year of Jingchang.

291
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,440
I'll ask Ze to check
with the Ministry of War.

292
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,640
After that, we will make our next move.

293
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,420
[Liu Yuan, Grand Commandant's wife]

294
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,760
Mrs. Jia.

295
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,470
Look at these flowers.

296
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,590
They were recently grown
by the gardeners.

297
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,030
Do you like them?

298
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,230
Graceful and elegant,

299
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,920
bright but not common.

300
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,590
It's perfect for Jing.

301
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,950
Order a batch for me,
to be delivered on the 15th of next month.

302
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,000
Yes.

303
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:24,110
Mrs. Jia, are you preparing it
for the princess' wedding?

304
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,070
Silk flowers are too ordinary.

305
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,520
I'd like to decorate the wedding hall
with fresh flowers.

306
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,590
Okay, I'll make the arrangements.

307
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,110
Shangguan Zhi,

308
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,560
if you're so shameless,

309
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,430
I'll publicize your scandal.

310
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,470
Mrs. Jia, what a coincidence.

311
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,280
You're here to buy flowers too?

312
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,430
Miss Sima.

313
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Jia.

314
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,920
I just want to ask

315
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,920
if the princess is doing well.

316
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,880
What could go wrong with the princess?

317
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,310
Didn't the princess tell you?

318
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,310
That day in Fengya Garden,

319
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,400
the princess quarreled
with a young lady named Shangguan Zhi

320
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,040
because of Mr. Pan.

321
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,640
She even took Shangguan Zhi away
in public.

322
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,920
I thought

323
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,000
the matter was settled.

324
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,350
I didn't expect to see

325
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,830
Mr. Pan and Shangguan Zhi on the street,

326
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,590
acting so intimate together.

327
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,160
That's why

328
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,110
I'm really worried about the princess.

329
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,590
I've heard that there's
the daughter of a rich merchant

330
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,350
who's been infatuated with Pan Yue
for years.

331
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,230
It's this Shangguan Zhi?

332
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,230
Yes, it's her.

333
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,040
She has chased Mr. Pan

334
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,640
from the capital to Heyang,

335
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,230
and from Heyang to the capital.

336
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,800
She has done everything she can.

337
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,520
Mrs. Jia, I'm really worried

338
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,400
that the marriage
between the princess and Mr. Pan

339
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,920
will be affected by her.

340
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,400
Miss Sima,

341
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,230
don't gossip about others
behind their backs.

342
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,880
Pan Yue is my future brother-in-law.

343
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,280
I trust Jing's judgment.

344
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,470
Their marriage

345
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,190
can't be influenced

346
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
by a mere merchant's daughter.

347
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,560
Don't ever

348
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
say anything like that again.

349
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,400
Yes.

350
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,800
Shan, let's head back.

351
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,470
Yes.

352
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,470
Master, he's arrived.

353
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,470
Greetings, Master.

354
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,680
Raise your head.

355
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,430
Your father was your age

356
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,680
when I first met him.

357
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,520
You look exactly

358
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,680
like him back then.

359
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,430
Stand up.

360
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,070
Back then,

361
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,520
we were both nobodies,

362
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,880
but we shared the same great ambitions.

363
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,680
We became sworn brothers

364
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,830
and promised to work together

365
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,110
and share the wealth and prosperity.

366
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,800
All these years,

367
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,640
I'd been in the court
while he'd been out there.

368
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,880
We helped and supported each other.

369
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,160
My power has made
the Silver Rain Terrace

370
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,160
the greatest power in Heyang.

371
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,350
His money supported me
to climb up to this high position.

372
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,000
And when we were almost there,

373
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,160
your father...

374
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,520
Life is unpredictable.

375
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,040
That's why I'm here.

376
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,400
I don't want my father

377
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,520
to die with regrets.

378
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,830
Do you know that wealth and power
come with great danger?

379
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,420
Your father didn't want you

380
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,880
to get involved in these things
as an attempt to keep you out of trouble.

381
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,880
He even

382
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,640
pretended to be dead for three years.

383
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,040
Why do you go against his last wish?

384
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,310
I'm not interested in fame or wealth.

385
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,640
Pan Yue forced my father to death.

386
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,560
I must avenge my father's death.

387
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,920
If you want to deal with Pan Yue,

388
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,110
I'm willing to be the sword
in your hand.

389
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,520
Is that so?

390
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,280
But how come I heard

391
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,280
that you and Pan Yue were quite close

392
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,160
in Heyang?

393
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,880
I did all this for a woman.

394
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,880
Pan Yue not only took advantage

395
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,470
of my relationship with that woman,

396
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,430
but he also stole her from me.

397
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,040
I'm sure you've found out

398
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,040
what happened.

399
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,070
If you don't believe me,
just kill me with one blow.

400
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,830
Why are you testing me
with this nonsense?

401
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,880
Mind your language.

402
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,040
Daring and bold,

403
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,160
youthful and ambitious.

404
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,640
Good.

405
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,640
You're a lot like your father.

406
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,710
Since you hate Pan Yue so much,

407
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,070
I'll give you a chance

408
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,600
to let you personally avenge
your father's death

409
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,950
and the stealing of your beloved woman.

410
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,280
Young Master.

411
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,760
Here's the letter on the door.

412
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,000
What's the matter?

413
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,020
Mrs. Jia invited me

414
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,190
[Invitation]
to a banquet.

415
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,230
Mrs. Jia?

416
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,520
The elder sister of Princess Changle.

417
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,680
The wife of Grand Commandant, Jia Quan.

418
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,160
That's strange.

419
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,070
If it's about the wedding,

420
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,070
my father should have been invited
as well.

421
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,350
But why did she invite me alone

422
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,280
and specify
that it would be a family banquet?

423
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,400
[Grand Commandant's Residence]

424
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,430
Greetings, Grand Commandant.

425
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,230
Greetings, Mrs. Jia.

426
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,640
It's a small token of goodwill.
Please accept it.

427
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,640
Ze.

428
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,810
Mr. Pan,

429
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,640
[Jia Quan, Grand Commandant]
we'll be family soon.

430
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,070
Just spare the formality.

431
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,640
I've heard that you're a talented man

432
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
with a remarkable appearance.

433
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,710
Now that I see you,

434
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,350
I'm sure your reputation
is well-deserved.

435
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,710
No wonder Jing is so fond of you.

436
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,110
You flatter me, Mrs. Jia.

437
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,680
It's my honor to be favored
by the princess.

438
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,830
Master, Madam, the feast is ready.

439
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,560
Mr. Pan, please.

440
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,470
Darling, please.

441
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,000
Why did your sister invite me over?

442
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,830
It happened suddenly.

443
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,280
I only found out this morning.

444
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,070
Just play it by ear.

445
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,590
Please.

446
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,950
There are no outsiders here today.

447
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,310
It's just an ordinary family meal.

448
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,430
Mr. Pan,
just help yourself with the food

449
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,490
and spare the courtesy.

450
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,680
Yes.

451
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,160
It's a family meal,

452
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,830
but you're a guest.

453
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,640
Mr. Pan, here's to you.

454
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,760
Yes, you're right, darling.

455
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,110
Come on. Mr. Pan, here's to you.

456
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,070
Thank you, Grand Commandant.
Thank you, Mrs. Jia.

457
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,590
Jing was young
when our parents passed away.

458
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,520
I brought her up by myself.

459
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,470
An elder sister is like a mother.

460
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,520
Jing has always set her sights high.

461
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,800
She's been courted
by many princes and young masters,

462
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,560
but she just wants to marry you.

463
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,190
You must treat her well

464
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,520
and don't let her down, Mr. Pan.

465
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,880
Don't worry, Mrs. Jia.

466
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,560
There's something
I'd like to ask you, Mr. Pan.

467
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,760
Can you answer honestly?

468
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,520
Please go ahead, Mrs. Jia.

469
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,920
I've heard rumors

470
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,160
that you're involved
with a Miss Shangguan.

471
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,760
Is that true?

472
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,040
Yuan,

473
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,590
don't buy into those rumors out there.

474
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,920
They're all made up
by some backstabbers.

475
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,640
If it's just rumors,

476
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,470
then why did you fight with her
in the Fengya Garden?

477
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,290
Miss Shangguan
and I have known each other

478
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,690
since we were little.

479
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,040
I'm also close friends with her brother.

480
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,800
That's why our families have been
seeing each other more often.

481
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,710
I've explained all this to the princess.

482
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,590
With your experience and wisdom,

483
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,430
I'm sure
you can tell the facts, Mrs. Jia.

484
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,310
Be it a sister or a friend,

485
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,710
if you are determined to marry Jing,

486
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,110
you can only have her
in your heart and eyes

487
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,350
from now on.

488
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,110
A gentleman should be prepared
for the unexpected

489
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,280
and not be under suspicion.

490
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,920
I'm sure you understand that.

491
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,350
I don't want Jing's life

492
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,000
to be the talk of the town.

493
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,040
You should sever your ties with her
as soon as possible.

494
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,950
It's better for you and Jing.

495
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,830
As well as Miss Shangguan's reputation.

496
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,040
Mr. Pan, what do you think?

497
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,110
Don't worry, Mrs. Jia.

498
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,950
I know what to do.

499
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,640
Darling, can I start eating now?

500
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,830
This Osmanthus Steamed Sea Bass

501
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,400
will turn fishy if it gets cold.

502
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,560
Come on, look.

503
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:07,230
Here, here's
your favorite sea bass face.

504
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:07,760
Try it.

505
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:22,800
Your Highness.

506
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,920
Mr. Pan.

507
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,230
I've seen your portraits before.

508
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,040
At the time, I thought

509
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,340
this man had a great ambition.

510
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,110
I never thought you'd become

511
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,000
Jing's husband.

512
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,290
It's really fate
that brings us together.

513
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,310
Grand Commandant, you flatter me.

514
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,430
You and your wife are a perfect match.

515
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,070
That's true. When I met her,

516
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,590
I was just a humble soldier.

517
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,800
Who would have thought

518
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,590
I could marry her?

519
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,470
All right.
Why are you talking about this?

520
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,520
That's embarrassing.

521
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,470
Here, dig in.

522
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,000
Come on, dig in.

523
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,470
Here, Mr. Pan.

524
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,760
Mr. Pan, this way, please.

525
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,470
The princess will get married soon.

526
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,280
Just let the sisters

527
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,950
have a few words.

528
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,920
I'll show you around the garden.

529
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,920
Let's relax.

530
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
I'd like to thank you
for helping me out just now.

531
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,800
I hope you won't get offended.

532
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,920
That's the way my wife is.

533
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,430
She's actually quite easy
to get along with.

534
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,040
But when it comes to the princess,

535
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,470
she's overly nervous.

536
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,520
I was afraid
you'd argue with her to the end.

537
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,110
She's just worried about the princess.

538
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,280
Of course I don't mind.

539
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,520
That's good.

540
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,040
But if you're an imperial family member,

541
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,040
you'll be subject to
the rules of imperial families.

542
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,350
Things like
that are going to happen again.

543
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,920
Can you give me some words of advice?

544
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,710
We can't

545
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,640
think of ourselves as husbands.

546
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,650
We have to be gardeners.

547
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,640
Gardeners?

548
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,640
Yes.

549
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,520
Take care of your wife the way

550
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
you take care of these delicate flowers.

551
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,400
Get to know their temperaments
and preferences.

552
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,560
Don't ask what's right or wrong,

553
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,110
just do what she wants.

554
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,040
That's how

555
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,880
you can be called
a qualified prince consort.

556
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,760
How wise of you.

557
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,830
I'm truly enlightened.

558
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,110
Besides,

559
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,230
bear this in mind.

560
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,590
There are so many eyes on us.

561
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,640
These people look down on us,
openly and secretly.

562
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,590
No matter how capable we are,

563
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,590
they still say

564
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,560
we're benefiting from our wives.

565
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,520
I didn't think you'd still feel this way

566
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,640
after all these years
of meritorious service.

567
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,950
I may be the Grand Commandant,

568
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,230
but I do nothing

569
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,190
more than paperwork for the army.

570
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,430
Since we've married the princesses

571
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,430
and got the glory
that doesn't belong to us,

572
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,190
we have no choice
but to accept the criticisms

573
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,470
uttered behind our backs.

574
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,040
But even with all the grievances,

575
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,230
you're still so gentle
and considerate to your wife.

576
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,680
I can't thank

577
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,950
and love her enough for marrying me.

578
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,800
As for any grievances
I may have suffered outside,

579
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,880
I'll put up with them.

580
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,350
There's no need to bring them home.

581
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,040
Grand Commandant, watch out!

582
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,800
Mr. Pan!

583
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Guards!

584
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,000
Mr. Pan! Mr. Pan!

585
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,470
Sir!

586
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,400
Hurry! Summon the imperial physician!

587
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:11,950
Yes!

588
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,310
Mr. Pan!

589
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,880
What's wrong, Young Lady?

590
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,230
I'm fine.

591
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,110
I don't know what's wrong with me today,

592
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,880
but I've been feeling restless.

593
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,430
Ling, there's still no letter for me
at the door?

594
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,000
I've just asked them. No.

595
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,760
It's already the hour of Xu.

596
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,400
Pan Yue should be back from the meal

597
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,980
at the Grand Commandant's Residence.

598
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,760
Young Lady, bad news!

599
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,800
News has just come
from the Grand Commandant's Residence

600
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,710
that Mr. Pan was ambushed.

601
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,520
What?

602
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,230
You always say
that our residence is safe from attack,

603
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,920
but today the assassin
had been in our residence to kill.

604
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,190
What's going on?

605
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,590
Sorry, Darling.

606
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,760
I didn't expect an assassin

607
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,350
to be on the roof for the ambush.

608
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,310
Besides, it's been only a few days
since Mr. Pan returned to the capital.

609
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,440
I haven't heard
of any political rivals of his

610
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,350
in the court.

611
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,680
Well, why would an assassin target him?

612
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,230
Imperial Physician.

613
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,400
Imperial Physician, how's his injury?

614
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,950
His bleeding has stopped.

615
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,560
Fortunately, he's not hurt badly.

616
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,800
Luckily, God has blessed him.

617
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,310
But he still needs a few days
of rest and recuperation,

618
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,000
in case his wound gets worse.

619
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,800
Okay.

620
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,060
Thank you, Imperial Physician.

621
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,620
[Grand Commandant's Residence]

622
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,740
[Grand Commandant's Residence]

623
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,160
Ze.

624
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,070
Miss Yang.

625
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,190
How's Pan Yue doing?

626
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,310
Miss Yang, don't worry.
Mr. Pan is all right now.

627
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,040
It's only because he was attacked
at the Grand Commandant's Residence

628
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,560
that Mrs. Jia felt sorry for him,

629
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,800
so she'd like to keep him here

630
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,280
for a few days.

631
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,070
I'm on my way to Shuyu Abode

632
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,630
to get some of his clothes.

633
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,100
I'd like to go in and see him.

634
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,330
Can you help me?

635
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,840
Miss Yang, well...

636
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,120
After the assassination
of Young Master Pan,

637
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,080
the Grand Commandant's Residence

638
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,840
has increased its security,
especially Mr. Pan's room.

639
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,870
so it will be guarded at all times.

640
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,710
I think there's someone who can help me.

641
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,520
Your Highness.

642
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,150
I'm going in to see Mr. Pan.

643
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,630
Yes.

644
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,390
Leave me alone.
I'll call you if there's anything else.

645
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,840
Yes, Your Highness.

646
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:17,870
Pan Yue.

647
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,120
Why are you here?

648
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,800
Be careful. I'll help you up.

649
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,040
You're so bold.

650
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,120
If Mrs. Jia sees you,

651
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,360
she'll give you a hard time.

652
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,080
I've assured Miss Yang

653
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,120
that you're fine,

654
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,040
but she insisted on seeing you
before she can rest assured.

655
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,320
Besides, at this moment,

656
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,910
I don't think there's any cure

657
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,080
that works better
than seeing Miss Yang yourself.

658
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,630
Since I'm already here,

659
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,230
do you still want to drive me away?

660
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,430
How do you feel now?

661
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,120
Does it hurt?

662
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,470
It hurt a lot just now.

663
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,560
But it stops hurting now.

664
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,430
Thank you, Your Highness.

665
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,360
I'm cured now.

666
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,040
It's not a good time for jokes.

667
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:03,910
Oh, right.

668
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,670
Who tried to assassinate you today?

669
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,710
It was Zhuo Lanjiang.

670
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,280
Jiang?

671
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,800
Listen to me.

672
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,600
When the sword came,

673
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,280
There was no way I could dodge it.

674
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,760
If he had really wanted to kill me,

675
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,430
with Jiang's skills,

676
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,320
there's no way I could survive it.

677
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,470
So I don't think

678
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,390
he really wanted to kill me.

679
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,840
You mean

680
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,560
Jiang was forced to do it?

681
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,000
Yes.

682
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,470
There's a good chance

683
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,670
that he left without saying goodbye

684
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,150
in order to infiltrate
the mastermind behind the operation.

685
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,710
This assassination

686
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,710
is a retaliation
for the trouble we caused

687
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,430
at Shiluo Garden,

688
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,390
and a test of his loyalty.

689
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,950
Jiang wants
to avenge his father's death,

690
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,600
so he takes such risks.

691
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,150
Oh, right.

692
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,460
A few days ago,
Mr. Zhang was assassinated

693
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,470
on the outskirts of the city.

694
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,630
The assassin
was a young man with a sword.

695
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,040
I think that might be Zhuo Lanjiang.

696
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,430
He must be in a

697
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,430
very precarious situation.

698
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,390
I failed to take Pan Yue's life

699
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,040
due to my incompetence.

700
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,080
Please forgive me, Master.

701
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,600
I remember when you killed Mr. Zhang,

702
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,910
he was guarded by many men.

703
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,000
However, you killed him effortlessly.

704
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,520
Why did you fail this time?

705
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,710
I sparred with Pan Yue in Heyang before.

706
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,150
He knew my sword moves,

707
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,760
so he could dodge my attack.

708
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,760
Master, please give me one more chance.

709
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,950
Whatever.

710
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,190
You tried your best.

711
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,560
This time, he's just lucky
to have survived it.

712
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,280
We'll find another chance after this.

713
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,320
Thank you for the impunity, Master.

714
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,520
Take him to his room.

715
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,430
From now on,

716
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,630
he's one of us.

717
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,910
Yes.

718
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,670
So Mr. Chen has been
hiding here all along.

719
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,760
This is your room.

720
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,360
Don't go out without an order.

721
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,600
Noted.

722
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,670
He doesn't fully trust me yet.

723
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,430
I have to wait for the right moment
to strike.

724
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,940
[Grand Commandant's Residence]

725
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,870
Mr. Pan, stay here and recuperate.

726
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,670
You got injured in my residence.

727
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,560
It was caused by our negligence.

728
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,470
You're leaving
when you're just a little bit better.

729
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,470
Are you blaming us?

730
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,190
Grand Commandant, don't say that.

731
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,430
It's thanks
to the timely treatment of my injury

732
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,520
at your residence

733
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,520
that I've recovered so well.

734
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,430
But there are still a lot of things

735
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,040
to be arranged for the wedding.

736
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,630
I'm afraid it's not appropriate

737
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,080
for me to keep staying here.

738
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,000
But...

739
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,080
Quan, Yuan, just listen to him.

740
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,630
I'll take good care of him.

741
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,710
You've not even got married yet.

742
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,120
But you're already defending him.

743
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,430
Yuan.

744
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,190
All right.

745
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,320
I'll see him out now.

746
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,150
I've asked someone
to go to the Ministry of Personnel,

747
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,520
to investigate the household registrations
of all the officials.

748
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,040
If there's any news,

749
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,630
I'll inform you right away.

750
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,080
