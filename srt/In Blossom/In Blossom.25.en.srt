00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,590
for Jing to protect you
in front of His Majesty.

377
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,470
She was right about you.

378
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,040
Empress, that's too much praise.

379
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,070
It's what I'm supposed to do.

380
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,470
Stand and speak.

381
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

382
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,000
For the past two days,

383
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,070
there were quite a few requests
to reward you.

384
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,430
Officials from the Ministry of Rites
also delivered such requests.

385
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Why not marry Jing

386
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,560
since you happen to be in the capital?

387
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,350
I summoned you and your father
into the palace today

388
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,260
just to discuss this.

389
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,440
Marriage should be done sooner
rather than later.

390
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,470
I asked them to check the calendar.

391
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,010
The 15th day of next month is good.

392
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,680
Your Majesty.

393
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,040
Her Highness' marriage is a major event
and cannot be hasty.

394
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,400
Should we give it more thought
and discuss it later?

395
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,920
There has been a drought in Shandong

396
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,040
and a flood in the south this year.

397
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,640
The people are suffering.

398
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,950
Your marriage is to bless the people.

399
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,000
It might not be well-prepared

400
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,400
if it is so rushed.

401
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,400
Her Highness might not be satisfied.

402
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,920
The princess
is the descendant of a general.

403
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,950
Her parents died on the battlefield
for the country

404
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,400
and left behind two orphaned daughters.

405
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,560
Due to their loyalty,

406
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,830
I took her and her sister in
as my foster daughters.

407
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,350
She grew up as a military kid.

408
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,040
I don't think she cares about
such customs.

409
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,880
Right, Jing?

410
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,520
Yes.

411
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,830
I'll decide this for both of you.

412
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,790
I will send the officials
of the Ministry of Rites

413
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,880
to make sure the wedding
goes as planned.

414
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,070
There's no need to worry about it.

415
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,640
Thank Her Majesty at once.

416
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

417
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,920
Why would the Ministry
of Rites' officials

418
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,560
bring up my wedding with the princess
suddenly?

419
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,350
Is it arranged by the one
behind the scenes?

420
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,950
You

421
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,920
closed the case of Zhuo Shanju
with great fanfare,

422
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,880
and you returned
to the capital in haste.

423
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,830
Are you trying to investigate

424
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,230
the one from the imperial court?

425
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
You've avenged the Yang family.

426
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,680
Since you will be
marrying the princess soon,

427
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,110
you will surely
have a bright future ahead.

428
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,190
Why don't you just stop right now?

429
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,640
Father, you know

430
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,590
this is not where my ambition lies.

431
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,160
I advise you...

432
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,070
Mr. Pan.

433
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,800
Sirs.

434
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,920
I am Sun Ximing
from the Ministry of Rites.

435
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,350
I'm here to prepare
for your wedding with the princess

436
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,800
according to Her Majesty's orders.

437
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,790
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

438
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,280
It is my honor.

439
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,830
After accepting this task,

440
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,310
I worked on it the whole night
and came up with this plan.

441
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,430
Please take a look.

442
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,380
[Arrangements]

443
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,640
This is

444
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,000
your schedule

445
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,430
for the next month, Prince Consort.

446
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,760
It's quite a full schedule.

447
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,280
I don't think I can get any sleep

448
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,760
in the next month.

449
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,760
People are energetic
when there are happy events.

450
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,230
There might be many things
you need to do,

451
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,040
but I'm sure we won't exhaust you.

452
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,040
Why don't I

453
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,830
get you familiarized with the schedule
at the Ministry of Rites?

454
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,470
- Tomorrow, we need to measure...
- No need to tell me in detail.

455
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,590
As long as you know it.

456
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,760
Sir.

457
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,400
Young Lady, the weather is hot.

458
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,590
I brought you the ice container.

459
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
That was Baocai.

460
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,040
Bao... Baocai.

461
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,560
Why are you so afraid of it?

462
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,520
I'm not really very afraid of it.

463
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,830
Young Lady,
were you frightened by the stray dogs

464
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,470
when you were investigating the case,

465
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,520
so you have a trauma?

466
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,640
That's right.

467
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,710
Ling.

468
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,280
I have something to ask you.

469
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,920
Yes?

470
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,760
Have you been helping me?

471
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,880
Do you know something?

472
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,920
When did you find out?

473
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,920
Back in Heyang,

474
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,920
since you regained consciousness

475
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,640
after the incident,

476
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,040
I realized

477
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,110
you were different.

478
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,750
You don't need people to serve you,

479
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,160
don't scold your servants,

480
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,970
aren't picky about food,

481
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,880
and don't care about your appearance.

482
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,680
Your habits, taste, and personality

483
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,160
have all been different.

484
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,470
In the beginning,

485
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,560
I only found it weird

486
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,520
until...

487
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,190
Young Lady was afraid of items
related to dead people.

488
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,560
She would never use and clean

489
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,310
coroner's tools so skillfully.

490
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,640
Ze also said

491
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,160
that you held the dead body

492
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,040
to protect the evidence.

493
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,590
That was when I knew

494
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,590
you were

495
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,190
no longer the same person.

496
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,920
Since you knew,

497
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,830
why didn't you expose me?

498
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,110
Don't worry, Young Lady.

499
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,400
I've never thought about

500
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,190
telling anyone about this.

501
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,110
Actually,

502
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,000
I lived my life cautiously in the past.

503
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,880
As long as I did something wrong,

504
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,430
I would be beaten up or scolded.

505
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,040
Although I don't know what happened,

506
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
I know

507
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,070
you are a good person.

508
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,190
You treat me

509
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,950
and other people well.

510
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,310
I might just be a servant,

511
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,230
but I can tell good from bad.

512
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,430
So don't worry, Young Lady.

513
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,920
I will never

514
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,190
tell this to anyone else.

515
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,710
I should thank you for believing in me.

516
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,000
During the last few months,

517
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,680
you've been taking care of me

518
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,160
as if you were my younger sister.

519
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,220
I'm the one who should thank you.

520
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,640
Well, from now on,

521
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,880
I'll no longer be your Young Lady.

522
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,710
Think of me as your elder sister.

523
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,680
How can I do that, Young Lady?

524
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,160
I am just a servant.

525
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,830
How can I see you as my sibling?

526
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,760
We both have a nose and two eyes.

527
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,800
So, why not?

528
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,430
However, I have a condition.

529
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,000
Don't give me this face anymore.

530
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,560
Smile.

531
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,190
Wait...

532
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,190
Didn't I just eat?
Why are you serving me again?

533
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,760
Young Master said

534
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,710
you are exhausted

535
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,430
and need to replenish your nutrition.

536
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,310
Young Master

537
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,040
ordered the kitchen

538
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,640
to prepare all the food,
especially for you.

539
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,110
Since it's from Lan...

540
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,070
Yes.

541
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,070
Young Lady, please enjoy your meal.

542
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,640
Since Pan Yue entered the palace,

543
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,270
there hasn't been news of him.

544
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,590
Did something happen?

545
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,760
Pan Yue, if you don't come,

546
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,470
I'll be stuffed to death.

547
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,760
Young Lady,

548
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,920
Mr. Pan sent a message.

549
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,230
He wants you to meet him
at Fengya Garden.

550
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,190
Prepare the carriage.

551
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,000
Young Lady.

552
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,430
You can't go there like this.

553
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,190
Why?

554
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,430
Fengya Garden is a place to enjoy tea
and do flower arrangements in the capital.

555
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,710
Those who go there are noble ladies.

556
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,310
These ladies don't do anything serious.

557
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,590
They only know
how to compete with each other.

558
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,470
There was once

559
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,590
when Young Lady did an outdated hairdo

560
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,430
and they laughed at her for a long time.

561
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,560
If you go there in this state

562
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,880
and bump into someone you know,

563
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,710
you will be in trouble again.

564
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,180
[Virtue, Diligence, Generosity, Peace]

565
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,710
Mr. Pan is supposed to meet you
this afternoon.

566
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,350
You came early, Young Lady.

567
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,430
It's all right. I can wait for him.

568
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,310
Seriously,

569
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,680
I didn't feel it

570
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,430
when we always met each other
at the county yamen,

571
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,040
but I do miss him

572
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,520
after not meeting him in so long.

573
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,070
This is probably what

574
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,880
"not meeting a day feels like
three years have passed" means in Huabens.

575
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,830
Restrain yourself.

576
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,950
Isn't this Zhi?

577
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,520
This is Sima Xuan, the daughter
of the Minister of Personnel.

578
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,400
Usually,

579
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,000
she likes to compete with you.

580
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,520
She has always been hostile towards you.

581
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,230
After you left for some time,

582
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,430
you look so much better.

583
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,590
Look at your skin and body.

584
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,040
Even the Jade Rabbit

585
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,190
might mistake you for Chang'e.

586
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,000
You too.

587
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,400
Let's go, Zhi.

588
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,070
Join me in drinking tea
and watching flowers.

589
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,470
Let's catch up with each other.

590
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
I'm waiting for someone.
Let's do it some other time.

591
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,280
Just ask your servant to do it for you.

592
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,520
Let's go.

593
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,280
This tea is nice.

594
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,350
Zhi.

595
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,190
I was worried about you yesterday.

596
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,400
I know you are sad.

597
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,310
We are all your friends.

598
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,830
There's no need to pretend to be strong.

599
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,560
We all know

600
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
that the Empress

601
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,800
summoned Pan Jin and his son

602
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,000
to give the wedding invitation.

603
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,560
On the 15th day of the next month,

604
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,590
Pan Yue will marry the princess

605
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,230
according to Her Majesty's decree.

606
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,640
What did you say?

607
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,160
Zhi,

608
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,070
did you really not know?

609
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,110
You went after Pan Yue

610
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,160
to a barren place like Heyang,

611
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,280
but he still abandoned you.

612
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,280
I feel sorry for you.

613
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,230
Is she telling the truth?

614
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,940
There hasn't been any news

615
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,040
since Pan Yue
entered the palace yesterday.

616
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,670
Is it because of this?

617
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,280
Your family is so rich.
If Pan Yue marries someone else,

618
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,640
you can just add some dowry

619
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,470
to become his concubine.

620
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,070
That might work

621
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,470
thanks to your family's assets.

622
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,710
However, he's going
to marry the princess.

623
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,280
The princess
will never agree to share her husband

624
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,000
with a merchant's daughter.

625
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,000
A person needs to know

626
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,520
what's best for them.

627
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,110
What a shame that she wasted
so many years of her youth

628
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,230
but can't even become a concubine.

629
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,830
If it were me,

630
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,640
I would've hidden in my residence

631
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,310
to avoid meeting anyone.

632
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,400
We are both single.

633
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,430
I like Pan Yue

634
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,430
and that's my own business.

635
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,070
Of course.

636
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,760
If he marries someone else,

637
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,880
that’s fine.

638
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,760
What is this talk
about wasting one's youth?

639
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,680
I'm free anyway.

640
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,760
At least I'm pursuing the person I love

641
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,400
instead of following my parents' wishes.

642
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,680
Well said, Zhi.

643
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,230
Zhi,

644
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,430
we mustn't lose the momentum.

645
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,920
This is Xiangyuan House's
latest White Jade Powder.

646
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,590
After you use it,
your face will shine like a white jade.

647
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,280
You must try it.

648
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,230
I'm sure Pan Yue will regret it

649
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,560
when he sees you.

650
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,040
Try it.

651
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,190
This doesn't smell like rouge.

652
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,150
This is pollen.

653
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,190
I knew you meant harm.

654
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,760
How can I use such a nice item?

655
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,040
You should use it as well.

656
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,630
Zhi,

657
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,230
I prepared this especially for you.

658
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,150
You mustn't reject it.

659
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,360
You must accept it.

660
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,950
I have a lot of this in my residence.
You use it.

661
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,280
Zhi, just take it.

662
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,230
Use it.

663
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,320
I also have a lot.

664
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,230
You must use it.

665
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,120
Zhi.

666
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,230
This...

667
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,390
You...

668
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,360
Don't come after me!

669
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,320
Don't come after me!

670
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,150
Trying to harm me
with such a petty trick?

671
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,800
You are messing with the wrong person.

672
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,150
Why Fengya Garden is in such chaos?

673
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

674
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,950
Be careful...

675
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,150
Greetings, Your Highness.

676
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,600
All of you have ruined

677
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,620
such a pure and elegant place.

678
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,870
How preposterous.

679
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,190
Is she the princess?

680
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,840
Are you Shangguan Zhi?

681
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,560
Your face

682
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,190
is different from what I imagined.

683
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,990
What a coincidence.

684
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,080
I have something to ask you about Pan.

685
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,910
Come with me.

686
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Shangguan Zhi,

687
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,430
I'll see how long
you can keep acting so arrogantly.

688
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,120
Her Highness,
I wonder what you want to know

689
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,280
by bringing me here.

690
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,630
I'm still waiting for someone,

691
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,910
so...

692
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,910
Are you waiting for Pan?

693
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,760
Pan and I are discussing
something important,

694
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,840
so he won't hide anything from me,

695
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
including

696
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:21,870
your identity.

697
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,870
Her Highness, what do you mean?

698
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,150
It's a blessing

699
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,670
that Miss Yang escaped death.

700
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,520
You must seize this opportunity

701
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,710
and not repeat your mistake.

702
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,120
Do you know why I want to help Pan?

703
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,630
Naturally, you care
about the country's safety

704
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,710
and don't want the traitorous officials
to cause a mess in the court.

705
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,000
Have you not thought of the possibility

706
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,430
that I'm not just helping Pan

707
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,080
for the sake of the country,

708
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,950
but truly want him

709
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,870
to be my prince consort?

710
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,150
I'll tell you honestly.

711
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,430
Pan asked me to come here today.

712
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,520
I know

713
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,760
you had an engagement with Pan.

714
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,910
However, you gain something,
and you will lose something.

715
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,520
Since you've escaped death

716
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,000
and changed your appearance
to become Shangguan Zhi,

717
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,150
your engagement with him is null.

718
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,390
If you are a reasonable person
who is able to see the bigger picture,

719
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,390
you should let him return to his place

720
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,430
and not hinder his future.

721
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,840
Am I right?

722
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,390
Your Highness' words might be right,

723
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,080
but I won't be separated from Pan Yue.

724
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,560
When men fall in love, they can
get away from it whenever they want.

725
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,280
When women fall in love,
they are infatuated.

726
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,190
Miss Yang, you are too confident.

727
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,230
It's not about confidence.
It's about trust.

728
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,080
When I was rejected by the Pan family,

729
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,190
I didn't trust him.

730
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,080
Later, he came to Heyang to find me,
but I didn't trust him either.

731
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,560
We experienced many setbacks
and misunderstandings

732
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,560
before we could be together.

733
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,120
Right now, I won't

734
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,390
give him away to someone else

735
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,950
because of a few words from others.

736
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,760
If I do that,

737
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,040
I don't deserve his affection.

738
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,040
Unless he tells me

739
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,390
that he wants to break up with me.

740
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,190
Otherwise, I'll never let him go.

741
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,080
Now that it has come to this,

742
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,560
I don't think
this is within your control anymore.
