1
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:12,737
It fits you perfectly.

2
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:16,037
It's yours.

3
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:19,937
Seo Yun Jae had gotten it
before the accident.

4
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:22,904
Yun Jae had gotten this?

5
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:32,171
You can fall back in love with him.

6
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:35,603
So long as you have that on,
I won't waver, either.

7
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,904
I, Kang Gyeong Jun,

8
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:43,904
vow to never

9
00:00:49,304 --> 00:00:51,904
fall in love with you.

10
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,570
Your parents want them
to get married right away?

11
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,770
Yeah.

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,737
My dad told her not to see him unless
they're planning to get married.

13
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:09,338
But they can't get married until he returns.

14
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:10,704
Now isn't the time.

15
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:13,338
Mary,

16
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:15,304
Dr. Seo is back.

17
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:17,071
You told me to support them.

18
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,371
[Episode 8]
Don't over think it.

19
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,204
We're simply taking things back
to the way they should have been.

20
00:01:23,204 --> 00:01:26,204
You wanted to marry Seo Yun Jae, right?

21
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:31,037
I gave up because I thought
he didn't love me.

22
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,304
Are you sure this was meant for me?

23
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,937
If you want to know how
he really feels about you,

24
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:39,670
let's just get married.

25
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,137
Would it be okay

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,404
for you to marry me though?

27
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:49,870
It's better than being nagged
by Yun Jae's mother.

28
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,503
Adults get married to become fully
independent of their parents, right?

29
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:55,737
Plus, it's not a real marriage anyway.

30
00:01:57,404 --> 00:01:59,904
This time, the bait is Seo Yun Jae.

31
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,904
If you don't want to lose him again,
take the bait.

32
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:27,404
Gyeong Jun!

33
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,637
No way!

34
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:33,570
What?

35
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,970
I heard Ms. Gil's parents
told you to marry Ms. Gil.

36
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,637
You're not marrying her, are you?

37
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,004
No, right?

38
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,503
I don't care one way or another,
so mind your own business.

39
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:44,804
You can't get married.

40
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:48,970
I'm going to tell them
to stop pressuring you.

41
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,503
They won't listen to you.

42
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:57,037
Then I'm telling them you're
actually Kang Gyeong Jun.

43
00:02:57,737 --> 00:02:59,937
Jang Mary.

44
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:01,404
Jang Mary.

45
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:06,570
Why is she here?

46
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:12,338
Why doesn't Mary want Da Ran
and Yun Jae to get married?

47
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:15,670
- Jang Mary.
- Get out of the way.

48
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,603
- Yun Jae.
- I have to run.

49
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:19,837
Da Ran.

50
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:21,904
Why are you here? Let's talk later.

51
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:23,737
What the...

52
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,037
What's going on?

53
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,470
They must really be in love to have
gotten together behind our backs.

54
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,237
They shouldn't have gone behind our backs.

55
00:03:33,237 --> 00:03:34,970
I told Da Ran I won't see either of them
if they're not getting married,

56
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,570
so if they want to keep seeing each other,

57
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,470
they should make their engagement official.

58
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:42,870
Mr. Jang. Mrs. Jang.

59
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:44,737
- Mary.
- Mary.

60
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:46,804
There's something you need to know.

61
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:48,371
Huh?

62
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,304
Please don't be alarmed.

63
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:51,704
Yun Jae.

64
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:53,970
He's here.

65
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,404
What do you want?

66
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:59,637
I said I didn't want to see you
if you don't plan on marrying Da Ran.

67
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:01,503
Hello.

68
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:03,237
I'm telling them everything.

69
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,237
Da Ran.

70
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:08,438
Did she tell them?

71
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:09,204
Not yet.

72
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:10,970
Are you marrying him, Ms. Gil?

73
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,470
Mary...

74
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:15,237
You accepted the ring.

75
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:16,670
Ring?

76
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,137
He proposed to you, didn't he?

77
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:21,904
Did you ask her to marry you?

78
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,037
Yes.

79
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:25,470
So what's your answer, Ms. Gil?

80
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,837
Da Ran, what are you going to do?

81
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:28,503
Are you marrying him?

82
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,271
Um...

83
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,037
I told Da Ran how I felt about her.

84
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:35,371
I'm now waiting for her decision.

85
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:37,338
Nothing's set in stone yet,

86
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:40,438
but Mary has jumped the gun.

87
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:42,071
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:44,204
Let's go, Jang Mary.

89
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:47,537
I can always come back and tell them.

90
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,304
We now know Yun Jae wants to marry you.

91
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:52,770
What about you?

92
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,503
Of course she'll marry him. She's
been seeing him behind our back.

93
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,537
What's going on?

94
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:03,271
Chung Sik, your sister's getting married.

95
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,438
Yun Jae even gave her a ring.

96
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,870
Is that why you rushed over here?

97
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,071
Why did you go behind our back
if you were in such a rush to marry him?

98
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,503
You saw, right?

99
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:18,071
If Ms. Gil says yes, I'm going back
and spilling the beans.

100
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:19,438
You're just a kid.

101
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:21,570
I, on the other hand, look like an adult.
They'll believe me over you.

102
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,637
An adult is no match for a bratty kid.

103
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:24,637
You know that.

104
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:27,904
Your mom and my dad didn't get married
because of my persistence.

105
00:05:27,904 --> 00:05:33,004
That's right. They couldn't get married,
because we were both brats.

106
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:35,271
And what happened to my mom?

107
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:40,503
If you tell them I'm Kang Gyeong Jun,

108
00:05:40,503 --> 00:05:42,338
I won't ever see you again.

109
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:51,870
The furniture and appliances are there,

110
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,004
and they did their wedding shoot.

111
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:57,237
The wedding ceremony is all that's left.

112
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:59,503
Don't let anyone know

113
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:01,404
until the wedding date is confirmed.

114
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,004
It's not peak season. It won't be
hard to find a wedding hall.

115
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:38,804
If you want to know how
he really feels about you,

116
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:41,104
let's just get married.

117
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:50,704
I wonder if Yun Jae really
was planning to marry me.

118
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,737
You did the right thing, Da Ran.

119
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:12,704
You got the wedding ceremony out of the way

120
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:15,470
and got us a beautiful house.

121
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,737
The house is worth a lot more
than what you got it for, too.

122
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:21,137
You're a perfect wife.

Chung Sik.

124
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,071
Take it. Take it.

125
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:42,570
I wonder if that's how it'll be.

126
00:07:44,104 --> 00:07:47,071
But

127
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:49,503
what if he didn't want to marry me?

128
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,304
I'm so sorry, Da Ran.

129
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:58,338
I had no idea you were this dense.

130
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:01,837
The house went up in value.
Would you settle for that?

[Divorce Petition]

132
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:12,770
Will you just sign right here?

133
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:33,304
You're still awake?

134
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,071
Hi, mom.

135
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,271
Are you still wavering?

136
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:49,204
I'm not sure what Yun Jae's
true feelings are.

137
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,904
And how do you feel about him?

138
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:02,271
What's important is how you feel.

139
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:07,537
Don't you love Yun Jae?

140
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:11,503
I wish you won't worry too much
about Yun Jae's feelings

141
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:14,204
like you did last time

142
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:17,438
and just be faithful to your own feelings.

143
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:22,737
You should go to bed.

vow to never

How much does

149
00:10:22,304 --> 00:10:25,037
Ms. Gil like Dr. Seo?

150
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,804
My sister used to

151
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:31,904
wait around the clock for him to call.

152
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:35,503
She was pathetically in love.

153
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,837
Then I won't have to worry about Ms. Gil.

154
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:49,537
Jang Mary,

155
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:54,304
how much do you like me?

156
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:59,804
I know you like Kang Gyeong Jun,

157
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:05,570
but we've gotten closer
through the pizza deal.

158
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,271
Let's say your feelings for Gyeong Jun
are at 100. Where do I stand?

159
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,937
30?

160
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:16,904
30?

161
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:18,904
I'd be happy with just 20.

162
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:23,304
No. Just 10 will do.

163
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:27,737
So?

164
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:31,071
You're...

165
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,271
Zero.

166
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:39,271
Zero.

167
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:40,837
Zero.

168
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:42,271
Zero.

169
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,204
Zero?

170
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:00,770
Chung Sik,

171
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,737
what did you get on your English test?

172
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:07,637
Zero.

173
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:09,537
Zero.

174
00:12:09,537 --> 00:12:12,603
What? 0%?

175
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,770
That's not easy pull even by
guessing them all.

176
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,637
Bring me your report card.

177
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:25,271
You don't know how I feel.

178
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:29,670
Where are you going? Gil Chung Sik!

179
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,904
Did you hear?

180
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:33,171
He opened a skin clinic in Gangnam.

181
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:35,004
Yeah. It cost him $2 million, right?

182
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,837
His wife's parents are rich.

183
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:38,171
I didn't know that.

184
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:39,404
How did you know?

185
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:40,870
Didn't you see them at the wedding?

186
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:48,104
Yun Jae,

187
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,937
you'll be at the opening reception, right?

188
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,137
It's all part of networking.

189
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:57,338
I want to set up my own practice, too.
Will you co-sign a loan?

190
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,737
I have something important to tend to.

191
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,704
I have to run. See you.

192
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,537
See you later.

193
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:33,603
Doctor? Why are you back here?

194
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:36,637
I was at the emergency room,

195
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:40,304
but there were so many trauma victims
that I was traumatized.

196
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:42,637
I need to rest, so go away.

197
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:47,470
But doctors are supposed
to treat sick people.

198
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,904
Do you want to co-sign a loan?

199
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:50,137
Huh?

200
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:52,704
That's the best way
to shoo away a pesky friend.

201
00:13:52,704 --> 00:13:54,904
Try it when you get older.

202
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:57,670
Let me have a bite, Bunny Girl.

203
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,137
My blood sugar level is low.

204
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:05,737
You're an adult. Why are you
taking a kid's snack?

205
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:09,104
I'm not an adult, so I can take her snack.

206
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:11,271
Teddy Bear Boy,

207
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:13,537
you sure talk a lot. You're a real pain.

208
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:15,204
Do you want to co-sign a loan?

209
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:16,237
Huh?

210
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:18,704
Bunny Girl,

211
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:20,637
you rock.

212
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:25,371
- Good job.
- Isn't that something only adults say?

213
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:31,770
Let's play a game.
Whoever has this doll has to be quiet.

214
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:48,670
What is it that you want to ask me?

215
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,104
How close were you and Yun Jae?

216
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:57,204
It's something even Yun Jae doesn't remember,

217
00:14:57,204 --> 00:15:00,271
so why should I tell you?

218
00:15:00,271 --> 00:15:02,404
I need to know for sure
how Yun Jae feels about me.

219
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:04,137
Please tell me.

220
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,137
Yun Jae and I slept together.

221
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:13,870
We were close enough to come
in and out of another's houses.

222
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,570
You're lying, aren't you?

223
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:19,804
Please be honest.

224
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:22,438
What difference does it make if I'm lying?

225
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:25,937
You don't think you're good enough for him,

226
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:31,271
so you gave up before you got
to find out how he felt about you.

227
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:34,371
Do you feel more confident
now that Yun Jae's back?

228
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,037
Yes.

229
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,204
I plan to be more self-assured

230
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:41,304
and be true my feelings.

231
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:42,937
Do what you will,

232
00:15:42,937 --> 00:15:46,737
but I don't care to encourage you.

233
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:50,470
I'm merely trying to gain
some self-confidence.

234
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,071
Can't you help me out here?

235
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:53,104
No.

236
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:55,304
You're really rotten, aren't you?

237
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:57,104
At least I'm not pathetic like you.

238
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:59,970
So did you have an affair
with Yun Jae or not?

239
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,470
You have no right to be so brazen, you know?

240
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,637
What I did may have been wrong,

241
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:07,237
but I don't want things to go well for you.

242
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,970
That's why I will never tell you.

243
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:27,970
Hi.

244
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:58,338
What's up?

245
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,503
Hey.

246
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:06,237
It's so hot that my face is flushed.

247
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:08,804
Should I cool you down?

248
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,371
How about some rain?

249
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:18,404
Wow. It's like real rain.

250
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:27,804
That was a short rain shower.

251
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:29,104
My turn.

252
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:39,770
- You're done for.
- Don't you dare.

253
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:46,737
This one's monsoon rain. It will never stop.

254
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:49,137
And this one's a typhoon.

255
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,004
Hey. You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?

256
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:54,737
Stop it.

257
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:03,637
Gil Teacher, I don't think
I'm the only typhoon victim.

258
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,104
My purse!

259
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,237
There are important documents in it.

260
00:18:38,271 --> 00:18:40,637
I have to turn this in tomorrow.

261
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:43,004
You were acting like the goddess of rain

262
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:44,670
or something.

263
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:47,438
And who started it?

264
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:50,503
Who asked you to goof off
with a kid anyway?

265
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:56,704
Huh?

266
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:58,371
The ring.

267
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,271
My ring's gone.

268
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,404
You lost it?

269
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,037
You're such a scatterbrain.

270
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:11,371
You've waited for that ring for ages.
How can you lose it in less than a day?

271
00:19:13,404 --> 00:19:15,304
It's not here.

272
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:18,271
Maybe I lost it somewhere else.

273
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:21,171
Look more carefully.

274
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:26,904
Never mind.

275
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:29,037
If it's lost, so be it.

276
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,438
What?

277
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:38,770
Maybe you're relieved that it's lost.

278
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:43,870
I thought I had gotten over him,
but then that ring showed up.

279
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,404
I don't think I can figure out
how he really felt about me.

280
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:50,104
Now that I've lost the ring,
I just won't think about it anymore.

281
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:51,737
Gil Da Ran,

282
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:55,271
all your thinking and pondering
has confused you even more again.

283
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:58,104
How can you give up so easily?

284
00:19:58,104 --> 00:19:59,704
I have to give up

285
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:02,770
if I'm to discuss marriage
with a kid like you.

286
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,438
No else knows but I know who you really are.

287
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:05,837
Don't make excuses.

288
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,037
That's not what's going on.
You're still not confident.

289
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:10,503
You're scared of waiting and
finding out how he really feels.

290
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:14,837
How can I just go through with this
when I don't know how he feels?

291
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:17,171
Only young kids like you
can be that reckless.

292
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:20,404
Even a young kid like me only gave up
after I was turned out.

293
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:23,338
You, however, only agonized over it
and then gave up without even trying.

294
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:26,037
That doesn't make you an adult.
That makes you a loser.

295
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:28,204
Fine. I'm a loser.

296
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:30,837
Don't expect much of an
immature loser like me then.

297
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:34,837
Fine. I won't.

298
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:38,970
I'm just going to marry anyone
Yun Jae's mother tells me to.

299
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,670
That means you'll never get
a chance to find out.

300
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:58,104
[Supplementary Class Schedule:
2013 Summer Session]

301
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,004
Has your sister decided to get married?

302
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:18,503
She says she hasn't made up her mind yet.

303
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:20,171
Really?

304
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,670
Then all I have to do is
make up with Gyeong Jun.

305
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,204
Jang Mary,

306
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:32,704
although I may be a zero to you right now,

307
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:35,837
I'll spread a white sheet of paper

308
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,704
in my heart and wait for you

309
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:40,503
to give me even just a single point.

310
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:43,137
Chung Sik. Chung Sik.

311
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:45,204
Take this out to the recycling bin.

312
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,603
Mom,

313
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:48,237
can't you see I'm busy right now?

314
00:21:48,237 --> 00:21:49,438
You do it.

315
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:54,670
Fine. I'm throwing out the magazines
and DVDs I found under your bed.

316
00:22:03,137 --> 00:22:04,870
White sheet of paper?

317
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:08,904
Mary.

318
00:22:08,904 --> 00:22:11,737
They're not mine. They're my dad's.

319
00:22:11,737 --> 00:22:13,204
Mary.

320
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:15,570
Mom!

321
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,137
Why did you bring these out?

322
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:20,404
That's why I told you to take them
to the recycling bin.

323
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:22,503
Mary was here. This is so embarrassing.

324
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:25,804
You drive me crazy, mom.

325
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:28,237
It's okay. I understand.

326
00:22:28,237 --> 00:22:29,870
I hate you.

327
00:22:32,371 --> 00:22:35,804
Why's he so riled up over nothing?

328
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:37,570
I hate you, too.

329
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,204
All I wanted him to do
was take out the trash.

330
00:23:20,037 --> 00:23:23,037
It's fine when it's in books or on screen...

[Supplementary Class Schedule:
2013 Summer Session]

332
00:23:36,037 --> 00:23:38,438
I hope the vice principal chews her out.

333
00:23:54,804 --> 00:23:56,570
Hyo Sang's on his way.

334
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,037
His piggy bank's gone.

335
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,704
He must have run away like he did
when he was in middle school.

336
00:24:01,704 --> 00:24:03,970
Good grief.

337
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,204
Chung Sik will take Mary's call,

338
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:11,603
and Mary will do what
Gyeong Jun tells her to.

339
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,371
Gym?

340
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:30,770
Why's he here?

341
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,937
Do you how much was in the piggy bank?

342
00:24:34,937 --> 00:24:37,104
Around $100.

343
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:39,204
He couldn't have gotten that far then.

344
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:42,904
It's important to find him before
he leaves the near vicinity.

345
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:45,271
I've contacted Chung Sik's friends,

346
00:24:45,271 --> 00:24:46,837
so we'll be able to locate him.

347
00:24:46,837 --> 00:24:47,904
Thank you.

348
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,670
Da Ran, get him something to drink.

349
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:52,804
Please don't worry.

350
00:24:53,503 --> 00:24:56,737
We're sorry we asked you come
all this way in this terrible heat.

351
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,071
Thank you.

352
00:25:01,737 --> 00:25:03,870
She can see the gym teacher for all I care.

353
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,804
Yun Jae.

354
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:09,237
Yun Jae.

355
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:13,970
You must have come over because
you were worried about Chung Sik.

356
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:16,271
Uh... Yes.

357
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:19,770
Come in. Let's talk inside.

358
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:23,037
Da Ran, Yun Jae's here.

359
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:25,937
Come in.

360
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:28,603
You didn't have to call Yun Jae.

361
00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:32,371
Hyo Sang's here, so don't worry.

362
00:25:32,371 --> 00:25:36,037
But he came all this way,
because he was worried.

363
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:38,770
Da Ran, why don't you two

364
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,937
look for Chung Sik at nearby internet cafes,

365
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:43,937
comic book stores, and karaokes?

366
00:25:43,937 --> 00:25:45,438
We'll do that.

367
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:47,204
That will be useless.

368
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:48,804
If Chung Sik's really intent
on running away,

369
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:51,870
he wouldn't be anywhere
you'd expect him to be at.

370
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,503
I'll look for him,

371
00:25:53,503 --> 00:25:55,204
so don't worry and go to bed.

372
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:57,171
Hyo Sang's right.

373
00:25:57,171 --> 00:26:00,870
Da Ran, why don't you go and
look for Chung Sik with Hyo Sang?

374
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,271
There's no need to bother Yun Jae.

375
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,603
I want to help out.

376
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:07,037
Who knows?

377
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:11,438
I might find Chung Sik more quickly
than the runaway expert here.

378
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,937
Fine. Go for it then.

379
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:27,104
The gym teacher's a runaway expert,
but I'm the runaway's classmate.

380
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,404
But they don't know that, do they?

00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:37,837

Gil Chung Sik ran away from home.

383
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:42,204
We have to find him,

384
00:26:42,204 --> 00:26:45,404
so get his best friends and come over.

385
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:47,404
And don't take the gym teacher's calls.

386
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:48,704
Okay.

387
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,104
You're still here?

388
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,304
I'm strategizing.

389
00:26:57,304 --> 00:26:58,670
Excuse me then.

390
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:03,338
Did you get in touch with Mary?

391
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:06,503
Why should I tell you?
You're not on my team.

392
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:08,704
Mr. Na.

393
00:27:10,737 --> 00:27:12,837
That pitcher's still hasn't left the mound.

394
00:27:12,837 --> 00:27:17,171
Mr. Na, I'll look for Chung Sik
with that team.

395
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:18,637
Sure.

396
00:27:24,537 --> 00:27:26,137
Is Mary coming?

397
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:27,737
Yup.

398
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:34,937
Mary.

399
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:36,304
Has Gil Chung Sik called?

400
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:38,004
His phone's turned off.

401
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:40,204
Where do you think he might be?

402
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:44,804
Our other friend Geun Chan ran away once.
He slept in the underpass by Seoul Station.

403
00:27:44,804 --> 00:27:47,503
- Underpass?
- Chung Sik wouldn't do that.

404
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:50,004
I bet he's at a sauna.

405
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:55,837
He once spend the night at a sauna
where Jun Seok's sister works.

406
00:27:55,837 --> 00:27:57,371
A sauna?

407
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:02,071
I'm an expert.

408
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:05,670
I must read the mind of the runaway teen.

409
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:10,237
He ran away on impulse,

410
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:12,503
so he couldn't have gotten far.

411
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:15,937
A dark place near the house...

412
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:19,037
I'll start with the park.

413
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:22,937
Gil Chung Sik, here I come.

414
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:24,904
Mr. Na's coming to find you.

415
00:28:39,503 --> 00:28:41,470

[Help Wanted]

417
00:28:44,137 --> 00:28:46,970
He was looking for a job.

418
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,404
Once he gets a job, it'll be
even harder to find him.

419
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:54,770
I have to find him tonight.

420
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:03,870
He has eaten.

421
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,704
It's been less than an hour since he left.

422
00:29:13,137 --> 00:29:17,470
Why did he leave though?

423
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:23,737
Mosquitoes.

424
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:28,704
If he wanted to get away from mosquitoes,

425
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,204
he would have gone indoors.

426
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,637
If he's nervous, he wouldn't have returned

427
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:36,104
to a place he's already been to.

428
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:40,004
Where can he be?

429
00:29:43,438 --> 00:29:46,537
A place his friends know
but his parents don't...

430
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:49,670
I need info from Chung Sik's best friends.

431
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,271
Why aren't they picking up?

432
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:53,737
The person you're trying to reach...

433
00:29:56,537 --> 00:29:58,603
Are we just going to sit here?

434
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:02,937
We'll hear from Mary soon.

435
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:04,438
Chung Sik has run away from home.

436

Why are you so laid back?

437
00:30:06,603 --> 00:30:09,037
What would you know? You've always been

438
00:30:09,037 --> 00:30:10,770
a model student.

439
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,503
I defied my mom, too. It got very serious.

440
00:30:13,503 --> 00:30:14,670
Over what?

441
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,603
Did you say you were going to Harvard
instead of Seoul National?

442
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:18,338
I need another drink.

443

Answer the phone if Mary calls.

444
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:25,704
He must have really gone
against his mother's wishes.

445
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,304
Hi, Mary.

446
00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:34,603
Are you with Gyeong Jun?

447
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:36,970
Yeah. Did you get a hold of Chung Sik?

448
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,271
No.

449
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,804
Are you and Gyeong Jun
looking for Chung Sik together?

450
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:46,104
Hasn't Chung Sik's friends heard from him?

451
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,704
One of them thinks he might be
at the underpass by Seoul Station.

452
00:30:52,171 --> 00:30:53,037
Seoul Station?

453
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:55,171
You go and look for him there,

454
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:58,870
and tell Gyeong Jun to meet me
at the sauna in Noryangjin.

455
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,204
Okay.

456
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:11,137
Mary's meeting you at the sauna in
Noryangjin. I'm going to Seoul Station.

457
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:12,338
Go.

458
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:13,204
Are you sure you can go alone?

459
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,438
Look for him at the dry sauna
with Mary. Hurry.

460

Dr. Seo.

461
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,237
Defiance must be kept short.

462
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:51,338
Otherwise, you'll miss your window
of opportunity to cut it short.

463
00:31:51,338 --> 00:31:53,037
But I don't plan to keep it short.

464
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:54,737
I'm not going home.

465
00:31:54,737 --> 00:31:57,503
I'm not seeing my mom again.

466
00:31:57,503 --> 00:31:59,503
You may say that, but I bet

467
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:02,371
there's no way you believe
you really won't ever see her again.

468
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:04,104
I don't care if I don't get to see her again.

469
00:32:04,104 --> 00:32:05,904
You know Kang Gyeong Jun, right?

470
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:07,637
Yes.

471
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:10,404
His mother died while he was being defiant.

472
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:15,104
He thought he wouldn't care if he never
got to see her again, but she died.

473
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:19,404
Defy your mom more often if you have to,
but don't drag this out.

474
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,037
Keep an eye on how your mom's doing.

475
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:26,904
Is my mom okay?

476
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:29,570
You can go home and check for yourself.

477
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,770
If you can't bear to go back just like this,
tell your mom what you want.

478
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,637
I'll do my best to negotiate on your behalf.

479
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:41,338
Could you get her to let me
study in the States?

480
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:44,004
I'll see if I can negotiate
a trip to the U.S. for you.

481
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,637
Gil Chung Sik.

482
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:47,637
Gyeong...

483
00:32:47,637 --> 00:32:49,171
Dr. Seo.

484
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,470
Jang Mary,

485
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,071
did you come to look for me?

486
00:32:57,071 --> 00:32:58,737
Are we spending the night here?

487
00:32:58,737 --> 00:33:00,237
It'll be fun.

488
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,737
Time to go home.

489
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:04,204
Okay.

490
00:33:04,904 --> 00:33:07,438
Gil Da Ran's at a sauna
near Seoul Station, right?

491
00:33:07,438 --> 00:33:08,470
No.

492
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,304
She's at an underpass
where the homeless are.

493
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:11,670
- What?
- What?

494
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,037
Gil Chung Sik.

495
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,404
Chung Sik.

496
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:21,770
Chung Sik.

497
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,670
Chung Sik.

498
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,137
Spare some change.

499
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:47,704
You startled me.

500
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:50,338
Are you out of your mind?
How could you come here alone?

501
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:54,570
I'm fine. Why are you all worked up?

502
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:56,770
Da Ran.

503
00:34:02,704 --> 00:34:04,271
Gil Chung Sik.

504
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:05,704
You're a jerk.

505
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:07,570
You'll be the death of me.

506
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,037
What did I do?

507
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:11,071
You'd better get your act together.

508
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,037
Don't hit me.

509
00:34:14,037 --> 00:34:15,237
You...

510
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:21,904
I'm sorry.

511
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:23,537
Chung Sik,

512
00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:24,937
where have you been?

513
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:28,470
Get a good night's sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow morning.

514
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,570
Good grief.

515
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,137
Mom.

516
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:37,137
Yes, my baby.

517
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:39,670
- I'm glad you're back.
- Yun Jae found him?

518
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,037
Yes.

519
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:46,004
Tell Yun Jae I'd like to see him later too

520
00:34:46,004 --> 00:34:48,204
for lunch or dinner.

521
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:57,304
Your dad seems to have come around,
because he brought Chung Sik back.

522
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,404
Why are you crying, Mary?

523
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:17,271
Gyeong Jun's

524
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:21,071
mad at me because

525
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,503
I lied again

526
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:30,438
and put you in harm's way.

527
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:33,637
He's very angry.

528
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,470
I...

529
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,438
I didn't do it on purpose.

530
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:45,237
It's okay.

531
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:53,503
Gyeong Jun doesn't like me

532
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,603
because he thinks

533
00:35:58,603 --> 00:36:02,271
it's my fault his mother died.

534
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:15,404
On the night my dad was going
to propose to his mother,

535
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:24,004
I lied.

536
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:35,670
My dad's going to propose
to your mom tonight.

537
00:36:36,304 --> 00:36:38,104
We can't let it happen.

538
00:36:38,104 --> 00:36:41,237
You don't want your mom
remarrying either, do you?

539
00:36:41,937 --> 00:36:45,770
I'll tell my dad I'm sick
and keep him at home,

540
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,371
so you also make sure your
mother doesn't come over.

541
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:50,804
Okay?

542
00:36:51,304 --> 00:36:53,371
You promise, right?

543
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:03,937
That night,

544
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:10,937
Gyeong Jun's mother

545
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,804
was shot

546
00:37:14,804 --> 00:37:16,870
and killed.

547
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,704
She wouldn't have died if
she had come to see my dad.

548
00:37:26,404 --> 00:37:29,338
It was all my fault.

549
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,338
Gyeong Jun.

550
00:38:08,804 --> 00:38:10,737
Gyeong Jun,

551
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,037
I have to go somewhere tonight.

552
00:38:14,037 --> 00:38:16,904
Don't go.

553
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:19,737
If you go,

554
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:22,503
I won't ever see you again.

555
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:25,970
Okay.

556
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,537
I'll stay with you then.

557
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:33,904
Hey, you.

558
00:38:53,937 --> 00:38:57,637
I didn't want anyone else in my mom's life.

559
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:03,237
I was a brat,

560
00:39:04,438 --> 00:39:07,470
which is why I lost my mom forever.

561
00:39:18,338 --> 00:39:20,603
It wasn't your fault.

562
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,937
You were

563
00:39:23,937 --> 00:39:27,404
just upset, like Chung Sik.

564
00:39:29,137 --> 00:39:31,438
What happened wasn't your fault.

565
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,371
I asked you over for lunch to thank you

566
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:48,371
for helping us find Chung Sik.

567
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:52,438
I said I was coming here, and Ms. Lee
said she wanted to come with me.

568
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:55,304
I said I wanted to come for the dumplings,

569
00:39:55,304 --> 00:39:59,237
and Vice Principal Kim said
she wanted to see you, sir.

570
00:39:59,237 --> 00:40:03,304
It's been a long time, Min Gyu.

571
00:40:03,304 --> 00:40:04,837
Yes.

572
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:08,237
It sure has been a long time, Yeong Ok.

573
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:09,570
You were a dear...

574
00:40:11,004 --> 00:40:12,804
I, mean, a junior colleague.

575
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:15,503
We worked at the same school
for a very long time, didn't we?

576
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:16,404
Yes.

577
00:40:16,404 --> 00:40:17,937
We also taught the same grade twice.

578
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:19,404
Yes.

579
00:40:19,404 --> 00:40:22,770
She was my homeroom teacher
in my senior year.

580
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,371
Oh...

581
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:27,438
It's been so long, Ms. Kim.

582
00:40:30,404 --> 00:40:35,537
You've aged a lot, Jeong Hye.

583
00:40:35,537 --> 00:40:40,237
Age enhances one's intellect

584
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,037
but diminishes one's beauty, right?

585
00:40:42,037 --> 00:40:47,937
You still have a way of getting
under people's skin, don't you?

586
00:40:49,404 --> 00:40:52,704
And you're still an airhead.

587
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,704
Yeong Ok was very bright.

588
00:40:57,704 --> 00:40:59,271
Welcome.

589
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:03,837
What would you like?

590
00:41:04,937 --> 00:41:06,137
Pork dumplings.

591
00:41:06,137 --> 00:41:07,670
Pork dumplings?

592
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,237
Pork dumplings.

593
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:12,137
Why doesn't she recognize me?

594
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,338
Is it because of this?

595
00:41:15,603 --> 00:41:18,304
Enjoy the food.

596
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:20,470
- These are all yours.
- Thank you.

597
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:24,804
This is better.

598
00:41:27,637 --> 00:41:28,937
Let me see.

599
00:41:28,937 --> 00:41:31,438
Your former students are here.

600
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:33,837
Undo the top button.

601
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:51,104
Hello, Mr. Gil.

602
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,870
Hi.

603
00:41:58,004 --> 00:41:59,837
I brought these for you.

604
00:42:01,904 --> 00:42:03,737
Thanks.

605
00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:13,637
- Min Gyu...
- Here you go.

606
00:42:13,637 --> 00:42:15,404
Thanks.

607
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:30,237
You're the student who always

608
00:42:30,237 --> 00:42:34,770
watched those two with a rock in your hand.

609
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,637
And you're the teacher
who always watched them

610
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,204
from behind a tree with
a handkerchief in your hand.

611
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:48,704
As you age, you realize
beauty really is nothing.

612
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:54,804
Maybe it's this shabby restaurant,
but he certainly looks old.

613
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:56,503
Very old.

614
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:02,404
I didn't plan to go back home,

615
00:43:02,404 --> 00:43:05,603
but Mary came to look for me
and was so insistent

616
00:43:05,603 --> 00:43:06,904
that I caved in.

617
00:43:09,937 --> 00:43:12,037
Your father must have
given you a good beating.

618
00:43:12,037 --> 00:43:13,171
No, he didn't.

619
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:14,404
It was his mom.

620
00:43:14,404 --> 00:43:17,704
I let her beat me so she'd feel better.

621
00:43:17,704 --> 00:43:19,271
Be good to your moms.

622
00:43:21,271 --> 00:43:23,104
Keep your defiance short.

623
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:26,371
Otherwise, you'll miss your "windex"
of opportunity to cut it short.

624
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,271
You mean "window of opportunity," right?

625
00:43:30,104 --> 00:43:32,271
Just forget about studying in the States.

626
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:33,670
No.

627
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,404
I must go wherever Mary goes.

628
00:43:38,404 --> 00:43:43,503
But Mary's probably with Kang Gyeong Jun...

629
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,837
What are you doing here?

630
00:44:02,503 --> 00:44:06,804
I got you your favorite.

631
00:44:11,804 --> 00:44:13,704
It's all melted.

632
00:44:19,338 --> 00:44:21,171
It's all my fault.

633
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:24,137
I ruined everything.

634
00:44:28,837 --> 00:44:30,338
It's not your fault.

635
00:44:31,104 --> 00:44:33,104
It's hot out.

636
00:44:34,637 --> 00:44:38,804
And what happened to my mom
wasn't your fault either.

637
00:44:39,171 --> 00:44:43,603
I won't be a brat anymore.

638
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:48,603
I won't just do whatever I feel like.

639
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:16,371
Don't over think it.

640
00:45:17,704 --> 00:45:20,438
We're simply taking things back
to the way they should have been.

641
00:45:32,804 --> 00:45:35,404
I will no longer waver over what I think

642
00:45:35,404 --> 00:45:37,704
Yun Jae's feelings toward me may have been.

643
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:42,104
I was thinking of telling you
to help you out,

644
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:43,404
but should I not?

645
00:45:43,404 --> 00:45:45,004
Do what you will.

646
00:45:45,004 --> 00:45:48,603
What you say won't affect me anyway.

647
00:45:48,603 --> 00:45:50,870
I have to be a reliable adult.

648
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:55,570
and to that end, I need to be
strong and self-assured.

649
00:45:56,438 --> 00:45:58,470
Really?

650
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:02,637
You might need a little help

651
00:46:02,637 --> 00:46:05,104
to test how strong and self-assured you are.

652
00:46:06,104 --> 00:46:07,670
Let me help you on that front.

653
00:46:08,171 --> 00:46:10,338
Fine.

654
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:15,470
Like the pine atop Namsan Peak
in our national anthem,

655
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:20,071
I will stand firm as if wrapped in armour.

656
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:29,537
Where is it?

657
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:32,804
Now that I've even likened
myself to a pine tree,

658
00:46:32,804 --> 00:46:36,371
I have to find that ring.

659
00:46:37,704 --> 00:46:39,037
It's hot out. What's up?

660
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:43,104
I need to find the ring. Where can it be?

661
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:47,237
You should've looked for it right away.
You're such a slowpoke.

662
00:46:48,004 --> 00:46:50,870
It's too hot out. Add to it
by being annoying.

663
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,670
You're hot?

664
00:46:55,137 --> 00:46:57,937
That's nice. Keep that coming.

665
00:46:59,404 --> 00:47:01,603
Stronger.

666
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,503
My arm hurts.

667
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:20,271
You had found it.

668
00:47:22,637 --> 00:47:24,904
Why are you just staring at it? Take it.

669
00:47:31,837 --> 00:47:34,237
I think I still love him.

670
00:47:35,304 --> 00:47:40,537
I'm sure my heart still yearns for him.

671
00:47:41,404 --> 00:47:46,537
I know the person you're seeing
right now is not Kang Gyeong Jun.

672
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,870
I won't be a baby anymore

673
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:53,603
and keep you from loving the man you want.

674
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:57,937
I'll help you grow up into a fine young man.

675
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,970
Kang Gyeong Jun,

676
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,970
marry me.

677
00:48:10,603 --> 00:48:12,737
I'll raise you well.

678
00:48:21,603 --> 00:48:24,770
If I'm still like this
by the time I reach 20,

679
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,704
let's just go our separate ways.

680
00:48:29,071 --> 00:48:33,837
I will stand firm as if wrapped in armour.

681
00:48:33,837 --> 00:48:35,537
Go, go!

682
00:48:38,737 --> 00:48:40,304
What's wrong?

683
00:48:40,304 --> 00:48:42,137
Do you think this is a bad idea?

684
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,570
I know Seo Yun Jae's not here
to do it himself,

685
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,404
but it's really sad to put on
your own engagement ring.

686
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:50,904
I'll do it in his stead.

687
00:49:01,537 --> 00:49:03,037
Let's make this work.

688
00:49:06,438 --> 00:49:08,804
I shall repeat my vow.

689
00:49:08,804 --> 00:49:12,104
I will never

690
00:49:12,104 --> 00:49:14,037
be nice to you.

691
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:17,037
Why not? You said I could
think of you as Yun Jae.

692
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,104
What if you get confused

693
00:49:20,104 --> 00:49:21,637
and try to jump me?

694
00:49:21,637 --> 00:49:23,071
No, I won't.

695
00:49:23,937 --> 00:49:27,371
I will continue being a jerk
for my own safety.

696
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:28,704
Fine.

697
00:49:28,704 --> 00:49:32,570
Since I'm the adult, I'll let you be a baby.

698
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:35,970
Let's inform our parents and
get this over and done with.

699
00:49:36,404 --> 00:49:37,904
Let's go.

700
00:49:38,304 --> 00:49:40,004
Go, go.

701
00:49:40,737 --> 00:49:42,004
Go, go.

702
00:49:43,537 --> 00:49:45,503
No refunds.

703
00:49:46,237 --> 00:49:49,404
How will you manage the
consequences of black magic?

704
00:49:51,804 --> 00:49:53,104
Then write me another spell.

705
00:49:53,104 --> 00:49:55,837
Readjusting a spell

706
00:49:55,837 --> 00:49:57,704
costs an additional $30.

707
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:02,570
This time, make sure they don't fall
in love even if they're together 24/7.

708
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,637
Okay.

709
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:11,171
Go behind the door and
divert the evil spirits.

710
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,404
Not him.

711
00:50:20,404 --> 00:50:22,237
He's not pure.

712
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,870
It's a misunderstanding, Mary.

713
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:27,470
The porn...

714
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:31,104
Was my dad's.

715
00:50:31,104 --> 00:50:35,204
I'm as pure as a white sheet of paper.

716
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:41,204
He does seem pure.

717
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,204
Go and distract the evil spirits.

718
00:50:43,204 --> 00:50:44,970
You can read right through me.

719
00:50:46,704 --> 00:50:48,637
Mary,

720
00:50:48,637 --> 00:50:51,470
I'm distracting the evil spirits for you.

721
00:50:57,537 --> 00:51:03,537
What you want is to keep two people from

722
00:51:03,537 --> 00:51:04,970
falling in love, right?

723
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,137
Even if they get married,

724
00:51:07,137 --> 00:51:11,338
make sure they won't ever
fall for each other.

725
00:51:12,137 --> 00:51:16,438
This one has to work.

726
00:51:18,037 --> 00:51:23,304
I'd still like to see you even
after Yun Jae gets married.

727
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:28,637
And please introduce me to Dr. Seo
when he comes to Korea.

728
00:51:28,637 --> 00:51:34,404
I've wanted to meet him not because
he's Yun Jae's dad but a great doctor.

729
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:38,204
Yun Jae's father says he can't
come to Korea right away,

730
00:51:38,204 --> 00:51:42,204
but they're still pushing
ahead with the wedding.

731
00:51:44,537 --> 00:51:45,737
Oh?

732
00:51:45,737 --> 00:51:48,870
Yun Jae has this book too.

733
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,670
Is it a famous storybook?

734
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:53,004
It's never been released.

735
00:51:53,438 --> 00:51:57,837
Yun Jae's father put it together
to remember someone by.

736
00:51:58,537 --> 00:52:00,237
Dr. Seo wrote this?

737
00:52:00,237 --> 00:52:01,770
Yes.

738
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:06,004
Yun Jae's father painted this
when Yun Jae was young.

739
00:52:06,004 --> 00:52:07,503
Oh...

740
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:09,503
What is it about?

741
00:52:10,937 --> 00:52:15,037
The story is that if one
child helps another child,

742
00:52:15,037 --> 00:52:19,204
the latter will save yet another child.

743
00:52:31,804 --> 00:52:35,904
It's a good thing we didn't throw these out.

744
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,204
It's beautiful.

745
00:52:56,204 --> 00:52:57,970
Mary,

746
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:02,338
are you really planning to go
to my sister's wedding like that?

747
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:05,071
Yes. I have to.

748
00:53:07,338 --> 00:53:10,470
But...

749
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,338
Isn't that poor etiquette?

750
00:53:13,338 --> 00:53:17,570
You'll outshine the bride.

751
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,470
Precisely.

752
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:23,637
I'll never leave her side.

753
00:53:23,637 --> 00:53:27,937
But then it'll look like
the groom has two brides.

754
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:29,438
Precisely.

755
00:53:38,304 --> 00:53:40,970
Tomorrow's the day, Kang Gyeong Jun.

756
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:44,004
You're becoming an adult.

757
00:53:44,004 --> 00:53:46,037
I'll open it for you.

758
00:53:46,737 --> 00:53:47,637
But I can do it.

759
00:53:47,637 --> 00:53:49,037
No.

760
00:53:49,637 --> 00:53:53,970
This delineates our relationship.

761
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:57,304
This is something I can drink
but you can't.

762
00:53:57,304 --> 00:53:59,603
Let's not forget that.

763
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:04,071
Let's always keep this boundary in mind.

764
00:54:04,071 --> 00:54:05,438
Fine.

765
00:54:05,438 --> 00:54:07,570
If I'm not back in my body

766
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:09,804
by the time I can legally open this myself,

767
00:54:09,804 --> 00:54:11,304
we'll share a drink

768
00:54:11,304 --> 00:54:13,737
and then say our goodbyes.

769
00:54:55,537 --> 00:54:57,637
Gil Da Ran,

770
00:54:57,637 --> 00:55:02,037
are you happy to be going to China alone?

771
00:55:02,037 --> 00:55:03,404
Wait until you start working.

772
00:55:03,404 --> 00:55:06,304
It's not easy to get time off.

773
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:07,737
And what about you?

774
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:10,204
I'll figure something out.

775
00:55:10,204 --> 00:55:13,204
You didn't go on the class trip last year,
did you? Gyeongju is great.

776
00:55:13,204 --> 00:55:15,371
Drop me off and then head over to Gyeongju.

777
00:55:15,371 --> 00:55:18,404
Our parents think we're off together
on our honeymoon,

778
00:55:18,404 --> 00:55:19,970
so don't get caught.

779
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:21,404
Don't worry about me.

780
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:24,071
Just make sure you don't run into
anyone you know in China.

781
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:26,804
I can't wait to see the Forbidden City.

782
00:55:26,804 --> 00:55:29,237
And I've been dying to try Peking Duck.

783
00:55:29,237 --> 00:55:31,704
Ni hao ma. Xie xie.

784
00:55:45,004 --> 00:55:46,071
Thanks.

785
00:55:46,071 --> 00:55:49,071
I'll show you pictures of
the Great Wall when I get back.

786
00:55:49,071 --> 00:55:50,637
Off I go!

787
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:57,404
She doesn't even ask me
if I want to come with her.

788
00:56:08,503 --> 00:56:09,770
Gil Da Ran.

789
00:56:10,937 --> 00:56:13,970
Gil Da Ran! Gil Da Ran!

790
00:56:22,904 --> 00:56:24,470
Wow, Gil Da Ran.

791
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:26,970
I guess you won't get a chance
to say "ni hao ma."

792
00:56:33,204 --> 00:56:34,737
My passport.

793
00:56:50,804 --> 00:56:52,770
What's up?

794
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:57,271
I think I left my passport in the car
along with the guidebook.

795
00:56:57,271 --> 00:56:58,637
Can you check?

796
00:56:58,637 --> 00:57:00,237
Your passport?

797
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:08,804
Hang on. I'm driving.

798
00:57:10,004 --> 00:57:11,870
Your passport?

799
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:14,438
Let's see.

800
00:57:14,438 --> 00:57:16,304
Look at that. It's here.

801
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:17,204
It's there?

802
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:19,804
Then bring it over to the airport right away.

803
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:22,438
But I've already come quite far.

804
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:26,737
I'll step on the gas though
and try to get there ASAP.

805
00:57:26,737 --> 00:57:28,804
You have to hurry.

806
00:57:28,804 --> 00:57:30,204
Okay.

807
00:57:58,904 --> 00:58:00,670
Gil Teacher.

808
00:58:02,404 --> 00:58:05,237
Is it too late?

809
00:58:16,537 --> 00:58:18,171
[Forbidden City]

810
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:25,537
You were working hard
on your Chinese phrases.

811
00:58:25,537 --> 00:58:29,371
What a shame you won't get to say "ni hao ma."

812
00:58:30,237 --> 00:58:32,704
I think the chef's Chinese.

813
00:58:32,704 --> 00:58:34,137
Do you want to talk to him?

814
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:37,404
I wanted Peking Duck.

815
00:58:37,404 --> 00:58:40,271
Chinese noodles are just as good.

816
00:58:40,271 --> 00:58:42,037
Enjoy.

817
00:58:46,137 --> 00:58:49,470
Are you that disappointed?

818
00:58:51,404 --> 00:58:53,204
Oh, well.

819
00:58:53,937 --> 00:58:55,804
Let's go home.

820
00:58:56,537 --> 00:58:58,004
How about this?

821
00:58:58,004 --> 00:58:59,670
Let's go on a trip.

822
00:59:00,438 --> 00:59:03,071
Forget about your vacation
and my school trip.

823
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:04,870
Let's go on our honeymoon.

824
00:59:09,537 --> 00:59:12,770
Yun Jae got married.

825
00:59:14,004 --> 00:59:18,171
As always, you're so aloof toward Yun Jae.

826
00:59:18,171 --> 00:59:19,937
That's not true.

827
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:24,338
There was something I had to look into.

828
00:59:24,338 --> 00:59:27,404
What's more important than your son?

829
00:59:27,404 --> 00:59:29,904
That child.

830
00:59:29,904 --> 00:59:32,438
I heard his mother died.

831
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:34,338
Pardon?

832
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:36,338
She got shot in the States.

833
00:59:37,271 --> 00:59:39,804
She was gunned down by armed robbers.

834
00:59:41,904 --> 00:59:44,037
Then what about the child?

835
00:59:44,037 --> 00:59:49,304
I'm looking for him right now.

836
00:59:49,304 --> 00:59:52,338
I'm sure Yun Jae will understand.

837
00:59:59,104 --> 01:00:00,503
Where should we go?

838
01:00:01,171 --> 01:00:03,970
You only have 5 days off, so we can't go far.

839
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:06,770
We could go to a resort in Guam or Saipan.

840
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,104
If you really want to see the Forbidden City,
we can go to China, too.

841
01:00:10,104 --> 01:00:13,704
I really want to go to China.

842
01:00:13,704 --> 01:00:14,804
Why?

843
01:00:14,804 --> 01:00:17,670
I want to see the Great Wall.

844
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:18,737
Alright.

845
01:00:19,338 --> 01:00:23,870
Off to the Great Wall we go.

846
01:00:27,438 --> 01:00:31,870
Why did you have your luggage
and passport in your car though?

847
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:35,004
I always keep these in my car.

848
01:00:36,137 --> 01:00:39,271
I'm a jetsetter. It's my lifestyle.

849
01:00:39,271 --> 01:00:43,171
So that means you could've come
to China with me if I had asked earlier.

850
01:00:43,171 --> 01:00:45,570
It didn't sit well with me
to leave you behind.

851
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:47,438
Really?

852
01:00:47,438 --> 01:00:51,737
You should've said so. I could've
come with you if you wanted me to.

853
01:00:51,737 --> 01:00:55,304
But it's a bit weird asking you to come
with me on my honeymoon.

854
01:00:55,304 --> 01:00:57,171
Why?

855
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,137
A honeymoon is...

856
01:01:00,137 --> 01:01:01,338
Gil Teacher,

857
01:01:01,338 --> 01:01:03,171
don't get carried away.

858
01:01:03,171 --> 01:01:04,537
I would never ask you

859
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:08,037
to do what other couples do on honeymoons.

860
01:01:08,037 --> 01:01:09,770
Of course not.

861
01:01:12,338 --> 01:01:14,404
I need to withdraw some cash.

862
01:01:26,304 --> 01:01:28,804
Why am I so giddy?

863
01:01:29,237 --> 01:01:31,870
It'll be embarrassing
if Gyeong Jun catches on.

864
01:01:36,904 --> 01:01:38,704
Shanghai.

865
01:01:38,704 --> 01:01:40,570
Beijing.

866
01:01:44,804 --> 01:01:47,804
Let's see. Do I need to exchange money?

867
01:02:25,837 --> 01:02:27,570
Gyeong Jun.

868
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,837
What's wrong?

869
01:02:37,137 --> 01:02:40,537
I think

870
01:02:40,537 --> 01:02:43,004
I just revisited my own body.

871
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:50,204
Congratulations, Gil Teacher.

872
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:55,171
I think Seo Yun Jae is about to return.

873
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:32,804
What should I sing at my sister's wedding?

874
01:03:32,804 --> 01:03:35,338
- "Wedding Proposal."
- That's so cliche.

875
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:36,670
"I Will Never Let You Go."

876
01:03:39,171 --> 01:03:42,438
I don't think it's a good wedding song.

877
01:03:42,438 --> 01:03:43,837
Sing it!

878
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,371
I will never let you go even if it kills me.

879
01:03:46,371 --> 01:03:48,071
How can I let you go?

880
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:51,904
If you're going to leave,
mend my broken heart.

881
01:03:51,904 --> 01:03:53,137
Sing.

882
01:03:53,804 --> 01:03:55,904
♪ I will never let you go even if it kills me ♪
