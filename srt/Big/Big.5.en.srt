00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:15,937
If it has been lost,

173
00:17:15,937 --> 00:17:19,537
I'll search the entire hospital
if I have to in order to find it.

174
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:22,904
Do you really not know where it is?

175
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:34,603
Here. Happy now?

176
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:39,204
I thought it was lost. What a relief.

177
00:17:48,304 --> 00:17:51,004
You can't sit there. Go.

178
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,937
Mister,

179
00:17:53,937 --> 00:17:57,470
there's a secret of mine
only Gyeong Jun doesn't know.

180
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,237
That only he doesn't know?

181
00:17:59,237 --> 00:18:01,503
Because I've never done it to him.

182
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:03,204
Done what?

183
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:13,104
Hey!

184
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:18,704
No!

185
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,503
Don't tell Gyeong Jun.

186
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,137
Go!

187
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:40,904
[Ms. Gil Da Ran, please don't forget
about the wedding photo shoot tomorrow]

188
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:11,104
Mr. Na,

189
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:13,737
you were gazing lovingly
at Da Ran, weren't you?

190
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,603
What are you talking about?

191
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:16,870
Wait.

192
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,137
You like Da Ran, don't you?

193
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:21,237
Oh my goodness.

194
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:25,371
I thought you were avoiding her
like a plague because you hated her.

195
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:26,670
Oh my goodness.

196
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,837
It was actually because
you had feelings for her.

197
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:29,137
Don't say that.

198
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:31,137
Please don't say that.

199
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,404
Please don't say anything. I beg you.

200
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:34,804
Please.

201
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,737
What do you think you're doing?

202
00:19:42,737 --> 00:19:45,438
You're supposed to be setting
an example for the kids.

203
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,271
Please be careful.

204
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:57,371
Why is there so much coupling
on sacred school grounds?

205
00:19:57,371 --> 00:20:00,570
It's like the Serengeti during mating season.

206
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,137
[Incoming Call: Lee Se Yeong]

207
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,670
It was you and Yun Jae who were
at my front door last night, right?

208
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,470
Se Yeong,

209
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,570
how can you sit there
so brazen and shameless?

210
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,237
You shouldn't be so aggressive either.

211
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:31,704
What won Yun Jae over
was your weakness.

212
00:20:32,338 --> 00:20:35,937
Even when Yun Jae was in school,
he only hung out with

213
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:40,304
the most unfortunate and pitiful kids.

214
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:45,737
He can't turn a blind eye to
people who are sick or weak.

215
00:20:45,737 --> 00:20:47,570
Yun Jae's too sympathetic.

216
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:51,470
But I didn't think he would
marry out of sympathy, too.

217
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:57,338
Yun Jae fell for me the moment he saw me.

218
00:20:57,338 --> 00:20:58,404
You heard the story.

219
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:00,637
At the wedding,

220
00:21:00,637 --> 00:21:04,071
when Yun Jae crashed into you,

221
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:08,837
who do you suppose he was
in a hurry to get to?

222
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:11,404
I left the wedding before him

223
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:15,804
after having told him I had broken
with the guy I was seeing.

224
00:21:16,737 --> 00:21:18,970
So...

225
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,470
Are you saying Yun Jae crashed into me

226
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,904
on his way to see you?

227
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:27,837
Because you got hurt and tied him down,

228
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:29,537
I could never find out for sure.

229
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:32,137
What's wrong?

230
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:36,004
Should we get Yun Jae here
to set the record straight?

231
00:21:37,937 --> 00:21:41,804
You must be nervous.

232
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:50,204
If you are, do a good job holding on to him.

233
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:54,970
Yun Jae's nice, so he'll
let you hold him down.

234
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:58,737
Hey!

235
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:03,770
You watch out for your windows.

236
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,004
You never know when
a rock will be thrown at it.

237
00:22:06,004 --> 00:22:09,904
And if things come to that,
I'm brewing tea out of your hair.

238
00:22:22,137 --> 00:22:24,004
Here you are.

239
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:31,870
If you're going to take him down,
should I keep watch for you?

240
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,503
Gyeong Jun,

241
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:45,704
the wedding photo shoot is tomorrow.

242
00:22:45,704 --> 00:22:46,870
What?

243
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,737
Wedding photo shoot?

244
00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:51,037
You're nuts.

245
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:55,870
Take pity on your poor teacher

246
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,503
and please show up on time.

247
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:59,171
I beg you.

248
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:07,503
Wu Jin.

249
00:23:07,904 --> 00:23:08,737
Yeah?

250
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:11,371
Do you know Yun Jae's
parents' phone numbers?

251
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:12,904
Yeah. Why?

252
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,037
You see,

253
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:18,104
there's something important I need
to tell them about Yun Jae.

254
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:20,104
Give me their numbers.

255
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:29,137
Yun Jae was in an accident?

256
00:23:29,904 --> 00:23:32,737
He didn't mention it to me.

257
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,338
He doesn't seem to want to listen to me,

258
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:41,071
and Da Ran doesn't seem that concerned.

259
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,737
I had to call you although I may be
overstepping my bounds.

260
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:47,937
Thank you for calling.

261
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,037
I have to go to Korea right away.
Please pack my things.

262
00:23:53,037 --> 00:23:54,171
Yes, ma'am.

263
00:23:57,237 --> 00:24:01,171
Chung Sik, go to your sister's wedding
photo shoot and take some candid shots.

264
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:02,537
Sure.

265
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,970
Mom.

266
00:24:05,537 --> 00:24:06,870
Yes?

267
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:12,438
There's something important I want
to discuss with you after the shoot.

268
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:13,804
What is it?

269
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:17,004
I'll tell you after the shoot.

270
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:20,470
I have an upset stomach. Excuse me.

271
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:22,837
Why don't you have some more?

272
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:28,304
She seems stressed.

273
00:24:28,304 --> 00:24:32,037
It's like she's agonizing over something.

274
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,404
Something's up with Yun Jae.

275
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:36,770
Really? What?

276
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,770
I happened to overhear
their conversation a while back.

277
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,704
They said they were hiding something
so that it wouldn't show.

278
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:44,404
They were arguing about whether
or not to go to the hospital.

279
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,438
Really?

280
00:24:48,304 --> 00:24:50,037
Da Ran.

281
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:54,837
Where did she go?

282
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:09,271
I wonder why she has these out.
It's very hot these days.

283
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:10,937
It's like she's pregnant.

284
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,570
Pregnant?

285
00:25:16,104 --> 00:25:19,004
Hide something so it doesn't show?

286
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,071
Oh my goodness.

287
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,770
Yun Jae,

288
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:25,637
Da Ran's ready.

289
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:27,204
You're in for a surprise.

290
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:28,503
Okay.

291
00:25:28,503 --> 00:25:30,204
Tada.

292
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:48,171
Okay. Ready.

293
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,304
Okay. Good.

294
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:51,570
The bride looks great.

295
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,704
The groom, please step forward.

296
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:58,371
Gil Teacher, if you're going
through with this, why dilly-dally?

297
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:01,237
After we're done here, let's go
to city hall and get a marriage license.

298
00:26:02,404 --> 00:26:03,770
I didn't even think of that.

299
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,704
That would seal the deal, not this.

300
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:09,037
But this is more important to me.

301
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:12,104
I want nice pictures, so don't frown.

302
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,037
I want you to smile like Yun Jae would have.

303
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:19,237
Okay.

304
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:20,104
Ready,

305
00:26:20,104 --> 00:26:21,537
jump.

306
00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:24,904
Doves?

307
00:26:24,904 --> 00:26:28,071
This blows. I can't stand birds.

308
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:29,438
No birds.

309
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:31,404
I'm not doing this if those birds fly.

310
00:26:36,537 --> 00:26:39,603
Excuse me. Could we do it without the doves?

311
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,804
Very nice. Smile. 1. 2.

312
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,537
Okay.

313
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:47,937
All done.

314
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:50,438
Come on!

315
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:17,404
2 pizzas.

316
00:27:21,603 --> 00:27:24,570
There were a lot of clothes
from this brand in Ms. Gil's closet.

317
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:31,503
I didn't know Gyeong Jun
was into this style.

318
00:27:31,503 --> 00:27:33,970
If you see anything you like,
please try it on.

319
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:37,404
Does this make me look
like a school teacher?

320
00:27:37,404 --> 00:27:40,037
An adorable kindergarten teacher.

321
00:27:41,503 --> 00:27:44,204
I have to look like a high school teacher.

322
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:50,737
[300 pizzas]

323
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:54,937
They're from the wedding shoot.

324
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,837
The dress isn't all that.

325
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:03,804
My dress will be a lot prettier.

326
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:53,737
Why does this guy

327
00:28:54,204 --> 00:28:55,770
remind me of Gyeong Jun?

328
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:02,603
Last shot.

329
00:29:02,603 --> 00:29:04,438
The bride, please smile.

330
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:08,071
1, 2.

331
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:09,770
Okay.

332
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,071
All done.

333
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:12,937
Good job. It was hot, wasn't it?

334
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:14,704
- How can she smile like that?
- The pictures will turn out great.

335
00:29:14,704 --> 00:29:16,704
- You were so good.
- Really?

336
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:18,171
Thanks.

337
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,870
Sure.

338
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,071
Really?

339
00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:23,670
I developed a few cuts.

340
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,470
Let me know what you like.

341
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,670
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

342
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,537
Good job.

343
00:29:35,237 --> 00:29:36,204
Are you happy?

344
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:38,271
Yes. I'm very happy.

345
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:40,570
They're all beautiful, right?

346
00:29:44,037 --> 00:29:45,937
It's all done now.

347
00:29:46,404 --> 00:29:50,237
Now that we're done with this,
should we go to city hall?

348
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:53,271
We're all done.

349
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:55,171
This is it.

350
00:29:56,737 --> 00:29:59,171
I'm not getting married.

351
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:06,237
Yun Jae's a good guy,
so he won't be able to leave me.

352
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,304
The only option is for me to let him go.

353
00:30:09,937 --> 00:30:15,404
And you don't have to pretend
to be Yun Jae anymore.

354
00:30:16,438 --> 00:30:20,804
I'm so sorry for all that
I've put you through.

355
00:30:20,804 --> 00:30:22,071
Wait.

356
00:30:24,137 --> 00:30:26,371
Yun Jae had gotten this.

357
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:31,104
Is this what you meant by
whether I was running away?

358
00:30:31,104 --> 00:30:33,438
Once I break the news
that I'm not getting married,

359
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:36,503
there will be a lot of commotion.

360
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:40,970
It'll be annoying and difficult
for you if you are to stay.

361
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,371
You can really get away
from it all like you wanted to.

362
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:48,271
Why did you want to get pictures taken
if you weren't planning to get married?

363
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:53,137
Precisely because I can't marry Yun Jae.

364
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:59,704
At least I now have keepsakes.

365
00:31:01,171 --> 00:31:04,271
All you see is Seo Yun Jae, right?

366
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:08,737
It was me who played
the clown for you all day.

367
00:31:09,438 --> 00:31:12,503
But you'll only remember Seo Yun Jae.

368
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,770
That's why I'm grateful to you.

369
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:21,837
I won't make you do this anymore.

370
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,837
Use that ticket and take care of yourself.

371
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,371
I'll take one final shot

372
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:32,704
of you two just like that.

373
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:39,304
Please look at the camera.

374
00:31:39,937 --> 00:31:41,603
Very nice.

375
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:43,271
1...

376
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,204
A keepsake has to be more meaningful.

377
00:31:56,737 --> 00:31:58,637
What a shame.

378
00:31:58,637 --> 00:32:01,438
This was from Kang Gyeong Jun,
not Seo Yun Jae.

379
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:04,171
Gil Teacher,

380
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:07,837
don't ever forget this.

381
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:11,438
It was Kang Gyeong Jun's first kiss.

382
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:15,870
- You little twerp.
- Hey!

383
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,104
See?

384
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:20,603
The love beams are gone.

385
00:32:20,603 --> 00:32:22,271
Now you see Kang Gyeong Jun, right?

386
00:32:31,503 --> 00:32:33,804
Come here.

387
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:36,537
You said you had never
really kissed anyone, right?

388
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:39,670
So this was Gil Da Ran's first kiss, too?

389
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,970
It'll be your last kiss when
I get my hands on you!

390
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,970
Nosebleed. Nosebleed.

391
00:32:55,837 --> 00:32:57,570
No.

392
00:33:08,171 --> 00:33:12,470
[Incoming Call: Mother]

393
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:16,570
The person you're trying to reach...

394
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:29,071
Please do not include the kissing
picture in the wedding album.

395
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:31,737
But that one came out very well.

396
00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:34,670
I don't need it, so please
delete it permanently.

397
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,271
Wow.

398
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:46,837
Mom will like this one.

399
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,137
Here...

400
00:33:49,137 --> 00:33:52,438
This was in the groom's suit.
Could you give it to him?

401
00:33:52,438 --> 00:33:54,071
Okay.

402
00:33:54,904 --> 00:33:56,404
What is this?

403
00:33:56,404 --> 00:33:58,037
Is Yun Jae going somewhere?

404
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:00,304
It has been permanently deleted.

405
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,670
And it will be deleted from my memory, too.

406
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,304
It was a goodbye kiss.

407
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,137
You said you wanted to remember this body.

408
00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:12,071
You can hold on to your memory
of this body and forget me entirely.

409
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:14,404
It's for the better. I'm leaving anyway.

410
00:34:14,404 --> 00:34:18,204
Don't come running back to me,
whining about how hard things are.

411
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:20,904
Bastard!

412
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:22,637
Chung Sik,

413
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:24,537
what's the matter with you?

414
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:27,637
- Don't.
- You called off the wedding

415
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:29,804
- but you don't want her to whine?
- I'm your brother-in-law.

416
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:31,004
Chung Sik!

417
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:36,438
Let go.

418
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:37,770
Hey!

419
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,304
You're a lunatic.

420
00:34:39,304 --> 00:34:40,503
No.

421
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:46,004
I'm going to kill you!

422
00:34:46,004 --> 00:34:48,404
Come back here. Come back here!

423
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:51,037
Are you okay?

424
00:34:51,037 --> 00:34:53,271
Of course I'm not okay. It hurts.

425
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:56,271
It was this dude who caused
all this trouble, but I'm the one

426
00:34:56,271 --> 00:34:58,503
who got bitten by you and beaten up
by your brother.

427
00:34:58,503 --> 00:34:59,470
I'm sorry.

428
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,204
If we tell your parents
we're not getting married,

429
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:04,071
I'll get a beating from your
mother and father, too.

430
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:06,670
Your dad collects stones.
He might stone me.

431
00:35:09,904 --> 00:35:11,770
That won't happen.

432
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,438
That's why I'm telling you
to get away from here.

433
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:21,137
I was going to break the news
after you leave,

434
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:25,937
but I'll have to do it right away
now that Chung Sik knows.

435
00:35:26,603 --> 00:35:28,570
You're going to break the news alone?

436
00:35:29,304 --> 00:35:30,937
I'll take care of everything.

437
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,137
Tell them Seo Yun Jae was cheating
on you with his best friend.

438
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,071
I'm going to tell them it was me
who decided to call off the wedding.

439
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,904
I'm not trying to defend Yun Jae.

440
00:35:45,904 --> 00:35:48,404
My parents will get upset
if they find out this happened

441
00:35:48,404 --> 00:35:51,470
because I wasn't good enough.

442
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,904
I have to tell them it was my decision
to call off the wedding.

443
00:35:56,603 --> 00:36:01,470
What if you get scolded?
You're scared of your dad.

444
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:03,837
I can take a beating.

445
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:10,338
I feel so bad that you got beat up
when you didn't do anything wrong.

446
00:36:10,937 --> 00:36:12,137
I should get going.

447
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:13,537
I'll call you.

448
00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:19,371
Make sure you apply antiseptic,
and make yourself an ice pack.

449
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:20,704
I'm sorry.

450
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:24,503
Mom.

451
00:36:25,637 --> 00:36:27,570
Hi, Chung Sik.

452
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,970
Hello.

453
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,603
Look at how you've grown.

454
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,770
Da Ran and Yun Jae didn't come with you?

455
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,271
No.

456
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:39,171
Can I see you for a second, mom?

457
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:40,603
Why?

458
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:43,970
What are they doing here?

459
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,503
They stopped by after attending
a wedding nearby.

460
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:50,704
They're waiting to for Da Ran
and Yun Jae to get here.

461
00:36:51,737 --> 00:36:53,404
I guess I can't tell you today.

462
00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:54,870
Tell me what?

463
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,570
Oh! Da Ran's big news?

464
00:36:58,404 --> 00:36:59,704
Maybe...

465
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:03,737
I know what it is.

466
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:30,704
Gil Chung Sik, did you tell them?

467
00:37:30,704 --> 00:37:32,438
I couldn't.

468
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:37,770
We have relatives visiting.

469
00:37:47,037 --> 00:37:48,570
Thanks.

470
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:53,937
Hi, Da Ran. Where's Yun Jae?

471
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:55,837
He didn't come with me.

472
00:37:56,937 --> 00:37:58,503
Hello.

473
00:37:59,204 --> 00:38:03,438
Why not? You said you had
something important to tell us.

474
00:38:03,438 --> 00:38:06,970
We'll talk about that later.

475
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,970
I wonder what it is.

476
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,171
Da Ran.

477
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,104
Are you pregnant?

478
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:14,071
Huh?

479
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:15,537
Chung Sik.

480
00:38:15,537 --> 00:38:19,037
I was going to bring it out
after Da Ran broke the news.

481
00:38:19,037 --> 00:38:20,904
What are you talking about?

482
00:38:20,904 --> 00:38:23,304
Yun Jae did what he did

483
00:38:23,304 --> 00:38:25,204
when Da Ran's pregnant?

484
00:38:25,204 --> 00:38:26,537
No.

485
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,537
No, no.

486
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:31,537
Never. No way.

487
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:33,071
Why don't you just spill the beans?

488
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:35,037
- You're getting married soon anyway.
- Mom,

489
00:38:35,037 --> 00:38:35,970
that's what not what it is.

490
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,704
Tell us exactly what's going on.

491
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:41,570
I'm going to kill that bastard.

492
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:44,404
You stay put. It's not true.

493
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:45,737
Gil Da Ran,

494
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:48,737
tell us what's going on.

495
00:38:48,737 --> 00:38:50,804
You're not pregnant?

496
00:38:50,804 --> 00:38:56,271
That wasn't the big news?
Then what is the big news?

497
00:38:56,271 --> 00:38:58,004
What did you want to tell us?

498
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:08,404
I...

499
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:11,171
I'm not marrying Yun Jae.

500
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,503
What?

501
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:26,904
You're really not getting married?

502
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:29,171
No.

503
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:32,237
I told him I couldn't marry him.

504
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,737
Why not?

505
00:39:34,737 --> 00:39:37,104
But you love him.

506
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:38,637
Did he have

507
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:40,603
a change of heart?

508
00:39:40,603 --> 00:39:44,137
No. It's me.

509
00:39:44,137 --> 00:39:45,937
I had a change of heart.

510
00:39:45,937 --> 00:39:47,837
Why?

511
00:39:49,204 --> 00:39:52,670
Yun Jae said he didn't want
to be a doctor anymore.

512
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,637
I told him he had to stay on as a doctor,

513
00:39:56,637 --> 00:39:59,970
but he wouldn't listen to me,

514
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,503
so I called off the wedding.

515
00:40:02,937 --> 00:40:08,770
You don't want to marry him, because
he doesn't want to practice medicine?

516
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,503
That's right.

517

I got married at 19

534
00:41:35,304 --> 00:41:38,171
despite my father's adamant opposition.

How could you go to these places?

Do you know

00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,637
how upsetting this must've been for Da Ran?

575
00:44:17,637 --> 00:44:20,603
He did more than just upset her.

576

He committed a mortal sin.

Get up.

there's no way I can forgive you
and that we're not getting married.

I think so.

I hope so.

She told me you had been
in an accident. Was it bad?

Are you suggesting that we get married?

667
00:52:42,637 --> 00:52:44,071
Let's do it.

668
00:52:44,071 --> 00:52:50,371
I can be neither an 18-year-old student
nor a 30-year-old doctor.

669
00:52:50,371 --> 00:52:54,904
If I'm to live like this, I need
to skip over some things.

670
00:52:54,904 --> 00:52:56,637
Skip what?

671
00:52:56,637 --> 00:52:59,737
The years that stand between
Kang Gyeong Jun and Seo Yun Jae.

672
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:02,438
I have to skip 12 years.

673
00:53:03,204 --> 00:53:06,171
I don't think it'll be too bad.

674
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:09,338
I would have had to take the college
entrance exam, do my military service,

675
00:53:09,338 --> 00:53:11,870
and get a job, but Seo Yun Jae's
already taken care of all that.

676
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:15,737
I just need to fill the gap.

677
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:18,171
Fortunately, I'm smart, so I should
be able to manage.

678
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:20,503
You don't become an adult just
by filling your mind with knowledge.

679
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:21,937
I disagree.

680
00:53:22,438 --> 00:53:25,837
I think filling my mind with knowledge
will do the trick.

681
00:53:25,837 --> 00:53:28,937
I'm merely skipping the years
I would've wasted on growing up.

682
00:53:29,904 --> 00:53:32,137
Are you really leaving?

683
00:53:32,937 --> 00:53:34,237
Yeah.

684
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,637
I'll marry you when I return.

685
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:38,904
What?

686
00:53:38,904 --> 00:53:41,503
I think I like you.

687
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,637
I'll come back new and improved

688
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,637
and marry you.

689
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:51,204
You're too young to be saying such things.

690
00:53:51,204 --> 00:53:55,104
Marry me? Give me a break.

691
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:56,904
But you said earlier that you'd marry me.

692
00:53:56,904 --> 00:54:00,870
But that was the only way I would've
been able to take care of you.

693
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:03,804
Wow. I just got a marriage proposal
from a high school kid.

694
00:54:03,804 --> 00:54:06,737
This really throws me for a loop.

695
00:54:06,737 --> 00:54:08,204
Wow.

696
00:54:12,904 --> 00:54:14,937
Is it that funny?

697
00:54:16,071 --> 00:54:17,237
Yeah, it is.

698
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:20,171
This is the funniest thing
since "Dumb and Dumber,"

699
00:54:20,171 --> 00:54:21,704
you little nursling.

700
00:54:25,237 --> 00:54:31,537
I'm sorry that a little nursling
has thrown you for a loop, Ms. Gil.

701
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:37,304
So long.

702
00:55:10,438 --> 00:55:11,970
Doctor,

703
00:55:13,937 --> 00:55:21,171
you said you had taken Gyeong Jun
out to find a way to get him back.

704
00:55:21,171 --> 00:55:23,271
But it didn't work, right?

705
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,904
If nothing works,

706
00:55:26,904 --> 00:55:30,870
we're thinking of moving him
to a long-term care facility.

707
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:34,271
You're taking care of Gyeong Jun

708
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:37,071
because of the inheritance
his mother left him, right?

709
00:55:37,071 --> 00:55:38,970
Apart from the assets you're
currently managing for him,

710
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:41,837
I understand that there's
a sizeable trust fund

711
00:55:41,837 --> 00:55:45,071
Gyeong Jun will be able to collect
in a year's time.

712
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,104
How do you know...

713
00:55:47,104 --> 00:55:51,004
I know the passcode to the trust fund.

714
00:55:51,004 --> 00:55:52,804
But how?

715
00:55:52,804 --> 00:55:54,737
Gyeong Jun's the only one who knows.

716
00:55:54,737 --> 00:55:59,404
Leave him here and take
good care of him until then.

717
00:56:01,004 --> 00:56:02,904
Please.

718
00:56:18,637 --> 00:56:22,104
He's the one who bought Gyeong Jun's house.

719
00:56:23,204 --> 00:56:27,470
He's so similar to Gyeong Jun.

720
00:56:28,204 --> 00:56:30,171
Why do I get this nagging feeling?

721
00:56:34,371 --> 00:56:36,004
What the...

722
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,004
Where's the wallet?

723
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:40,537
Let go.

724
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:42,970
Is it in here?

725
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,404
Let go.

726
00:56:54,904 --> 00:56:57,338
I'll take good care of this.

727
00:56:57,338 --> 00:56:59,404
You take good care of him here.

728
00:57:00,837 --> 00:57:02,937
I have faith in you.

729
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:25,904
Am I blushing?

730
00:57:26,537 --> 00:57:28,237
I must be losing it.

731
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:37,770
Why did I just turn around?

732
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,570
It's not like I was trying to sneak a peek.

733
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:52,304
He's gone already.

734
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:58,004
I hope he had breakfast.

735
00:57:58,537 --> 00:58:03,570
The soul is not a physical entity,

736
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:07,338
so the changeover could happen
over long distances, right?

737
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:09,804
That would be good.

738
00:58:09,804 --> 00:58:12,171
When this body returns,

739
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:15,870
will you be able to tell whether
it's adult Seo Yun Jae

740
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:18,037
or nursling Kang Gyeong Jun that's inside?

741
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:44,603
This is Kang Gyeong Jun alright.

742
00:59:21,904 --> 00:59:23,670
Yun Jae.

743
00:59:27,271 --> 00:59:29,037
Yun Jae.

744
00:59:47,737 --> 00:59:53,404
[1 year later]

745
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,537
I'm sorry I'm late.

746
01:00:09,537 --> 01:00:10,804
Hurry over.

747
01:00:12,704 --> 01:00:14,438
- Congrats on passing the exam.
- Congratulations.

748
01:00:14,438 --> 01:00:17,204
Ready.
1, 2, 3.

749
01:00:17,637 --> 01:00:18,603
I'd like a meal ticket, please.

750
01:00:18,603 --> 01:00:21,004
The groom's friends are amazing.

751
01:00:21,004 --> 01:00:23,071
We have to go to the post-wedding bash.

752
01:00:23,071 --> 01:00:25,137
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

753
01:00:25,137 --> 01:00:27,304
That should be the least of your concern.

754
01:00:27,304 --> 01:00:32,004
Look at the groom's friends. They're so hot.

755
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:35,937
I didn't have breakfast.
I'm starving. I'm off.

756
01:00:36,804 --> 01:00:38,071
Huh?

757
01:00:38,704 --> 01:00:41,704
Is that Yun Jae?

758
01:01:16,904 --> 01:01:19,004
Gyeong Jun.

759
01:01:22,104 --> 01:01:25,037
Kang Gyeong Jun.

760
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:37,371
Yun Jae?

761
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:13,637
[Big]

762
01:02:14,304 --> 01:02:15,737
So you're coming back to work?

763
01:02:15,737 --> 01:02:17,004
Soon.

764
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:18,670
I'm almost ready.

765
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,804
Did you hear anything about
Dr. Seo returning to the hospital?

766
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:25,004
Ms. Gil wasn't dumped?
She did the dumping?

767
01:02:25,004 --> 01:02:27,204
We have to make it seem like
it was you who dumped me

768
01:02:27,204 --> 01:02:29,204
so that you don't look pathetic
when we get back together.

769
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:32,271
How can two people be so similar?

770
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:33,371
Mary.

771
01:02:33,371 --> 01:02:36,737
He bought the house
Gyeong Jun used to live in?

772
01:02:36,737 --> 01:02:41,271
I'd be grateful if you could
stay by Yun Jae's side.

773
01:02:42,537 --> 01:02:44,204
This could be war.

774
01:02:44,204 --> 01:02:46,104
We could get hurt.
