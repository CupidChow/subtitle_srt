00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:10,937
Gyeong Jun,

3
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:14,304
something's wrong with me.

4
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:19,371
I don't know why

5
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:21,371
I'm so happy to see you.

6
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:32,904
What?

7
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:34,937
Um...

8
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,937
I'm going to get something to drink.
Do you want anything?

9
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:41,537
Are you thirsty? Anything at all?

10
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:46,970
You just said you were happy to see me.

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,637
And you're trying to cover it up, huh?

12
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,438
Why am I acting so weird?
I think I've gone crazy.

13
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:02,804
What? Did I ask you what
you would like to drink?

14
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:05,470
Do you want something?

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,237
I didn't say anything.

16
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:09,637
How about water? I'll get you water.

17
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,371
What's up with her?

18
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:26,870
What's wrong? You don't like the movie?

19
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:32,271
It was Chung Sik's choice.
It's really gory, isn't it?

20
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:37,271
Scared?

21
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,770
Yeah.

22
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,037
Gil Teacher,

23
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:47,837
do you like me?

24
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:55,404
I thought you didn't hear me

25
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:58,837
but I guess you did. You have great hearing.

26
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:02,670
So what I actually wanted to say was that

27
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,137
I'm just glad you came with me

28
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:05,970
to watch this really scary movie.

29
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,537
That's all.

30
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:11,737
But you had a funny look on your face.

31
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:14,004
It was as if you were trying to confess
your love or something.

32
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:16,770
No. It's nothing like that.

33
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,404
You really don't know me at all, do you?

34
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:21,837
When I crave food or something,

35
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,837
my mind just goes blank... Like this.

36
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:27,271
Like when I'm thirsty,

37
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:29,770
I'd say it like this. "Drink..."

38
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,438
It was that look.

39
00:02:32,104 --> 00:02:35,171
Are you sure you were craving
something to drink?

40
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:37,737
Weren't you craving this guy?

41
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:46,404
Honestly, I'm a bit confused these days.

42
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:49,503
I liked it when you showed up to see me.

43
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,104
That's why I said something
was wrong with me.

44
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:57,470
I promised I wouldn't fall for you,

45
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,171
and I've kept my word.

46
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:01,304
But if you keep hitting on me like this,

47
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:03,603
I'm not sure I'd be able to say no.

48
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:06,371
So please don't complicate things,

49
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:08,071
and stop lusting after me.

50
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:09,670
Lusting after you?

51
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,804
I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.

52
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,837
Oh stop it.

53
00:03:13,837 --> 00:03:15,637
- I'm just glad to see you. Come on.
- No, stop it.

54
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,204
- Oh come on.
- Stop lusting after me. I hate it!

55
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:20,570
I'll buy you anything you want. Please.

56
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,603
Are you saying I'm like that?

57
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:31,870
I don't know why I'm so happy to see you.

58
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,371
Geez.

59
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,804
I'm just so glad...

Did you come to see Kang Gyeong Jun
instead of going to the movies?

65
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,470
If you went to watch a movie you didn't like,

66
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,171
that means

67
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:30,304
you really like that person, right?

68
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,171
At the very least,

69
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:35,537
it's not a zero on the love barometer.

70

Give me an exact number.

If you had watched the movie with me,

save our Yun Jae.

Hello?

93

I just got to your hotel.

I will see you soon.

Thanks for the tea.

96

So what can I do for you?

97
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:28,704
The patient Yun Jae is caring for...

98
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:31,870
Do you mean Gyeong Jun?

99
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,304
Is he

recovering?

101

We've run countless tests,

but we don't know why he won't wake up.

103

If there are any changes in his condition,
could you please let me know?

104
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:52,804
Why don't you ask Yun Jae?

105
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:57,770
Because you are his primary care physician.

106
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,970
The patient has a special
connection with Yun Jae,

107
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,171
which is why I'm interested in him.

108
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:07,037
Can you call me from time to time?

109
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:10,404
Oh, right.

110
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:12,870

Is he... Perhaps her son?

Was Seo Yun Jae looking for someone?

114

Yun Jae?

115
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:46,438
That's what his mom said.

116
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:49,637
She said he was looking for someone
she didn't want him to find and that

117
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,338
she was relieved I've stopped looking
for that person after the accident.

118
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,770
Really?

119
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,970
I don't know anything about that.

120
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,537
Was he someone very important?

121
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:59,271
She wouldn't say. But she said

122
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,104
she hoped Yun Jae wouldn't recognize him
even if they crossed paths.

123
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:06,404
So maybe it's

124
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:09,304
the woman who used to lust after Yun Jae.

125
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:13,404
The food here's awful, right?

126
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:15,904
There's nothing to lust after.

127
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:19,137
You're right. It's not very good.

128

Is that you why you brought me here?

129
00:08:20,637 --> 00:08:23,570
Yeah. I did bring you here on purpose.

130
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:28,171
This is my uncle's restaurant.

131
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:32,271
On the outside, it looks a lot like
my mom's old restaurant in LA.

132

The decor's amazing.

134
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:40,171
That's because my mom was cool.

135
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:44,104
I saw her picture. She did look cool.

136

Oh.

140
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,470
Thanks to the contact info
you gave me last week,

141
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,804

Oh, right.

You're Gyeong Jun's teacher right?

146
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:15,438
How uncanny.

147
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:17,603
You hang out with Gyeong Jun's teacher

148
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:20,271
and Gyeong Jun's friend.

149
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:22,770
You bought Gyeong Jun's house,

150
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,237
and you have the contact info
of someone only Gyeong Jun knows.

151
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:34,470
It's very difficult to believe that
this is all just a coincidence.

152
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,404
Were you...

153
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,371
Sent here by Gyeong Jun's father?

154
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:43,338
Did he send you because

155
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:46,438
he didn't want to confront us directly?

156
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:49,338
Answer me.

157
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:54,537
Do you know Gyeong Jun's father?

158
00:10:15,404 --> 00:10:19,037
The only time I saw him
was at the hospital when

159
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:23,570
Gyeong Jun was born.
It was a very brief encounter.

160
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,503
Hui Su called him doctor
or something like that.

161
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:30,004
I asked her about him,
but she didn't tell me anything.

162
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,804
A doctor?

163
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:34,937
I'm guessing

164
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:37,603
he was probably married.

165
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,970
Hui Su really wasn't that
type of person, though.

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,404
Hyeok Su,

167
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:45,870
leave the two alone so they can
enjoy their meal.

168
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,904
Why? We're having a serious
conversation here.

169
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:49,171
Get up!

170
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,304
Enjoy your meal.

171
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:55,171
All we needed to know was that
Gyeong Jun's father hadn't sent him.

172
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,470
Why were you telling him
more than you needed to?

173
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,937
He asked, so I answered.

174
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:01,438
They seem like good people.

175
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:03,737
- You are so gullible.
- Ow!

176
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:07,704
So you knew nothing about your father?

177
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:11,470
Mom never told me anything.

178
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:17,537
If he's still alive, I'm sure
you can find him.

179
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,970
Do you think he'd be happy to see me?

180
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:24,271
The person everyone thinks is Gyeong Jun
is in a coma at the hospital.

181
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,104
So...

182
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:34,237
Could he be Yun Jae's brother?

183
00:11:36,837 --> 00:11:38,104
Jong Wu.

184
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:39,204
Yeah?

185
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:43,537
You're friends with Dr. Lee
at the DNA lab, right?

186
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,837
Yeah.

187
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,704
I was asked to do a favor.
It's an emergency.

188
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:51,271
Could you run a paternity test for me ASAP?

189
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:53,204
A paternity test?

190
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:54,271
Yeah.

191
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:03,870
So this is your dad's painting?

192
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,071
Apparently.

193
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:07,371
This is all I have though.

194
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:09,870
Even if I wanted to find him,
I wouldn't know how.

195
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,004
Is he a painter?

196
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:14,870
I don't know.

197
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,704
This painting looks familiar.

198
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,237
Really?

199
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,304
I bet this is the only one of its kind.

200
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:29,004
I doubt he had sons all over the place.

201
00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:32,171
No. I'm sure I've seen it somewhere.

202
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:33,970
I wonder where...

203
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,737
I doubt it.

204
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:38,137
Plus, I don't want to look for him.

205
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:42,603
Gyeong Jun,

206
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:47,704
just let me know when you
decide to look for your dad.

207
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:49,737
I'll help you as much as I can.

208
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,037
I'm driving,

209
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,770
I need to focus.

210
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:57,470
And this isn't me lusting after you.

211
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,970
Oh, so you admit that you were
lusting after me earlier?

212
00:13:01,804 --> 00:13:03,171
Good grief.

213
00:13:03,171 --> 00:13:04,404
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:06,603
I'm sorry, okay? But enough is enough.

215
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:12,737
You couldn't enjoy the movie

216
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:14,670
or have a nice dinner.

217
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,071
It's the last day of your vacation.
Is there anything you'd like to do?

218
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:20,837
We need to find Chinese-made goods.

219
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:23,037
I have to give presents to people at school.

220
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:25,870
Does it have to be Chinese things?

221
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,304
Wow. Made in China...

222
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,870
Be that as it may, the Eiffel Tower
makes no sense, does it?

223
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:39,870
Is there something like the
panda of the Forbidden City?

224
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:43,737
How about we paint these

225
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:46,670
and make them into pandas?

226
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,037
That's doable.

227
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:56,438
We could paint the eyes,
ears and tummy black.

228
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:58,737
No. The tummy's white. The feet are black.

229
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:02,004
No. Penguins have white tummies.
Pandas have black tummies.

230
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,737
Do you want to make a bet?

231
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:07,004
- Sure.
- You're on.

232
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:08,271
Don't cheat.

233
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:12,304
It's just a panda.

234
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,071
Was he right about the black arms?

235
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:27,904
- Just tell me if the arms are black.
- Fine.

236
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:28,804
The arms are white.

237
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:30,137
- White?
- Yeah.

238
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,804
I'm feeling generous today.
The arms are white.

239
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,271
Huh? Oh. The legs are black.

240
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,438
Perfect.

241
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,004
Just show me the tail.

242
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,804
- Here you go.
- What's this?

243
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:51,603
Did you color it or not?

244
00:15:01,104 --> 00:15:03,371
So the person who wins
gets to live like a panda.

245
00:15:03,371 --> 00:15:05,737
The winner can just eat and sleep
and not have to do anything.

246
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:09,570
I will show you how the world's
laziest panda lives.

247
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,537
So Gil Panda, let's see what you've got.

248
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:19,870
Tada!

249
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:23,670
Gil Teacher,

250
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,670
pandas don't wear black underwear.

251
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:30,104
Well, Kang Panda. Let's see what you've got.

252
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:33,937
This is a real panda.

253
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,970
We need to check.

254
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,804
Search panda.

255
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:55,470
See?

256
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:58,237
Long arms. Tank top.

257
00:15:58,237 --> 00:16:01,537
You can see the tummy, has boots,
and no underwear.

258
00:16:02,404 --> 00:16:04,904
Kang Panda wins!

259
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,071
My shoulders are sore

260
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,004
from turning polar bears into panda bears.

261
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:16,404
Give me a massage.

262
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:20,637
Come on.

263
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,371
The victorious Kang Panda demands a massage.

264
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:32,704
Oh, yes.

265
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:35,271
That feels so good.

266
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,371
Oh, yeah.

267
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,371
This is so nice. Very nice...

268
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:42,338
Now I'm thirsty.

269
00:16:42,338 --> 00:16:43,970
Go get me some water.

270
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,837
Yes, sir.

271
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:55,670
Gil Teacher,

272
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:59,104
panda with underwear isn't so bad, either.

273
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:01,503
Close it for me.

274
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:06,904
Come on. Help me.

275
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:09,171
Kang Panda does not work.

276
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:12,970
It's not a lot of work. One at a time.

277
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,570
Okay.

278
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:17,670
Hey. Make it snappy.

279
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,704
Here.

280
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,603
Geez.

281
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,237
Mary,

282
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,770
why are we at Yun Jae's house?
We were on our way to school.

283
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,404
I'm going to come every morning
and every afternoon.

284
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,570
Mary,

285
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,137
my sister just got married.

286
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,770
Visiting newlyweds unannounced

287
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,304
could bring catastrophic consequences.

288
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:51,304
No. I don't want to eat this.

289
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,937
Don't make me force you to eat it, okay?

290
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:54,670
They're fighting.

291
00:17:56,104 --> 00:17:59,937
Do you like that my sister
and her husband fighting?

292
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:03,237
Beans are really high in protein.

293
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:05,937
There are so many other foods
with tons of protein.

294
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:09,304
I don't see why I should have to eat beans
when there are other alternatives.

295
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,904
Just eat it. I got up at the crack of dawn

296
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:13,970
to prepare those beans for you.

297
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,804
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

298
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,870
I'm not eating this. Never ever.

299
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,770
I have to run. My mom wants to see me.

300
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,404
Just eat it.

301
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:25,837
He really hates beans, and if she keeps

302
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:29,004
making him do things he doesn't like,
her score will go down, right?

303
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:34,570
How did you know my brother-in-law
doesn't like beans?

304
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:53,937
Ugh...

305
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:04,837
He's eating the beans...

306
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:08,371
He listens to my sister.

307
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:13,304
Mary,

308
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:14,804
what's wrong?

309
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:18,304
If you eat what you hate for someone,

310
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,338
what would that person's score be?

311
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:22,104
Around

312
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:24,670
90%?

313
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,937
Mary,

314
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:28,837
for you, I could eat carrots,

315
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:31,204
which I hate more than death.

316
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,704
If she's 90%,

317
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,804
then there's only 10% left.

318
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:48,603
Mary,

319
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:50,770
don't tell me

320
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:58,837
you have a crush on Dr. Seo.

321
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,237
Yes, mom?

322
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:08,570
Why did you call me?

323
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,904
Your mother-in-law's returning
to the States soon, right?

324
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:14,004
When you go see her, give this to her.

325
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,503
Mother-in-law?

326
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:17,371
Oh. Yun Jae's mom?

327
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:18,371
Goodness gracious!

328
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:21,004
You're married. How can you
refer to her as Yun Jae's mom?

329
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:23,537
She's your mother-in-law, and
you're her daughter-in-law.

330
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:26,371
Oh, right.

331
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:30,970
Yun Jae is her only child.

332
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,837
You have to be good to her, okay?

333
00:20:48,237 --> 00:20:53,004
90% is a really high score, isn't it?

334
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,837
Did you get a 90?

335
00:20:56,837 --> 00:21:00,637
You can get a 100% if you work
just a little bit harder.

336
00:21:02,338 --> 00:21:04,503
Why? What's wrong?

337
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:09,704
You also wish that Gyeong Jun would
return to his own body, right?

338
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,271
Yes, of course.

339
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,970
You don't like it that Gyeong Jun's
in there, right?

340
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,438
You do want Yun Jae back, right?

341
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:26,204
Scold Gyeong Jun if he says
he likes things the way they are.

342
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:29,371
Scold him more sternly than
you did over the beans.

343
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,804
Tell him he has to return to his own body.

344
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:35,071
You can do it!

345
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,637
Sure.

346
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:50,570
It's only right that Gyeong Jun
return to his own body.

347
00:21:54,537 --> 00:21:57,637
Ms. Gil?

348
00:21:57,637 --> 00:21:59,704
Thank you for the present.

349
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,004
Please don't mention it.

350
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:03,804
Now that you're married,

351
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:06,237
do you want to take on
an intellectual project?

352
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,503
Pardon?

353
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:09,904
Please write a piece for the
"Teacher of the Month" section

354
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:12,804
of the school newspaper.

355
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:32,770
Gyeong Jun,

356
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,570
you're still thinking about
your dad, aren't you?

357
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:42,271
Don't you think the fact
that he gave you this

358
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:45,503
mean he wants you to
come look for him?

359
00:22:46,371 --> 00:22:48,037
You know Jumong, right?

360
00:22:48,037 --> 00:22:52,237
King Yuri found his father with an artifact
his father had left for him.

361
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:56,237
If my father were a king,

362
00:22:56,237 --> 00:22:59,171
I'd look for him, too.

363
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,670
Look at the painting.

364
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,970
If he's a painter as you said he might be,

365
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,371
he couldn't be making a decent living.

366
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:09,304
And even if he paints as a hobby,
I don't even like his style.

367
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,071
Come on. Angels?

368
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:14,171
So you don't want to look for him?

369
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:18,438
If he comes looking for me,
I'd meet with him,

370
00:23:19,137 --> 00:23:21,704
but I'm not setting out to search for him.

371
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:25,470
Haven't you ever thought
of meeting your father?

372
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,737
I was curious about him, but I didn't
feel the need to find him.

373
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:33,438
I was perfectly fine just with my mom.

374
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:49,371
Yun Jae's mom is Gyeong Jun's
biological mother.

375
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:57,470
Should I tell Yun Jae about this?

376
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,737
It seems Yun Jae grew up
mostly with his mom, too.

377
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:04,570
His parents don't really get along.

378
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,338
I know they don't live together.

379
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:10,837
I never saw the dad even
when I was in the States.

380
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:14,737
I think they just meet up
once a year, and that's it.

381
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,271
Do you remember how Yun Jae's
passcode is 0624?

382
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:21,338
Right. 0624.

383
00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:22,670
Yeah.

384
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,637
They were having a family gathering
on June 24.

385
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:27,171
But what day is that?

386
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:28,204
Wedding anniversary?

387
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:31,171
They meet once a year. I doubt they'd
meet on their wedding anniversary.

388
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:32,804
I don't know.

389
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:39,104
Does 0624 remind you
of something else though?

390
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:42,071
Should I be reminded of something else?

391
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,904
No. Never mind.

392
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:47,304
I knew you wouldn't remember.

393
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,104
Why? Is it something important?

394
00:24:50,104 --> 00:24:52,637
No. Just don't make any more beans.

395
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:55,438
0624. June 24th.

396
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:58,171
I told her specifically
that it's my birthday.

397
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,870
She's so dumb.

398
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,770
How could she forget my birthday?

399
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,470
How did she even become a teacher?

400
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:09,004
0624?

401
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:10,770
What was it?

402
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:14,404
Does he want it to be a "no-beans" day?

403
00:25:17,104 --> 00:25:21,237
I remember Yun Jae saying something
when he told me his password...

404
00:25:21,237 --> 00:25:23,071
0624...

405
00:25:24,037 --> 00:25:26,071
Oh, right.

406
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:27,737
Gyeong Jun.

407
00:25:29,704 --> 00:25:31,304
Why? You remembered?

408
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:34,704
Yeah. I just remembered I had
something to do by June 24th.

409
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,970
What is it?

410
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,137
I have to write a piece
for the school newspaper.

411
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:42,037
School newspaper?

412
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:44,371
Are Yun Jae's books here?

413
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,603
I removed all his stuff.
Is there something left?

414
00:25:49,004 --> 00:25:50,603
I found it.

415
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:52,770
What is it?

416
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,304
It's a piece Yun Jae wrote for teens.

417
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,603
I'm going to use it as reference.

418
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:58,104
Reference?

419
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:07,970
The vice principal told me to write
about why I became a teacher,

420
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,937
and Yun Jae's piece is about why

421
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,570
he wanted to become a doctor.

422
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,345
[Why I Became a Teacher
Meeting the 18-Year-Old Me]

423
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:20,071
You're planning to plagiarize.

424
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:23,071
No. I'm just going to use it as reference.

425
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:27,171
"Meeting the 18-Year-Old Me."

426
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:29,870
What a boring and uninspiring title.

427
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,404
You can learn what Yun Jae thought about

428
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:33,870
when he was your age.

429
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,438
It's a very heart-warming piece.

430
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:38,304
A book is not a hot-pack.
It doesn't warm anything.

431
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:48,204
I decided to become a doctor when I was 18.

432
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:54,537
I realized at age 18 that
my life was made possible

433
00:26:54,537 --> 00:26:58,404
because of the warm helping hand
that was extended to me.

434
00:27:02,004 --> 00:27:06,904
So I wanted to become someone
who could help others as well.

435
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:10,037
I came to believe that if I
reached out with sincerity,

436
00:27:10,037 --> 00:27:15,071
I could pass on the salvation
I had received to others.

437
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:19,438
I always go back to the
18-year-old me and ask,

438
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:25,970
"Am I doing well?"
"Is my hand still warm?"

439
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,870
All you need to do is change
"doctor" to "teacher."

440
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:35,503
Right?

441
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:37,704
That's why this came to mind.

442
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:39,171
So you were going to plagiarize.

443
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:42,603
I also decided to become
a teacher when I turned 18.

444
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:45,970
What about you? What do you want to be?

445
00:27:46,737 --> 00:27:50,271
What do you think I should be?

446
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:52,171
You're asking me?

447
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,503
Yun Jae came to an epiphany
when someone held his hand, right?

448
00:27:56,503 --> 00:27:58,637
Why don't you enlighten me?

449
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:00,603
Like you could be whatever I tell you to be.

450
00:28:00,603 --> 00:28:01,870
But of course.

451
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,870
I can be anything, so tell me

452
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,937
the future you envision for me.

453
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:09,704
I'll give it some thought.

454
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:12,004
I'll mull over what your future
should look like.

455
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,770
While you're at it, think about
the near future as well.

456
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,570
June 24th.

457
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:25,537
Why does he keep mentioning that date?

458
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:29,470
Oh, right.

459
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,537
It's Gyeong Jun's birthday.

460
00:28:36,937 --> 00:28:39,338
So he's going to be a year older.

461
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:43,804
Gyeong Jun's future.

462
00:28:47,704 --> 00:28:50,537
So you're asking me whether
I witnessed Gyeong Jun's birth?

463
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:52,338
Yes.

464
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:57,470
And are you sure the deceased woman
is really Gyeong Jun's mother?

465
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,071
I was wondering whether
he might have been adopted.

466
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,137
I saw her pregnant with my very eyes.

467
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:08,470
And my husband got Gyeong Jun's
birth certificate on June 24th.

468
00:29:09,438 --> 00:29:11,837
Why do you ask?

469
00:29:12,537 --> 00:29:14,470
Is something wrong?

470
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,637
No.

471
00:29:16,637 --> 00:29:20,004
I was just checking
the patient's family history.

If the test result is accurate,

474
00:29:36,737 --> 00:29:39,970
Yun Jae's mother is also
Gyeong Jun's biological mother.

475
00:29:41,104 --> 00:29:44,404
But she has a different birth mother?

476
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:48,704
Perhaps a surrogate?

477
00:30:11,371 --> 00:30:13,970
She still doesn't recognize you, does she?

478

Be strong. Don't give up.

479
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:19,670
If you say hello first,
she'll get the upper hand.

480

And that would make it obvious
I had had a crush on her, right?

I've always kept my dignity in check
by not making my feelings obvious.

It's a very sad story.

489
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:09,171
Wow. You are very intellectual, Mr. Kang.

490
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:14,204
After having lost Jeong Hye
to that old, decrepit teacher,

491
00:31:15,271 --> 00:31:20,670
I started developing a special sense
of connection with An Tak Gap.

492
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,970
An Tak Gap?

493
00:31:25,304 --> 00:31:27,904
When the cell phone first came out,

494
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:31,537
I cried.

495
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:36,470
The dormant An Tak Gap in me

496
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,271
suddenly awoke.

497
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:48,271
If only I had had a cell phone

498
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:50,338
when I was supposed to have
my first date with Jeong Hye...

499
00:31:50,338 --> 00:31:52,870
Only if I could have called to let her know

500
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:58,470
I was going to be late. Just one call,

501
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:03,371
and Jeong Hye would've waited for me.

502
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,937
Jeong Hye!

503
00:32:11,271 --> 00:32:14,137
How sad.

504
00:32:14,438 --> 00:32:19,137
Listening to you just awoke the An Tak Gap

505
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:23,037
inside me as well.

506
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:27,338
When the GPS first came out,

507
00:32:27,338 --> 00:32:30,304
I couldn't believe it.

508
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,970
I'm very bad with directions, you see.

509
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,570
If only I had a GPS,

510
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,371
I would've been able to find my way

511
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:43,371
to see Min Gyu.

512
00:32:44,804 --> 00:32:47,271
It was so unfortunate.

513
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:51,271
How sad.

514
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:54,503
Only if Jeong Hye would recognize me,

515
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:58,770
the An Tak Gap in me could be placated.

516
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,470
Why can't she recognize me?

517
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:05,837
Love is cruel.

518
00:33:06,603 --> 00:33:09,104
The one who loves more

519
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:15,171
always ends up suffering

520
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:17,271
and getting hurt.

521
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:19,037
Oh...

522
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,670
What do kids these days
like as birthday presents?

523
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,071
Who's it for? Is it Chung Sik's birthday?

524
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:28,837
No. He's actually a lot smarter than
Chung Sik, so I don't know what to get.

525
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:31,737
You sound like you're getting
your lover a present.

526
00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:33,338
Just get whatever.

527
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,670
No, I can't.

528
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,371
I have high expectations for his future,
and I want to express that somehow.

529
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:43,037
I want the present to inspire him.

530
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:44,804
I wonder what I could get him.

531
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:47,004
Wow. How deep.

532
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:50,271
A gift that expresses all those sentiments?

533
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,037
That's really hard.

534
00:33:53,338 --> 00:33:54,570
Huh?

535
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:58,037
I have to go. Talk to you later.

536
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,304
Vice Principal Kim!

537
00:34:01,804 --> 00:34:03,404
What should I get?

538
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:04,637
A book?

539
00:34:05,637 --> 00:34:07,071
Ms. Gil,

540
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:09,603
I heard Gyeong Jun went to his uncle's
and asked about his dad.

541
00:34:09,603 --> 00:34:10,603
Yeah.

542
00:34:10,603 --> 00:34:14,271
But Gyeong Jun has no desire to look for him.

543
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:16,570
He has to find him though.

544
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,137
The only adult Gyeong Jun can rely on
is you, which is why he's with you,

545
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:22,870
but if he finds his dad, then you
have no reason to stick around.

546
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,537
And it'd be a load off for you too, right?

547
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:26,637
I don't know.

548
00:34:26,637 --> 00:34:28,637
I actually don't mind

549
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:32,937
being with Gyeong Jun.

550
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:35,470
Can you be with him forever and ever though?

551
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,970
No, right?

552
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,470
Once he finds his father,
Gyeong Jun will not be alone

553
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,171
even if he returns to his body, so you
don't have to worry about him anymore.

554
00:34:45,804 --> 00:34:50,237
I will find Gyeong Jun's father
for the sake of our future.

555
00:35:00,603 --> 00:35:03,037
Gyeong Jun,

556
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:06,438
you must find your father.

557
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:11,570
You must find your father.

558
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,137
What for? He's a stranger to me.

559
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:17,837
You can find him first,
and then see what he's like.

560
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:21,570
In your current state, you can find him
without revealing your true self.

561
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,837
It's the perfect disguise.

562
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:27,503
Would it really help to find him?

563
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:30,137
It would help Ms. Gil.

564
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:33,438
She'll no longer be burdened by
the responsibility of taking care of you

565
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:35,937
if you find your father.

566
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:38,237
Why do you think I'm a burden on Gil Teacher?

567
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:42,570
Technically, she's living
for free at my place.

568
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:46,404
In any case, Ms. Gil does feel burdened.

569
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:49,037
She's not saying anything because
she's too nice and a little slow,

570
00:35:49,037 --> 00:35:51,304
but I'm sure she's burdened.

571
00:35:58,338 --> 00:36:00,338
Am I that big a burden?

572
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,071
Maybe I shouldn't have said
I'd be a lazy panda.

573
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:10,338
Let's do it together.

574
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:20,937
She's not telling me,

575
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:23,503
but I must be a burden on her.

576
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:28,404
She's right.

577
00:36:28,404 --> 00:36:31,304
I'm only interfering if I can't
stay by his side forever.

578
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:35,904
It's no better than lusting after him.

579
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,937
I should let him go.

580
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:43,037
I should stop thinking about

581
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:45,570
Gyeong Jun's future and start thinking

582
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,171
about my future with Yun Jae.

583
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:52,770
What did we do on Yun Jae's
birthday last year?

584
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:55,570
What was it?

585
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,338
Oh, right. Biking.

586
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:06,304
We were going to go biking together.

587
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:10,737
He was late, so I was waiting with the bikes.

588
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:17,603
We only had the bikes for 2 hours,

589
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,870
but we never even got to ride them.

590
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:33,503
I used to be the kind of woman

591
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:36,537
who'd wait for him in the cold for 2 hours.

592
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:38,537
Don't you

593
00:37:38,537 --> 00:37:40,438
forget that, Da Ran.

594
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:41,537
Go, go!

595
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,338
Go, go!

596
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:47,071
Go, go, go!

597
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:55,271
How annoying.

598
00:37:58,104 --> 00:38:00,171
Annoying?

599
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:06,071
Am I annoying her?

600
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,470
The face is Yun Jae's,

601
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,237
but why do I keep seeing Gyeong Jun?

602
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:35,770
It's nice that the house is so spacious,

603
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,537
but it's burdensome to clean.

604
00:38:39,804 --> 00:38:41,737
Burdensome?

605
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:44,970
Give it to me.

606
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,470
It's fine.

607
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,237
This is nothing!

608
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,904
I can do it. Really.

609
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:53,570
But you decided to be a panda
today and not do anything.

610
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,537
No.

611
00:38:54,537 --> 00:38:57,770
Kang Panda will work today
so Gil Panda can just relax.

612
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,104
Just chill out on the couch.

613
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,570
Really?

614
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,637
Yeah, really. This is nothing.

615
00:39:04,637 --> 00:39:06,603
I can do this really quickly.

616
00:39:07,603 --> 00:39:10,770
Also, the lawn needs to be mowed.

617
00:39:11,304 --> 00:39:13,603
Does the thought of mowing
the lawn burden you?

618
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:15,371
I'll mow the lawn then.

619
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:17,970
I'll make sure the lawn is nice and trim.

620
00:39:18,537 --> 00:39:19,870
Really?

621
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,704
Then I'm just going to prepare dinner.
I should get the grocer...

622
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:22,704
No, no.

623
00:39:22,704 --> 00:39:24,537
I'll go get the groceries.

624
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:29,404
Gil Teacher, I used to manage on my own.

625
00:39:29,404 --> 00:39:32,637
You don't have to take care of me.
I'm fine on my own.

626
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:34,670
Don't be burdened. Go inside and chill.

627
00:39:35,404 --> 00:39:38,204
I'll go get all the groceries.
Don't feel burdened.

628
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:54,870
I guess Gyeong Jun will be fine without me.

629
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,704
Da Ran, stop thinking about Gyeong Jun.

630
00:40:03,704 --> 00:40:07,937
What's important is your past with Yun Jae.

631
00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:23,970
Gil Teacher, where are you going?

632
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:24,804
Oh.

633
00:40:24,804 --> 00:40:27,371
I just need some fresh air

634
00:40:28,537 --> 00:40:30,770
and do some thinking.

635
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,570
By your self? Should I come with you?

636
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,804
No. You don't have to come.

637
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:41,037
I'm going to have a chat with Gil Da Ran,
the woman who knows of patience.

638
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:46,737
Okay. I'll clean the house,
do all the laundry,

639
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:48,404
and also prepare dinner.

640
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:52,570
You can just go and do
whatever you need to do.

641
00:41:41,037 --> 00:41:44,770
Where is the bench where
I waited for Yun Jae?

642
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,004
They all look the same.

643
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:00,637
God! I'm good at everything I do!

644
00:42:00,637 --> 00:42:03,071
Maybe this is too clean.

645
00:42:03,071 --> 00:42:06,271
Gil Teacher should see this
so she doesn't feel burdened.

646
00:42:06,271 --> 00:42:07,271
Gyeong Jun!

647
00:42:08,603 --> 00:42:09,804
Hey, watch it.

648
00:42:09,804 --> 00:42:11,503
I just cleaned the floors spic and span.

649
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,171
Gyeong Jun,

650
00:42:13,171 --> 00:42:16,137
I just found some information
about your father.

651
00:42:27,104 --> 00:42:28,737
Dr. Seo,

652
00:42:28,737 --> 00:42:31,271
would you like to stop by to see
Mrs. Seo at the hotel?

653
00:42:32,137 --> 00:42:33,537
No.

654
00:42:33,537 --> 00:42:37,137
I need to see Professor Park first
at the university.

655
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,404
So my dad and your mom
flew all the way to New York

656
00:42:43,404 --> 00:42:46,704
just to see this person's exhibition.

657
00:42:48,104 --> 00:42:49,603
It's him.

658
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:51,937
Really?

659
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:55,204
Your mom used to refer to your father
as doctor, right?

660
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:58,603
He used to be your mom's
instructor back in art school.

661
00:42:58,603 --> 00:43:00,037
Makes perfect sense, right?

662
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,304
Min Gyu.

663
00:43:08,104 --> 00:43:09,204
Hey,

664
00:43:09,204 --> 00:43:10,970
you've really come.

665
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,870
- Long time no see.
- Welcome.

666
00:43:16,104 --> 00:43:20,071
Last year, your son Yun Jae came to see me.

667
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:22,371
So it's your turn this year?

668
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:27,271
Yun Jae came to see you?

669
00:43:28,137 --> 00:43:31,470
He asked me about Hui Su
and Hui Su's son.

670
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:37,404
So have you found the son?

671
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,237
Not yet.

672
00:43:43,237 --> 00:43:44,970
I'm all set.

673
00:43:46,004 --> 00:43:50,071
But we should look for your father.
It's for your future.

674
00:43:50,071 --> 00:43:53,937
My dad is not the person I want by my side.

675
00:43:54,603 --> 00:43:56,704
Then who do you want by your side?

676
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:59,338
I can be whatever others want me to be,

677
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:01,870
but I can't make others
be what I want them to be.

678
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,470
So I'm fine being alone.

679
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,670
How about me?

680
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,937
Let me be with you.

681
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:10,271
I just cleaned this place, so don't
mess things up. You should go.

682
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:12,637
I have to show this place to her
in this condition.

683
00:44:12,637 --> 00:44:14,304
Ow.

684
00:44:14,304 --> 00:44:18,737
I have a headache from all
the information gathering.

685
00:44:18,737 --> 00:44:20,037
I need to get some rest.

686
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:21,537
Hey, Jang Mary.

687
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:24,304
Don't try to sneak your way in.

688
00:44:26,537 --> 00:44:31,870
If I leave my things here one at a time

689
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:38,237
and use this room like it was mine,

690
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:43,338
it will eventually become my room.

691
00:44:50,304 --> 00:44:52,137
Where was it?

692
00:45:11,271 --> 00:45:14,704
I'm pretty sure it was this park.

693
00:45:14,704 --> 00:45:16,737
I remember waiting somewhere around here.

694
00:45:16,737 --> 00:45:20,603
It was really cold, but I was so giddy.

695
00:45:20,603 --> 00:45:22,570
Come on. Think.

696
00:45:24,171 --> 00:45:26,470
Where was it?

697
00:45:30,204 --> 00:45:35,737
I want that same giddiness

698
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:38,970
I got from waiting for the person I loved.

699
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:55,404
Why can't I feel the same way anymore?

700
00:46:09,137 --> 00:46:10,371
What?

701
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:12,104
Where are you?

702
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,204
I told you I had something to do at the park.

703
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:16,937
I'm at the park, too. Where are you?

704
00:46:16,937 --> 00:46:18,670
Huh?

705
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,304
You're here?

706
00:46:20,304 --> 00:46:21,970
Why are you here?

707
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,137
I came to find you.

708
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,004
Where are you?

709
00:46:26,004 --> 00:46:29,603
Here?

710
00:46:29,603 --> 00:46:32,237
I'm in front of the long tarp.

711
00:46:32,237 --> 00:46:35,237
Okay. I'll be right over.

712
00:46:39,204 --> 00:46:40,837
Why did he come here?

713
00:46:45,171 --> 00:46:48,171
How's he going to find me?

714
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:14,537
My heart's

715
00:47:14,537 --> 00:47:17,204
beating fast.

716
00:47:21,137 --> 00:47:24,404
Just like when I was waiting
for the person I loved.

717
00:47:28,537 --> 00:47:31,037
What's wrong with me?

718
00:47:31,037 --> 00:47:35,870
I'm just waiting for Gyeong Jun.

719
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:02,304
I must be losing it.

720
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,204
Where are you?

721
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,237
I'm not there anymore.

722
00:48:14,237 --> 00:48:16,271
What? You left?

723
00:48:17,237 --> 00:48:19,470
I told you to wait.

724
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:22,503
You're not the one who

725
00:48:22,503 --> 00:48:24,870
I should be waiting for,

726
00:48:27,837 --> 00:48:30,804
so don't look for me.

727
00:48:32,104 --> 00:48:36,137
I can't see you right now.

728
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:46,637
Okay.

729
00:48:46,637 --> 00:48:48,837
I won't find you then.

730
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:52,037
I'm leaving.

731
00:49:11,904 --> 00:49:14,004
Gyeong Jun.

732
00:49:14,004 --> 00:49:16,404
Please leave.

733
00:49:16,404 --> 00:49:19,371
I'm waiting right now.

734
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,904
And you have to leave.

735
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:08,004
So the two kids in this painting...

736
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,570
Are they both your sons?

737
00:50:13,204 --> 00:50:17,237
If one is Yun Jae, the other one

738
00:50:18,603 --> 00:50:20,937
is Hui Su's child?

739
00:51:04,237 --> 00:51:05,438
Excuse me...

740
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:07,204
He moved again.

741
00:51:07,204 --> 00:51:08,537
I saw him move this time.

742
00:51:08,537 --> 00:51:09,537
- Really?
- Yes. I'm sure.

743
00:51:09,537 --> 00:51:10,737
Hurry.

744
00:51:11,104 --> 00:51:12,670
Gyeong Jun!

745
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:14,304
Gyeong Jun!

746
00:51:18,037 --> 00:51:19,304
Gyeong Jun!

747
00:51:19,304 --> 00:51:21,770
Gyeong Jun. Gyeong Jun.

748
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,704
Kang Gyeong Jun!

749
00:51:31,104 --> 00:51:32,904
I found it!

750
00:51:59,371 --> 00:52:02,304
Why doesn't it feel the same?

751
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:06,137
I don't get it.

752
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:14,537
Hey, Mary.

753
00:52:14,537 --> 00:52:15,737
Ms. Gil,

754
00:52:15,737 --> 00:52:18,670
Gyeong Jun moved again.

755
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,371
Are you with him?

756
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:22,304
Is Gyeong Jun okay?

757
00:52:22,304 --> 00:52:25,071
Is he back in his own body?

758
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:26,770
Huh?

759
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:30,770
I'm on my way. I'll be right there.

760
00:52:36,271 --> 00:52:37,937
So...

761
00:52:39,204 --> 00:52:42,304
Is Gyeong Jun leaving?

762
00:53:00,503 --> 00:53:01,804
Gyeong Jun!

763
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,004
Gyeong Jun!

764
00:53:04,004 --> 00:53:05,570
Gyeong Jun!

765
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,470
Kang Gyeong Jun.

766
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:41,970
Gil Teacher,

767
00:53:48,837 --> 00:53:50,637
it's me.

768
00:53:52,937 --> 00:53:55,438
I...

769
00:53:58,537 --> 00:54:01,071
I think I was just in my body again.

770
00:54:05,271 --> 00:54:07,171
I'm sorry but

771
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:12,004
Seo Yun Jae's not back yet.

772
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:58,104
It didn't happen this time either.

773
00:54:58,104 --> 00:55:00,037
It's the same here.

774
00:55:00,503 --> 00:55:02,071
How are you?

775
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,837
I felt sick.

776
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:11,104
I felt nauseous and dizzy.

777
00:55:12,171 --> 00:55:14,438
It felt horrible.

778
00:55:19,271 --> 00:55:21,737
The switch-over didn't happen,

779
00:55:21,737 --> 00:55:23,704
and I all I felt was sick.

780
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:26,704
Where is Ms. Gil?

781
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:29,670
I think she's very disappointed.

782
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,171
She didn't say a word and went into her room.

783
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:52,804
I think I've gone crazy.

784
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:57,137
I've really gone crazy.

785
00:56:40,937 --> 00:56:42,603
Seo Yun Jae,

786
00:56:44,104 --> 00:56:46,204
please come back.

787
00:57:03,204 --> 00:57:06,438
Da Ran is sick, so she can't come in today.

788
00:57:06,438 --> 00:57:08,970
She enjoyed herself on her honeymoon,

789
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:11,404
and now she's enjoying herself on sick leave.

790
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,537
Is she very ill?

791
00:57:18,704 --> 00:57:20,037
I don't know.

792
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:24,837
I didn't know you were the type
to worry about other people.

793
00:57:27,837 --> 00:57:29,104
- Hello.
- Hello, ma'am.

794
00:57:29,104 --> 00:57:30,237
This is Toma Capital.

795
00:57:30,237 --> 00:57:33,304
I'll be seeing you tonight, right?

796
00:57:33,304 --> 00:57:34,570
Yes.

797
00:57:35,438 --> 00:57:37,503
Really?

798
00:57:37,503 --> 00:57:41,071
I like everything. That sounds great.

799
00:57:41,071 --> 00:57:43,371
We have low-interest loans for you today.

800
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,570
I'm going to report you to the police.

801
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,171
Don't ever call me again.

802
00:58:08,438 --> 00:58:10,204
Do you feel sick?

803
00:58:10,204 --> 00:58:12,537
Let's go to the hospital.

804
00:58:12,537 --> 00:58:15,171
There's no need.

805
00:58:15,737 --> 00:58:19,071
I'm the one who got sick
from changing bodies.

806
00:58:19,071 --> 00:58:21,770
Why are you the one who's sick?

807
00:58:22,503 --> 00:58:25,104
Are you that disappointed?

808
00:58:33,438 --> 00:58:36,904
I'm disappointed in myself.

809
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:40,503
This time,

810
00:58:40,503 --> 00:58:42,837
it was about 30 seconds longer
than the last time.

811
00:58:42,837 --> 00:58:46,704
At this rate, we'll be making
a complete switch soon.

812
00:58:47,371 --> 00:58:49,704
Don't be so disappointed.

813
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:53,770
Gyeong Jun,

814
00:58:54,704 --> 00:58:59,637
if you return to your body,

815
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:04,603
do you think

816
00:59:08,804 --> 00:59:13,037
I'll be able to let you go?

817
00:59:15,338 --> 00:59:18,104
Am I

818
00:59:18,104 --> 00:59:20,503
such a burden on you?

819
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:31,804
Just focus on getting better.

820
00:59:32,537 --> 00:59:34,304
I'll get you something from the pharmacy.

821
00:59:43,171 --> 00:59:47,204
You told me to let you know
of any changes, right?

822
00:59:47,204 --> 00:59:49,371
Is there a problem?

823
00:59:50,037 --> 00:59:53,503
You must be very worried about him.

824
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:56,570
Do you want to see him in person?

825
00:59:57,171 --> 00:59:59,704
No.

826
01:00:00,371 --> 01:00:02,171
Why not?

827
01:00:02,171 --> 01:00:04,204
Is he not

828
01:00:04,704 --> 01:00:08,237
your son?

829
01:00:09,338 --> 01:00:13,570
The child Yun Jae was
looking for is Gyeong Jun, isn't it?

830
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:17,004
It's because he is his brother, right?

831
01:00:22,503 --> 01:00:25,371
When Yun Jae was 12,

832
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:28,171
he became very ill.

833
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:34,204
He needed his brother if he was to survive.

834
01:00:34,637 --> 01:00:36,271
But...

835
01:00:36,271 --> 01:00:39,937
I was not able to have children anymore.

836
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:47,438
So my husband and his lover

837
01:00:47,438 --> 01:00:49,503
had a child instead.

838
01:00:50,237 --> 01:00:55,704
That child is Gyeong Jun.

839
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:02,204
Gyeong Jun came into this world
to save my Yun Jae,

840
01:01:03,037 --> 01:01:08,470
so I can't say he's really my child.

841
01:01:08,937 --> 01:01:12,137
To save a child,

842
01:01:12,137 --> 01:01:16,338
the other child descends
and holds out his hand.

843
01:01:19,371 --> 01:01:20,904
When the accident occurred,

844
01:01:20,904 --> 01:01:24,371
it was Yun Jae who saved Gyeong Jun.

845
01:01:25,637 --> 01:01:30,137
So they were destined to save one another...

846
01:01:30,137 --> 01:01:33,904
They met without knowing each other.

847
01:01:33,904 --> 01:01:37,937
Shouldn't we tell them?

848
01:01:37,937 --> 01:01:40,470
Please stay out of it.

849
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:46,271
I do not want the two to cross paths again.

850
01:01:48,637 --> 01:01:52,704
Were you planning to never see him again?

851
01:01:52,704 --> 01:01:54,438
Frankly,

852
01:01:54,438 --> 01:01:58,371
I didn't think I'd have to see him again

853
01:01:58,371 --> 01:02:04,237
unless Yun Jae relapsed.

854
01:02:09,804 --> 01:02:12,603
Is it about salvation?

855
01:02:13,704 --> 01:02:19,503
Salvation requires love and sacrifice.

856
01:02:21,937 --> 01:02:27,470
He was created for the sole
purpose of saving Yun Jae.

857
01:02:27,804 --> 01:02:32,937
If he never wakes up and disappears,

858
01:02:32,937 --> 01:02:34,470
what then?

859
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:03,071
Why are you here?

860
01:03:07,404 --> 01:03:10,071
I'm better now.

861
01:03:11,338 --> 01:03:13,837
Are you okay?

862
01:03:17,438 --> 01:03:20,438
I'm fine now,

863
01:03:21,237 --> 01:03:25,704
but it'll hurt if I'm to return
to my own body, right?

864
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:34,037
Going back to where we belong

865
01:03:34,037 --> 01:03:37,338
will be a very painful process for us all.

866
01:03:40,237 --> 01:03:42,171
Gil Teacher,

867
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:50,503
if it burdens you, don't worry about me.

868
01:03:51,371 --> 01:03:54,037
I can manage on my own,

869
01:03:54,037 --> 01:03:56,637
and when I do return to my own body,

870
01:03:57,304 --> 01:04:00,237
I will disappear from your life.

871
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:13,603
You will never ever

872
01:04:13,603 --> 01:04:15,404
have to see me again.
