00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,680
[Episode 15]

2
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,100
Seo Yun Jae,

3
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,050
have you been waiting for me

4
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,950
just as I had first met you in the water?

5
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,250
When I return to my own body,

6
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,380
will my memory of what happened disappear?

7
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,500
If I take your hand,

8
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,410
I'll wake up a happy kid

9
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,950
who doesn't remember anything, right?

10
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,310
Gyeong Jun.

11
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,120
Gyeong Jun,

12
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,370
It's you, Gyeong Jun, right?

13
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,210
Gyeong Jun.

14
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,780
This body's not awake yet.

15
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,190
Is that still you, Gyeong Jun?

16
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,810
Is that you, Dr. Seo?

17
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,680
Gyeong Jun.

18
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,680
If I go back,

19
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,270
I will make someone miserable.

20
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,370
Give me

21
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,820
a little bit more time.

22
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,930
It's you, Gyeong Jun, right?

23
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,690
Why aren't you saying anything?
I know it's you, Gyeong Jun.

24
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,950
You haven't returned to your body, right?

25
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,080
Were you in a lot of pain this time too?

26
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,510
Yes. It's still Kang Gyeong Jun,

27
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,220
Ms. Gil.

28
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,110
What's wrong?

29
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,590
Gyeong Jun.

30
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,380
Why am I lying down there?

31
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,920
What happened to me?

32
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,350
Yun Jae lost consciousness briefly
during the blood collection.

33
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,920
But he wasn't out for long.
He's with Gyeong Jun right now.

34
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,040
What about Gyeong Jun?

35
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,640
He's fine.

36
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,190
We're still collecting his blood.

37
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,780
We'll be done in a couple of hours.

38
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,680
You can't remember anything
that happened after the accident?

39
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,030
No.

40
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,170
Are you sure?

41
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,220
There was an accident, I woke up,
and this is the state I'm in.

42
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,590
This is absurd. Just a while ago...

43
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,950
Can you explain

44
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,680
this absurd situation, Mary? What happened?

45
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,310
You were in an accident with Dr. Seo Yun Jae.

46
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,380
Your bodies changed then.

47
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,370
Seo Yun Jae?

48
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,240
The doctor to whom Ms. Gil's engaged?

49
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,540
You really don't remember Yun Jae?

50
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,090
So I've gone into Seo Yun Jae's
body, right, Mary?

51
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,880
Yeah. You've been in Dr. Seo's body
since the accident.

52
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,150
You even married Ms. Gil in his place.

53
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,480
Really, Gil Teacher?

54
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,640
And Dr. Seo's your brother.

55
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,820
You found your biological parents.

56
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,200
So much happened. Do you
really not remember anything?

57
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,800
No. I don't remember a thing.

58
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,740
There they are.

59
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,190
They're your parents.

60
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,600
They don't know there was a switch.

61
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,370
They think you're Dr. Seo.

62
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,910
Say hello.

63
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,410
Yun Jae,

64
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,140
we heard you had passed out.
Are you okay?

65
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,040
He's not pushing her away.

66
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,430
He really must not remember anything.

67
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,250
You and Ms. Gil live in your house.

68
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,190
There's a lot of junk here.

69
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,590
I got them for the house
when we got married.

70
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,120
Oh, right. I do remember that bed.

71
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,440
You do?

72
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,830
You broke it

73
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,770
and then took me out for stew
to get me to buy it from you.

74
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,850
So you do remember.

75
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,510
Because that was before the accident.

76
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,520
That's right.

77
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,360
It was before the accident.

78
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,410
Seeing that the bed is here,
we really must've gotten married.

79
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,120
She married Dr. Seo, not you.

80
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,200
And Seo Yun Jae had gotten
the ring she's wearing too.

81
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,030
You were dying to marry him,

82
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,010
and you've succeeded. Congratulations.

83
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,740
Do you really not remember

84
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,850
anything about our time here together?

85
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,730
No.

86
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,770
Did something important happen?

87
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,450
Really...

88
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,790
Gyeong Jun,

89
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,830
you and I lived on the second floor.

90
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,720
I'll show you my room.

91
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,140
Gyeong Jun,

92
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,070
you may not remember,

93
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,730
but I took care of you here in my room

94
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,320
and we fell in love.

95
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,380
Stop lying. I do remember everything.

96
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,360
You do?

97
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,720
So you've been acting?

98
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,910
And you believed me?

99
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,340
I did.

100
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,540
That's because you wanted to.

101
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,340
It didn't seem like

102
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,440
Ms. Gil wanted to believe you though.

103
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,690
So why have you been deceiving us?

104
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,950
I'm not really deceiving you.

105
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,950
When I wake up in my own body,
I really won't remember a thing.

106
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,140
Really?

107
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,070
Yeah.

108
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,910
I won't remember anything that
happened after the accident.

109
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,380
But why are you pretending to
have lost your memory already?

110
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,340
If I just take off,

111
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,230
vulnerable Gil Da Ran will be
all alone and have a hard time.

112
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,950
I want to try to undo

113
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,490
all that's happened between us.

114
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,930
After blood collection, there may be
side-effects, albeit rare.

115
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,610
It's just a precautionary measure.

116
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,170
He's fine, so please rest assured.

117
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,400
It seems he's just enjoying
a good night's sleep, right?

118
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,550
Yes.

119
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,130
I hope he won't know a thing
when he wakes up

120
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,910
and can accept us with
the same peaceful face.

121
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,180
Mary gave me a rough rundown
of our living arrangement.

122
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,130
What?

123
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,120
Mary said

124
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,300
you had asked me to help you
marry Seo Yun Jae, and in return,

125
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,350
had offered to take care of little ol' me.

126
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,220
Is that how things started?

127
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,720
Yes. That is how things started,

128
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,460
but a lot happened afterwards.

129
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,670
Mary said I'd be better off
not knowing about those things.

130
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,170
She said if I were to find out,

131
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,060
I'd only get hurt.

132
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,670
She said it was actually a good thing
that I've lost my memory.

133
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,710
Yeah, she is right, but...

134
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,770
That's good.

135
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,520
It works out for the both of us
that I don't remember anything,

136
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,610
so I don't want to go out of my way
to try to remember.

137
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,100
Let's just say nothing ever happened, okay?

138
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,350
Let's just say nothing ever happened?

139
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,870
I'll keep playing Seo Yun Jae,

140
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,230
but you don't have to take care of me though.

141
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,310
I hate having a random person
poke her nose into my business.

142
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,160
A random person?

143
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,360
Gyeong Jun,

144
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,540
your memory will come back with time.

145
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,170
We don't have to say nothing ever happened.

146
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,050
His memory should return soon, right?

147
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,770
Would you like me to come
to the hospital with you?

148
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,950
I don't have any morning classes.

149
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,740
I'm all set.

150
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,570
It's a bit awkward going to places with you.

151
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,360
I'd rather go places alone like I used to.

152
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,780
I didn't make beans.
Would you like to eat with me?

153
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,760
I'll fix myself something like I used to.

154
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,380
It's a bit uncomfortable eating with you.

155
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,360
Uncomfortable?

156
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,600
There are mushrooms on that pizza.

157
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,970
So?

158
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,330
Gyeong Jun,

159
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:24,350
are you pretending to have forgotten
like we had promised?

160
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,750
If that's what you're doing,
you don't have to pretend yet.

161
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,300
We still have time.

162
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,400
What are you talking about?

163
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,940
What promise?

164
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,040
We made a promise while having
chicken and bread right here.

165
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,870
I don't remember.

166
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,360
Stop being like this.

167
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,980
Do you

168
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,000
really not feel anything when you see me?

169
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,770
No.

170
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,660
10:10.

171
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,910
No.

172
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,370
It's not even 6:00 yet.

173
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,190
You're

174
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,020
acting, aren't you?

175
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,150
If you really agreed

176
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,170
to pretend nothing had ever happened,

177
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,220
stop pressuring me to remember.

178
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,810
Have you forgotten this too?

179
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,850
What is it?

180
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,830
What do you think is in this bag?

181
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,930
It's a trash bag, so I suppose
it would contain trash.

182
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,040
If this really does contain trash,

183
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,200
will you take it out for me?

184
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,330
Sure.

185
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,120
[Roundtrip Ticket to the Moon A-1]

186
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,500
She had retrieved this.

187
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,950
You remember everything,

188
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,590
don't you?

189
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,070
You don't have to start pretending already.

190
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,280
You have no idea how scared I was

191
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,080
when you first said you lost your memory.

192
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,770
When you said all that transpired
between us here had been lost,

193
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,790
I thought I was going to pass out.

194
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
I'm not pretending though.

195
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,890
Have you really lost your memory?

196
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,070
Yeah.

197
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,410
I don't remember any of the things
you're talking about.

198
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,210
So you can throw these out?

199
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,400
You told me to throw them out.

200
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,730
Kang Gyeong Jun,

201
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,860
have you really decided to pretend
nothing had happened

202
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,900
and wipe our time together
from your memory?

203
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Are you done?

204
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,490
As far as I'm concerned,
nothing happened between us.

205
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,920
I don't know what it is that
you feel so poignant about,

206
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,080
but I can't remember a thing, so this
whole thing is rather awkward for me.

207
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,710
I'd like you to stop making me feel
uncomfortable and just let it all go.

208
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,990
Is that how you really feel?

209
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,910
Yeah.

210
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,520
Fine.

211
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,380
I'll let everything go too then.

212
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,250
But...

213
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,690
There's a lot I have to throw out,

214
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,540
so I'll need a bit more time than you.

215
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,080
As uncomfortable as it may be for you,

216
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,280
please bear with it, okay?

217
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,930
How can you pretend nothing ever happened?

218
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,730
How can it be so easy for you?

219
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,190
Hurry up.

220
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,140
Why do you want a shot of you
and Gyeong Jun all of a sudden?

221
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,930
I'm leaving evidence

222
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,590
of how loyal I was in staying by his side.

223
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,160
It'll move him when he wakes up.

224
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,810
It was with me that you fell in love
when you were asleep.

225
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,200
You don't remember?

226
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,790
It's me.

227
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,580
I swear.

228
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,460
Marry me.

229
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,450
I'm going to marry Gyeong Jun
as soon as he wakes up.

230
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,910
Should I just get a ring this big
while I'm at it?

231
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,230
You have the wedding ring
you got for my sister.

232
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,610
Ask her to give it back to you.

233
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,590
Erase anything that has to do
with that ring from your mind.

234
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,810
Instead, I want it etched in your mind
that I took care of Gyeong Jun

235
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,530
day in and day out so you can
tell him when he wakes up.

236
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:01,670
That would also prove that you and I
were together day in and day out.

237
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,470
Really?

238
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,280
But I don't remember.

239
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,220
You don't remember our time together?

240
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,720
No.

241
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,700
I wiped it clean from my mind.

242
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,450
It doesn't just go away like that.

243
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,150
Love isn't remembered by your mind.

244
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,000
It's your heart that remembers.

245
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,620
You need to go.

246
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,450
Jang Mary,

247
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,310
no matter where you are
or what you are doing,

248
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,010
I will find you

249
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,640
not with my mind but with my heart.

250
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,800
I can just keep Gyeong Jun from

251
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,090
ever seeking or finding Ms. Gil Da Ran.

252
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,080
Since you never went to Germany,

253
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,610
I was worried you'd refused
to be treated again.

254
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,150
I'm relieved that isn't the case.

255
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,480
It hit me how flustered he'll be
when he wakes up.

256
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,260
But I told you I'd be by his side.

257
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,190
I'm trying hard to take him in
as my own son.

258
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,390
Do you think he'd be able to accept
you and dad as his parents though?

259
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,510
You kept him stored for 12 years

260
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,730
and used his mother's love for dad
to bring him to life.

261
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,790
You had tried to keep him a secret,

262
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,340
but sought him out as soon as
Seo Yun Jae got sick.

263
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,510
You even tried to secretly steal his blood.

264
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,810
I don't know how receptive
he'd be to all this.

265
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,740
Wouldn't it be better for Gyeong Jun's sake

266
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,860
if he never found out about such things?

267
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,910
No. It would be better for you
and dad if he never found out.

268
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,370
It's a real shame that a young kid

269
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,590
will fall for another of your lies.

270
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,010
I knew it. They think I'm a pushover
because I'm young and will lie to me.

271
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,860
You must remember everything
about your parents.

272
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,150
Seeing them made me angry,

273
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,120
and the anger reminded me of who they were.

274
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,780
So you remember everything
I don't want you to remember

275
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,890
but claim you don't remember

276
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,920
anything I want you to remember...

277
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,110
What is it that you want me to remember?

278
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,460
My memories of you?

279
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,150
Nothing stirs me when I see you,

280
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,870
so I really can't remember anything.

281
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,060
Fine.

282
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,050
Be that way.

283
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,910
I had gotten many of your
favorite cup noodles,

284
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,720
but you wouldn't remember, right?

285
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,100
No.

286
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,180
I'll eat them all then.

287
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,660
It'll all be over by the time
I go through these.

288
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,150
This is a new flavor,

289
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,740
so you can't say that
you used to like this, right?

290
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,100
This may be new to you,
but would you like to give it a try?

291
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,410
It's just cup noodles.

292
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,700
See?

293
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,220
You do like it.

294
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,080
You don't have to say anything.

295
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,120
I just look at you and I know.

296
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,340
That's enough for me.

297
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,090
So now you want to go to Germany
instead of the States for college?

298
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:19,940
Yes.

299
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,830
Germany?

300
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,670
But you don't even speak German.

301
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,190
That's right.

302
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,060
I'm still going to go.

303
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,550
Ms. Gil Da Ran,

304
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,090
are you interviewing at
a high school in Pocheon?

305
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,780
Yes.

306
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,640
I was going to tell you today...

307
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,090
I'd like to have a word with you.

308
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,830
Is Ms. Gil transferring to another school?

309
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,810
So she says.

310
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,930
Why is she going to a school outside Seoul?

311
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:59,660
Is she having problems with Yun Jae?

312
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,600
No.

313
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,080
Da Ran and Yun Jae are doing great.

314
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,700
Jang Mary,

315
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,690
you are the only one who
knows apart from Gil Da Ran,

316
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,470
so once I return to my body
and lose my memory,

317
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,480
make sure I never run into Gil Da Ran.

318
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,250
Whether I end up in the States or Germany,

319
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,680
don't ever let me

320
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,740
return to Korea.

321
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,920
Of course. I'll make sure of it.

322
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,280
And not a peep about

323
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,000
what happened.

324
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,370
Don't worry. Mum is the word.

325
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,870
I'll just pretend it never happened.

326
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,900
I'll undo everything before
I return to my body.

327
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,110
Chung Sik said you were still

328
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,100
looking for a position
outside Seoul. Is it true?

329
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,610
Yes.

330
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,280
I also heard while Yun Jae
pushed back his itinerary,

331
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,890
he will soon be leaving
for Germany with his family.

332
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,150
Why aren't you going with him?
Why are looking to move away alone?

333
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,310
I'll explain everything to you later.

334
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,510
I thought everything was okay

335
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,780
when I heard you two were holding hands

336
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:39,050
in the holding cell.

337
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,730
Have you not come to terms
with your feelings yet?

338
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,920
I just don't know how I feel.

339
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,190
You need to be an adult about this.

340
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,280
I know.

341
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,250
It did occur to me that I've been childish,

342
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:58,000
and I've been trying so hard
to hold myself back.

343
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,640
What are you doing?

344
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,820
Summary of Kang Gyeong Jun.

345
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,270
I figured those folks needed a little lesson.

346
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,890
A lesson?

347
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,790
Yup.

348
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,760
If they lie to me and tell me
they've been taking care of me,

349
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,430
I'll fall for it and do what they tell me to
because I'm a good boy.

350
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,370
I can't let that happen.

351
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,140
I'll give them a short-term,
intensive lesson on me

352
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,410
to create parents customized for me.

353
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,490
You're so meticulous in
preparing for your return.

354
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,020
Take a seat.

355
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,100
I have to tell you something.

356
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,310
Mary told me

357
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:52,660
there had been a little something between us.

358
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:58,780
Once I leave, I won't ever return to Korea.

359
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,330
So?

360
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,460
I'm all set because I don't
remember anything,

361
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,620
but you need to pretend it never happened
so that you can move on too.

362
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,290
What?

363
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,330
What's the matter?

364
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,530
You can't just let things go because
of your memory of our time together?

365
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,180
No.

366
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,270
It wasn't anything grand anyway.

367
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,520
It was just a fling.

368
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,390
Oh, right. You must not remember.

369
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,750
You used to like me.

370
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,650
I didn't care for you, but you brought
me flowers, sang for me,

371
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,790
and even cooled me down when I got hot,
so I fooled around with you for a bit.

372
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,550
Right.

373
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,610
But I have no intentions of wasting my time
over such a silly fling anymore.

374
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,270
At this point, I'm just ashamed
and scared someone might find out.

375
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,820
I couldn't be happier that you want
both of us to move past it.

376
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,530
Vice Principal Kim called.

377
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,130
Da Ran's going for an interview
at a school outside Seoul.

378
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:54,300
Ae Gyeong had said she thought Da Ran
was looking for a boarding house.

379
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,970
I guess it was to find a place
near her new school.

380
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,250
Do you think she has her heart
set on splitting with Yun Jae?

381
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,050
Yun Jae's leaving for Germany soon.

382
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:10,390
Da Ran will come around
before he leaves, right?

383
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,750
Don't you want to eat?

384
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,840
I set out yours just in case.

385
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,650
There's rice too.

386
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,640
I'm going out.

387
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,780
Where are you going?

388
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,370
To see my uncle.

389
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,540
Aren't you going to work?

390
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,750
I don't have classes today,

391
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,130
and I also have an important engagement.

392
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,820
I'm bust tying up loose ends too.

393
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,670
I'll be home late today.

394
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,380
I'm sure you don't care,

395
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,510
but I thought I'd let you know
as you are my housemate.

396
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,400
Whatever.

397
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,620
Actually, I may not come
home at all tonight.

398
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,950
You and your family are
leaving next week, right?

399
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,000
It's right around the corner.

400
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,820
You only have to put up with me
for a few more days.

401
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,310
That's right.

402
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,190
These are Ms. Kang Hui Su's recipes.

403
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,410
But why...

404
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,960
When Gyeong Jun wakes up,

405
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,460
he won't know that you sold his house

406
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,980
or that you tried to put him
in someone else's care.

407
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,120
If he ever found out, this is what he'd say,

408
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,950
"Uncle Hyeok Su."

409
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,680
"I'm letting you off the hook only
because of my gratitude to mom."

410
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,100
Be good to Gyeong Jun from now on.

411
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,670
There are more recipes.

412
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,670
He sounded exactly like
Gyeong Jun just now.

413
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,800
I wonder who he is.

414
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,180
Spasibo.
[Thank you]

415
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,630
Was that a bad word?

416
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,570
Hold yourself back.

417
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,080
I don't think he's right in the head.

418
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,460
Yun Jae,

419
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,180
Da Ran is interviewing

420
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,100
at a school way outside Seoul today.

421
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,420
Interviewing?

422
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,770
Yes.

423
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,700
She's also looking for
a boarding house there.

424
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,120
A boarding house?

425
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,420
She went to find a new job

426
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,190
and a place for to stay
while you're in Germany,

427
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,940
and yet you just let her go alone.

428
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,150
Aren't you even curious where
she will be working and living?

429
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,510
You should've gone with her.

430
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,740
Don't you worry about her?

431
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,010
Yun Jae,

432
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,440
you're really very cold.

433
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,930
She's all packed.

434
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,190
Actually, I may not come
home at all tonight.

435
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,530
It's right around the corner.

436
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,470
You only have to put up with me
for a few more days.

437
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,390
Is she planning not to come back

438
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,680
until I leave?

439
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,320
No. That can't be.

440
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,930
She will come back.

441
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,500
It will all be over by the time

442
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,350
I go through these.

443
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:31,060
This isn't a bad way to end things.

444
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:37,200
Even if I get to see her tomorrow
and the day after,

445
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,120
she will disappear from my memory anyway.

446
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,400
If I don't see her today,

447
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,360
tomorrow,

448
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:57,720
the day after,

449
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,480
or the day after...

450
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,620
I wonder what they do with them afterwards.

451
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,530
They'll throw them out, of course.

452
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,080
They're so pretty. I love sunflowers.

453
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,780
If they're going to throw them out,
I should come get them after the show.

454
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,770
They were throwing them out, so I went
out of my way to get them for you.

455
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,000
You told me to throw them out.

456
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,990
You're at a great school in Seoul.
Why would you come here?

457
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,890
Is it because of your husband's job?

458
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm not with my husband.

459
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,690
Do you get to see each other
only on weekends?

460
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,090
We separated.

461
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,040
Oh...

462
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,020
The vice principal will be
here shortly. Excuse me.

463
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,790
The school is tiny.

464
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,590
It's a lot more rural than I expected.

465
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,710
The woman interviewing today is divorced.

466
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,860
Really?

467
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,830
That must be why she can't
stay where she is now.

468
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,440
But wouldn't it be better
if she stayed in Seoul?

469
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,660
People gossip a lot more
at a place like this.

470
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,860
- Please come this way.
- Thank you.

471
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,570
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. Something came up.

472
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,700
What's the matter with you?

473
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,990
Did you come here to make things
harder for me?

474
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,720
Do you plan to run away to this place?

475
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,630
Do you plan to give up on a job
at a great school

476
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,710
and run away to the boondocks?

477
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,880
It's because I'm ashamed and scared.

478
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,040
I said I'd handle everything, right?

479
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,970
Just pretend nothing happened
and go back to where you were.

480
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:08,570
I'll get over things on my own terms,
so leave me alone.

481
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,190
If you split with Seo Yun Jae,
have your family sever ties with you,

482
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,800
and run away to a tiny village

483
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,620
to cry over memories of someone
who can't remember the same things,

484
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,740
how do you suppose you will
manage to get over things?

485
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,060
Yeah.

486
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:26,100
I wish I could wipe my memory
clean in one go just like you.

487
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,790
I wish I'd never have to remember
having opened up to you

488
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,470
or having told you that I loved you.

489
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,490
I wish I'd never admitted that
I was having an affair with you.

490
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,910
As a matter of fact, I wish I had never met

491
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,440
a kid like you in the first place.

492
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,380
It was me who ruined everything for you,

493
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,410
so everything will be fine once I disappear.

494
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,490
Yup.

495
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,990
I sure hope so.

496
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,350
I'm sure of it.

497
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:23,210
Yun Jae called and asked Chung Sik
where Da Ran was interviewing.

498
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:26,600
I really hope he can keep her from straying.

499
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,750
Why didn't she just tell us Yun Jae was
going to Germany for medical treatment?

500
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,630
I don't know what's going on
in that head of hers.

501
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,800
Why don't you have

502
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,270
a word with Da Ran?

503
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,460
Da Ran,

504
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:55,650
are you planning to run away
to a small school outside Seoul

505
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:02,310
to stay away from that K-guy
or to be with him?

506
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,740
Dad,

507
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,460
I...

508
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:17,220
I know very well it's out of the question

509
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,780
- unless I go mad.
- That's good.

510
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,330
But dad,

511
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,080
when you went to that island
to end things with mom,

512
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,350
would you have been able to get over her

513
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,060
and leave the island

514
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,970
if mom had said

515
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:49,400
she had gotten over you

516
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,030
and had moved on?

517
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,810
I don't think so.

518
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:02,210
I probably wouldn't have left the island

519
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,960
for a very long time.

520
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,980
Right?

521
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:16,610
I know because I take after you.

522
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:21,650
I bet you would've stayed
on the island all your life.

523
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,080
Da Ran,

524
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,780
you said you knew

525
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,910
it was out of the question
unless you went mad, right?

526
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,310
Then go

527
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,780
to an even more remote place
than where you interviewed.

528
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,390
What's out of the question
should never happen.

529
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:44,680
But would it make a difference

530
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,250
if I ran away farther?

531
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:55,830
You moved to an island,
and it still didn't work.

532
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,240
I...

533
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,850
Dad,

534
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,830
I don't think

535
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:11,530
I can get over him even if
I run away to the moon.

536
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,720
Yes?

537
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,480
Hey,

538
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,250
it's you, Gyeong Jun.

539
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:32,530
You said you couldn't remember,

540
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,790
so why are you here?

541
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:39,690
I have to go away too, right?

542
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,670
I should go.

543
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:00,110
It may be easy

544
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:05,040
for you to just pretend
nothing had ever happened,

545
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,810
but it's not easy for me.

546
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,070
But...

547
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:14,750
I can endure and persevere,

548
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,830
so I will do just that because I love you.

549
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:21,510
I'll let you go because I love you.

550
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,960
But...

551
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:29,280
How am I supposed to
endure and persevere

552
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,280
if you don't remember?

553
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,990
You had asked me not to forget you, remember?

554
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,420
Couldn't you

555
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,310
keep me in your memory too?

556
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,900
We are having dinner

557
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,080
with Da Ran's family tonight.

558
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,500
I was thinking of a get-together
before our departure myself,

559
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,810
so good job.

560
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:27,390
Yun Jae and Da Ran haven't even
gotten their marriage license yet.

561
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,540
Maybe Da Ran really was serious
about what she had promised me.

562
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,850
I did think it was strange that
Da Ran didn't want to come with him.

563
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:41,510
Do you suppose they are
having marital problems?

564
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:47,260
We'll see at the dinner tonight.

565
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,380
At the dinner tonight,

566
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,830
I'm going to tell them Yun Jae
and I are splitting up.

567
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,780
It'll be harder for me if you come,

568
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,030
so tell them you have to go to
the hospital and don't come.

569
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,960
I'll take care of everything.

570
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,200
My family and Yun Jae's family
are getting together tonight.

571
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,450
I'm worried about Da Ran.

572
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,430
Why?

573
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,980
Da Ran said she was going to try,

574
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:30,420
but I don't think she'll be able
to stay with Yun Jae.

575
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:35,750
I get the feeling there will be
big news at the dinner.

576
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,180
Really?

577
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,930
I'm coming too then.

578
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,230
But it's a family gathering.

579
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:45,420
Oh, right.

580
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,270
You're my family, right?

581
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,070
I'm Gyeong Jun's family, remember?

582
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,650
I wonder if Ms. Gil will tell everyone

583
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:58,290
she's leaving Dr. Seo.

584
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:02,120
Give me the watch, Jang Mary.

585
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,250
I told you I threw it out.

586
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,420
It's the only thing Gil Da Ran
has ever give me.

587
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,080
I have to give it back to her.

588
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,550
You're not keeping it?

589
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,800
No.

590
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,670
I have to return it and put Gil Da Ran's
time back to before she met me.

591
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,550
How?

592
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,630
Gil Da Ran is only holding on to me
because she's still out of it.

593
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,950
Once it hits her I'll be leaving for good,

594
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,980
she'll come to her senses and
return to where she should be.

595
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,830
Hop in.

596
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,120
I'll go alone and tell them.

597
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,890
You'll only further complicate matters.

598
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:47,950
I'll tell my parents and yours.

599
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:50,440
They'll probably say
you've lost your marbles.

600
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,540
They all think you're Yun Jae.

601
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,780
I need to set the record
straight for all of them

602
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,650
before you return to your body.

603
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,130
I'm not coming with you,

604
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:01,840
so hop in.

605
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,300
Where are we going?

606
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,230
Why are we leaving Seoul?

607
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,320
Gyeong Jun.

608
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,970
Before you set the record
straight with our families,

609
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:27,640
you and I need to tie up some loose ends.

610
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,930
This is...

611
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,420
Yeah.

612
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:47,710
This is where you were right before
Seo Yun Jae and I got into the accident.

613
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,520
This is where Kang Gyeong Jun left and
where Seo Yun Jae was supposed to come.

614
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,060
When I return to my body,

615
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:02,130
my last memory will be of this place.

616
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,840
Everything that happened after the accident

617
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,870
will be wiped clean.

618
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,650
Are we talking about that again?

619
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:13,970
The Kang Gyeong Jun that was with Gil Da Ran

620
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,530
will disappear forever.

621
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:24,090
Seo Yun Jae has remained in a coma

622
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,460
to keep my time standing still.

623
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:32,850
So do you mean to say
you really will be no more?

624
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:35,870
Yeah,

625
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,400
so you need

626
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,150
to return your clock back too.

627
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,150
The watch...

628
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,990
This will be something

629
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,500
that never happened after the switchover.

630
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:08,950
10:10 will disappear forever

631
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,460
from your clock,

632
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,240
and

633
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:21,370
so will Kang Gyeong Jun

634
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,750
who loved you.

635
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:33,920
You must forget everything about me.

636
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,580
I'm off now to turn back the clock.

637
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,880
You stay here

638
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,800
and turn your clock back to when
you were waiting for Yun Jae's answer.

639
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,460
You won't

640
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,800
remember anything?

641
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,730
Gil Teacher,

642
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,350
don't ever forget this.

643
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,390
It was Kang Gyeong Jun's first kiss.

644
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,190
I, Kang Gyeong Jun,

645
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,000
vow to never

646
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,680
fall in love with you.

647
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:05,060
But you know I was in this body,

648
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,490
so even after I leave,

649
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:11,490
couldn't you keep me in your memory?

650
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,520
Don't wipe me out completely.

651
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:22,810
Don't be completely preoccupied
with Seo Yun Jae,

652
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:27,240
and take some time to remember me as well.

653
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,070
Jeong Hye,

654
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:36,300
do you still not recognize me?

655
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,790
It's such a shame.

656
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,350
Something serious must be going on
between those two families.

657
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:48,360
They haven't exchange a single word.

658
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,540
I know.

659
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,900
Wait. They're going to talk.

660
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,610
The kids are running late.

661
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,850
Yes.

662
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:03,200
Da Ran did call to tell me
she was leaving from school...

663
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,000
We heard Yun Jae might not make it
as something came up at the hospital.

664
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,470
No.

665
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:12,710
He called earlier and said
he was definitely coming.

666
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,320
They must not be coming together.

667
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,450
They're not here yet.

668
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,310
Yeah.

669
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,230
Yun Jae.

670
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,380
You're late.

671
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,420
- Yun Jae.
- Yun Jae.

672
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,880
Hi, Yun Jae.

673
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,430
Where's Da Ran?

674
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,030
There's something I have to

675
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,510
tell you in Da Ran's stead.

676
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:32,410
I will be going to Germany
with my family as planned.

677
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,380
After I get treated and receive surgery,

678
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,670
my family will stay in Germany

679
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,550
and I will be returning to be with Da Ran.

680
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,700
When Seo Yun Jae returns,

681
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,550
everything will return to where it should be.

682
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:51,200
Seo Yun Jae

683
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,030
will help Da Ran find her center again.

684
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,570
You all seem to be thinking

685
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:02,360
that Gil Da Ran has her heart
set on someone else,

686
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,770
but you are mistaken.

687
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,620
So there is no KKJ?

688
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,620
You,

689
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,170
how...

690
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:13,360
What's KKJ?

691
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:19,520
It must be that man Se Yeong told me about.

692
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,600
The man Da Ran's having an affair with.

693
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,260
That can't be.

694
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,330
You're right.

695
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,330
The person does not exist.

696
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,690
No.

697
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,240
- Da Ran.
- Da Ran.

698
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,750
He does exist.

699
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:49,080
What's going on?

700
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,650
He does exist.

701
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:58,320
Because of him,

702
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,050
the clock in my heart

703
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:03,910
always points to 10:10.

704
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:10,280
We held hands and crossed an ocean
we never should have crossed.

705
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,230
We even went to the moon together
and went on a submarine adventure.

706
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,610
I've lost my mind, haven't I?

707
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,520
I can't pretend these things never happened,

708
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,100
which is why I'm telling you.

709
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:33,400
You should all listen carefully

710
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,900
so it doesn't become something
that never happened.

711
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:53,540
I'm in love

712
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:58,070
with KKJ.

713
01:02:43,243 --> 01:02:44,489
[Big]

714
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:48,850
Even if I'm mean and rude

715
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:51,740
when I appear before you,

716
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,090
endure and don't let me go.

717
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:57,840
I'll continue to remember as I've promised.

718
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,720
Be honest and sincere like you're being now

719
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,910
when I wake up and can't remember.

720
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,210
Then

721
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,080
we'll be able to return
to our time right now.
