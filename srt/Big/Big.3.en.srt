1
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:15,504
Yun Jae.

2
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,204
Hi.

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,337
I was so worried.

4
00:00:30,337 --> 00:00:34,471
I should've been the first person you called.

5
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,471
Hey.

6
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,404
What's wrong with you?

7
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,404
Yun Jae,

8
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:53,504
I love you.

9
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:58,337
Yun Jae.

10
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:10,804
Seo Yun Jae, you bastard.

11
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:14,670
[Episode 3]
You were here too, Da Ran.

12
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:19,371
Thank you for bringing Yun Jae's things.

13
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:22,037
What are friends for?

14
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:23,570
Friends?

15
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:27,171
Thank you.

16
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,870
If you want to thank me, how about
offering me a cup of tea?

17
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,104
I'd like you to brew me something warm.

18
00:01:32,104 --> 00:01:35,637
Oh, really? Would you like some coffee?

19
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,837
Not coffee.

20
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:42,538
Remember the Darjeeling tea from England
that I gave you half of?

21
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:43,371
Let's drink that.

22
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:45,770
Darjeeling? Black tea? That sounds good.

23
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,970
Let's go up.

24
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,404
I wonder where that tea is.

25
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:51,171
I want to be alone with you.
Can't you tell her to leave?

26
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,404
Da Ran.

27
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,504
Yes?

28
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:57,837
The cookies at the bakery
next door are really good.

29
00:01:57,837 --> 00:02:00,304
Could you get us some to have with the tea?

30
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:01,304
Cookies?

31
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:03,637
Sure. I'll be right back.

32
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:05,438
She can't take a hint.

33
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:06,570
Let's go.

34
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:08,570
Gil Da Ran.

35
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,837
We want to be alone.

36
00:02:13,837 --> 00:02:15,404
You should go.

37
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,703
But Yun Jae, your friend came all this way.
We should serve her some tea.

38
00:02:22,703 --> 00:02:27,237
You can have all the Darjeeling
you gave Seo Yun Jae.

39
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:30,037
You sure are making a big deal
about half a box of tea.

40
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:32,337
And if you want cookies, you can get them
and eat them at your place.

41
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:35,471
I don't care how good they are.
You can have them all.

42
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:37,037
I don't want half.

43
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:38,204
Yun Jae.

44
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:42,037
Yun Jae, why are you being
like this to your friend?

45
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:45,970
You go on up, Se Yeong.

46
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,171
I'll go and get the cookies.

47
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:50,670
There's no need for you to get the cookies.

48
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,104
I'll be right back.

49
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:54,770
I don't want any. I really don't.

50
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,004
Don't go.

51
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:59,804
But they're for your friend.
What's the big deal?

52
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,004
Let go.

53
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:12,271
We're not having any cookies,

54
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:13,837
so you should go.

55
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:17,870
What's keeping you?

56
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,171
Get a clue, will you?

57
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:25,004
I want to be alone with my fiancee.

58
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,171
So you should go, my friend.

59
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:30,603
What's wrong with you, Yun Jae?

60
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:35,304
Kang Gyeong Jun, have you lost your mind?

61
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:37,171
Have you lost it? Huh?

62
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:42,904
Hey!

63
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,171
Geez, you're heavy.

64
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:47,504
What's the matter with you?

65
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:50,104
Why were you so rude to Yun Jae's friend?

66
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:52,304
Don't go.

67
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:04,904
Are you a rabid dog?

68
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:06,371
Why did you bite me? Are you nuts?

69
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,171
You're the one who's nuts.
What you did was so embarrassing.

70
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:13,471
I got you out of the mess
that bastard created.

71
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:15,271
You don't know anything.

72
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:19,037
Do you really think she's just a friend
who came by for cookies?

73
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:20,271
Give me a break.

74
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:24,171
You need to wise up.

75
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:26,770
Did you just call Yun Jae a bastard?

76
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,837
Yeah.

77
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:29,937
He's a real jerk.

78
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,137
He was cheating on you,
playing you for a fool.

79
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:34,204
What?

80
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,070
Do you know what she did?

81
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,970
What did she do?

82
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,004
As soon as she saw me,

83
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:40,271
she said, "I was so worried about you,"

84
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,504
and embraced me.

85
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:43,504
So?

86
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:45,304
So I was taken aback.

87
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:47,137
I said, "What's wrong with you?"
and pushed her away.

88
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:48,504
Then she said, "I love you."

89
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:51,438
She loves Seo Yun Jae.

90
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:55,438
I couldn't believe it.

91
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:58,304
That's why I sent her away.

92
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:01,603
I see.

93
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:03,670
I see?

94
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,538
How can you be so laid back?

95
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:10,337
The situation calls for a lot
more than just "I see."

96
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:14,870
You must have been very worried about me.

97
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,970
Is that why you told me
not to get her the cookies?

98
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,237
Were you watching out for me?

99
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:24,804
- So that's what it was.
- What are you doing?

100
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:26,137
Don't worry.

101
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:29,538
My fiance's just not the type
to do such a thing.

102
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:34,304
That lady doctor and my fiance

103
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:36,770
have been friends for a very long time.

104
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,603
Contrary to what you may think,
physical contact and love between

105
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:44,603
a man and a woman do not
always have to be erotic.

106
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:47,804
Thank you though

107
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:48,937
for your concern.

108
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:51,371
Stop it.

109
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:55,304
Are you babying me?

110
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,837
Calm down, Gyeong Jun. Calm down.

111
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:01,371
Ms. Gil Da Ran,

112
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:06,371
you're not thinking straight because
you're head over heels for this dude,

113
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:09,637
but he's not as nice a guy
as you think he is.

114
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,570
That's right, Gyeong Jun.

115
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,104
I am head over heels in love with him.

116
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:19,104
And the reason I'm so crazy
about him is that

117
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:21,004
he really is a very nice guy.

118
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:30,404
Ouch. Poor Yun Jae.

119
00:06:30,404 --> 00:06:32,271
What if it scars?

120
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:37,371
Are you only concerned about the outer shell?

121
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:40,304
I'm the one who's in pain
from your nasty bite.

122
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,504
Did it hurt?

123
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:43,104
You should've taken cover
instead of just letting me bite you.

124
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:44,737
This is going to bruise.

125
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,904
Do you love him that much?

126
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:52,670
Do you really think he feels
the same way about you?

127
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,504
Say that thing you said earlier.

128
00:06:57,504 --> 00:07:01,037
You know... What Yun Jae
was going to say to me.

129
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:02,538
Oh, that?

130
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,937
It was so nice to hear it
come from Yun Jae's lips.

131
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:19,237
Gil Da Ran, I...

132
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:25,304
Do not love you.

133
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:28,904
That's what he could have said, too.

134
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,004
How do I know what
he was going to tell you?

135
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:35,471
You're not sure either.

136
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:40,204
I'm still a kid, so I don't know
all this adult mumbo jumbo.

137
00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:43,404
All I get is the pain of a nasty bite
for getting myself involved.

138
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:47,804
I have a low pain threshold,
so I'll stay out of this from now on.

139
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:03,737
A nice guy?

140
00:08:03,737 --> 00:08:05,637
Give me a break.

141
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:31,137
Do you love me?

142
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:35,970
I'll answer you in person.

143
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:44,637
What were you going to say?

144
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,770
I was waiting for you. We need to talk.

145
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,337
About what?

146
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:07,770
Are you mad at me?

147
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,204
I was flustered, too.

148
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:13,171
I didn't know Da Ran was over.

149
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:16,471
What were you going to do if she wasn't?

150
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:22,770
I must have taken you aback, because
I told you I loved you out of the blue.

151
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,304
I only said that because

152
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:29,904
it felt as though you were wavering
on marrying Da Ran because of me.

153
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,104
I know you're wavering

154
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:37,070
because you haven't returned what I gave you.

155
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,538
What you gave me?

156
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:40,337
What did you give me?

157
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:42,870
You said you had it.

158
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:48,171
You still have what I gave you, right?

159
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,603
Huh?

160
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:51,404
Oh, that?

161
00:09:53,137 --> 00:10:00,471
Is what you gave me really that special?

162
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:05,804
Of course it is.

163
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:11,304
Then we should talk about it.

164
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:14,703
Hop in. Let's go to our usual spot.

165
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:16,970
Not there...

166
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,438
Sure. Let's go.

167
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,004
Your usual.

168
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,538
I'm back.

169
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:07,538
You're late.

170
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:09,804
Were you with Yun Jae this whole time?

171
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:12,703
What were you up to?

172
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,804
We went for a walk.

173
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:16,204
What are you guys doing?

174
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:18,970
We're sealing your wedding
invitation envelopes.

175
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,603
I should get paid for this.
Let Yun Jae know I'm billing him.

176
00:11:23,703 --> 00:11:25,037
Chung Sik,

177
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:27,603
why don't you bring me your report card
that you've been hiding.

178
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:32,137
We might run out of envelopes, mom.

179
00:11:32,137 --> 00:11:34,670
We should get some more printed.

180
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:38,070
Does Yun Jae have enough?

181
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,070
We could get some more
printed for him as well.

182
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,070
Oh...

183
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,404
I...

184
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:50,438
We can't send out

185
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:52,870
the wedding invitations just yet.

186
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:58,770
Why not?

187
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:06,438
Well...

188
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:14,104
Because it's night time.

189
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:17,837
The post office is closed.
We have to wait until tomorrow morning.

190
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:20,538
You call that a joke?

191
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:23,703
That's why your classes are so boring.

192
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:27,004
I'll do it later. Just leave them be.

193
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,570
We're fine.

194
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,670
You just worry about getting
these out to your friends.

195
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,304
Go to your room and study.

196
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:35,438
Okay.

197
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:42,204
- Da Ran.
- Hi, mom.

198
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:47,037
I can send the furniture and appliances
to your new place, right?

199
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:50,037
You said you were going to close
the deal on your apartment this week.

200
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,970
Oh, right. The apartment...

201
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,538
I totally forgot about it.

202
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:55,538
Of all things...

203
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:59,104
What if you end up losing the deposit?

204
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:05,504
By the way, why does Yun Jae
call you "Gil Teacher"?

205
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:06,870
Gil Teacher?

206
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,603
I overheard earlier.

207
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:14,037
He was calling you "Gil Teacher"
when you two were alone.

208
00:13:14,037 --> 00:13:16,404
Is that your pet name?

209
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:19,438
Are you his teacher of love?

210
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:22,104
Yeah. It's a pet name.

211
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:25,670
You two seemed very happy today.

212
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,304
You were arguing but you also
watched out for each other.

213
00:13:28,304 --> 00:13:32,104
You two finally seem like a real couple.

214
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,337
Really?

215
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:38,937
So we didn't come across
as a real couple before?

216
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:42,037
Frankly, it didn't seem like
there was much going on.

217
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:45,070
You were always as nervous as can be,

218
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,570
and Yun Jae always seemed uncomfortable,
like a first-time guest.

219
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,070
Did we seem that distant?

220
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,204
You two were very wholesome,

221
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,970
but there wasn't any electricity

222
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,670
or sparks that you see
passing between lovers.

223
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:17,204
So in your eyes, it didn't
seem like we were in love.

224
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:20,670
But that was in the past.

225
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,603
You two seem to be in love now though.

226
00:14:25,904 --> 00:14:27,438
Da Ran,

227
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:33,171
why don't we go lingerie shopping
for your honeymoon this weekend?

228
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:37,970
Let's get you something electrifying,

229
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,104
okay?

230
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,637
Electricity and sparks...

231
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:59,271
That's what I wanted.

232
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:08,070
Seo Yun Jae

233
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:11,904
is marrying Gil Da Ran.

234
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:19,570
He can't be with any other woman.

235
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,538
Yun Jae.

236
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,637
Geez.

237
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,404
Why am I here?

238
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,538
I'm off to work. See you at the hospital.

239
00:16:22,538 --> 00:16:24,438
I spent the night with her.

240
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:29,770
No!

241
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:35,670
Huh?

242
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,070
Did he go somewhere?

243
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:39,471
What did I do?

244
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:41,171
Stupid.

245
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:49,937
Kang Gyeong Jun, where have you been
so early in the morning?

246
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:52,104
Huh?

247
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:57,237
I was just taking out the garbage.

248
00:16:57,237 --> 00:17:00,737
When did you come out?
I've been waiting for some time.

249
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:03,404
I went jogging. I did a full lap.

250
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:05,304
In that?

251
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,637
I always jog like this.

252
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:09,037
American style.

253
00:17:09,837 --> 00:17:13,070
People might think you're just getting in,
doing the walk of shame.

254
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:18,970
Walk of shame?

255
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,570
I'm just a kid.

256
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,703
What does that mean anyway?

257
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:29,538
You smell of alcohol.

258
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:31,538
Did you drink?

259
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:34,104
Right? I reek, don't I?

260
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:35,271
I really do.

261
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,371
It's the beer your dad gave me.

262
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:39,304
I shouldn't have had any.

263
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:41,637
I have a raging headache
and I feel queasy.

264
00:17:41,637 --> 00:17:45,703
Ms. Gil, now I know why drinking
is such a terrible thing.

265
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:47,570
There's no way a sip of beer
could've given you a hangover.

266
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,104
Yun Jae can hold his liquor.

267
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:52,304
But I'm a minor inside.

268
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:57,804
In any case, don't do anything
stupid with Yun Jae's body.

269
00:17:57,804 --> 00:17:59,304
If you do, you'll get it from me.

270
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:03,337
Don't worry.

271
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,904
You're right.

272
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:08,904
You're a thoughtful boy

273
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:11,237
who has my best interest at heart, right?

274
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,037
I trust you.

275
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,603
I can trust you, right?

276
00:18:19,637 --> 00:18:20,970
Yes.

277
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:25,703
Don't have any frozen foods.
I brought you lunch. Here.

278
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:27,104
I'll be back after school.

279
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:33,703
It didn't bruise.

280
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:35,004
What a relief.

281
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:37,837
I don't want a single scratch
on Yun Jae's body.

282
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:42,304
Gil Teacher,

283
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:45,670
what if

284
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:51,603
something does happen to his body?

285
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:53,271
Will you get very angry?

286
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:55,770
Why? Did you get hurt?

287
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,870
No, no.

288
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,538
Not hurt, but...

289
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:09,870
What if his body is sullied or used or...

290
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,870
Sullied or used?

291
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,637
What did you do?

292
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:17,737
I worked out.

293
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:22,237
You get all worn and torn
when you work out.

294
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:24,703
I wanted to know how

295
00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:30,337
intense my workouts should be. Just asking.

296
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,703
Just keep him as fit as he is now.

297
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:36,271
I know it's hard, Gyeong Jun,

298
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:38,471
but please take good care of Yun Jae's body.

299
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:39,538
Okay. Okay.

300
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:42,637
It won't be easy, but I'll try my best.

301
00:19:43,237 --> 00:19:45,504
Don't go anywhere. Just stay put.

302
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:47,438
Let's go to the hospital later to get
Yun Jae's leave of absence processed.

303
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:49,404
- Okay.
- I'm running late. See you.

304
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:50,471
Are you going this way?

305
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:55,104
- Go on in.
- Don't run. It's hot.

306
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:56,471
Go on in. Go.

307
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:59,837
- See you later.
- Thanks.

308
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:01,538
Have a good day.

309
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,837
I'll run into that woman
if we go to the hospital.

310
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:09,404
What a headache.

311
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:13,904
The hospital says Gyeong Jun
is fine physically,

312
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:16,703
so he should be able to return
to school soon.

313
00:20:16,703 --> 00:20:18,770
It's okay for the time being,
but if he doesn't return soon,

314
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,371
we may have to change his status
to extended absence.

315
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,204
He'll be back soon.

316
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:26,337
I'll visit him at the hospital, too.

317
00:20:26,337 --> 00:20:27,904
Thank you.

318
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:34,703
I was going to get you some juice at least,

319
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:36,171
but you were so adamant
that we came empty-handed.

320
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:37,404
That's fine.

321
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,104
I was only thinking about Yun Jae's work.

322
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:45,404
Gyeong Jun's schooling
didn't even occur to me.

323
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:51,570
Give me the notes for all
your classes from now on.

324
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,404
Okay.

325
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:58,004
Gyeong Jun's so lucky.

326
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:01,004
Final exams are around the corner,
but he doesn't have to take them.

327
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:03,137
Lucky? Really? Really?

328
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,438
How can you say such a thing?

329
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:06,870
Stop it.

330
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,070
I'll tell mom you beat me up at school.

331
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,970
I don't want your notes. Get them
from someone who's a good student.

332
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:17,737
You'd better watch it.

333
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:28,603
Gyeong Jun's a kid just like Chung Sik.

334
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:34,070
This is all his fault.

335
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:38,504
It's because his body caved
in to her seduction.

336
00:21:38,504 --> 00:21:41,703
I'm just an innocent 18-year-old.

337
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:50,970
Gil Teacher should never find out.

338
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:57,137
I need to find evidence
of his two-timing ways.

339
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:06,104
I need material evidence to prove
that he was cheating on her,

340
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:08,837
so that I can clear myself
of any accountability.

341
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:22,104
I know you're wavering,

342
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:25,070
because you haven't returned
what I gave you.

343
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:27,804
What can it be?

344
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,737
What did she give him?

345
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:35,037
I need to find that thing.

346
00:22:40,404 --> 00:22:42,737
I gave it to you for a situation like this.

347
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,637
Don't be bashful and just do as I tell you.

348
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:52,371
What can it be?

349
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:56,770
How am I supposed to know?

350
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:01,104
Maybe I should just run away.

351
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,404
Where should I go?

352
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:54,804
L.A.?

353
00:23:57,204 --> 00:24:00,837
No. Mary is there.

354
00:24:00,837 --> 00:24:03,304
Nope.

355
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:20,737
A ticket to Tokyo, please.

356
00:24:20,737 --> 00:24:22,637
I want to leave as soon as possible.
One-way, please.

357
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,870
- It's fully charged.
- Thank you.

[JangX: Pick up. Something wrong? Call me.]
Look at all this.

359
00:24:58,004 --> 00:24:59,538
They're all from Jang Mary.

360
00:25:03,438 --> 00:25:06,171
The person you're trying to reach
cannot take your call.

361
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,037
Why aren't you picking up, Gyeong Jun?

362
00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:13,538
Call me whenever you can.

363
00:25:17,137 --> 00:25:18,670
Gyeong Jun,

364
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,504
is something wrong?

365
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:28,538
You said you'd answer once a day.

366
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:29,603
Pick up!

367
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:31,471
Pick up!

368
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:32,770
Pick up!

369
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,937
Jang Mary has hit the roof.

370
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,937
She gets out of control when she's angry.

371
00:25:44,237 --> 00:25:46,371
I'm coming to Korea to see you.

372
00:25:52,504 --> 00:25:54,504
Whatever.

373
00:25:57,371 --> 00:26:00,837
I'm at LAX. I'm getting on the plane.

374
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:08,804
Mary's on her way over?

375
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:15,637
I'm in Korea.

376
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:23,438
You thought I wouldn't be able to find you
because you didn't give me

377
00:26:23,438 --> 00:26:26,271
info about your school or address, right?

378
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,438
You underestimate me.

379
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:34,904
She's probably just bluffing.

380
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:39,538
Gyeong Jun, you'll be seeing me very soon.

381
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:51,870
Gyeong Jun, I'm on my way to your school.

382
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:55,870
[Jaeil High School]

383
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:02,570
I'm going to meet your teacher, Ms. Gil.

384
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,637
Do you want to know how I found out?

385
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:10,737
I saw the picture you posted
on David's Facebook.

386
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:22,970
Now that I'm in Korea, I'm not
going back without you.

387
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,603
Whether you return with me
or whether I stay here,

388
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,237
let's be together, Gyeong Jun.

389
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:33,137
Excessive stress can...

390
00:27:33,637 --> 00:27:35,670
Why do we have so many assemblies?

391
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,538
Isn't your brother-in-law coming again?
It was a lot of fun.

392
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:40,970
Why would he?

393
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:45,404
He's not a teacher. He's a doctor.

394
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:48,804
Schools are for teachers.
"Hostesses" are for doctors.

395
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:50,737
It's "hospitals," you idiot.

396
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:52,770
Doctors work at hospitals.

397
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,237
I got confused for a second.

398
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,471
Not again.

399
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:12,204
It's a girl.

400
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:13,438
It's not him.

401
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,171
She's so cute.

402
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:42,570
Give me some money.

403
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:50,304
He won't take dollars nor credit cards.
I need to pay the cab fare.

404
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:52,404
Why are you asking me for it?

405
00:28:52,404 --> 00:28:53,870
Hurry up.

406
00:29:03,304 --> 00:29:05,337
Ms. Gil Da Ran!

407
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:08,904
I don't know her. I really don't.

408
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:10,304
Why would a stranger

409
00:29:10,304 --> 00:29:13,037
borrow money from you to pay for the cab?

410
00:29:13,037 --> 00:29:16,337
I don't know. I'm curious myself.

411
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,970
Why did you give her the money then?

412
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,337
It all happened so suddenly.

413
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,670
Go before you ruin yet another assembly.

414
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,037
I really don't know who she is,

415
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:28,237
but I'll go and give her a stern warning.

416
00:29:36,637 --> 00:29:40,070
Da Ran seems to know that hot girl.

417
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,471
Excuse me.

418
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:44,404
Why did you barge in and ruin our assembly?

419
00:29:44,404 --> 00:29:47,804
And why did you ask me for money?

420
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:53,070
You're Gil Teacher, right?

421
00:29:55,538 --> 00:29:58,538
Gyeong Jun's fallen off the radar
ever since he posted this picture.

422
00:29:58,538 --> 00:30:00,237
Where is he right now?

423
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,204
Over there?

424
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:06,004
Hang on.

425
00:30:07,637 --> 00:30:10,837
I'm sorry, Vice Principal Kim. I'm so sorry.

426
00:30:10,837 --> 00:30:13,937
We need to talk. Come.

427
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:18,804
Another cab.

428
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,371
Yun Jae?

429
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:50,171
You've come from the States
to see Gyeong Jun, right?

430
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:53,037
If he's at the assembly, get him for me.

431
00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:57,237
He's not at school right now.

432
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,204
The thing is, Gyeong Jun's...

433
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:01,770
Gil Da Ran!

434
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,204
Who's he?

435
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:19,271
Huh?

436
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:22,538
A friend of Gyeong Jun.

437
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:31,304
Hold on.

438
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:37,304
She's come from the States to see you.
Do you know her?

439
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,904
You can go now. I'll deal with this.

440
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:41,937
What are you going to do?
Are you going to tell her everything?

441
00:31:41,937 --> 00:31:44,004
This is kid stuff. Stay out of it.

442
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:45,970
Run along. Go.

443
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:49,337
Hey! Where are you going?

444
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,271
Who are you?

445
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:01,637
Who could she be? His girlfriend?

446
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:06,137
Huh? That's Yun Jae's.

447
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,471
Yeah. It is.

448
00:32:13,104 --> 00:32:17,337
So you've come, Jang Mary.

449
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,237
How do you know me?

450
00:32:24,237 --> 00:32:26,037
Because I know Gyeong Jun.

451
00:32:27,504 --> 00:32:29,504
You're not the type Gyeong Jun
would befriend.

452
00:32:29,504 --> 00:32:31,137
I know.

453
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:34,438
I'm definitely not someone
Gyeong Jun would like.

454
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,371
I have kindness and courtesy
written all over my face.

455
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:39,304
Gyeong Jun finds that annoying.

456
00:32:39,304 --> 00:32:41,471
Your father's like that, which is why I,

457
00:32:42,104 --> 00:32:43,703
I mean, Gyeong Jun, didn't like him.

458
00:32:43,703 --> 00:32:45,770
Gyeong Jun told you about my dad?

459
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:52,137
We've come to know each
other through and through.

460
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,337
Whatever. Where's Gyeong Jun anyway?

461
00:32:55,337 --> 00:32:56,504
You talk to me.

462
00:32:56,504 --> 00:32:58,104
You're not Gyeong Jun.

463
00:32:58,104 --> 00:32:59,904
Gyeong Jun is who I'm here to see.

464
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,904
No.

465
00:33:00,904 --> 00:33:03,337
Gyeong Jun won't see you.

466
00:33:03,337 --> 00:33:05,337
Never.

467
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:07,538
Kang Gyeong Jun said he wouldn't see you.

468
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:10,471
He made it clear when he left the States.

469
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:13,204
He said he never wanted to see you
or your father again.

470
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:17,271
I'm going to marry Gyeong Jun.
We're going to be family.

471
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:21,337
That's what your father and Gyeong Jun's
mother were going to do.

472
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:24,937
Then you two would've been family,
but that never happened

473
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:26,703
because his mother died.

474
00:33:29,603 --> 00:33:36,204
Did Gyeong Jun tell you
his mother died because of me?

475
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:44,538
Is that why he still doesn't want to see me?

476
00:34:11,737 --> 00:34:17,504
But I miss him so much and worry about him.

477
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,737
Gyeong Jun's fine. There's nothing
for you to worry about,

478
00:34:20,737 --> 00:34:22,304
so go back home.

479
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:27,304
I'm sure he's thankful and a bit sorry

480
00:34:27,304 --> 00:34:30,304
that you've come all this way.

481
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:34,371
I'll tell him to get in touch with you.

482
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:36,904
He won't be able to call,
but I'm sure he'll text you.

483
00:34:37,471 --> 00:34:39,037
Look, mister.

484
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,904
How do you know Gyeong Jun?

485
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:46,404
It's a secret, you see...

486
00:34:46,404 --> 00:34:49,970
Let's just say we're one in body and soul.

487
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,271
That's all you need to know.

488
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:54,804
Don't tell me...

489
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:56,670
Are you his lover?

490
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,603
No way.

491
00:35:00,603 --> 00:35:02,670
You're out of your mind, Jang Mary.

492
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,037
You and your wild imagination.

493
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:05,737
Geez.

494
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,637
You said he hated people like me.

495
00:35:17,804 --> 00:35:19,471
You...

496
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:24,137
You're just like Gyeong Jun.

497
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:32,703
Stop mimicking him.

498
00:35:32,703 --> 00:35:36,104
Don't do that.

499
00:35:37,104 --> 00:35:39,104
You're getting on my nerves.

500
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:43,804
Just relay my message to Gyeong Jun
word for word.

501
00:35:44,337 --> 00:35:45,904
Go ahead.

502
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,504
I will

503
00:35:49,504 --> 00:35:51,037
get you

504
00:35:51,037 --> 00:35:52,837
to marry

505
00:35:52,837 --> 00:35:54,670
me.

506
00:36:09,237 --> 00:36:11,438
Ms. Gil Da Ran,

507
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,937
you'd better pass the certification exam.

508
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:21,004
It's unlikely that we will renew
our contract with you.

509
00:36:23,204 --> 00:36:25,037
I'm sorry.

510
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:30,870
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

511
00:36:31,703 --> 00:36:36,570
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

512
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:48,670
- I swear.
- Hey.

513
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,171
It's that pretty girl.

514
00:36:51,204 --> 00:36:52,770
She's so cute. She's perfect.

515
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,104
Lay off.

516
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,104
She's leaving.

517
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:13,538
Get out of the way.

518
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:19,337
Heads up. Heads up.

519
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:03,637
I saw you earlier.

520
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:09,937
You're very pretty.

521
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:13,104
I know.

522
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,904
You're bleeding.

523
00:38:21,603 --> 00:38:23,237
Will you treat my cut?

524
00:38:23,237 --> 00:38:24,670
Gross.

525
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,271
No.

526
00:38:39,737 --> 00:38:41,837
It's my number.

527
00:38:41,837 --> 00:38:43,404
Call me.

528
00:38:44,603 --> 00:38:46,104
You ruined my purse.

529
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:48,304
That's why you should call.

530
00:38:48,304 --> 00:38:51,603
I'll compensate you for the purse
with a pizza dinner.

531
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:59,804
He's clueless.

532
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,438
Pizza for the purse?

533
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:11,004
Has your friend left?

534
00:39:11,004 --> 00:39:12,137
Yeah.

535
00:39:12,137 --> 00:39:15,471
I had a good talk with her
and convinced her to leave.

536
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:19,737
Did the vice principal yell at you again?

537
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:21,137
That was a low blow,

538
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:23,504
threatening you with the job contract.

539
00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:25,904
An adult shouldn't take
such a cheap shot, should they?

540
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,670
Kang Gyeong Jun, what's up
with this suitcase?

541
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,438
Did you get this from Yun Jae's
place to go somewhere?

542
00:39:41,438 --> 00:39:43,004
Yeah...

543
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:45,337
Why?

544
00:39:45,337 --> 00:39:47,637
I had to go somewhere.

545
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:48,937
Where?

546
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:52,837
- The airport.
- What for?

547
00:39:52,837 --> 00:39:54,438
Were you planning to run away?

548
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:57,271
No. I was planning to seek refuge.

549
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:59,770
A terrible disaster has befallen me.

550
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:02,770
I mulled over

551
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,670
my options,

552
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,171
but given that my soul
is not in my body,

553
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:09,670
getting away was the only way.

554
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,004
Getting away?

555
00:40:11,004 --> 00:40:11,937
Yeah.

556
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:14,637
I was worried I'd get into trouble

557
00:40:14,637 --> 00:40:16,970
in Seo Yun Jae's body.
But I wasn't going to...

558
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,337
Did you get yourself into trouble?

559
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:22,438
Seek refuge? Give me a break.

560
00:40:22,438 --> 00:40:24,737
You were simply planning to run away.

561
00:40:24,737 --> 00:40:28,271
Kids run away from home
when they get into trouble.

562
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:31,504
You got yourself into a pickle, didn't you?

563
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,737
Last night,

564
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,670
after a bout of drinking.

565
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:46,237
I spent the night at that woman's place.

566
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:48,104
What?

567
00:40:48,104 --> 00:40:52,237
She was waiting for me when
I stepped out of Yun Jae's apartment.

568
00:40:52,237 --> 00:40:55,104
I told you she was weird.

569
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:58,104
So I was going to settle things

570
00:40:58,104 --> 00:40:59,737
once and for all.

571
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:01,904
But she took me to a bar.

572
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:03,304
Are you telling me

573
00:41:03,304 --> 00:41:06,304
you got drunk and then
slept over at her place?

574
00:41:07,703 --> 00:41:09,904
I don't remember how I got there,

575
00:41:09,904 --> 00:41:12,171
but I was at her place when I woke up.

576
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:15,737
I guess I was taken there

577
00:41:15,737 --> 00:41:18,004
when I was really drunk.

578
00:41:18,004 --> 00:41:21,070
What did you do with Yun Jae's body?

579
00:41:22,404 --> 00:41:26,204
I can't say for sure as I don't have
prior experience,

580
00:41:26,204 --> 00:41:28,603
but I don't think anything happened.

581
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:30,804
You jerk!

582
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,404
How could you do this?

583
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:36,504
You're a real jerk!

584
00:41:36,504 --> 00:41:39,171
I only wanted to get that woman
out of the way for your sake.

585
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:40,471
What do you know?

586
00:41:40,471 --> 00:41:42,637
You're only 18.

587
00:41:42,637 --> 00:41:45,504
Who are you to butt in?
I told you I trusted Yun Jae.

588
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:47,337
But why do you trust him unconditionally?

589
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:50,870
Because if you don't, you can't
become a doctor's wife?

590
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,037
It doesn't really matter for you
what Yun Jae was going to say.

591
00:41:54,037 --> 00:41:57,471
You turn a blind eye to everything
whether or not he loves you.

592
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:58,737
Is marrying him all you care about?

593
00:41:58,737 --> 00:42:01,271
Then just go ahead with the wedding
while I'm in his body.

594
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:02,870
Why not get it over and done with?

595
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,970
Where did you learn to think
such nasty things?

596
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,171
I may be younger than you, but I'm smarter.

597
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:08,804
Yeah. You're so smart.

598
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:10,837
I can't wait to see how you turn out.

599
00:42:10,837 --> 00:42:15,538
I'll grow up smart
so I don't end up like you.

600
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,304
[Eat slowly. I'll kill you
if you get indigestion!]

601
00:44:24,337 --> 00:44:25,804
What's that?

602
00:44:27,104 --> 00:44:28,237
Oh...

603
00:44:28,237 --> 00:44:30,904
Yun Jae left it with me.

604
00:44:30,904 --> 00:44:33,237
It looks heavy.

605
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:35,804
Mr. Na, you said

606
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:39,371
you were going to see a student
at Hanguk Bath Hospital, right?

607
00:44:39,371 --> 00:44:40,404
Yes.

608
00:44:40,404 --> 00:44:44,471
Couldn't you give Da Ran a ride?

609
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:47,137
Ms. Gil? In my car?

610
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:48,637
I'm fine.

611
00:44:48,637 --> 00:44:50,804
He's heading over there anyway.

612
00:44:51,637 --> 00:44:53,371
Help her out, will you?

613
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:54,804
Sure.

614
00:44:54,804 --> 00:44:58,371
I'll get the car. Wait for me
at the front gate.

615
00:45:01,337 --> 00:45:03,237
Why's he being so nice?

616
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:05,870
I told him he needed to be
nicer to his colleagues.

617
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:10,070
And he's taking my advice. Isn't this great?

618
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,471
Darn it.

619
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:30,870
Oh, man.

620
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:42,304
It was wrong of me.
I shouldn't have said I what said.

621
00:45:42,304 --> 00:45:45,937
You were beating me up
so hard. I guess I lost it.

622
00:45:45,937 --> 00:45:48,504
You were hurting me.
No, no. This isn't good.

623
00:45:49,337 --> 00:45:52,304
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

624
00:45:58,904 --> 00:46:01,837
We have to go to the hospital.

625
00:46:01,837 --> 00:46:04,404
We should drop this off at Yun Jae's first.

626
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,337
I'll take that, Ms. Gil.
Are you done for the day?

627
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,603
I told them I was leaving a bit early.

628
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,570
What if the vice principal
picks on you for leaving early?

629
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,304
What if you really get fired?

630
00:46:20,304 --> 00:46:24,970
What do I care? I'm going to be
the wife of a doctor, right?

631
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:31,504
You shouldn't let something
a kid said upset you, Ms. Gil.

632
00:46:31,504 --> 00:46:33,670
You shouldn't stoop down to a kid's level.

633
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,171
You're an adult.

634
00:46:35,703 --> 00:46:38,271
You're only a kid when it works
in your favor, right?

635
00:46:38,271 --> 00:46:40,004
That's how you can tell I'm a kid.

636
00:46:40,004 --> 00:46:42,970
If I were consistent, I'd be an adult.

637
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,737
You're so smart. You always know what to say.

638
00:46:45,737 --> 00:46:47,937
When I grow up,

639
00:46:47,937 --> 00:46:54,371
I want to be a kind adult
just like you, Ms. Gil.

640
00:47:00,703 --> 00:47:04,504
The lunch was so good, Ms. Gil.
I ate it all up.

641
00:47:04,504 --> 00:47:06,538
The kimchi was very spicy,

642
00:47:06,538 --> 00:47:09,237
but I ate every last morsel.

643
00:47:09,237 --> 00:47:10,237
Look at my belly.

644
00:47:10,237 --> 00:47:13,703
Is there anything you can't do?
You're a master chef.

645
00:47:23,504 --> 00:47:27,504
I don't want to bother you,
so I'm heading out on my own.

646
00:47:27,504 --> 00:47:29,438
Thank you.

647
00:47:31,538 --> 00:47:34,304
I will have to take time off

648
00:47:34,304 --> 00:47:37,603
as it will take some time for me
to recuperate from the accident.

649
00:47:38,538 --> 00:47:43,837
Plus, my wedding's coming up.

650
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:45,804
But what about

651
00:47:45,804 --> 00:47:50,371
the fundraiser for the pediatric
cancer patients?

652
00:47:57,404 --> 00:48:01,237
Oh, right.

653
00:48:01,237 --> 00:48:03,137
You won't miss that, though, right?

654
00:48:03,137 --> 00:48:06,770
No. I'll be back by then.

655
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:11,204
What do I have to do for the fundraiser?

656
00:48:11,204 --> 00:48:14,037
I knew Yun Jae was helping sick children,

657
00:48:14,037 --> 00:48:15,837
but I didn't know there was a fundraiser.

658
00:48:15,837 --> 00:48:19,570
Is there anything at all you know about him?

659
00:48:20,237 --> 00:48:23,438
It'll be fun for you to get to know him
once you get married, though.

660
00:48:24,603 --> 00:48:27,137
He'll be back in his body by then.

661
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,137
He must.

662
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:31,637
I have my finals to take, too.

663
00:48:31,637 --> 00:48:32,937
Seo Yun Jae.

664
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:36,570
Hello.

665
00:48:39,904 --> 00:48:41,804
The department head told us.

666
00:48:41,804 --> 00:48:43,070
You're taking a leave of absence, right?

667
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,603
Are you feeling that bad?

668
00:48:44,603 --> 00:48:47,637
I need some time off for this and that.

669
00:48:47,637 --> 00:48:50,037
Yun Jae,

670
00:48:50,037 --> 00:48:51,937
are you okay?

671
00:48:55,504 --> 00:48:59,603
Se Yeong, I'm sorry Yun Jae put you
through a lot of trouble last night.

672
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:04,304
Why didn't you call me?
I could've picked him up.

673
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:07,070
I suppose I should've done that.

674
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:11,371
Did you two drink without us?

675
00:49:11,371 --> 00:49:13,304
You should've called me, too.

676
00:49:13,304 --> 00:49:16,670
What about tonight?

677
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,337
Maybe some other time.

678
00:49:19,337 --> 00:49:22,603
You two met at my wedding.

679
00:49:22,603 --> 00:49:25,304
It's only right that you treat me
to a dinner before your wedding.

680
00:49:26,603 --> 00:49:30,538
Where should we go?

681
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:35,770
How's Min Ju?

682
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:38,804
- I heard she's expecting.
- Yes.

683
00:49:38,804 --> 00:49:41,004
She was already pregnant
when we got married.

684
00:49:41,004 --> 00:49:45,037
She was so alarmed when you fell down.
We were worried about the baby.

685
00:49:45,037 --> 00:49:46,937
I'm sorry.

686
00:49:46,937 --> 00:49:51,737
Wait a minute. You two met
because of that fall, didn't you?

687
00:49:51,737 --> 00:49:53,670
Da Ran got hurt because of Yun Jae.

688
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:57,337
Yeah. An ambulance came to the wedding hall.

689
00:49:57,337 --> 00:49:58,837
So, Yun Jae,

690
00:49:58,837 --> 00:50:01,104
your first impression of Da Ran

691
00:50:01,104 --> 00:50:05,204
must have been of her falling down
the steps and passing out.

692
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:11,570
I guess it couldn't have been
love at first sight then.

693
00:50:12,737 --> 00:50:14,570
I suppose not.

694
00:50:16,737 --> 00:50:20,371
No. It was love at first sight.

695
00:50:22,204 --> 00:50:28,004
Da Ran looked adorable unconscious.

696
00:50:28,004 --> 00:50:31,104
She looked so sweet

697
00:50:31,104 --> 00:50:32,937
that I fell for her instantly.

698
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:36,171
That's not what happened.

699
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:39,804
Stop lying, Yun Jae. You know
that I know the real story.

700
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:41,870
He's lying?

701
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,670
What do you mean?

702
00:50:44,004 --> 00:50:48,970
It wasn't at the steps that
Yun Jae saw Da Ran

703
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:51,538
for the first time.

704
00:50:51,538 --> 00:50:54,371
He said she ran right into him
with Min Ju's bouquet.

705
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,438
Could you please press
the 4th floor for me?

706
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,271
All my wife's friends are teachers, too.

707
00:51:28,271 --> 00:51:30,471
Would you like me to set you up?

708
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:32,904
Teachers make great wives.

709
00:51:32,904 --> 00:51:33,937
Hey!

710
00:51:33,937 --> 00:51:37,037
Sorry. Hey. What's up?

711
00:51:39,904 --> 00:51:42,570
This is so humiliating.

712
00:52:05,137 --> 00:52:07,337
Gil Da Ran

713
00:52:08,204 --> 00:52:10,104
I'd also like a meal ticket.

714
00:52:15,137 --> 00:52:17,703
This isn't worth $30.

715
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,271
It's so bland.

716
00:52:27,204 --> 00:52:28,670
I'll pass the certification exam

717
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:31,937
and get a job at a great school
to show those girls what's up.

718
00:52:34,538 --> 00:52:36,937
That's better.

719
00:52:42,703 --> 00:52:46,937
Yun Jae was following me around
throughout the wedding?

720
00:52:46,937 --> 00:52:49,171
Yes.

721
00:52:49,171 --> 00:52:50,703
Right?

722
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:57,837
And then he made it very clear

723
00:52:57,837 --> 00:52:59,703
he wanted to be set up with you.

724
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:02,337
Which of Min Ju's friends?

725
00:53:02,937 --> 00:53:04,204
Gil Da Ran,

726
00:53:04,204 --> 00:53:05,804
the friend who delivered your wife's bouquet.

727
00:53:06,637 --> 00:53:08,204
Why her?

728
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,937
I've been watching her. She's pretty.

729
00:53:13,271 --> 00:53:17,204
So it wasn't at the steps
that he first saw you.

730
00:53:17,204 --> 00:53:22,438
He had been smitten with you
long before then.

731
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:28,538
So that's what happened.

732
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,970
Do you still find her pretty?

733
00:53:38,703 --> 00:53:40,204
It's written all over your face.

734
00:53:40,703 --> 00:53:42,471
She's still pretty, right?

735
00:53:43,237 --> 00:53:45,637
Okay, lovebirds.

736
00:53:45,637 --> 00:53:47,438
Let's drink.

737
00:53:47,438 --> 00:53:52,070
Cheers. Cheers. Come on, Da Ran.

738
00:53:56,703 --> 00:53:58,271
Chung Sik,

739
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:01,137
are you really not eating?
The fish is very good.

740
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,037
No.

741
00:54:02,037 --> 00:54:04,538
I may be having pizza, so I have to wait.

742
00:54:04,538 --> 00:54:06,837
What do you mean you may be having pizza?

743
00:54:06,837 --> 00:54:08,637
I have to wait for someone to call.

744
00:54:08,637 --> 00:54:11,037
Why isn't she calling?

745
00:54:11,037 --> 00:54:13,137
She should have called by now.

746
00:54:15,304 --> 00:54:16,371
Wow.

747
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,004
Yes!

748
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,770
I guess he's having pizza.

749
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,804
You should have his fish.

750
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:27,970
Hello?

751
00:54:30,371 --> 00:54:31,837
Hello?

752
00:54:35,004 --> 00:54:36,603
It's you.

753
00:54:37,204 --> 00:54:39,004
I knew you'd call.

754
00:54:39,603 --> 00:54:41,237
The purse?

755
00:54:42,504 --> 00:54:46,770
I'll buy you pizza as promised.

756
00:54:52,004 --> 00:54:55,904
You owe me around 300 pizzas then.

757
00:54:55,904 --> 00:54:57,204
Excuse me.

758
00:55:03,137 --> 00:55:06,037
My father makes dumplings for a living.

759
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:09,870
My mother's a full-time homemaker,
and I'm an ordinary student.

760
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,804
If you'll be so kind,

761
00:55:11,804 --> 00:55:13,271
I'll pay you back

762
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:18,538
one pan at a time.

763
00:55:22,304 --> 00:55:24,171
Fine.

764
00:55:24,171 --> 00:55:26,137
If you do what I tell you to,

765
00:55:26,137 --> 00:55:28,603
I'll deduct a pizza from the total balance.

766
00:55:29,271 --> 00:55:32,271
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

767
00:55:32,271 --> 00:55:34,570
There's a kid named Kang Gyeong Jun
at your school, right?

768
00:55:34,837 --> 00:55:36,570
Kang Gyeong Jun?

769
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,471
The kid from the States?

770
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:44,904
So you do know him.

771
00:55:44,904 --> 00:55:46,171
That's one pizza written off your debt.

772
00:55:47,737 --> 00:55:50,104
Are you good friends with him?

773
00:55:50,104 --> 00:55:51,070
No.

774
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:54,538
Yeah. You don't seem like the type
he'd befriend anyway.

775
00:55:54,538 --> 00:55:56,504
You look too dopey.

776
00:55:58,404 --> 00:55:59,804
Are you offended?

777
00:55:59,804 --> 00:56:02,404
No. I know I'm a bit dopey.

778
00:56:02,937 --> 00:56:04,304
That's another pizza written off.

779
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:06,937
In any case,

780
00:56:06,937 --> 00:56:09,870
find out who Gyeong Jun is friends with

781
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,504
and get me their names and contact info.

782
00:56:12,104 --> 00:56:13,271
Why?

783
00:56:16,004 --> 00:56:19,204
I need to know everything about him,

784
00:56:19,204 --> 00:56:22,471
including who's in touch with him.

785
00:56:23,404 --> 00:56:27,504
But I doubt anyone's in touch
with him right now.

786
00:56:27,504 --> 00:56:28,703
Why is that?

787
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:32,937
He's hurt. He's been hospitalized.

788
00:56:34,371 --> 00:56:37,438
I'm so pretty.

789
00:56:37,438 --> 00:56:39,670
I'm so sexy.

790
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:43,104
Beauty is my weapon.

791
00:56:43,104 --> 00:56:46,271
I'm a beautiful girl.

792
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:50,204
You should be ashamed.

793
00:56:50,204 --> 00:56:52,837
Is drunken ranting something you
should be showing your student?

794
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:57,137
I'm not ranting. I'm just in a good mood.

795
00:56:57,137 --> 00:57:00,037
Plus, I only had 3 glasses of wine.

796
00:57:00,037 --> 00:57:03,104
3 full glasses of wine make a full bottle.

797
00:57:03,104 --> 00:57:05,404
But then again, you're probably
not drunk off the wine.

798
00:57:05,404 --> 00:57:07,937
You're drunk on how
Yun Jae said you were pretty.

799
00:57:07,937 --> 00:57:09,870
Do you think so?

800
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:14,904
Yun Jae thought I was pretty and was
smitten with me as soon as he saw me.

801
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:19,870
He's so superficial.

802
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,804
You have to love what's on the inside
for the relationship to last.

803
00:57:22,804 --> 00:57:25,904
If he fell for you just for your looks,

804
00:57:25,904 --> 00:57:28,004
how can you marry him?

805
00:57:28,004 --> 00:57:29,570
For adults, you two are so...

806
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:30,870
What?

807
00:57:34,304 --> 00:57:37,171
It's not easy being drunk, huh?

808
00:57:37,171 --> 00:57:39,471
Your knees buckle and your pupils
dilate, right? Given your age...

809
00:57:39,471 --> 00:57:40,837
Stop.

810
00:57:41,504 --> 00:57:43,703
I have a favor to ask you.

811
00:57:43,703 --> 00:57:46,404
Stop babbling

812
00:57:46,404 --> 00:57:49,304
and just look at me.

813
00:57:49,304 --> 00:57:50,770
What?

814
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:55,337
Can you keep your mouth shut
so I can pretend I'm with Yun Jae?

815
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:02,204
Yun Jae,

816
00:58:02,837 --> 00:58:06,104
did you really find me that pretty?

817
00:58:06,104 --> 00:58:10,304
Why didn't you tell me?

818
00:58:10,304 --> 00:58:15,371
Then there would have been
electricity and sparks between us.

819
00:58:18,004 --> 00:58:20,137
Like this.

820
00:58:21,471 --> 00:58:26,504
I really love you.

821
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:31,570
I found you beautiful, too,
right from the start.

822
00:58:32,404 --> 00:58:35,770
Stop it. I'm Kang Gyeong Jun.

823
00:58:39,703 --> 00:58:44,204
That's right. You're Gyeong Jun.

824
00:59:10,137 --> 00:59:11,837
Gyeong Jun.

825
00:59:15,804 --> 00:59:17,603
Gyeong Jun.

826
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,703
Gyeong Jun.

827
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:35,337
Kang Gyeong Jun.

828
00:59:37,137 --> 00:59:39,204
Gyeong Jun.

829
00:59:40,237 --> 00:59:42,570
Gyeong Jun.

830
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,037
Kang Gyeong Jun.

831
00:59:49,037 --> 00:59:50,703
Aren't you going home?

832
00:59:50,703 --> 00:59:53,703
Don't you think Yun Jae is acting
a bit strange these days?

833
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:56,137
Yeah. Who knew that workaholic
would take a long break?

834
00:59:57,904 --> 01:00:00,570
I guess his perspective changed
after the accident.

835
01:00:01,371 --> 01:00:02,937
I'm off.

836
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:07,603
Yeah. He does seem like a different person.

837
01:00:07,603 --> 01:00:10,371
It's as though he's not Yun Jae anymore.

838
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,337
How did you manage for so long

839
01:00:13,337 --> 01:00:16,737
without electricity and sparks?

840
01:00:16,737 --> 01:00:18,904
It wasn't easy.

841
01:00:18,904 --> 01:00:21,703
But now, I know how Yun Jae
really feels about me.

842
01:00:21,703 --> 01:00:24,070
When he comes back,
I'm showering him with love.

843
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:27,037
You're going overboard, Gil Teacher.

844
01:00:27,037 --> 01:00:29,337
I think his friend made it all up

845
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:31,837
for free dinner and booze.

846
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,471
It makes no sense that

847
01:00:34,471 --> 01:00:38,337
a guy wouldn't show his 6-pack
to a woman he's in love with.

848
01:00:38,337 --> 01:00:40,271
What do you know anyway?
You're still a kid.

849
01:00:40,271 --> 01:00:43,304
Adults and kids are no different
when it comes to love.

850
01:00:43,304 --> 01:00:46,670
Love is about moving forward.

851
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:49,637
When a man stops short,
that means his love is no more.

852
01:00:49,637 --> 01:00:52,137
Do you get it?

853
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:56,438
Things may have been moving slowly,
but they didn't stop fully.

854
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:01,237
Oh, really?

855
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:03,304
So how far did you get with him?

856
01:01:03,304 --> 01:01:04,937
I can't tell you. You're too young.

857
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:09,137
I have a feeling you two were at
a level fit for the general audience.

858
01:01:11,404 --> 01:01:12,271
What?

859
01:01:12,271 --> 01:01:13,837
Wow.

860
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,670
So this is nothing, eh?

861
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:17,371
So you two hold hands often?

862
01:01:17,371 --> 01:01:19,070
Of course.

863
01:01:22,271 --> 01:01:24,104
What are you doing?

864
01:01:24,104 --> 01:01:25,371
Wow.

865
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:27,970
So you've done this every now and again.

866
01:01:29,304 --> 01:01:32,137
We're engaged. Duh.

867
01:01:32,137 --> 01:01:34,770
Unlike you, we're not little kids.

868
01:01:37,104 --> 01:01:38,471
Uh-oh!

869
01:01:38,471 --> 01:01:40,471
You're extremely tense.

870
01:01:41,504 --> 01:01:43,703
So this is as far as you got?

871
01:01:45,504 --> 01:01:51,471
That means even I, a little kid,
has gotten farther than you.

872
01:01:52,737 --> 01:01:56,637
This is about where you got to, right?

873
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:02,570
You haven't gone to the next base, have you?

874
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,204
Yes, I have.

875
01:02:39,737 --> 01:02:41,104
[Big]

876
01:02:41,471 --> 01:02:44,004
He's a doctor at this hospital?

877
01:02:44,004 --> 01:02:45,570
Why did they lie to me?

878
01:02:46,104 --> 01:02:48,104
Mary will try to stay by my side

879
01:02:48,104 --> 01:02:50,237
24-7.

880
01:02:50,237 --> 01:02:52,171
What? Gyeong Jun's not interested in anyone.

881
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:54,171
Yes, he is. Right here.

882
01:02:56,804 --> 01:02:59,204
These don't look like Gyeong Jun's clothes.

883
01:02:59,204 --> 01:03:01,471
Has someone been
coming by here?

884
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:04,171
Maybe Gyeong Jun's been
in touch with his father.

885
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:06,404
You're going to withdraw everything?

886
01:03:07,271 --> 01:03:10,204
Are you going to hold on to
the key to my place or not?

887
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:11,271
It was the key to your place?

888
01:03:11,271 --> 01:03:12,237
What's this key for?

889
01:03:12,237 --> 01:03:13,570
Why did Yun Jae have this?

890
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,237
Actually, the key...

891
01:03:15,237 --> 01:03:18,070
Could I have Dr. Lee Se Yeong's
home address?
