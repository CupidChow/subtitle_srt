1
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:17,221
Yun Jae?

2
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,387
Still?

3
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:31,188
Are you

4
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:32,620
Gyeong Jun?

5
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,954
Yes, Ms. Gil Da Ran.

6
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,254
Let's go back to the hospital.
[Episode 2]

7
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:39,921
This is the hospital's fault.

8
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:41,254
It was medical malpractice,

9
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:43,887
so if we go and tell them,
they'll switch you back.

10
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:45,587
What do we tell them?

11
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,754
So you'll say

12
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:48,954
your student's soul is now
in your fiance's body?

13
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:51,487
That they should put the right soul
in the right body?

14
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:55,221
They'll tell us we're crazy,
but they'd figure out a treatment.

15
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,387
They'll lock us all up
in a mental institution.

16
00:00:58,387 --> 00:01:02,054
My body won't be going anywhere.
It will be at that hospital.

17
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:04,520
You can go alone. I don't
want to go back there.

18
00:01:05,554 --> 00:01:08,587
But you can't just hide from the problem.
Stop being childish.

19
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:10,054
But I am a kid.

20
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:11,320
I'm only 18.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,620
Then you should listen to your elders.

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,620
Let's go, Kang Gyeong Jun.

23
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,854
Don't treat me like a baby.
Look at my old dude face.

24
00:01:17,854 --> 00:01:19,353
This is no time to be joking around.

25
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:22,487
And this is no time for you to be
stubborn like a stuffy adult either.

26
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:26,221
Why doesn't it occur to you to ask me
the details of what happened?

27
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,654
Fine. Tell me.

28
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:40,487
I, Seo Yun Jae, got into an accident.

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,787
Crash.

30
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:47,221
When my life was teetering,
my soul left my body.

31
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:51,021
Seo Yun Jae's soul, thinking
his body had died,

32
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:54,320
slyly slipped into my body.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,520
Huh?

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,254
But Yun Jae is not the sly type.
He'd never take what isn't his.

35
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,221
Whatever.

36
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:07,654
So my soul had no choice but to slip
into Seo Yun Jae's body.

37
00:02:07,654 --> 00:02:11,787
This is all Seo Yun Jae's fault
for slipping into the wrong body.

38
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:16,820
But Yun Jae always thinks things
through very carefully.

39
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,154
He's the not the type to make
a mistake like this.

40
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:23,754
Whatever.

41
00:02:23,754 --> 00:02:25,654
Seo Yun Jae's soul has to wake up

42
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:28,787
before we can do

43
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:30,554
anything at all.

44
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:42,954
Yun Jae,

45
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,021
how did this happen?

46
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,620
Why did you have to slip into
his body of all things?

47
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,820
Of all things?

48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,787
I don't like being in this either.

49
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,288
Yun Jae doesn't drink soda.
Please drink something else.

50
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:06,720
What?

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,787
This isn't your body. It's Yun Jae's.

52
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:15,520
Please treat it with care until
you can return to your own body.

53
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,654
With care? How?

54
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:21,087
Do what Yun Jae always did

55
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:23,854
and drink water instead of soda
if you're thirsty.

56
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:26,353
And it's still a bit chilly.
This is too thin.

57
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:28,254
Don't you have anything warmer?

58
00:03:28,254 --> 00:03:30,754
You should've gotten all the tests
done at the hospital.

59
00:03:30,754 --> 00:03:33,054
There's a scratch.

60
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:34,620
Oh, no.

61
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:38,620
Hang on.

62
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,787
I would like my soul to be elsewhere

63
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,288
when you're poring over his body,

64
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:45,453
but I can't do that.

65
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:49,288
At this rate, I might have
a nervous breakdown.

66
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:53,054
Kang Gyeong Jun,

67
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:55,520
please take good care of Yun Jae's body.

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,054
He's very important to me.

69
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:06,054
I'm going back to the hospital
to see how your body's doing.

70
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:10,021
Let me see your phone.

71
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:11,288
My phone?

72
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,654
Who're you calling?

73
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:20,954
My maternal uncle.

74
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:22,854
Ask them what the situation is.

75
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:24,154
Hello?

76
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:27,754
Is this Gyeong Jun's uncle?

77
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:30,554
I guess they must have already
contacted the school.

78
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,254
We moved Gyeong Jun to Hanguk Bath Hospital.

79
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:35,487
Oh...

80
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:39,754
If Gyeong Jun wakes up,

81
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:43,320
please let me know.

82
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Okay.

83
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,720
They moved your body to a hospital in Seoul.

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,387
I heard. This dude has good hearing.

85
00:04:56,221 --> 00:05:00,654
So do you live alone here?

86
00:05:01,954 --> 00:05:03,654
What if your uncle and aunt come over?

87
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:06,487
You can't be here like this.

88
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:08,420
I live alone.

89
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,487
They'll never come by.

90
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:10,453
You should go.

91
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:17,921
Will you be okay alone?

92
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:23,587
You were in a major accident,
and you're not yourself either.

93
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:28,453
This must be overwhelming.
Are you sure you'll be okay?

94
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:33,288
You're pretending to care about me,
so you can watch over his body.

95
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:35,587
I'll be fine. Go.

96
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:38,554
I'll give him a good night's sleep.

97
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:05,787
Only sodas and frozen foods.

98
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:08,787
Is this all he eats?

99
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:34,154
He's huge.

100
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:36,787
Too big.

101
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:50,520
I don't have to go to school.

102
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:55,154
Yes!

103
00:07:06,353 --> 00:07:07,787
Oops.

104
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:15,353
All for his precious body.

105
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,387
"Please take good care of it."

106
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:21,154
I won't eat any of this.

107
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:56,654
You're in there, right?

108
00:07:57,254 --> 00:07:58,987
Right?

109
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:11,021
Are you cold?

110
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:20,854
Your hand's so warm.

111
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:24,520
Maybe it's because I was holding
the coffee with it.

112
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,554
They say your hand temperature mirrors
the temperature of your soul.

113
00:08:28,554 --> 00:08:33,587
Your hand's super warm because
you're a warm person.

114
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:40,188
I bet you have the warmest
hands in the world.

115
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:51,654
It's warm.

116
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:59,787
There is only person

117
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:01,887
who has such warm hands.

118
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:05,854
And here you are.

119
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,143
[Gil Family Dumplings]

120
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:31,720
Da Ran just got in.

121
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,754
She spent the night out.

122
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:37,021
I bet she was with Yun Jae.

123
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:40,288
It's our daughter we're talking about.

124
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,720
They'll be married in a month
anyway. Who cares?

125
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,021
I was actually worried something
might be wrong with Yun Jae

126
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:49,188
because he always brought Da Ran
back home so early.

127
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,854
But no more worrying.

128
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:56,954
Should we ask Yun Jae over for grilled eel?

129
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:03,054
Don't make it so obvious.
You'll embarrass the kids.

130
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:05,087
You're right.

131
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:09,487
You have to do it less blatantly.

132
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:12,654
How can we make him eat eel
without his knowing though?

133
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:19,087
We can make dumplings with eel.

134
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,487
Eel dumplings.

135
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,987
Should I grow facial hair?

136
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:28,921
It's not my body anyway.

137
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:35,520
Why am I itchy all over?

138
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Does this dude have skin problems?

139
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,487
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

140
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:21,387
Da Ran,

141
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:24,587
he looks like Yun Jae.

142
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,154
Hang on. Hang on.

143
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,921
Gil Da Ran!

144
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:39,154

Gil Da Ran!

146
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:43,854
Give me some money.

147
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:44,787
- Just $10.
- What?

148
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,554
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

149
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:51,687
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

150
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,288
- Oh my gosh.
- Go.

151
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,320
Go away.

152
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:13,353
I'm going to lose it. I'm burning up.

153
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:14,188
What?

154
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:16,154
Help me.

155
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,188
Look at me. My body's on fire.

156
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:26,254
You're nuts.

157
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:28,687
Come. I'll show you.

158
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:33,520
Who is he?

159
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,587
Da Ran's fiance.

160
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,254
What's wrong with him?

161
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:40,720
- Hurry.
- What happened?

162
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,054
It's itchy and hot. It's driving me mad.

163
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,387
Oh my goodness. What's going on?

164
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:46,720
Something's wrong with this dude.

165
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,353
Is he sick or something?

166
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:49,887

And the butt.

170
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:00,854
What are we going to do?

171
00:13:01,353 --> 00:13:03,453
- How did this happen?
- I don't know.

172
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:04,687
Please.

173
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:07,387
Oh, mother. Oh, father. Oh, please.

174
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,887
Oh geez.

175

Oh, yes. Right there.

Oh, please. Geez.

177

Such a vile act on school grounds!

178
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:28,221
It's mushroom allergy.

179

You'll be fine once you take the medication
and put the ointment on.

180
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,487
I should have asked you about his allergies.

181
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:39,754
I feel dizzy.

182
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:48,954
Is our school infirmary a free clinic
or a public hospital?

183
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,954
I'm flabbergasted.

184
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:55,221
Is he mentally challenged?

185
00:13:57,154 --> 00:14:00,487
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

186
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:04,787
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

187
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:08,587
I spent all the money I had
on the cab fare yesterday.

188
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:11,820
His body was acting up, but I
couldn't go to a hospital.

189
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,387
I came to you because I was worried
something would happen

190
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,987
to your precious fiance's body.

191
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:19,188
Did you get chewed out badly?

192
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:21,320
Do you feel better now?

193
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,487
Yeah.

194
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,520
This dude must be really healthy.

195
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,353
The medication is working wonders.

196
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:34,420
Go home and have some lunch.

197
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:36,787
And don't forget to take the medication.

198
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:41,353
I wouldn't have had to bother you
if I only had my wallet.

199

I'll pay you back once I get my wallet back.

200
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:55,254
Did you get yelled at?

201
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,887
I'm just upset.

202
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:06,320
Yun Jae is smart and has great manners.

203
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,554
I don't want people thinking
he is mentally challenged.

204
00:15:10,554 --> 00:15:14,921
I feel so bad as to what this has done
to his reputation.

205
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:19,520
Go home and stay put.

206
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,554
Don't go out and cause trouble again.

207
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:26,188
I'll bring you whatever you need.

208
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:30,121
Bring me what I need?

209
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:31,520
I'm all set.

210
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,921
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

211
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:36,487
Head straight home.

212
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:38,787
Don't go anywhere else.

213
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:53,954
This is a cool shirt.

214
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,654
It looks awesome on my real body.

215
00:15:57,654 --> 00:16:00,453
It looks stupid just because
it's on this body.

216
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:45,921
I can dress like this
once I get my wallet back.

I came by the hospital to see Yun Jae,

234
00:18:36,054 --> 00:18:38,154
but he must be busy.

Pardon? Yun Jae is at the hospital?

Hello, doctor. Have you had lunch?

- What's going on?

00:22:47,587 --> 00:22:49,754
Is something wrong?

290
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:54,787
You look sick.

291
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,921
I had mushrooms.

It must have been pretty bad then.

295
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:05,054
Yeah. It's been very bad.

00:23:13,288 --> 00:23:16,154
you still have what I gave you, right?

299
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:17,654
Huh?

300
00:23:17,654 --> 00:23:20,420
Oh, that.

301
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,654
I gave it to you for a situation like this.

302
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:27,054
Don't be bashful and just
do as I tell you to.

How can you come here alone
without telling me?

309
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,587
I didn't know he was a doctor.

310
00:24:03,587 --> 00:24:05,453
And I only came to see my body.

311
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:06,453
Your body?

312
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:09,154
I'd like to know how it's doing.

313
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,520
And there's something important
I need to retrieve.

314
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:18,221
Then come with me.

315
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:21,654
Put this on.

316
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:27,387
By the way, Gil Teacher,

317
00:24:27,387 --> 00:24:31,288
this dude has a female colleague, right?

318
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,620
She's odd.

319
00:24:34,021 --> 00:24:38,754
She touched his body in a strange way.

320
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:42,854
You're making people think
Yun Jae is mentally challenged.

321
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:46,087
Don't make them think
he's a pervert as well.

322
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:47,221
What? A pervert?

323
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:48,887
I know boys your age

324
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,154
are very sensitive to a woman's touch.

325
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:54,288
I know. I'm a high school teacher.

328
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,254
What will she think?

329
00:25:00,254 --> 00:25:04,453
You're being delusional again.

330
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:06,021
I'm sure you also know that
the more you nag boys my age,

331
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:09,921
the more we want to rebel,
don't you, Ms. Gil?

332
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:14,854
Mentally-challenged, perverted,
and incompetent...

333

if you don't want me to add

334
00:25:17,054 --> 00:25:19,021
delinquent to the list.

335
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:21,754
I'm at a very emotional age.

336
00:25:30,221 --> 00:25:33,854
Lying there on Yun Jae's bed
in Yun Jae's clothes

337
00:25:33,854 --> 00:25:37,087
and in Yun Jae's hospital

338
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:39,154
makes it seem you really are Yun Jae.

339
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:41,121
Yeah, so...

340
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:42,720
Don't say anything for a second.

341
00:25:57,353 --> 00:25:59,787
Give me your hand.

342
00:26:10,587 --> 00:26:13,087
It's not warm.

343
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:15,288
The temperature of your soul is different.

344
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:19,854
You're not Yun Jae, so your hand
isn't as warm as his.

345
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:21,453
I'm relieved.

346
00:26:21,453 --> 00:26:23,420
I like being cool.

347
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:32,188
Let's go.

348
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:55,954
I...

349
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:58,054
I took his hand.

350
00:26:58,054 --> 00:26:59,921
What?

351
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,387
In the water...

352
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:09,288
I thought I was going to die.

353
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:12,453
I saw him holding his hand out to me.

354
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:18,754
I knew that was the only chance at survival,

355
00:27:18,754 --> 00:27:21,188
so I took his hand.

356
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,854
Maybe that's how my soul
slipped into his body.

357
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:43,453
If you and Yun Jae switched bodies
by holding hands,

358
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:47,453
wouldn't you switch back
if you held hands again?

359
00:27:49,353 --> 00:27:51,288
What if I don't wake up?

360
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:54,154
You will. Hurry up and hold his hand.

361
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,320
Da Ran.

362
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,453
It's me.

363
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:46,320
Yun Jae.

364
00:28:47,587 --> 00:28:51,320
I was so worried.

365
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,320
It felt like this happened to you
because I complained.

366
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,221
It seemed like it was my fault.
I was so worried.

367
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:06,787
I'm sorry about what I said.

368
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:11,387
I'm sorry, too.

369
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:18,754
I'll say what I was going to tell you.

370
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,754
I'm sorry.

371
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,320
It didn't work.

372
00:29:45,154 --> 00:29:46,720
It didn't work.

373
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,887
I'm still Kang Gyeong Jun.

374
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:52,620
You look very disappointed.

375
00:29:54,987 --> 00:29:56,887
Hello.

376
00:29:56,887 --> 00:30:00,387
Gil Teacher, snap out of it. Where are you?

377
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:24,520
Does this seem like a joke to you?

378
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,387
Is this funny to you?

379
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:32,720
Do adults cry over a kid's joke?

380
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,254
It's my fault for being fooled by you.

381
00:30:43,554 --> 00:30:47,320
It's not my fault we didn't switch over.
Why is she lashing out at me?

382
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,320
Where's my stuff?

383
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,487
Doctor.

384
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,487
You're here.

385
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:07,453
How's Gyeong Jun?

386
00:31:08,054 --> 00:31:10,021
Hello.

387
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:12,854
He's still in a coma.

388
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:17,021
But they say he's not hurt.
Why won't he wake up?

389
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:20,720
He won't be comatose forever, will he?

390
00:31:21,487 --> 00:31:24,420
He's not hurt, so he should wake up.

391
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,021
I heard that some people
stay like this for years.

392
00:31:27,021 --> 00:31:30,021
Then do we have to keep taking care of him?

393
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,687
He'll wake up, right?

394
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,921
If he doesn't, what will you do?

395
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:42,820
We're not his guardians per se, doctor.

396
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,554
We're just relatives looking after him.

397
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:47,288
You shouldn't be asking us

398
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:49,387
what we'll do about him
if he remains comatose.

399
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:50,687
Gyeong Mi.

400
00:31:50,687 --> 00:31:52,353
What?

401
00:31:53,554 --> 00:31:55,387
Excuse us, doctor.

402
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,854
Good grief.

403
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:07,087
If worse comes to worst, can we
send him to the States?

404
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:08,887
Who'll take him in?

405
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:12,288
He grew up there. I'm sure he knows people.

406
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,021
He doesn't have anyone.
That's why he came to Korea.

407
00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:16,654
Excuse me.

408
00:32:16,654 --> 00:32:18,787
What would you like us to do
with his personal effects?

409
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,987
- Gyeong Jun.
- Leave me alone.

410
00:33:27,987 --> 00:33:29,154
Gyeong Jun.

411
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:30,720
Just leave me alone.

412
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,221
- Gyeong Jun.
- What?

413
00:33:32,787 --> 00:33:36,487
Are you worried people will think
your precious fiance is a maniac?

414
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:37,887
Are you welling up again?

415
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:40,420
Then leave me alone before
I make things worse.

416
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:45,021
I'm sure you're upset about what
you heard. I can't just take off.

417
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:46,520
Don't pretend to be concerned.

418
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,987
You're just like my uncle.

419
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:52,787
You're just worried I'll be inside
your precious fiance's body forever.

420
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:54,787
I'm a hindrance to you
just like I am to my uncle.

421
00:33:54,787 --> 00:33:56,420
Stop acting concerned.

422
00:33:56,921 --> 00:33:58,453
Gyeong Jun.

423
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:01,921
I'll only get worse if you keep this up.

424
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:05,288
Da Ran.

425
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:16,720
Yun Jae,

426
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,787
did you just push my sister?

427
00:34:18,787 --> 00:34:20,921
Why were you yelling at her?

428
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:23,221
Chung Sik, this isn't your concern.

429
00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:24,087
Just go.

430
00:34:24,087 --> 00:34:27,420
He came to school this morning
and was acting strangely,

431
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,387
so I came to ask him what happened.
I'm glad that I came.

432
00:34:33,587 --> 00:34:38,854
I thought you were a good guy,
but I must have been wrong.

433
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:42,921
Yun Jae.

434
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:44,987
I'm not your brother-in-law, okay?

435
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:53,921
Wouldn't your husband be

436
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:57,221
my brother-in-law?

437
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:00,687
I'm confused.

438
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:02,254
Stupid.

439
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,554
Stupid?

440
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:12,021
Did you just insult me?

441
00:35:12,954 --> 00:35:15,221
Chung Sik, Chung Sik. Stop it.

442
00:35:15,221 --> 00:35:17,087
Hold on.

443
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,021
Yun Jae.

444
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:24,921
Yun Jae.

445
00:35:25,254 --> 00:35:27,221
Stupid.

446
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:31,520
Don't meddle and just go home.

447
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,254
He's treating you badly though.

448
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,288
Just stay out of it.

449
00:35:40,288 --> 00:35:41,987
The more you meddle, the more
complicated things will get.

450
00:35:41,987 --> 00:35:44,687
Go home. Just do as I say. Go.

451
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:17,121
Drink water instead of soda
if you're thirsty.

452
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:10,787
There's mom's inheritance,

453
00:37:10,787 --> 00:37:12,720
so they won't abandon you just yet.

454
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:19,353
You shouldn't worry.

455
00:37:46,387 --> 00:37:47,887
Huh?

456
00:37:48,654 --> 00:37:50,487
But they threw these out.

457
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,654
Dumplings?

458
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:10,654
Gil Family Dumplings?

459
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:13,121
Gil Family?

460
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:14,687
Gil?

461
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:17,854
Gil Da Ran?

462
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,254
Da Ran,

463
00:38:22,854 --> 00:38:25,487
did Yun Jae break off the engagement?

464
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,921
He said he wasn't my brother-in-law.

465
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:31,188
Is that why he didn't answer my call?

466
00:38:31,188 --> 00:38:32,453
You see,

467
00:38:32,453 --> 00:38:34,921
Yun Jae's going through a rough patch.

468
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:36,854
He insulted me, too.

469
00:38:36,854 --> 00:38:38,387
He called me stupid.

470
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:40,387
He acted like he didn't even know me.

471
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:43,221
He completely ignored dad.

472
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:45,221
It wasn't Yun Jae.

473
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:46,520
Then

474
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,754
who was it that I saw earlier?

475
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:51,654
And who was the guy who
pretended he didn't know me?

476
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:55,887
That was Yun Jae, of course.

477
00:38:57,687 --> 00:38:59,387
He broke it off.

478
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:00,887
Yes, he did.

479
00:39:11,353 --> 00:39:13,620
It's you, Yun Jae!

480
00:39:14,587 --> 00:39:16,820
Did you like the dumplings?

481
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:21,954
Guess what was inside.

482
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:23,154
Pardon?

483
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:24,887
Just guess.

484
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:30,087
Meat?

485
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:31,288
Nope.

486
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:36,320
- Shrimp?
- No.

487
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,687
I'll give you a hint.

488
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:41,221
It's slimy, and it wriggles
when you try to catch it.

489
00:39:41,221 --> 00:39:44,420
It wriggles like this.

490
00:39:45,288 --> 00:39:46,654
It's long.

491
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:47,620
Long?

492
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,154
Yup. Long and slimy.

493
00:39:52,154 --> 00:39:54,887
Long and slimy...

494
00:39:58,288 --> 00:39:59,487
Eel.

495
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:02,854
That's right. How did you know?

496
00:40:02,854 --> 00:40:04,254
Let's go in.

497
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:07,121
Hon, hon, hon,

498
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:11,520
Yun Jae guessed what we
put in the dumplings.

499
00:40:17,221 --> 00:40:19,554
Mom.

500
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:22,554
Mom? Hon?

501
00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:27,820
So she's Gil Da Ran's mother?

502
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,221
Then she's Seo Yun Jae's mother-in-law.

503
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:33,654
That guy is her husband,

504
00:40:33,654 --> 00:40:35,221
so he's Seo Yun Jae's father-in-law.

505
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:38,987
And he's Gil Da Ran's brother,
which makes him

506
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:40,554
Seo Yun Jae's brother-in-law.

507
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,787
Hello, sir.

508
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:48,387
Hi, Yun Jae.

509
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:51,820
- Hi, Chung Sik.
- Hi, Yun Jae.

510
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:54,854
Hello, ma'am.

511
00:40:54,854 --> 00:40:58,021
It's been so long.

512
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,921
Hi, Yun Jae.

513
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,687
Surprise!

514
00:41:15,254 --> 00:41:18,520
Why did you come here?
What were you thinking?

515
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,154
I came to see you, right?

516
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:21,687
But then this lady suddenly
showed up and asked me,

517
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,554
"Guess what was in the dumplings?"

518
00:41:24,554 --> 00:41:26,921
"Wriggle, wriggle."

519
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:28,720
"You got it."

520
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,353
And then she dragged me inside.

521
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:32,387
I don't believe this.

522
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:35,453
But thank goodness I was quick on my toes.

523
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:38,387
What if I had said, "Who are you"
to your mother?

524
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:42,754
I was smart and said my proper hellos,
so you take care of the rest.

525
00:41:42,754 --> 00:41:43,620
Bye.

526
00:41:45,188 --> 00:41:46,654
Where do you think you're going?

527
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:50,954
You came here as Yun Jae,
so you need to do your part.

528
00:41:50,954 --> 00:41:52,087
What?

529
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,554
I guess the engagement is still on.

530
00:41:58,554 --> 00:42:01,288
He was a bit loopy because
he was in a car accident.

531
00:42:01,288 --> 00:42:04,654
I shouldn't have taken it the wrong way.

532
00:42:04,654 --> 00:42:07,854
Talk things through with Yun Jae over beer

533
00:42:07,854 --> 00:42:09,954
and some spicy dumpling stew.

534
00:42:10,254 --> 00:42:11,453
Chung Sik. Chung Sik.

535
00:42:11,453 --> 00:42:12,620
Get a few bottles of beer
from the store fridge.

536
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,754
Beer.

537
00:42:15,587 --> 00:42:17,154
Why's he all excited?

538
00:42:18,687 --> 00:42:20,453
Get some soju, too.

539
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:22,520
You deal with it.
I don't want to be involved.

540
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,654
Then should I tell them
your soul's in Yun Jae's body?

541
00:42:24,654 --> 00:42:26,387
They'll drag you to a mental hospital.

542
00:42:26,387 --> 00:42:27,620
You need to cooperate if you
don't want anyone to find out.

543
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,554
It'll become more obvious with time anyway.

544
00:42:29,554 --> 00:42:31,887
Yes, but we should at least try to hide it.

545
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:34,254
Hide what?

546
00:42:34,554 --> 00:42:37,620
See? It's happening already.

547
00:42:42,787 --> 00:42:45,221
What are you two hiding?

548
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,387
You don't need to know. It's adult stuff.

549
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:53,620
Let's go, Yun Jae.

550
00:42:56,787 --> 00:42:58,587
It's adult stuff.

551
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:03,087
You're too young.

552
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:08,087
Wow.

553
00:43:11,054 --> 00:43:12,687
Take a seat.

554
00:43:13,587 --> 00:43:14,987
Da Ran. Da Ran.

555
00:43:14,987 --> 00:43:16,387
Yes, mom.

556
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,954
Something wrong?

557
00:44:04,587 --> 00:44:08,854
Would you like a pair of socks?

558
00:44:09,854 --> 00:44:11,954
No, thank you. This is how I like it.

559
00:44:19,921 --> 00:44:23,154
I heard you were in a car accident.

560
00:44:23,154 --> 00:44:24,820
Are you okay now?

561
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,687
As you can see...

562
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:30,854
So you're okay?

563
00:44:31,854 --> 00:44:33,487
I'm good.

564
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,654
It's itchy.

565
00:44:43,654 --> 00:44:45,620
This body has an allergy.

566
00:44:48,054 --> 00:44:51,054
You sure have a lot of stones.

567
00:44:52,854 --> 00:44:57,654
My viewing stones? I collect them.

568
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:04,554
I didn't know people collected stones.

569
00:45:08,654 --> 00:45:10,087
Ouch.

570
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:12,453
You shouldn't touch...

571
00:45:13,987 --> 00:45:16,887
These here are my family.

572
00:45:18,087 --> 00:45:20,720
The large black one is me.

573
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,520
The pretty white one is Da Ran's mom.

574
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,654
This smooth one is Da Ran.

575
00:45:26,654 --> 00:45:30,154
And this tiny one is Chung Sik.

576
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,854
You're literally the Flintstones.

577
00:45:39,754 --> 00:45:43,387
Daddy Flintstone,
Mommy Flintstone,

578
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:45,453
and Baby Flintstones...

579
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:50,754
Yeah...

580
00:45:51,754 --> 00:45:55,620
Since you're now part of the family,

581
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:00,121
let's pick one for you to place
right next to Da Ran's.

582
00:46:00,587 --> 00:46:01,754
No thanks.

583
00:46:01,754 --> 00:46:04,387
It's ridiculous.

584
00:46:07,654 --> 00:46:09,654
I mean, should we look
for the son-in-law flintstone?

585
00:46:09,654 --> 00:46:10,720
So this is where it'll go, right?

586
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,820
Yes. This is your place.

587
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,854
So what are the standards
you use to pick out a stone?

588
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:18,720
Standards?

589
00:46:19,587 --> 00:46:22,687
I can't figure it out.

590
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:25,254
If size was your standard,

591
00:46:25,254 --> 00:46:27,620
then this should be Chung Sik
as he's the biggest,

592
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:35,121
followed by Mrs. Gil, Da Ran, and then you.

593
00:46:35,654 --> 00:46:38,687
But if beauty were your standard,

594
00:46:38,687 --> 00:46:44,221
this one should be Mrs. Gil
as she's the prettiest,

595
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:49,320
then Chung Sik, then Da Ran, then you.

596
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,054
You need to tell me what your standards are,

597
00:46:54,087 --> 00:46:55,887
sir.

598
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,854
That's right.

599
00:46:58,854 --> 00:47:02,353
Despite being the smallest
and ugliest member of this family,

600
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:06,021
I picked out the best stone for myself.
You must not be happy with that.

601
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:07,720
Oh, no no no no.

602
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,121
I just wanted to know which stone
would best represent me

603
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:13,854
according to your standards.

604
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:20,687
The standard you should focus on
is compatibility.

605
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:24,154
That is, how your stone can fit in
with the rest of the stones here.

606
00:47:24,154 --> 00:47:25,453
Compatibility.

607
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,587
That's what you should focus on.

608
00:47:28,587 --> 00:47:32,487
You don't have to pick out a stone
if you don't want to though.

609
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,887
That's what adults do when
they don't have the answer.

610
00:47:37,887 --> 00:47:39,754
They give you an abstract,
long-winded sermon.

611
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:43,254
Compatibility?

612
00:47:43,254 --> 00:47:44,987
What is that?

613
00:47:45,754 --> 00:47:47,787
Plus, this is Seo Yun Jae's spot, not mine.

614
00:47:47,787 --> 00:47:49,654
The oh-so-perfect Seo Yun Jae
should figure it out.

615
00:47:59,288 --> 00:48:00,954
You're making so much noise.

616
00:48:03,353 --> 00:48:05,954
I can't eat food this hot and spicy.

617
00:48:05,954 --> 00:48:07,487
It won't kill you.

618
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:09,954
Keep it down. Keep it down.

619
00:48:12,987 --> 00:48:17,921
The stew must be too spicy for you.
How about a nice, cold beer?

620
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:19,387
Alcohol?

621
00:48:19,387 --> 00:48:21,054
Why not? Sure. Sure.

622
00:48:22,288 --> 00:48:24,188
It won't kill me.

623
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:28,921
Dad, Yun Jae has to drive.

624
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:33,453
My car was wrecked in the accident.

625
00:48:34,387 --> 00:48:38,520
You shouldn't drink.
You're still recovering.

626
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,121
One glass will help me
get a good night's sleep.

627
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:43,387
Please, sir.

628
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,921
Dad, dad. Me too.

629
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:48,453
You're only 18. No drinks for minors.

630
00:48:48,453 --> 00:48:49,654
You're too young.

631
00:48:49,654 --> 00:48:50,954
No.

632
00:48:53,121 --> 00:48:55,754
You really are a teacher
through and through.

633
00:48:55,754 --> 00:49:00,620
That's right. I can't let any
student of mine drink.

634
00:49:28,087 --> 00:49:30,787
You don't have to take me home.
I can manage just fine.

635
00:49:31,487 --> 00:49:33,820
You drank though.

636
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,453
I have to make sure you get home safely.

637
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:38,487
I had one sip.

638
00:49:38,487 --> 00:49:40,687
Don't tell me you're that naive,
Gil Teacher.

639
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:43,921
You don't suppose that was
my first drink ever, do you?

640
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,487
Regardless, I can't help but feel
responsible for your safety

641
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:50,288
as you're my student, Kang Gyeong Jun.

642
00:49:57,087 --> 00:50:00,754
I'm sorry

643
00:50:00,754 --> 00:50:04,720
I made you pretend to be my fiance.

644
00:50:05,254 --> 00:50:07,487
And thanks.

645
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:14,453
You don't have to be sorry.

646
00:50:15,288 --> 00:50:17,453
You got this back for me.

647
00:50:18,854 --> 00:50:22,587
And if you're really thankful,
fill this with some cash, will you?

648
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:25,121
With this face, I have to pay
the adult bus fare.

649
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:26,954
And get me some clothes.

650
00:50:26,954 --> 00:50:28,453
His body might rip my clothes.

651
00:50:28,453 --> 00:50:31,054
And I keep getting a wedgie.

652
00:50:32,987 --> 00:50:33,954
You're right.

653
00:50:33,954 --> 00:50:36,387
I can't have Yun Jae dressed like this.

654
00:50:36,387 --> 00:50:37,254
Let's go.

655
00:50:37,254 --> 00:50:38,188
Shopping?

656
00:50:38,188 --> 00:50:40,620
No. We're going to his place
to pick up some clothes.

657
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,987
Hey, hon.

658
00:50:45,987 --> 00:50:48,987
Didn't Yun Jae seem different today?

659
00:50:49,987 --> 00:50:52,054
I don't know where his manners went,

660
00:50:52,054 --> 00:50:54,121
and he was so brazen around us.

661
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:56,620
He wasn't his usual overly courteous self
to Da Ran either.

662
00:50:58,453 --> 00:50:59,887
Right?

663
00:50:59,887 --> 00:51:01,254
You noticed it, too, right?

664
00:51:01,254 --> 00:51:03,054
Yeah.

665
00:51:03,054 --> 00:51:06,353
I was so happy.

666
00:51:07,554 --> 00:51:10,987
He must feel at ease with us.

667
00:51:10,987 --> 00:51:15,654
He finally feels like our son-in-law.
It makes me so happy.

668
00:51:17,687 --> 00:51:21,954
It's a good thing if it's a sign

669
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,687
that he feels comfortable around us...

670
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:31,754
All set. Come.

671
00:51:32,288 --> 00:51:33,720
Come in.

672
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,420
Does Yun Jae live alone, too?

673
00:51:41,954 --> 00:51:43,453
His parents live abroad.

674
00:51:45,554 --> 00:51:47,288
Don't touch things.

675
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:49,954
Let's quickly get what we need.

676
00:51:54,854 --> 00:51:56,054
Hey.

677
00:51:56,054 --> 00:51:58,154
Don't touch anything! Come on!

678
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:01,820
Here are his clothes.

679
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,987
Pick out a few things.

680
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,054
Geez.

681
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,353
You startled me.

682
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:36,887
Cover yourself up.

683
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,754
You probably see this every day.
What's the big deal?

684
00:52:41,288 --> 00:52:43,387
Hurry up and change.

685
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,554
Why are you sneaking a peek?
Go ahead and look.

686
00:52:52,554 --> 00:52:54,320
I wasn't peeking.

687
00:52:56,254 --> 00:52:57,620
What's wrong with you?

688
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,554
You embraced this body when

689
00:52:59,554 --> 00:53:01,288
he was completely naked in the hospital

690
00:53:01,288 --> 00:53:03,854
and wailed, "I thought you were dead."

691
00:53:03,854 --> 00:53:08,054
Those were extenuating circumstances.

692
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:10,587
And I didn't get a good look.

693
00:53:12,987 --> 00:53:14,554
Oh my gosh.

694
00:53:16,987 --> 00:53:19,620
So you and Yun Jae

695
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:25,021
haven't... You know...

696
00:53:25,021 --> 00:53:27,520
You're about to get married
in a month. That's crazy.

697
00:53:28,554 --> 00:53:32,254
What do you know? You're a kid.

698
00:53:32,754 --> 00:53:35,221
Hurry up and pick out what you want to wear.

699
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:36,654
Gil Teacher,

700
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,154
do you want me to show you?

701
00:53:40,154 --> 00:53:42,221
He has a great body. Look. Look.

702
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:44,387
See?

703
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,387
This isn't something you can
achieve in a month or two.

704
00:53:46,387 --> 00:53:48,620
See? This dude even has a six pack.

705
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,188
Stop it.

706
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,420
He's hairy too.

707
00:53:55,654 --> 00:54:00,520
So why didn't this guy show you
his well-toned body?

708
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:05,620
He must have put a lot of time
and effort into it.

709
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,387
I assumed it was to impress you.

710
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:14,420
Yun Jae's disciplined, which is why
he likes to work out.

711
00:54:14,754 --> 00:54:15,887
That's right.

712
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:22,254
He had to have worked out at least
2 hours a day, every single day.

713
00:54:22,254 --> 00:54:23,887
Does it really take

714
00:54:23,887 --> 00:54:28,420
2 hours a day to buff up like that?

715
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,054
Definitely.

716
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,787
Why didn't he use that
time to see you instead?

717
00:54:32,787 --> 00:54:36,987
He kept standing you up,
saying he was busy.

718
00:54:36,987 --> 00:54:39,054
Maybe to him, his muscles were

719
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:44,520
more important than you.

720
00:54:47,254 --> 00:54:52,820
So I guess he had time to work out.

721
00:54:53,854 --> 00:55:00,754
Was he just making excuses?

722
00:55:03,288 --> 00:55:06,954
Maybe he just didn't want to see me.

723
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:09,154
I doubt that.

724
00:55:09,154 --> 00:55:14,054
He was on his way to see you
when he got into the accident.

725
00:55:14,754 --> 00:55:18,520
Yeah. And he was going
to tell you something, right?

726
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:28,654
Do you think he was going
to tell me he loved me?

727
00:55:28,654 --> 00:55:30,554
But what if it was something else?

728
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,587
Gil Da Ran,

729
00:55:48,587 --> 00:55:50,954
I love you.

730
00:56:03,054 --> 00:56:07,353
I'm sure that's what he was going to say.

731
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,921
Yeah.

732
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:14,787
You're probably right.

733
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,820
Right?

734
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:21,121
I don't know why I got so worried.

735
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:22,720
I'm an idiot.

736
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,188
That's right. You're an idiot.

737
00:56:25,188 --> 00:56:26,887
Let's pick out clothes.

738
00:56:32,254 --> 00:56:35,554
This color looks great on Yun Jae.

739
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,687
This one, too.

740
00:56:42,453 --> 00:56:45,554
And so does this one.

741
00:56:45,554 --> 00:56:46,921
Here.

742
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:48,420
Hold on to them.

743
00:56:48,754 --> 00:56:50,154
I'll get a bag.

744
00:56:58,787 --> 00:57:00,554
I don't know how she can like him so much.

745
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,288
These are so ugly.

746
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:25,654
Is this the key to this apartment?

747
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:27,320
No.

748
00:57:29,221 --> 00:57:32,654
Maybe it's the key to our marital home.

749
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,188
Oh, no. What now?

750
00:57:38,787 --> 00:57:41,620
Keep it short and natural.

751
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,420
What?

752
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,054
- Hello?
- Hi, Yun Jae.

753
00:57:50,054 --> 00:57:50,854
It's Se Yeong.

754
00:57:50,854 --> 00:57:52,854
- His colleague.
- You were home.

755
00:57:52,854 --> 00:57:55,654
I was so worried because no one
could get a hold of you.

756
00:57:55,654 --> 00:57:57,687
I heard you were in an accident.

757
00:57:58,554 --> 00:58:00,987
I only found out because they sent
your stuff over to the hospital.

758
00:58:00,987 --> 00:58:03,754
Why didn't you tell me?

759
00:58:04,188 --> 00:58:07,188
I'm okay now.

760
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:11,054
No wonder you didn't seem
like yourself earlier.

761
00:58:11,887 --> 00:58:14,587
I'll bring your stuff over to your place.

762
00:58:14,587 --> 00:58:17,420
I'm nearby, so it won't take long.

763
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,620
Okay.

764
00:58:22,087 --> 00:58:23,854
She's coming here.

765
00:58:24,687 --> 00:58:25,720
That's great.

766
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,787
She must be bringing Yun Jae's
personal effects.

767
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,921
What about Yun Jae's work?
Do I have to start working at his hospital?

768
00:58:34,921 --> 00:58:36,820
You can't do that.

769
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,254
Why don't we request a leave of absence?

770
00:58:40,254 --> 00:58:43,487
What about the wedding? Do I have to
walk down the aisle with you?

771
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,320
I'm sure he'll return by then. He has to.

772
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,987
If he doesn't, I won't do it for you.

773
00:58:54,453 --> 00:58:58,787
Should we tidy up until Se Yeong gets here?

774
00:58:59,221 --> 00:59:02,221
I'm doing my part by keeping his body clean.
I'm not cleaning his place.

775
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:03,687
I'm all set with that.

776
00:59:09,054 --> 00:59:11,887
When Se Yeong gets here,
be polite when you say hello.

777
00:59:11,887 --> 00:59:13,887
Don't look at her with lustful eyes.

778
00:59:16,087 --> 00:59:18,320
I'll look at her with pure
and innocent eyes.

779
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:33,921
Where's the vacuum cleaner?

780
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:35,320
Here it is.

781
00:59:38,254 --> 00:59:40,254
This thing's heavy.

782
00:59:41,154 --> 00:59:42,954
It's not empty.

783
00:59:50,188 --> 00:59:53,487
Huh? Yun Jae had packed this.

784
00:59:53,487 --> 00:59:56,320
Where was he planning to go?

785
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,520
He never told me about a trip.

786
01:00:45,487 --> 01:00:50,887
Where was he planning to go
without my knowing?

787
01:00:55,754 --> 01:00:57,453
Yun Jae.

788
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:02,687
Hi.

789
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,787
I was so worried.

790
01:01:11,787 --> 01:01:15,654
I should've been the first person you called.

791
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,921
Hey.

792
01:01:27,921 --> 01:01:29,854
What's wrong with you?

793
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,087
Yun Jae,

794
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,687
I love you.

795
01:01:38,954 --> 01:01:40,820
Yun Jae.

796
01:02:06,654 --> 01:02:09,254
Seo Yun Jae, you bastard.

797
01:02:31,054 --> 01:02:32,288
[Big]

798
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,954
He was cheating on you,

799
01:02:33,954 --> 01:02:36,121
playing you for a fool.

800
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:37,987
Yun Jae's not himself.

801
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,420
You got yourself into a pickle, didn't you?

802
01:02:39,754 --> 01:02:42,720
Kids run away from home
when they get into trouble.

803
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,820
I need to find evidence
of his two-timing ways.

804
01:02:46,154 --> 01:02:47,154
Who's he?

805
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:50,021
Someone Gyeong Jun knows.

806
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:52,021
I will

807
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:53,554
get you

808
01:02:53,554 --> 01:02:55,353
to marry

809
01:02:55,353 --> 01:02:57,121
me.

810
01:02:58,854 --> 01:03:01,188
You're very pretty.

811
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,587
Yun Jae,

812
01:03:04,854 --> 01:03:06,820
you're in there, right?
