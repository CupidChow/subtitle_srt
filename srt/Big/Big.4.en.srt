1
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:17,378
Why didn't you move away?

2
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:18,338
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:20,970
Were you planning to go for it?

4
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:24,837
For crying out loud.

5
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:26,937
No matter how much you want it,

6
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:30,537
there's an 18-year-old inside this body.

7
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:32,237
It would have been a catastrophe
if I hadn't stopped.

8
00:00:32,237 --> 00:00:34,804
How irresponsible can you be?

9
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:39,171
So this is how I would have felt.

10
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:46,137
This is how it would've felt
if Yun Jae had leaned toward me.

11
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:47,637
What?

12
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:52,670
So you two never even got this far?

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,237
No way.

14
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:58,104
We did,

15
00:00:58,104 --> 00:00:59,837
but I didn't get to see it.

16
00:01:00,503 --> 00:01:05,637
I was asleep when it happened.

17
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:09,171
I had pulled an all-nighter
for a school event,

18
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:13,271
so I dozed off when Yun Jae
went to get me coffee.

19
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:42,004
When it happened,

20
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:44,004
I was so startled that I did wake up,

21
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,770
but I couldn't open my eyes.

22
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,137
I should have opened my eyes right away,

23
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:50,338
but I lost the window of opportunity,

24
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:52,904
and I didn't know anymore
when I could open my eyes.

25
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,804
So?

26
00:01:53,804 --> 00:01:57,338
So I kept my eyes closed all the way home.

27
00:01:57,338 --> 00:02:01,670
Why couldn't I open my eyes then?

28
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,937
If only I had,

29
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:06,470
our relationship would have moved
forward at lightning speed.

30
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:10,071
Don't be too sad.

31
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:12,037
You might be mistaken.

32
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:15,004
You tend to get the wrong idea easily.

33
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,071
I was not mistaken.

34
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,770
But you said you didn't see.

35
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,837
How can you be sure it was
his lips that touched yours?

36
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:24,670
How can anyone mistake that?

37
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:27,537
Is she sleeping?

38
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,537
Maybe this is what happened.

39
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,237
It didn't feel like a quick pat like that.

40
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:38,870
Then...

41
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,737
She's drooling.

42
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,104
Maybe this is what happened.

43
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:53,503
It didn't feel like that either.

44
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:56,137
But then again, I didn't see anything.

45
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:01,737
This?

46
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:06,271
Was it like this?

47
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:10,304
Yeah.

48
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:16,237
Huh?

49
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,004
Huh?

50
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:21,670
You jerk.

51
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:23,537
You jerk!

52
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,438
What?

53
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,404
Why did you hit me?

54
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:29,371
I was just trying to help because
you seemed so confused.

55
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:32,071
You can't help me. You're a little kid.

56
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:33,304
How dare you?

57
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:35,137
Why would you help me? Huh?

58
00:03:35,603 --> 00:03:37,637
Stop. Stop. Stop.

59
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:41,338
If you keep kicking me, I'll plant these
on whoever I see.

60
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:42,704
They're not yours. They're Yun Jae's.

61
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:43,637
Precisely.

62
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:45,171
So why are you mad at me?

63
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:47,904
It was your precious Yun Jae's lips
that landed on yours.

64
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:50,137
Think of it as a rerun of a show you missed.

65
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:52,770
You had your eyes wide open this time.
So you didn't miss a thing, right?

66
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,338
Was it good? Was it?

67
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:56,237
You're not Yun Jae. You're Kang Gyeong Jun.

68
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,804
Since you know that,

69
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,137
stop making me play Yun Jae again.

70
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:04,837
I told you I'd rebel if you kept nagging me.

71
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:08,071
Where are you going?

72
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,171
Home.

73
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:10,503
To Kang Gyeong Jun's home.

74
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:20,404
So you didn't know Gyeong Jun was hurt.

75
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:25,438
Didn't my sister tell you?

76
00:04:25,804 --> 00:04:27,237
Your sister?

77
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:30,770
You were talking to my sister
at school earlier.

78
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,770
Ms. Gil Da Ran is my sister.

79
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:37,837
I suppose you also met my brother-in-law.

80
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:39,304
Your brother-in-law?

81
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:46,537
They're getting married next month.

82
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:52,704
My brother-in-law's a doctor
at this hospital.

83
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:56,470
He's a doctor at this hospital?

84
00:04:57,904 --> 00:05:00,004
You can go now.

85
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,438
How do Da Ran and Yun Jae know her anyway?

86
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:10,137
Why did they lie to me?

87
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:15,970
What now?

88
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,704
There's something I forgot
to give you earlier.

89
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,804
Come in, Ms. Gil.

90
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:42,438
Won't that give you indigestion?
It's so late at night.

91
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:45,204
Plus, it's very high in calories.
It's probably not healthy.

92
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:48,637
This dude's going to gain weight
and have an upset stomach.

93
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:53,271
Make sure you eat slowly. And brush
your teeth once you're done eating.

94
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,937
Just give me what you forgot
to give me earlier.

95
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,237
You may not like this,

96
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:02,870
but I think this is very important.

97
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,804
What now?

98
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:05,870
What do I have to do in Seo Yun Jae's stead?

99
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:10,670
This is what you've missed
at school since the accident.

100
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,338
You're a student.

101
00:06:14,338 --> 00:06:17,603
You can't go to school, but you should
still keep up with your studies.

102
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:19,037
I'll help you.

103
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:20,104
Whose class notes are these?

104
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:23,537
The best student in your class.

105
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:26,237
Once I return, this kid will
become second best.

106
00:06:26,237 --> 00:06:28,371
Why? Because I'll be the top student.

107
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:31,837
I did hear you had done quite well
back in the States.

108
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:34,438
Not just well. My grades were excellent.

109
00:06:34,438 --> 00:06:36,870
I was beyond compare.

110
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,637
And if you want to keep that up,
you need to keep studying.

111
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:42,670
I will. I'll go to Seoul National University.

112
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,570
SNU?

113
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,637
I could go to Harvard if I wanted to,

114
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:49,104
but I promised mom I'd go to SNU.

115
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,804
That's why mom bought me this house.

116
00:06:57,737 --> 00:06:58,537
I see.

117
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:02,171
I bet your mom is very proud of you,
given your good grades

118
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,137
and given how well you're doing for yourself.

119
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:10,037
I'll help you go to SNU, okay?

120
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:11,404
Really?

121
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:15,670
Then help me with this for starters.

122
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,037
It's math.

123
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,537
I specialize in Korean history...

124
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,737
This is integral calculus.

125
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,870
Gyeong Jun's fine. There's nothing
for you to worry about,

126
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,670
so go back home.

127
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:48,470
I'll tell him to get in touch with you.

128
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,037
He won't be able to call,
but I'm sure he'll text you.

129
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:57,904
Gyeong Jun's in a coma.

130
00:07:57,904 --> 00:08:00,970
How would he have been able to text me?

131
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,737
Gyeong Jun, I'm waiting for you
to get in touch with me.

132
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:28,870
I want to know how you are.

133
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,237
At least text me before I leave.

134
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:33,304
She won't leave if I don't
text her, will she?

135
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:43,603
[Take care. Bye]

136
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:45,104
Take care.

137
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:48,537
Bye?

138
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:56,237
But she came all this way.
Was the message too succinct?

139
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:14,637
Darn it.

140
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,137
Where are you going?

141
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,371
You're Gyeong Jun's uncle, right?

142
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:21,470
Yes.

143
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,804
Are you Gyeong Jun's friend from the States?

144
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:25,804
Is is true what you told me over the phone?

145
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:26,904
Yes.

146
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:29,237
I'm going to take Gyeong Jun to the States.

147
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,271
If she's that close a friend,
why don't you just tell her the truth?

148
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:43,304
You don't know what Mary's like.

149
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:45,104
I doubt she'd cause you trouble.

150
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:47,071
Yes, she will.

151
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:51,870
Gil Teacher, Mary will now
try to stay by my side.

152
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,670
Gyeong Jun,

153
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,338
I'll be right here by your side, okay?

154
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:08,037
If she finds out I'm in this body,

155
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:10,137
she'll follow me around

156
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:14,970
24-7, day and night, around the clock.

157
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,271
No matter what I tell her,

158
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:41,503
she won't listen to me.

159
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:47,371
You can't reason with her.

160
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,670
Really?

161
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,338
Then she shouldn't know.

162
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:55,570
Let's go.

163
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:58,570
So there was someone who
was willing to take Gyeong Jun.

164
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,137
I know.

165
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:03,004
We'd need his doctor's authorization
to put him on a plane, right?

166
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:05,637
If the doctor's still around,

167
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:06,970
we could get Gyeong Jun
discharged tonight, right?

168
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,603
I'm sure there are morning flights to L.A.

169
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:16,737
He's in a good mood. He must have
decided to send me to the States.

170
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:17,970
What should we do?

171
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,937
How will we talk her out of it?
She already has your uncle's permission.

172
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:24,037
Like I said, you can't reason with her.

173
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:28,071
We need to shock her
and take her down by surprise.

174
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:39,904
It seems like you're just sleeping.

175
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,470
In fairy tales,

176
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,570
the princess awakens when
she is kissed by Prince Charming.

177
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:12,637
I told you to go home, and yet here you are.

178
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:17,670
Thank goodness I found out.

179
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:22,770
Mister,

180
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,171
why did you lie to me?

181
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:27,670
You're a liar, a quack, and a fraud.

182
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,104
I'll tell the hospital you lied
about your patient.

183
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:32,837
I never lied.

184
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:36,171
As you can see, he is being
well taken care of here.

185
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,870
I'm taking Gyeong Jun to the States.

186
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,904
I bet that's what he'd want, too

187
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:43,537
because no one here cares about him.

188
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:45,670
I bet he'd want to stay here

189
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,271
because the woman Gyeong Jun likes
is here in Korea.

190
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:50,537
Someone he likes?

191
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:51,537
But Gyeong Jun's not interested in anyone.

192
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,837
Oh, yes he is.

193
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:53,837
She's right here.

194
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,670
Ms. Gil.

195
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,837
Gyeong Jun likes Ms. Gil Da Ran.

196
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:04,670
Gyeong Jun

197
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,037
likes her?

198
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,737
Gyeong Jun likes me?

199
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:14,071
Sure.

200
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:18,237
He fell for her the moment he saw her
on the bus, so he got off with her.

201
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:19,870
Really?

202
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,470
He did get off the bus with me, but...

203
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,937
He then followed you around

204
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:25,970
and pretended to have accidentally
run into her at the furniture store.

205
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,438
That's not true, right?

206
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:34,371
We did run into each other
at a furniture store, but...

207
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:36,603
No way.

208
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:40,404
Gyeong Jun's not the type to follow
someone around like a stalker.

209
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:45,137
I caught him following

210
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:46,570
my fiancee around.

211
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,438
I met with him to talk some sense to him

212
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:51,338
when he told me this and that about his life.

213
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:53,004
You're lying.

214
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:54,037
No way.

215
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:57,570
Then how else would I know
so much about him?

216
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:03,670
As you said, I'm not the type
he'd normally befriend.

217
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:08,371
But she's not the type
Gyeong Jun would like, either.

218
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,837
He said he liked women who were
charismatic like Angelina Jolie,

219
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:17,637
so I've been trying so hard
to work on my charisma.

220
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:25,171
She's anything but charismatic.
He can't possibly like her.

221
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:27,670
But she's pretty.

222
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:30,870
He said she grew on him
because she was so pretty.

223
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:41,004
So the one Gyeong Jun needs isn't you.

224
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,737
It's her.

225
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,603
Your name's Mary, right?

226
00:14:52,603 --> 00:14:55,937
I'll take good care of Gyeong Jun.

227
00:14:55,937 --> 00:15:01,404
I'm his teacher after all.

228
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:25,503
She loses.

229
00:15:25,503 --> 00:15:27,204
Game over.

230
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:29,037
Go, go!

231
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:37,104
It must have been a real shocker to her
that you like someone else.

232
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,503
Once I return to my body,
I can explain to her.

233
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:43,204
What you said isn't true, right?

234
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:47,204
You made up that whole thing
about how you like me, right?

235
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:51,438
But of course.

236
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:54,404
Don't tell me you were worried.

237
00:15:54,404 --> 00:15:56,304
Talk about delusional.

238
00:15:56,304 --> 00:15:57,870
All you had to say was that it wasn't true.

239
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,404
Mind your manners.

240
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:01,503
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,837
You tend to flatter yourself, Ms. Gil.

242
00:16:08,438 --> 00:16:10,271
Why did he have to say he found me pretty?

243
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:12,071
That's what Yun Jae said.

244
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:22,570
I should have known.

245
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:27,237
You're not the type to take pictures
of someone you don't care for.

246
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,870
We got her good. You saw, right?

247
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,438
I must be a genius.

248
00:16:36,438 --> 00:16:38,137
I'm so proud of myself.

249
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:41,037
But you don't feel the same way, right?

250
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:45,237
You don't like Gyeong Jun, right?

251
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,204
No.

252
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:49,570
I'm about to marry Yun Jae.

253
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,004
Be that as it may,

254
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:55,037
Gyeong Jun's much hotter than him.

255
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:58,171
That's not true.

256
00:16:58,171 --> 00:17:04,637
In my eyes, Gyeong Jun's just a kid
who doesn't know better.

257
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:08,770
I'm not the type who'd play
childish games with my students.

258
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,104
Were you worried?

259
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:14,004
Talk about delusional.

260
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:17,371
You can never ever change your mind.

261
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,171
That will never ever happen.

262
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,670
You seem like a good person.
Gil Chung Sik's your brother, right?

263
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,104
Tell him I'm deducting
10 pizzas from his debt.

264
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:25,470
10 pizzas?

265
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:30,837
Excuse me.

266
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:33,704
This is Gyeong Jun's.

267
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,870
It's mine.

268
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:39,770
This is Gyeong Jun's favorite sweatshirt.

269
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,904
No. This is my favorite sweatshirt.

270
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:46,271
You want to be like Gyeong Jun, don't you?

271
00:17:46,937 --> 00:17:49,204
No. He wants to be like me.

272
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,670
Stop copying me.

273
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,204
I wasn't copying you.

274
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:56,570
I did this, and then you copied me.

275
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,603
I did it like this.

276
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:58,937
What's the difference?

277
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:01,338
Did you just copy me? Stop copying me.

278
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,037
You're a super copycat.

279
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:04,503
Then you're a super duper copycat.

280
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:06,137
I told you not to copy me.

281
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:08,503
I said "super duper copycat,"
not "super copycat."

282
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:10,071
Then you're a super duper ultra copycat.

283
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:12,371
And you're a super duper ultra
copycat to the infinity power.

284
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:14,870
Infinity power to
the infinity power to you.

285
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,171
What you said times a 100 to you.

286
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,137
We'll have a lot of paperwork
to do to get him on a plane, right?

287
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:21,338
Probably.

288
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:23,503
Mary,

289
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,404
we just spoke with his primary care
physician, and...

290
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,637
We're not going.

291
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:36,137
Are they Seo Yun Jae's parents?

292
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,737
Yeah. They're both overseas.

293
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:43,770
What a relief. I don't have to
play the son at least.

294
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:45,837
Oh, right.

295
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:49,470
I think he called his mother often.

296
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,371
She must be worried.

297
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,004
What's the number?

298
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:11,970
Yun Jae?

299
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,338
I was worried because your phone
had been turned off for so long.

300
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,537
You're okay, right?

301
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:20,570
I've just been busy.

302
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:25,338
You can still make time
on that day though, right?

303
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,904
I'll be in Korea soon.

304
00:19:27,904 --> 00:19:32,071
I'm sure your father
hasn't forgotten, either.

305
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:35,503
We'll discuss your marriage
when we get together, okay?

306
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:36,870
Okay.

307
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,137
Alright.

308
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:41,503
You seem to be busy,
so we'll talk again later.

309
00:19:41,503 --> 00:19:43,004
Take care.

310
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:50,970
What's that day?

311
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:54,837
I don't know. It must be some kind
of a family gathering.

312
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:55,837
When could it be?

313
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:58,804
Doesn't Seo Yun Jae have
a planner? Look for it.

314
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:01,737
He must have the date saved
on his cell phone.

315
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,737
What's Seo Yun Jae's birthday?

316
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,137
I know his password.

317
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,404
You do?

318
00:20:12,404 --> 00:20:15,637
I saw him type it in by accident.
I swear it was an accident.

319
00:20:15,637 --> 00:20:17,338
Then why haven't you
checked his phone?

320
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:19,870
He had it password-protected.
He wouldn't like it

321
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,503
if I went through his phone.

322
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:24,338
He'd think I had no manners.

323
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:26,470
Gil Teacher,

324
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,371
are you going to make me
do all the dirty work?

325
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:31,438
I just told Mary a ridiculous lie.

326
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,037
That's how low I had to go.

327
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:37,670
I won't cooperate anymore
if you're going to be like this.

328
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,670
0624.

329
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:43,804
The password is 0624.

330
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:49,104
His password is 0624?

331
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:50,770
Yeah.

332
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,503
So it is.

333
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:01,071
0624... Is his birthday June 24?

334
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:03,237
No. Why?

335
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:07,071
Because my birthday's June 24, 0624.

336
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:10,704
It is a good number though

I think the family gathering
is on June 24.

341
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,970
There's no subject listed
for the date though.

00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,071
I wonder what the special occasion is.

We'll find out.

He might have gotten urgent messages.

345

I should check to see if there are any.

346

Look at that.

00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:37,237
Your bed? You're bringing that, too?

489
00:32:37,237 --> 00:32:40,004
I can only fall asleep in that bed.

490
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,037
Didn't you say we had a lot to do?

491
00:32:58,171 --> 00:33:01,470
These don't look like Gyeong Jun's clothes.

492
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,770
Hon,

493
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:05,004
whose shoes are these?

494
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:08,837
They certainly don't look like Gyeong Jun's.

495
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:12,603
Has someone been coming by here?

496
00:33:12,603 --> 00:33:13,737
Oh my goodness!

497
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,204
Maybe Gyeong Jun's been
in touch with his father.

498
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,704
His father?

499
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,704
Even I don't know where he is.
How would've Gyeong Jun found him?

500
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:27,371
Maybe his mother told him, and he's been
seeing his father behind our backs.

501
00:33:28,503 --> 00:33:29,804
No way.

502
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:32,937
Plus, Gyeong Jun's father has no right
or say in anything involving Gyeong Jun.

503
00:33:36,338 --> 00:33:38,438
Once we get that bed
he dragged from the States

504
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:40,837
out of here, we'll be good to go.

505
00:33:41,637 --> 00:33:43,704
How are we going to dispose of it?

506
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:45,371
It's too old to sell.

507
00:33:46,204 --> 00:33:47,637
Who'd buy that junk?

508
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:50,338
We'll just have to trash it.

509
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,371
Having a car does make things
a lot easier though.

510
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:05,171
Look at the colors on that comforter.

511
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:07,237
That's so gaudy.

512
00:34:07,237 --> 00:34:08,837
And the pajamas...

513
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,970
These are what newlyweds get.

514
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,171
This will look so cute on Yun Jae.

515
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:16,670
I hope it fits.

516
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:18,037
I can try it on.

517
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:20,304
Don't you dare.

518
00:34:20,304 --> 00:34:21,503
What?

519
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:24,404
I don't mean to be rude,

520
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:26,537
but these are matching pajamas

521
00:34:26,537 --> 00:34:28,271
and matching socks.

522
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:33,037
Yun Jae and I will wear them
as a married couple.

523
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,870
It's a bit weird if you were to try it on.

524
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,237
I wouldn't try it on even if
you begged me to.

525
00:34:38,237 --> 00:34:39,438
So rude.

526
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:45,137
We'll move these in once we pay
for the apartment and get the keys.

527
00:34:45,837 --> 00:34:49,104
But there's nothing there.
Where will I sleep tonight?

528
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:52,404
This isn't going to the apartment.
I'm keeping it in my room.

529
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:53,837
I'll find you a futon and a comforter.

530
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:55,037
Never mind.

531
00:34:55,037 --> 00:34:57,171
I'll get my own bedding.

532
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:00,171
Where are you going?

533
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:01,438
We have to go get the bowls
and plates I ordered.

534
00:35:01,438 --> 00:35:02,404
I'm not coming.

535
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:04,371
I can't use them anyway,
so why should I help you?

536
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:06,171
I'm off to get my own things.

537
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,271
Once you're done,
meet me at the realtor's.

538
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:11,404
You have to be there, okay?

539
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,670
Is he really mad?

540
00:35:16,537 --> 00:35:21,837
But these are for Yun Jae and me.

541
00:35:22,904 --> 00:35:24,237
Talk about exploitation.

542
00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:26,770
All she cares about is this body of his.

543
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:37,204
We can let it go for lower than market value.

544
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:38,670
We need to sell it ASAP.

545
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,737
It's very clean. We should be
able to sell it for you very quickly.

546
00:35:45,804 --> 00:35:47,171
Please make sure
all this trash is collected.

547
00:35:47,171 --> 00:35:48,937
Sure thing.

548
00:35:48,937 --> 00:35:49,937
Thank you very much.

549
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:50,870
I'll be in touch.

550
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,537
- Thank you.
- I'll see you soon.

551
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,104
The seller is almost here.

552
00:36:03,104 --> 00:36:05,237
Your husband-to-be
will be here soon too, right?

553
00:36:05,237 --> 00:36:06,570
Yes.

554
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:12,503
It's raining.

555
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:17,470
They say it's good luck if you
buy your house on a rainy day.

556
00:36:19,037 --> 00:36:20,637
Thank you.

557
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:02,104
The person you're trying to reach
is unable to take your call.

558
00:37:29,004 --> 00:37:30,570
He's running very late.

559
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,804
They say they're on a tight schedule.

560
00:37:42,338 --> 00:37:45,837
The person you're trying to reach
is unable to take your call.

561
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:48,904
You're ignoring my calls?

562
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:50,371
You're dead meat.

563
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:56,570
Kang Gyeong Jun, where were you?
And why didn't you answer the phone?

564
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,237
What are you doing?
Were you moving your bed?

565
00:38:01,004 --> 00:38:03,004
I'm not feeling well.

566
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:04,071
I'll come to the realtor's with you
some other time.

567
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:06,804
It wasn't something you could blow off
just because you were not feeling well.

568
00:38:06,804 --> 00:38:10,104
I had told you many times over
just how important it was.

569
00:38:10,603 --> 00:38:12,870
Please do me a favor and go.

570
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,204
Stop being a baby.

571
00:38:21,404 --> 00:38:23,037
What...

572
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:25,737
What's the matter?
Why are you soaking wet?

573
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,204
I got rained on.

574
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:31,537
You should get changed then.

575
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:34,503
They threw everything out.

576
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,004
Uncle Hyeoksu had come by
to clean the house

577
00:38:40,004 --> 00:38:43,837
because he wanted to sell it.

578
00:38:44,637 --> 00:38:48,204
He threw all my stuff out,
so I was dragging them back in.

579
00:38:48,204 --> 00:38:49,837
But it started raining, so I got wet.

580
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,570
Are you okay?

581
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,037
I told you I wasn't feeling well.

582
00:39:03,037 --> 00:39:05,804
You never listen to me.

583
00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:46,937
Let's go to your room.

584
00:39:52,338 --> 00:39:54,470
I'll make you something warm.

585
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,304
Get changed, okay?

586
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:41,204
Drink this. I'll get you medicine.

587
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:34,071
Are you up? You should eat
and then take your medicine.

588
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:37,804
Come and sit down.

589
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,204
Finish that and then take the medicine.

590
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,937
You must be upset

591
00:42:07,937 --> 00:42:10,970
that I ended up using what
you were saving for Yun Jae.

592
00:42:12,037 --> 00:42:16,637
It was going to get used anyway.

593
00:42:18,371 --> 00:42:20,937
You feel too sorry for me
to stay mad, right?

594
00:42:24,004 --> 00:42:25,737
Let's go to my house.

595
00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:28,004
I'll tell my parents I brought you over
because you're sick.

596
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,171
Do you want to sleep in Chung Sik's room?

597
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:31,404
No.

598
00:42:31,404 --> 00:42:33,438
I'm sleeping in my bed.

599
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:37,904
I'll finish this and take the medicine.

600
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:39,470
You can go now.

601
00:42:47,037 --> 00:42:50,904
You're still running a fever. Are you sure?

602
00:42:52,271 --> 00:42:56,438
I'll make sure to take good care
of Seo Yun Jae's body, so don't worry.

603
00:42:57,338 --> 00:43:02,338
Do you really think that's my only concern?

604
00:43:03,804 --> 00:43:05,204
I know.

605
00:43:05,837 --> 00:43:08,837
Right now, you're concerned about me.

606
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,338
How can you tell?

607
00:43:12,104 --> 00:43:16,737
Your eyes aren't shooting love beams.

608
00:43:57,404 --> 00:44:00,371
There's so much I want to do with you.

609
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,670
Please come back soon.

610
00:44:14,503 --> 00:44:17,237
You missed an important exam because of me.

611
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,071
I'm so sorry.

612
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:23,304
It's okay. You don't have
to keep apologizing.

613
00:44:23,304 --> 00:44:25,670
Are you going to take the teacher
certification exam eventually?

614
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,670
Yes.

615
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:31,837
I was quite confident this time,
so it's a shame I couldn't take it.

616
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,404
I'm not saying it's your fault.

617
00:44:39,204 --> 00:44:41,338
But I think it is, and I should be
held accountable.

618
00:44:42,037 --> 00:44:43,637
Pardon?

619
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,470
I have to take care of you
for the rest of my life.

620
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,503
Da Ran,

621
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:06,204
I kept you waiting for so long.

622
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:11,537
There's a surgery though. I'm sorry
I have to cancel our date again.

623
00:45:11,537 --> 00:45:12,937
Oh...

624
00:45:12,937 --> 00:45:14,438
It's okay.

625
00:45:14,438 --> 00:45:18,071
We can go to the movies some other time.

626
00:45:18,071 --> 00:45:23,204
Thank you for coming to see me though
despite how busy you are.

627
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:25,937
I'll get going then.

628
00:45:25,937 --> 00:45:27,371
Da Ran.

629
00:45:32,037 --> 00:45:33,704
Oh?

630
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,037
This seems to be a bigger
emergency than the surgery.

631
00:45:54,137 --> 00:45:56,404
I'll call you after the surgery.

632
00:45:56,404 --> 00:45:57,904
Okay.

633
00:47:18,071 --> 00:47:21,004
You're going to withdraw everything?

634
00:47:25,237 --> 00:47:27,237
- It's not spicy, right?
- No.

635
00:47:30,937 --> 00:47:32,438
Is it Yun Jae's?

636
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:39,043
[Account withdrawal: 914,440 dollars]

637
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:42,104
A withdrawal has been made...

638
00:47:42,104 --> 00:47:47,271
Wait a minute...

639
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,037
What?

640
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,537
That's him.

641
00:47:51,537 --> 00:47:53,438
He wants to buy the house right away.

642
00:48:32,404 --> 00:48:33,704
You were here.

643
00:48:34,937 --> 00:48:38,237
I was scared you had run off
with Yun Jae's money.

644
00:48:38,237 --> 00:48:40,470
Where would I run off to? This is my home.

645
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:43,338
Why did you take out so much?
Where's Yun Jae's money?

646
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:44,737
Oh...

647
00:48:44,737 --> 00:48:46,237
I bought something.

648
00:48:46,237 --> 00:48:47,637
What did you get?

649
00:48:48,137 --> 00:48:49,537
What's this?

650
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:52,704
I bought this house in Seo Yun Jae's name.

651
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:58,171
This house is Yun Jae's now.

652
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,037
Gil Teacher.

653
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,104
But you said you had to buy a place.

654
00:49:09,104 --> 00:49:10,704
This house is great.

655
00:49:10,704 --> 00:49:12,570
I got it at an amazing deal.

656
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:16,970
I'll pay him back when he wakes up.

657
00:49:17,503 --> 00:49:21,171
Gil Teacher. Gil Teacher.

658
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:23,570
I'll pay back the deposit you blew.

659
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,371
Come inside and take your medicine.

660
00:50:35,371 --> 00:50:38,570
We'll talk when you get better.

661
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:40,704
I'm sorry.

662
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,404
I know it's your marital home,

663
00:50:51,404 --> 00:50:56,770
but this house is all I have left.

664
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,037
I wanted to save it, but there wasn't
anything I could do,

665
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:03,637
so I used Yun Jae. I'm sorry.

666
00:51:05,804 --> 00:51:07,770
I'm sorry.

667
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:20,137
You're done for if the housing value drops.

668
00:51:25,004 --> 00:51:26,870
You need to take your medicine.

669
00:51:29,603 --> 00:51:31,870
The realtor said the housing value
around here is bound to shoot up.

670
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,438
This area's going to get a subway station.

671
00:51:33,438 --> 00:51:35,470
That's probably just a rumor.

672
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:38,704
I swear. Don't you feel better now?

673
00:51:42,371 --> 00:51:43,271
Here?

674
00:51:43,271 --> 00:51:44,737
No. Here.

675
00:51:45,737 --> 00:51:46,870
This way.

676
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:50,104
Please place it here.

677
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:51,970
It's that bed.

678
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:56,404
Don't touch it.
I haven't gotten it repaired yet.

679
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:04,503
The gift from the radio station

680
00:52:04,503 --> 00:52:06,503
for Ms. K of Dongjak-gu, right?

681
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:07,770
Let's see. Open it.

682
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,104
No.

683
00:52:09,104 --> 00:52:10,870
I'm not opening this.

684
00:52:13,104 --> 00:52:15,837
I don't care for this couch.
Couldn't you put it somewhere else?

685
00:52:16,037 --> 00:52:18,237
Then don't sit here.

686
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:21,637
You can stay in your room.

687
00:52:21,637 --> 00:52:22,737
- Are you okay?
- Ow...

688
00:52:23,371 --> 00:52:24,304
Stupid.

689
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,503
Why you...

690
00:52:29,804 --> 00:52:31,171
Let me make this clear.

691
00:52:31,171 --> 00:52:33,271
This home now belongs to me and Yun Jae.

692
00:52:33,271 --> 00:52:34,637
And you, Kang Gyeong Jun,

693
00:52:35,137 --> 00:52:36,438
are just a lodger.

694
00:52:36,438 --> 00:52:39,304
So you'd better do what

695
00:52:39,304 --> 00:52:40,637
the landlord tells you to.

696
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,904
Why are you putting
Yun Jae's stuff in my room?

697
00:52:55,904 --> 00:52:57,404
This isn't a storage shack.

698
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:03,670
I brought you over because you said
you'd deduct 50 pizzas,

699
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,438
but I still don't know why you insisted
on coming to my place.

700
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:08,704
Where's your sister's room?

701
00:53:11,071 --> 00:53:12,704
It's the size of my bathroom.

702
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:15,104
Once Da Ran gets married,

703
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:18,037
this will be my personal fitness room.

704
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:21,837
She's definitely marrying that guy, right?

705
00:53:21,837 --> 00:53:23,204
Of course.

706
00:53:23,204 --> 00:53:25,603
She's crazy about him.

707
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,570
I don't like that guy one bit.

708
00:53:29,037 --> 00:53:30,837
He's so similar to Gyeong Jun.

709
00:53:32,503 --> 00:53:34,438
He's a Gyeong Jun-wanna-be.

710
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:44,603
My brother-in-law is
nothing like Gyeong Jun.

711
00:53:44,603 --> 00:53:46,904
He's a great guy.

712
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:48,937
So are you saying Gyeong Jun's
not a great guy?

713
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:50,570
No.

714
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,770
I like Gyeong Jun, too.

715
00:53:54,804 --> 00:53:56,670
See? I brought these

716
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,204
class handouts for him.

717
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:03,737
I'll deduct one pizza.

718
00:54:05,271 --> 00:54:06,870
I can come by often, right?

719
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:11,503
Sure. You deducted 50 pizzas.

720
00:54:11,503 --> 00:54:14,670
So aren't you going back to the States?

721
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:15,837
Nope.

722
00:54:16,537 --> 00:54:18,304
I'm going to learn all there is to know

723
00:54:18,304 --> 00:54:20,937
about your sister until Gyeong Jun wakes up.

724
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:35,837
I'm trying to find the education channel.

725
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:55,171
My parents are coming by,

726
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:56,837
so go and get some juice and fruit.

727
00:55:20,137 --> 00:55:23,904
[Incoming Call: Lee Se Yeong]

728
00:55:34,137 --> 00:55:37,304
So what did I leave behind
when I inadvertently

729
00:55:37,304 --> 00:55:39,171
spent the night at your place?

730
00:55:42,804 --> 00:55:45,470
I found this on the floor by my bed.

731
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,137
Huh? This...

732
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:49,204
Yun Jae,

733
00:55:49,204 --> 00:55:52,037
are you returning this to me

734
00:55:52,037 --> 00:55:54,603
or did you lose it there because
you were hung over?

735
00:55:54,603 --> 00:55:57,704
Please don't confuse me.
Just give me a straight answer.

736
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:01,837
Are you going to hold on to
the key to my place or not?

737
00:56:01,837 --> 00:56:05,071
It was the key to your place?

738
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,470
What?

739
00:56:08,004 --> 00:56:10,603
I thought it was the key to the place
Da Ran and I were moving into.

740
00:56:15,104 --> 00:56:16,237
Never mind.

741
00:56:16,237 --> 00:56:20,171
I had given you the key to my apartment,

742
00:56:20,171 --> 00:56:22,037
and because you held on to it,

743
00:56:22,037 --> 00:56:24,804
I thought you were going to call off
the wedding and come to me.

744
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:29,470
If I was mistaken, let's just end this.

745
00:56:37,637 --> 00:56:39,104
Oh, man...

746
00:56:44,004 --> 00:56:49,537
This house is amazing.

747
00:56:49,537 --> 00:56:52,338
But I thought you had gotten an apartment.

748
00:56:52,338 --> 00:56:54,837
It's a long story.

749
00:56:57,137 --> 00:56:59,603
This came from Yun Jae's place, right?

750
00:56:59,603 --> 00:57:00,904
Yup.

751
00:57:01,371 --> 00:57:03,237
We should put these away.

752
00:57:04,503 --> 00:57:07,237
Here you go.

753
00:57:13,004 --> 00:57:16,603
What could Se Yeong have put in here?

754
00:57:26,503 --> 00:57:27,570
Hello.

755
00:57:28,371 --> 00:57:30,004
Come, come.

756
00:57:30,004 --> 00:57:31,637
- Where have you been?
- Yun Jae.

757
00:57:31,637 --> 00:57:33,071
- Come eat.
- Yes, sir.

758
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:35,371
- Come and eat.
- Coming.

759
00:57:38,937 --> 00:57:41,104
What took you so long? Where have you been?

760
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:42,603
You took the car, didn't you?

761
00:57:42,603 --> 00:57:43,937
I told you not to drive.

762
00:57:43,937 --> 00:57:44,970
Give me the car key.

763
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:51,670
Huh?

764
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,570
This is the key we saw
at Yun Jae's apartment.

765
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,037
Yeah...

766
00:57:56,037 --> 00:57:59,837
I thought it was for our apartment,
but maybe I was wrong.

767
00:57:59,837 --> 00:58:01,537
The realtor hasn't asked for it back.

768
00:58:02,004 --> 00:58:04,304
It's probably to another place.

769
00:58:04,304 --> 00:58:07,770
So what's this key for?
Why did Yun Jae have this?

770
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,537
Gil Teacher...

771
00:58:13,704 --> 00:58:15,404
Actually, the key...

772
00:58:15,937 --> 00:58:17,503
What about this key?

773
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,271
It's broken.

774
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,470
It doesn't work.

775
00:58:29,937 --> 00:58:31,338
Really?

776
00:58:33,004 --> 00:58:36,171
It's useless, so I'll throw it out.

777
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:39,037
It's Yun Jae's. You can't throw it out.

778
00:58:39,037 --> 00:58:40,837
But it doesn't work. Why keep it?

779
00:58:40,837 --> 00:58:43,637
I'll take dispose of it,
so don't worry about it.

780
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:06,237
We should come back tomorrow.
There's still more to do.

781
00:59:06,237 --> 00:59:08,770
Your mother sent us that nice kimchi.

782
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:10,870
We should split that with the kids.

783
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:13,271
Yun Jae's there alone. He needs food.

784
00:59:14,237 --> 00:59:18,670
But if he comes by our place often,
there's no need to split it.

785
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:25,470
With that, we won't have to
split tea anymore, right?

786
00:59:31,503 --> 00:59:35,870
We won't have to split anything

787
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:37,870
if he comes by often, right?

788
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:40,537
That's right. He can have the kimchi
whenever he comes over.

789
00:59:40,537 --> 00:59:42,438
He's closer by now.

790
00:59:42,438 --> 00:59:45,704
Tell him he's free to come over
whenever he wants to.

791
00:59:45,704 --> 00:59:47,104
Mom,

792
00:59:47,804 --> 00:59:54,171
what do you give someone if you want him
to feel free to come over whenever?

793
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:56,204
Should we make Yun Jae a copy
of our house key?

794
00:59:56,204 --> 01:00:00,537
He can come by and eat
even if we're not around.

795
01:00:04,137 --> 01:00:06,237
Dad...

796
01:00:06,237 --> 01:00:10,104
Could you pull over? I have to go somewhere.

797
01:00:15,704 --> 01:00:17,338
Da Ran.

798
01:00:17,338 --> 01:00:18,837
Da Ran, where are you going?

799
01:00:24,937 --> 01:00:26,304
Hello?

800
01:00:26,304 --> 01:00:29,271
Yun Jae, is Da Ran there?

801
01:00:30,137 --> 01:00:32,071
No. Why?

802
01:00:32,071 --> 01:00:37,537
She asked dad to pull over
all of a sudden and then took off.

803
01:00:37,537 --> 01:00:39,204
It was odd.

804
01:00:43,104 --> 01:00:44,338
She's not picking up.

805
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:58,937
I'm sorry to bother you,

806
01:00:58,937 --> 01:01:01,970
but Se Yeong lives near the hospital, right?

807
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:05,037
Could I have her address?

808
01:02:57,737 --> 01:02:59,338
Who is it?

809
01:03:19,637 --> 01:03:20,937

811

so brazen and shameless?

812
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:54,338
When Yun Jae crashed into you,

813
01:03:54,338 --> 01:03:56,570
who do you suppose
he was in a hurry to get to?

814
01:03:58,037 --> 01:03:59,438
It should fit perfectly.

815
01:03:59,438 --> 01:04:02,271
The gentleman who ordered the ring
said he had the exact measurement.

816
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:03,970
They're hiding something
so it doesn't show.

817
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:05,904
They were arguing about whether
or not to go to the hospital.

818
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:12,304
The patient who was brought here
with Kang Gyeong Jun

819
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:13,438
was Seo Yun Jae?

820
01:04:13,438 --> 01:04:15,503
If you're going to take him down,
should I keep watch for you?

821
01:04:15,503 --> 01:04:16,937
No.

822
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:19,371
I'm going to feign ignorance

823
01:04:19,371 --> 01:04:20,837
and just keep chugging along.
