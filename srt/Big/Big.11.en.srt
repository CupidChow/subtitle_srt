00:00:05,904 --> 00:00:07,237
[Episode 11]
The place next to Gil Da Ran

2
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:08,570
is for Seo Yun Jae.

3
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:12,937
When he comes back,

4
00:00:12,937 --> 00:00:15,870
Kang Gyeong Jun will disappear.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,137
I will disappear for good.

6
00:00:18,537 --> 00:00:21,537
I'll be living it up somewhere

7
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:24,904
so you just worry about Seo Yun Jae.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,404
You're just going to disappear?

9
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:35,603
Are you going to come after me?

10
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,537
If you don't get your act together,

11
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:41,704
I may whisk you off.

12
00:00:49,503 --> 00:00:51,304
Your shoelace is untied.

13
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:54,037
I told you to get your act together.

14
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:58,071
I'm going to soar, so don't look back

15
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:00,470
and you can be on your way.

16
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:04,438
Let's make it work until then.

17
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:09,271
Okay.

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,237
You look like you're in so much pain.

19
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:15,537
I'm just a kid. I shouldn't have to worry
about an adult like you.

20
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:16,904
It's burdensome.

21
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:18,071
I know.

22
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:21,204
I shouldn't be like this.

23
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:25,071
I need to get my act together.

24
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:29,904
Is the shoelace tied tight?

25
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:31,637
It's tied super tight.

26
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:32,970
Is it okay?

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,603
It definitely won't come loose.

28
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:36,004
Let's go.

29
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,704
Are you sure it's not cutting off
your blood circulation?

30
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:41,438
I'm fine.

31
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:42,970
Let's go.

32
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:50,870
Come on.

33
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,371
Eating like that can mess up your system.

34
00:02:01,237 --> 00:02:02,904
You're messing up my system
by staring at me.

35
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:04,537
You should go to bed.

36
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:07,104
How am I such a bother?

37
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:08,704
Because I'm young?

38
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:14,204
A smart and handsome kid with a lot
of money can do well anywhere.

39
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:16,104
I'd never mooch off you, not even
for a single bite of your noodles,

40
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:18,804
so don't you worry.

41
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,603
But you'll be all alone once
you return to your body.

42
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:23,137
If that's what's bothering you, don't worry.

43
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,937
I'm going to find my father.

44
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:40,704
Mary,

45
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,904
this doesn't seem like your first time.

46
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:46,770
I've built up my expertise
from stalking Gyeong Jun.

47
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,470
Wow. These are amazing.

48
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,438
The pictures are so vivid and animated.

49
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,804
Who's that?

50
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:03,470
Please tell me anything you can
about the man you met in New York,

51
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,338
the man Hui Su was going to marry.

52
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,137
I have no leads on Gyeong Jun's whereabouts.

53
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:16,371
I did hear he had a daughter
around Gyeong Jun's age.

54
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:19,237
Her name was Mary.

55
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:21,970
Mary.

56
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:24,637
Get out of the way.

57
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:38,970
Yun Jae and Da Ran are meeting us
at the hotel lobby.

58
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,338
Don't bring up anything that will
cause us to raise our voices.

59
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:44,537
Gyeong Jun may be in Korea.

60
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:47,171
I think I might be able to find him.

61
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,404
This is the first time I'll be
seeing Yun Jae's father.

62
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:51,570
Yun Jae's mother doesn't like seeing him,

63
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,304
so I didn't have to see him, either.

64
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:57,870
I met him when our families
met to discuss our wedding.

65
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,304
He's very quiet and rather unapproachable.

66
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:01,970
He's a doctor too.

67
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:05,438
Is that why you've come?

68
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,603
I'm not getting myself involved,

69
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:12,637
so don't tell Yun Jae either.

70
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:16,870
He's Yun Jae's brother and your son.

71
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,071
Don't you feel sorry for him? He's all alone.

72
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:24,970
He's not my son.

73
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:28,338
He's Kang Hui Su's son.

74
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:31,804
I'm perfectly happy with having had
just my mom in my life,

75
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,104
but he is someone my mom loved,

76
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:37,570
so I am curious about him.

77
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,004
It was you who had asked Hui Su
to have a baby for us.

78
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,937
I didn't need a baby.

79
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:51,570
I needed the umbilical cord

80
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,503
because it was the only way
we could save Yun Jae.

81
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,037
You had agreed to it too.

82
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:02,071
Do you think you'll be able to face him
as your son after all this time?

83
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:05,804
He came into being not out of love
but out of necessity.

84
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:11,338
You just dumped that kid on Hui Su too.

85
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:14,537
I think my father does want to meet me

86
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:16,338
if he's left behind something like this.

87
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:20,171
In any case, I'm sure I came into being
because he loved my mother very much.

88
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:22,670
I wonder why there are two babies.

89
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,104
Do you think you might have a brother?

90
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:27,304
A brother?

91
00:05:27,304 --> 00:05:29,670
I suppose that's not out of the question.

92
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:35,371
Promise me you won't tell Yun Jae

93
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:37,404
about the child.

94
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:44,104
I won't remind him of anything
he can't remember.

95
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:09,271
Hi.

96
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,603
Hello, mom.

97
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,204
It's been a long time.

98
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:23,603
Yes, dad.

99
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:38,704
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the wedding.

100
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:39,804
It's okay.

101
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:41,237
Wait.

102
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,904
We should go up to the room.

103
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,404
Your father brought you a wedding gift.

104
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:48,770
It won't take long.

105
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,837
Let's go.

106
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:56,071
I'll be right back.

107
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:05,204
I heard you've been ill. I'm sorry
I haven't been able to come by.

108
00:07:05,204 --> 00:07:06,937
Are you better now?

109
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:09,304
No.

110
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:13,171
I know you're my father, but you
seem like a stranger to me.

111
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:15,271
You'll get better with time.

112
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:18,970
We're father and son.
We're definitely not strangers.

113
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,970
I'm your only son, so I must
mean a lot to you and mom.

114
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,204
Our only son?

115
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:31,237
You really don't remember.

116
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:32,603
What do you mean?

117
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,271
It's nothing.

118
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:38,037
- Are you still on leave?
- Yes.

119
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:41,071
Oh, wow.

120
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:43,338
Do you know him?

121
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,904
Don't you remember Professor Park Min Gyu?

122
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:47,304
So he knows Seo Yun Jae?

123
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:49,104
Yes.

124
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,204
It's as your mom said.

125
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:55,404
You're like a different person.

126
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:57,704
I'll come back to my old self soon.

127
00:07:57,704 --> 00:07:59,438
Of course.

128
00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:21,770
I may seem unfamiliar to you,

129
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,204
but just consider me a different son
who's come for a short visit.

130
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,737
A group of doctors' wives

131
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:38,570
are getting together this weekend.

132
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,704
You should come with me.

133
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:42,603
Pardon?

134
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:46,704
It's a volunteer group I've been
a part of since I got married.

135
00:08:46,704 --> 00:08:50,004
I'd like to introduce you
to everyone while I'm in Korea.

136
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,004
Okay.

137
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:56,470
Do you always dress like that?

138
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,904
Yes.

139
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:03,970
We should go shopping before the gathering.

140
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,503
You don't have your own car, right?

141
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:11,004
We should get you a car, too.

142
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:14,171
But I don't need a car.

143
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:17,371
You need one if you don't
want Yun Jae to lose face.

144
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:18,937
If you had tended to such things yourself,

145
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:22,004
I wouldn't have to worry about these things.

146
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,338
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:30,537
She's doing it so that I don't lose face,

148
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,438
so you shouldn't say, "I'm sorry."

149
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:38,204
Look her in the eye and say, "Thank you."

150
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:40,737
Da Ran's rather timid,

151
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:43,338
but I'm shameless, so let me
thank you instead.

152
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:46,537
Give me your credit card.

153
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,904
You don't have to make time
out of your busy schedule.

154
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:54,271
I'll get her what she needs
for the sake of saving my face.

155
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:56,970
How much do you think it'll take
to save face, for my sake.

156
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:01,737
I need to know the exact value you've set
for the sake of saving my face.

157
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:03,537
Yun Jae,

158
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:06,438
is it so wrong of me to want
to do volunteer work with her?

159
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:09,970
If you have to get a new car and clothes,
it's not volunteer work.

160
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,470
It's a money-flaunting gathering.

161
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,537
Yun Jae.

162
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:13,837
Sir...

163
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:16,304
I mean, dad, you should
spend more time with her

164
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:19,037
if you don't want her involved
in strange organizations.

165
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:21,670
It's not a strange organization.

166
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,770
It's an exclusive club for the wives
of famous directors of hospitals.

167
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,204
But then you and Da Ran

168
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:32,970
are not qualified to be in that club.

169
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,937
Dad's not a director.

170
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:37,804
Yun Jae,

171
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:43,271
your father was an acclaimed doctor.

172
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:45,271
Right?

173
00:10:47,237 --> 00:10:49,737
That's not good enough.

174
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:52,304
You need to step it up and set up
your own practice.

175
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:55,037
I'd be too ashamed to have her
meet anyone until you do.

176
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:59,937
She'd lose face at
the money-flaunting gathering.

177
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:01,470
Yun Jae,

178
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,037
your father was the director
of a hospital before going to Africa.

179
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:08,737
Right?

180
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,670
Yes.

181
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,171
You may not remember, but I was
a director of a hospital.

182
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:18,304
But not anymore.

183
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,837
Stop arguing with me, and just
give me your credit card.

184
00:11:24,204 --> 00:11:25,637
Are you really going to buy a car?

185
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:28,503
They're very thorough. They don't say
what they don't mean.

186
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:30,237
You were there. They couldn't stop

187
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:32,704
showing off about how he used to be
a director of a hospital.

188
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:35,837
It would be rude of us not to
take up on their offer.

189
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:39,104
I don't think she was serious
about getting me a car.

190
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:40,704
This will be good for you.

191
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:41,670
Why don't you test drive it?

192
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,670
I don't need a car. I'm not
a good driver anyway.

193
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,137
Fine then.

194
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:47,904
I'll get a nice one for myself.

195
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:51,904
This one.

196
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:54,371
Gyeong Jun.

197
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:57,438
From here

198
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:01,570
to here.

199
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:06,104
How can I get them without
even trying them on?

200
00:12:06,104 --> 00:12:07,770
Then try them on.

201
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,004
But I don't need this.

202
00:12:12,004 --> 00:12:14,470
Not bad. Get it.

203
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:19,271
I'm really fine.

204
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,071
Not bad. Get it.

205
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:26,804
How can I go do volunteer work
in something like this?

206
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:29,537
Not bad. Get it.

207
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,404
This is more fit for a resort.

208
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,237
Not bad. Get it.

209
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:40,503
That's bad. Get it.

210
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,338
Not bad.

211
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,237
Wear it home.

212
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,870
The car will be ready in a few days.

213
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,004
Seeing that we haven't maxed out
their credit card yet,

214
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:11,104
Seo Yun Jae's face must be worth quite a bit.

215
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:14,104
Yun Jae's parents were flustered.

216
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:17,071
Yun Jae used to be such a sweet son.

217
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:19,870
A sweet son would only
make things hard for you.

218
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,870
They need to know the world

219
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,137
is not full of sweet sons
and that there can be

220
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,904
bad sons like me.

221
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:34,870
What's the matter?

222
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:40,804
I keep playing along with you,

223
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:44,237
and that makes me feel bad toward Yun Jae.

224
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:48,338
If this is too hard for you,

225
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:51,570
pretend Kang Gyeong Jun is gone.

226
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,338
Seo Yun Jae's back in here.

227
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:56,970
The switchover makes me sick, so...

228
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,770
Ow.

229
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,237
Kang Gyeong Jun's leaving.

230
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:07,237
He's coming. He's coming.

231
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:10,171
Seo Yun Jae

232
00:14:10,171 --> 00:14:12,037
is here.

233
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,970
It's been a long time, Da Ran.

234
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:20,537
What are you doing?

235
00:14:20,537 --> 00:14:23,670
You've become even prettier.

236
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,704
I've liked you because you were so pretty.

237
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:32,271
Apart from a few fine lines,
you're still your pretty self.

238
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:34,737
Kang Gyeong Jun,

239
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:36,304
stop it.

240
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:38,470
I'm Yun Jae.

241
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,737
Oh, right.

242
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,371
Warm hands are my trademark.

243
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:47,237
Da Ran,

244
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:49,404
does this warm you up?

245
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:51,104
Yun Jae?

246
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:52,603
Cut it out, and bring me back

247
00:14:52,603 --> 00:14:55,503
to reality with that comedy
punchline you know so well.

248
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:59,004
Oh...

249
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:01,171
So that's what you're into.

250
00:15:01,171 --> 00:15:03,870
Good grief.

251
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,237
Given how serious and well-mannered
I am, I don't know...

252
00:15:11,071 --> 00:15:12,937
Da Ran,

253
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:15,171
your taste has changed.

254
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:18,870
I've gotten childish as I've been
spending a lot of time with a kid.

255
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,837
You're into childish things?

256
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,071
Well...

257
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:25,104
Let me sing you song Teddy Bear and Rabbit

258
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:28,537
have sung for me more times
than I care to count.

259
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:41,970
Tuning.

260
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:44,071
Here we go.

261
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:51,304

274
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:41,037
Now you're laughing.

275
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:43,304
You made me laugh.

276
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:46,503
No. It was Seo Yun Jae who made you laugh.

277
00:16:46,503 --> 00:16:49,004
You were laughing at Kang Gyeong Jun?

278
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,137
Huh?

279
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,804
Seeing that you managed
to see Kang Gyeong Jun,

280
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:58,037
I think you've gotten your act together.

281
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:01,204
Since Kang Pororo just sang you a song,

282
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:03,537
how about a song in return, Gil Patty?

283
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:08,004
Come on.

284
00:17:08,004 --> 00:17:10,037
I don't want to sing.

285
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:16,737
I went out of my way to cheer you up.

286
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:18,371
What's wrong?

287
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,937
Leave the frying pan here.

288
00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:27,704
Snap out of it.

289
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:30,570
This isn't the time for me
to have a good time with him.

290
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,004
Ow.

291
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,670
It's not like I can crack my heart open

292
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,338
and fry it up on this thing.

293
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:48,037
This is driving me nuts.

294
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,503
I wonder if Gil Da Ran's upset
because of Seo Yun Jae's mother.

295
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,171
Should I not have sung the Pororo song?

296
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:04,004
She seemed to like though.

297
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:09,037
I've made up my mind to wait for Yun Jae.

298
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:14,970
Getting funny ideas is betrayal.

299
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,470
To avoid getting any funny ideas,

300
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:22,704
I should keep myself preoccupied.

301
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,804
What can I do?

302
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,737
Oh, right.

303
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:46,770
This is it.

304
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:55,371
Focusing on the needle is helping me.

305
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:57,371
That's why the women of the Joseon era

306
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,904
focused on embroidery

307
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:02,970
as they waited for their husbands to return.

308
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:17,470
I'm waiting for my husband.

309
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:20,937
Until he returns,

310
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:23,837
I will spend the long, long nights
doing embroidery

311
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:26,438
to keep myself preoccupied.

312
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:44,404
What am I doing?

313
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:46,937
I cannot let the enticing piper

314
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:49,804
next door make me waver.

315
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,004
I need to focus.

316
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,937
I need to focus on nothing but this needle.

317
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:29,037
How are your fingers?

318
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:32,637
You look tired.

319
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:35,937
I had something to do last night.

320
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:37,503
Oh my goodness.

321
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,338
Are you showing off that you're a newlywed?

322
00:20:41,804 --> 00:20:44,637
I'm going to get married soon too.

323
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:47,204
I'm going on a blind date tonight.

324
00:20:48,404 --> 00:20:53,204
I'm seeing the guy at
the cafe in Hanguk Hotel

325
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:55,570
at 7 o'clock.

326
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,937
I wonder if he heard.

327
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:03,537
I think Mr. Na did hear you.

328
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:05,737
I don't care either way.

329
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:07,804
We're not an item anyway.

330
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:12,037
Do you really think I'd wait for him
to open his heart to me?

331
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:17,704
If it's hard for you to wait,
why don't you pick up embroidery?

332
00:21:17,704 --> 00:21:22,470
It keeps you preoccupied
so you don't get funny ideas.

333
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:26,637
Do you think he looks like you?

334
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:28,271
Take a look.

335
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:30,737
I don't know.

336
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:33,770
Shouldn't he be more handsome
if he was my father?

337
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,870
But he's smart.

338
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,637
You don't think he's your father?

339
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,470
He could be my father.

340
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,770
His paintings were part of my mom's
art collection.

341
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:50,438
Even if he's not my father,
he might know who my father is.

342
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:55,304
Huh?

343
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:58,071
This is Seo Yun Jae's father.

344
00:21:59,071 --> 00:22:00,570
Really?

345
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,404
That's really Dr. Seo's father?

346
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,837
I did hear they knew each other.
They must be close.

347
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:07,470
Then maybe he knows my dad, too.

348
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,338
Ask him.

349
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:16,137
I don't really care to see
Seo Yun Jae's parents.

350
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:18,837
I get into a funk whenever I see them.

351
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:22,503
It must be hard to play their son.

352
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:27,371
Your birthday's coming up. I hope
you find your father before then.

353
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:29,570
That's right. My birthday
is around the corner.

354
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,104
My birthday is the reason why
I've come back from the States.

355
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:34,004
To have a birthday bash?

356
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,338
If everything works out as
I had planned in the States,

357
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:39,970
we'll have a birthday bash.

358
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,404
What did you plan in the States?

359
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,937
I made preparations for me
to be able to live on my own.

360
00:22:46,937 --> 00:22:49,237
After Gyeong Jun's birthday,

361
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:51,237
he will have access to his trust account,

362
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:54,470
and we'll no longer be managing his assets.
What are we going to do?

363
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,904
Gyeong Jun's in a coma.

364
00:22:56,904 --> 00:22:59,004
We'll probably have to keep
managing his inheritance.

365
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:01,104
He has no one else but us.

366
00:23:01,503 --> 00:23:06,171
But that doctor said he knew the passcode.

367
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:08,770
He was probably just bluffing.

368
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,104
How would be know?

369
00:23:10,104 --> 00:23:12,004
He's not Gyeong Jun.

370
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,438
Being in an adult body does make
some things a lot easier.

371
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:17,104
You didn't get to go to China,
so enjoy the food at least.

372
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:19,470
Is there cause to celebrate?

373
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,338
Would you like it if something
good happened to me?

374
00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:23,770
Why would I like you?

375
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,338
Never mind then.

376
00:24:25,804 --> 00:24:27,704
I'm not buying you dinner because I like you.

377
00:24:27,704 --> 00:24:30,037
I have a favor to ask you.

378
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:31,570
What is it?

379
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:35,104
This guy knows Seo Yun Jae.

380
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:37,371
I was going to go with Mary,
but since he knows Yun Jae,

381
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:39,770
it would look more natural
for me to go with you.

382
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,470
You can come with me, right?

383
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,704
Of course. I said I'd help you
find your father.

384
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:51,837
Gil Teacher,

385
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:54,603
are you trying to make it obvious
that you've never been to China?

386
00:24:54,603 --> 00:24:57,603
You're supposed to put
the Beijing duck in a wrap.

387
00:25:21,704 --> 00:25:23,338
One more?

388
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:25,970
I'd

389
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,537
prefer something else.

390
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:36,804
This is hot and spicy.

391
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:38,937
It's good.

392
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:45,438
Why are you having something hot and spicy?

393
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:47,204
Why torture yourself?

394
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,503
How's this?

395
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,371
It's turbo charge from Kang Gyeong Jun.

396
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:59,071
And it's gentle breeze from Seo Yun Jae.

397
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:00,603
Turbo charge.

398
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:02,371
Gentle breeze.

399
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:22,870
Back and forth. Turbo charge. Gentle breeze.

400
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,737
- Turbo charge...
- Stop it.

401
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:26,937
You said you were hot.

402
00:26:26,937 --> 00:26:28,804
- I'm fine.
- Really?

403
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,438
Then it's my turn.

404
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:32,537
Give me what you've got.

405
00:26:33,104 --> 00:26:35,104
This is driving me insane.

406
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:36,737
Let's just go.

407
00:26:37,438 --> 00:26:39,404
What?

408
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:41,404
What about the duck?

409
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,404
I must have lost it.

410
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:52,503
How can I be having a good time with him?

411
00:26:53,338 --> 00:26:57,371
I wish I could iron out all my
troubles and confusion.

412
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,537
I should iron.

413
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,137
I should iron my mind clean and neat.

414
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:29,670
Until my husband returns,

415
00:27:30,204 --> 00:27:32,937
I have to keep myself preoccupied

416
00:27:32,937 --> 00:27:37,104
by ironing the nights away.

417
00:27:56,204 --> 00:27:58,570
I'm about to lose it.

418
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,104
No matter how enticing the guy next door is,

419
00:28:01,104 --> 00:28:04,770
I must keep myself in check.

420
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,637
I need to iron out the confusion.

421
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,438
Why are you ironing in here? Aren't you hot?

422
00:28:28,438 --> 00:28:31,237
I'm centering myself.

423
00:28:31,237 --> 00:28:33,037
Go away.

424
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:37,603
What's going on here?

425
00:28:37,603 --> 00:28:39,737
Are you playing the devoted wife,
doing embroidery and ironing?

426
00:28:39,737 --> 00:28:43,237
Mind your own business.

427
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:46,338
Give it back.

428
00:28:47,104 --> 00:28:49,304
Tell me what's bothering you.

429
00:28:49,304 --> 00:28:50,804
I'll iron for you.

430
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,804
You're just getting in the way.

431
00:28:54,937 --> 00:28:57,237
Does it make you nervous
to keep seeing his face?

432
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:59,104
Are you worried he might
dump you once he returns?

433
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,570
Are you being the devoted woman
so that you can guilt trip him

434
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,371
when he returns to say he wants to break up?

435
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:04,770
Yeah. That's exactly what's going on,

436
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,371
so don't get in the way and just go.

437
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,870
Fine. The pesky Kang Gyeong Jun
will get out of your way,

438
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,770
but you must be fearful of the Seo Yun Jae
who's about to return.

439
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:16,937
Your message is, "I've waited
all this time, so you're mine."

440
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:20,037
Your devotion could be suffocating to him.

441
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:22,004
But then again,

442
00:29:22,904 --> 00:29:27,438
Seo Yun Jae's a responsible person,
so he'll probably stick it out.

443
00:29:27,438 --> 00:29:28,670
Good luck.

444
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,603
Fine. So stop bothering me,
and give this back.

445
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:36,271
Miss Devoted,

446
00:29:37,037 --> 00:29:38,603
good luck.

447
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,237
What's wrong?

448
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:52,371
What happened?

449
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:53,570
- I burned myself.
- You burned yourself?

450
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,937
Let me see.

451
00:29:56,304 --> 00:29:57,237
Ow. That hurts.

452
00:29:57,237 --> 00:29:58,837
Get up for a second.

453
00:29:58,837 --> 00:29:59,670
Ouch.

454
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,970
Easy does it.

455
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:19,237
I'll do it.

456
00:30:19,237 --> 00:30:21,104
Just sit still.

457
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:22,937
This might scar.

458
00:30:23,603 --> 00:30:26,371
It'll be fine if I put something on it.

459
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:30,204
Yun Jae liked you because you were pretty.

460
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:32,438
You can't get a scar.

461
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,937
This is his fault. It happened
because he's keeping you waiting.

462
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:41,071
You said I'd suffocate him.

463
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,204
Even if you do, tell him to put up with it.

464
00:30:44,537 --> 00:30:48,603
Tell him he has to do
whatever you want him to.

465
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:52,071
Okay.

466
00:30:54,837 --> 00:30:56,670
Does it hurt?

467
00:30:57,171 --> 00:31:00,071
Yeah. It does hurt.

468
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,037
Do you want me to keep this going?

469
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:09,204
Yes, keep it going.

470
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:32,137
You are so cute.

471
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:35,104
You must be very popular with the students.

472
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:39,704
Like that does me any good.

473
00:31:43,937 --> 00:31:46,137
Mr. Na!

474
00:31:56,037 --> 00:31:58,404
Mr. Na,

475
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:10,137
you're here.

476
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:14,770
Are you here to stop my blind date?

477
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:23,704
You should've come sooner.

478
00:32:23,704 --> 00:32:25,770
What took you so long?

479
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:30,537
Na Hyo Sang,

480
00:32:30,537 --> 00:32:32,271
what are you doing?

481
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,704
Hurry over.

482
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:39,037
What's he doing over there?

483
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:43,137
Are you here to see your friends?

484
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,104
They're my old school friends...

485
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:49,338
Go.

486
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:51,004
Ms. Lee.

487
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,004
This is so humiliating.

488
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:11,904
How will I be able to show up
to work tomorrow?

489
00:33:13,704 --> 00:33:16,603
Na Hyo Sang, that jerk.

490
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,304
Why did you follow me?

491
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:30,137
I was worried about you

492
00:33:30,137 --> 00:33:32,970
given the circumstances under which you left.

493
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:37,204
You were worried?

494
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:42,970
I was thinking about what happened
as I was looking for you,

495
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,104
but I just can't wrap my head around it.

496
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:48,204
Do you really not get it?

497
00:33:48,204 --> 00:33:49,338
Are you stupid?

498
00:33:49,338 --> 00:33:53,537
Maybe. I just can't figure it out.

499
00:34:06,104 --> 00:34:08,204
Ms. Lee.

500
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,137
Gil Chung Sik,

501
00:34:27,137 --> 00:34:28,470
do you think this is your sister's style?

502
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,870
Mary,

503
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,970
I just don't get it.

504
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,503
So you have to

505
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:35,537
dress like Da Ran

506
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:38,271
and go with Yun Jae to the exhibition

507
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:40,338
of the old man we tailed

508
00:34:40,338 --> 00:34:42,937
for the sake of Kang Gyeong Jun?

509
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:45,937
It's all too complicated.

510
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,438
Gil Chung Sik,

511
00:34:50,904 --> 00:34:52,503
empty your mind

512
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:56,438
and just

513
00:34:56,438 --> 00:34:58,137
look with your eyes.

514
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:02,603
Do I look pretty?

515
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:09,171
Yes, you do.

516
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,570
We're all set then.

517
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,770
It's so nice to empty my mind

518
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,970
and focus on nothing but you.

519
00:35:18,037 --> 00:35:20,937
I'd look good with Kang Gyeong Jun like this.

520
00:35:21,804 --> 00:35:23,338
Gyeong Jun?

521
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:31,037
It would make more strategic
sense for me to go with Ms. Gil.

522
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:33,438
I'll report to you once I get back.

523
00:35:34,404 --> 00:35:37,537
But I even got dressed up to play the part.

524
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,171
How's your leg?

525
00:35:42,171 --> 00:35:43,970
It's not like I broke it. It's just a burn.

526
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,570
I'm fine.

527
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:49,171
You don't have to help me walk.

528
00:35:49,704 --> 00:35:52,338
Do you think all those women
have broken legs?

529
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,603
I wonder where he is.

530
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:04,970
It's his exhibition. I'm sure he's coming.

531
00:36:06,204 --> 00:36:08,237
Let's just admire the paintings.

532
00:36:15,704 --> 00:36:17,503
You seem nervous.

533
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,503
I'm glad I helped you walk.

534
00:36:25,404 --> 00:36:27,870
The person we're meeting is
someone mom knew well,

535
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,271
so even if he's not my father, he'll
probably be able to tell me who is.

536
00:36:32,004 --> 00:36:34,804
Yeah. I'm sure things will go well.

537
00:36:41,637 --> 00:36:44,338
Look at all those flowers.

538
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:46,171
I wonder what they do with them afterwards.

539
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:49,438
They'll throw them out, of course.

540
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,237
They're so pretty. I love sunflowers.

541
00:36:53,237 --> 00:36:56,937
If they're going to throw them out,
I should come get them after the show.

542
00:36:56,937 --> 00:37:00,770
Why? Are you going to make
sunflower oil with them?

543
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,537
Yes, mother.

544
00:37:08,537 --> 00:37:11,937
You're coming with me to the gathering
I told you about, right?

545
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,071
Yes.

546
00:37:14,704 --> 00:37:17,404
I'd like to see you today
to prepare you for it.

547
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:20,770
Yun Jae and I are out right now.

548
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:24,837
We're at Professor Park Min Gyu's exhibition.

549
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,237
Yun Jae's meeting Professor Park Min Gyu?

550
00:37:30,237 --> 00:37:33,404
Yes, but I don't think
Professor Park's here yet.

551
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:34,804
Da Ran,

552
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:37,570
get out of there right away.

553
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,704
Pardon?

554
00:37:38,704 --> 00:37:42,071
Come with Yun Jae to the hotel this instant.

555
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:47,071
But we're in the middle of something.

556
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:49,237
Just do as you're told.

557
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,937
Mom,

558
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:56,804
we're at an art gallery. We can't talk.

559
00:37:57,937 --> 00:38:01,171
Why can't you just tell her no?

560
00:38:02,637 --> 00:38:04,071
Don't answer.

561
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:06,937
It's not good manners to answer
the phone at an art gallery.

562
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:11,137
We'll call her back when we get out.

563
00:38:11,137 --> 00:38:12,637
Let's go.

564
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,603
The person you're trying to reach...

565
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:28,338
There he is.

566
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:38,570
He's in the middle of an interview.

567
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,404
Let's wait.

568
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:53,304
He didn't tell me not to come,

569
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:54,704
so I can go.

570
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:02,603
Daddy? What is it?

571
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:07,071
Gyeong Jun's still in a coma.

572
00:39:07,837 --> 00:39:09,704
What?

573
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:12,670
Who's looking for Gyeong Jun?

574
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:16,037
Who?

575
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,637
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

576
00:39:17,637 --> 00:39:18,770
Please show him around.

577
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,937
This way, please.

578
00:39:30,503 --> 00:39:32,737
It's been a long time, Yun Jae.

579
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,837
Congratulations on the exhibition.

580
00:39:37,804 --> 00:39:39,737
This is my wife.

581
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:41,670
Nice to meet you.

582
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,737
Congratulations on the wedding.

583
00:39:43,737 --> 00:39:44,870
Is it just the two of you?

584
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,137
Yes.

585
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:48,438
There's something I'd like to ask you.

586
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,704
Do you know Ms. Kang Hui Su?

587
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:54,937
Of course. She was my student.

588
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:59,870
Then do you know her son,
Kang Gyeong Jun?

589
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:06,637
I did hear you were in an accident.

590
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:11,104
Do you not remember seeing me last year?

591
00:40:11,503 --> 00:40:13,371
No, sir.

592
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:15,470
I have amnesia.

593
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:22,137
Why are you asking about Hui Su and her son?

594
00:40:23,503 --> 00:40:26,004
There's something I'd like you
to check for me.

595
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:33,037
Is this your painting?

596
00:40:34,004 --> 00:40:35,438
Yun Jae.

597
00:40:35,904 --> 00:40:37,004
Your mother is here.

598
00:40:37,004 --> 00:40:38,237
Hello, Professor Park.

599
00:40:38,237 --> 00:40:40,137
Long time no see.

600
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:44,404
My husband told you about
Yun Jae's condition, right?

601
00:40:44,404 --> 00:40:46,237
Yes.

602
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:49,004
I have something to discuss with him.

603
00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:51,204
I'd like to have a word with you first.

604
00:40:51,204 --> 00:40:52,770
- Excuse us.
- Of course.

605
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,004
Excuse me.

606
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:05,204
I don't know what Yun Jae
wants to know about Hui Su,

607
00:41:05,204 --> 00:41:08,438
but please let him know
I have nothing to tell him.

608
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,271
What is it?

609
00:41:12,271 --> 00:41:15,171
What did you ask Professor Park?

610
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:17,637
About this kid named Kang Gyeong Jun.

611
00:41:17,637 --> 00:41:18,570
Why?

612
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,071
He's been in a coma after having
gotten into an accident with me.

613
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:23,603
I'd like to find his father for him.

614
00:41:24,371 --> 00:41:27,137
I heard he knew Kang Gyeong Jun's mother,

615
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:29,171
so I wanted to ask him if he knew anything.

616
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:37,104
If you know Professor Park, do you
and dad know Gyeong Jun's mother?

617
00:41:37,104 --> 00:41:39,404
Her name is Kang Hui Su.

618
00:41:39,404 --> 00:41:42,470
We don't know her.

619
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,837
I've never even heard the name before.

620
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:50,271
Yun Jae, I don't think

621
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:54,704
it's a good idea for you to get
involved in that kid's affairs.

622
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,503
Dr. Seo.

623
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:08,570
I'll figure all this stuff out.

624
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,970
Don't worry about it.

625
00:42:15,937 --> 00:42:18,470
That old professor is not your father.

626
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:19,770
What?

627
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,470
My dad just called,

628
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,904
and he told me your father's looking for you.

629
00:42:27,404 --> 00:42:30,637
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the wedding.

630
00:42:31,404 --> 00:42:34,804
We're sorry we were so rushed
with the wedding.

631
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:40,171
Do you know that it was thanks to me
that you two got married?

632
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:40,970
Pardon?

633
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:43,970
Yun Jae must not have told you.

634
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:48,104
You two got together because
of an accident at a wedding, right?

635
00:42:48,104 --> 00:42:49,171
Yes.

636
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:53,071
Yun Jae was rushing out to meet me when

637
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,304
he crashed into you
trying to catch the bouquet.

638
00:42:56,304 --> 00:43:00,737
Yun Jae was rushing out to see you?

639
00:43:00,737 --> 00:43:02,271
Yes.

640
00:43:03,137 --> 00:43:07,537
He was very grateful to me
for having gotten you two together.

641
00:43:07,537 --> 00:43:11,271
You two look great together.

642
00:43:11,537 --> 00:43:12,404
Professor.

643
00:43:12,404 --> 00:43:14,603
Okay. I'll be right with you.

644
00:43:14,603 --> 00:43:15,970
Excuse me.

645
00:43:21,004 --> 00:43:24,104
But Se Yeong had said

646
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:26,770
Yun Jae was rushing out to see her.

647
00:43:34,004 --> 00:43:35,371
Let's go.

648
00:43:35,371 --> 00:43:37,237
We don't have to be here anymore.

649
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,503
He's not Gyeong Jun's father.

650
00:43:40,503 --> 00:43:43,670
Gyeong Jun's real father is looking for him.

651
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,204
They'll get to see each other soon.

652
00:43:46,603 --> 00:43:47,670
Really?

653
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,537
That's great.

654
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,570
What's wrong?

655
00:43:53,904 --> 00:43:56,770
I have to meet someone
and check on something.

656
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,570
I have to run.

657
00:44:03,037 --> 00:44:08,271
Why don't we enjoy the exhibition
and then go out for some dinner?

658
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:13,770
If my dad were more on the ball,
we could've met him right away.

659
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,271
In any case, dad told him where
the hospital was, so he'll come soon.

660
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:22,004
Maybe I should've gone with her.

661
00:44:23,004 --> 00:44:25,637
Now you know the old man is not your dad.

662
00:44:25,637 --> 00:44:27,603
I should go home.

663
00:44:27,603 --> 00:44:29,503
I think something's come up with Ms. Gil.

664
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:31,837
Aren't you going to the hospital?

665
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:34,970
Is Ms. Gil more important to you
than finding your dad?

666
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:36,071
Yup.

667
00:44:36,071 --> 00:44:39,171
Ms. Gil is more important to me
than the dad I've never met.

668
00:44:39,171 --> 00:44:41,970
She came with me even though she was hurt.

669
00:44:47,503 --> 00:44:50,737
How much would you like for them?

670
00:45:12,037 --> 00:45:13,937
I need to toss them some place

671
00:45:13,937 --> 00:45:17,071
where Gil Da Ran will notice them.

672
00:45:31,637 --> 00:45:33,603
She's not always the most alert.

673
00:45:35,704 --> 00:45:37,904
This looks too set up.

674
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:44,137
She's too short to see this high up.

675
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:46,837
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

676
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:51,271
This is really bad.

677
00:45:51,271 --> 00:45:52,804
This is way too much.

678
00:45:57,804 --> 00:45:59,338
They threw them out.

679
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:00,603
You should take them.

680
00:46:09,404 --> 00:46:11,404
This is the best.

681
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:18,371
The day Yun Jae and I met,

682
00:46:18,371 --> 00:46:22,904
he wasn't rushing out

683
00:46:22,904 --> 00:46:24,937
to see you.

684
00:46:24,937 --> 00:46:27,637
What does that matter at this point?

685
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:30,071
It does matter a lot to me.

686
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,304
I suppose it could.

687
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,603
I thought Yun Jae seemed distracted
right before the wedding

688
00:46:41,603 --> 00:46:44,404
because of me.

689
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:48,970
But I think there was something
else he was preoccupied with.

690
00:46:49,338 --> 00:46:51,137
And what was that?

691
00:46:51,704 --> 00:46:54,737
I've decided to stay out of it.

692
00:46:55,404 --> 00:46:58,204
In any case,

693
00:46:58,204 --> 00:47:01,004
I'll concede that

694
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:05,770
it wasn't me who made

695
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,770
Yun Jae waver.

696
00:47:12,137 --> 00:47:13,937
But then

697
00:47:15,071 --> 00:47:21,371
why did Yun Jae have the key
to your apartment?

698
00:47:28,904 --> 00:47:31,338
He never came by.

699
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:36,837
I had hoped he would come by,

700
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:42,338
but he never used that key.

701
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:44,904
Satisfied?

702
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:47,037
Are you happy now?

703
00:47:49,137 --> 00:47:52,338
After butting in and causing
all that confusion,

704
00:47:52,338 --> 00:47:53,570
that's what you have to say?

705
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,603
What does it matter?

706
00:47:55,603 --> 00:47:58,338
You and Yun Jae are already married.

707
00:48:00,537 --> 00:48:02,371
I'm busy. I have to go.

708
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:28,637
I should be held accountable.

709
00:48:59,171 --> 00:49:02,770
I have to take care of you
for the rest of my life.

710
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:13,237
Could you ask me the question

711
00:49:13,237 --> 00:49:14,970
you had asked earlier?

712
00:49:17,904 --> 00:49:20,104
Do you

713
00:49:21,204 --> 00:49:24,237
love me?

714
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,570
Where are you right now?

715
00:49:28,438 --> 00:49:30,271
I'll answer you

716
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:31,870
in person.

717
00:50:09,304 --> 00:50:11,104
Where have you been?

718
00:50:11,104 --> 00:50:13,237
Why didn't you answer your phone?

719
00:50:22,837 --> 00:50:26,271
You said you wanted them if they were
throwing them out anyway.

720
00:50:26,271 --> 00:50:30,071
They were throwing them out, so I went
out of my way to get them for you.

721
00:50:42,503 --> 00:50:45,304
What's wrong? Don't you like them?

722
00:50:49,137 --> 00:50:51,104
Is something wrong?

723
00:50:51,104 --> 00:50:53,104
Did someone say something to you?

724
00:50:53,104 --> 00:50:55,271
Gyeong Jun,

725
00:50:56,704 --> 00:50:59,104
it was all a misunderstanding.

726
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:04,204
Yun Jae

727
00:51:04,204 --> 00:51:07,104
never went to Lee Se Yeong.

728
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:16,071
He really did fall for me,

729
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:19,004
and he always liked me.

730
00:51:20,637 --> 00:51:24,371
He never went against his word that

731
00:51:24,371 --> 00:51:27,438
he would take care of me.

732
00:51:32,404 --> 00:51:34,637
That's great.

733
00:51:34,637 --> 00:51:36,837
There's nothing for you to be
nervous about anymore.

734
00:51:36,837 --> 00:51:38,804
Congratulations.

735
00:51:45,037 --> 00:51:47,704
It's a good thing you remained
devoted to Seo Yun Jae.

736
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,770
I'm proud of you, Gil Da Ran.

737
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:57,271
Are you that happy?

738
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:04,904
Now you can wait happily in anticipation

739
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:08,371
until Kang Gyeong Jun
disappears from your life.

740
00:52:08,704 --> 00:52:10,338
I won't get in the way.

741
00:52:57,737 --> 00:52:59,004
Da Ran,

742
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:01,171
so you can't

743
00:53:01,171 --> 00:53:02,537
come with Yun Jae

744
00:53:02,537 --> 00:53:05,137
this weekend to look for pretty rocks?

745
00:53:05,137 --> 00:53:06,837
I heard you were going somewhere
with your mother-in-law.

746
00:53:06,837 --> 00:53:08,371
Is it somewhere nice?

747
00:53:09,204 --> 00:53:10,737
Yeah.

748
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:15,404
Then should we just ask
Yun Jae to come with us?

749
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:18,338
Don't. This isn't a good time.

750
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,770
Are you not feeling well?

751
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:25,204
Did you have a fight with Yun Jae?

752
00:53:25,204 --> 00:53:26,937
You look upset.

753
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,670
It's nothing like that.

754
00:53:31,937 --> 00:53:33,371
[Incoming Call: Yun Jae's Mother]

755
00:53:34,137 --> 00:53:35,737
It's Yun Jae's mother.

756
00:53:36,503 --> 00:53:38,237
Why aren't you answering?

757
00:53:39,438 --> 00:53:41,338
Are you scared of her?

758
00:53:41,338 --> 00:53:42,770
No.

759
00:53:43,338 --> 00:53:44,970
Yes, mother.

760
00:53:46,704 --> 00:53:48,204
Today?

761
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:52,404
Is Yun Jae's mother giving her a hard time?

762
00:54:07,503 --> 00:54:10,704
I'm trying to lay down the tracks.

763
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:12,870
Get out of the way.

764
00:54:13,637 --> 00:54:16,603
Get out of the way?

765
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,603
I'm getting in your way too?

766
00:54:20,603 --> 00:54:23,137
They're just stupid train tracks.

767
00:54:24,404 --> 00:54:28,137
You should go and work where the adults are.

768
00:54:28,137 --> 00:54:31,037
Hey. I should be studying and playing too.

769
00:54:31,037 --> 00:54:32,371
I'm too young to work.

770
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:35,970
What? How old are you?

771
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,338
I'm definitely older than you.

772
00:54:38,338 --> 00:54:40,503
Mind your manners.

773
00:54:41,104 --> 00:54:42,704
Never mind.

774
00:54:42,704 --> 00:54:48,071
In a little while, your warm-handed
doctor will be back.

775
00:54:48,737 --> 00:54:50,171
I'm leaving.

776
00:54:50,637 --> 00:54:52,503
Yun Jae.

777
00:54:53,037 --> 00:54:55,071
Come back soon, Yun Jae.

778
00:54:55,071 --> 00:54:56,637
Rabbit.

779
00:54:58,438 --> 00:54:59,837
It's a secret.

780
00:55:00,603 --> 00:55:01,870
Shhh.

781
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:06,870
Are you on your way to see Kang Gyeong Jun?

782
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,037
Yes.

783
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:10,304
Someone's here to see him.

784
00:55:10,737 --> 00:55:13,171
Is it that lady who had come by earlier?

785
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:16,804
No. It's a gentleman this time.

786
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:42,104
I'm sorry.

787
00:55:44,171 --> 00:55:47,071
You're also my son, and yet...

788
00:56:28,503 --> 00:56:29,704
Dr. Seo.

789
00:56:29,704 --> 00:56:31,037
Yun Jae,

790
00:56:33,271 --> 00:56:34,770
where are you off to?

791
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:38,704
Is he here by any chance?

792
00:56:39,171 --> 00:56:41,004
I'm not sure.

793
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:46,937
Can I see you for a second?

794
00:56:48,503 --> 00:56:50,104
Yun Jae,

795
00:56:50,104 --> 00:56:55,503
I'm asking you as the eldest
son of the Gil family.

796
00:56:56,171 --> 00:57:01,404
Is your mother mean to my sister?

797
00:57:01,404 --> 00:57:03,037
Why do you ask?

798
00:57:03,537 --> 00:57:06,071
I think Da Ran's seeing your mother today,

799
00:57:06,071 --> 00:57:09,904
and she's acting like she's being
dragged to the slaughterhouse.

800
00:57:10,503 --> 00:57:12,438
Mom wants to see her?

801
00:57:12,438 --> 00:57:18,338
Da Ran loves you a lot,
so she'll put up with it,

802
00:57:18,338 --> 00:57:20,438
but please don't intimidate her
and make things tough on her.

803
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:23,837
What's there for her to be intimidated about?

804
00:57:23,837 --> 00:57:26,371
Plus, I'm not the one harassing her.

805
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,503
I told to her to wait happily
and in anticipation.

806
00:57:31,503 --> 00:57:33,304
Why is she being intimidated like a fool?

807
00:57:36,338 --> 00:57:38,204
Here you go.

808
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:41,704
You two rushed to get married,
so I didn't get a chance

809
00:57:41,704 --> 00:57:43,537
to give them to you sooner.

810
00:57:44,104 --> 00:57:48,271
I've been collecting them over the years
for my daughter-in-law-to-be.

811
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:51,438
I may have come off as a little rude

812
00:57:51,438 --> 00:57:54,704
because you didn't meet my expectations.

813
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:58,904
Let's get past that and work this out.

814
00:57:58,904 --> 00:58:04,870
It's you who Yun Jae chose to spend
the rest of his life with, after all.

815
00:58:07,104 --> 00:58:09,071
I can't

816
00:58:10,171 --> 00:58:13,004
accept these.

817
00:58:13,338 --> 00:58:14,870
What?

818
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:17,570
I...

819
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:21,804
I don't deserve these.

820
00:58:21,804 --> 00:58:26,837
Are you doing this to spite me right now?

821
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:30,004
No.

822
00:58:30,004 --> 00:58:33,137
I know

823
00:58:33,137 --> 00:58:38,404
I fail to you meet your expectations,
but that's not all.

824
00:58:38,404 --> 00:58:41,004
I'm the very worst.

825
00:58:42,037 --> 00:58:44,804
Even when Yun Jae was by my side,

826
00:58:44,804 --> 00:58:49,104
I was always unsure of myself and nervous.

827
00:58:49,904 --> 00:58:58,204
That's why I didn't trust him
and tried to forget him.

828
00:58:59,304 --> 00:59:04,438
I'm a really bad person.

829
00:59:04,837 --> 00:59:09,537
If you know you're not good enough
for him, it's not too late to let him go.

830
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:14,137
Yun Jae's not his normal self right now,

831
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:17,570
which is why I let him do as he pleased.

832
00:59:18,271 --> 00:59:22,338
I couldn't care less if
you were to leave him.

833
00:59:36,271 --> 00:59:38,137
Not now though.

834
00:59:38,137 --> 00:59:39,937
He needs me

835
00:59:40,603 --> 00:59:42,704
right now.

836
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,071
Then

837
00:59:45,071 --> 00:59:47,637
if Yun Jae returns to his normal self

838
00:59:47,637 --> 00:59:52,104
and doesn't need you anymore,
can you let him go then?

839
00:59:55,438 --> 00:59:56,603
Yes.

840
00:59:56,603 --> 01:00:00,503
If you know you don't deserve
to be with Yun Jae,

841
01:00:00,503 --> 01:00:02,904
are you ready to let him go?

842
01:00:03,637 --> 01:00:07,904
If Yun Jae returns to his old self,

843
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:12,438
I will tell him how bad I've been

844
01:00:13,537 --> 01:00:15,970
and let him go.

845
01:00:47,704 --> 01:00:49,670
Have you been crying?

846
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,837
Don't worry about it.

847
01:00:52,737 --> 01:00:54,137
Let's go.

848
01:00:54,137 --> 01:00:55,137
Go where?

849
01:00:55,137 --> 01:00:56,404
She made you cry.

850
01:00:56,404 --> 01:00:58,737
I'm going to make her pay for making you cry.

851
01:00:58,737 --> 01:01:01,371
I'll make sure I get you what
Yun Jae's face is worth.

852
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:02,937
Stop it.

853
01:01:04,037 --> 01:01:05,537
Why?

854
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:08,271
Yun Jae won't be able to defend you,
so I'll do it in his place.

855
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:16,837
I'll have to hold off on
returning to the States.

856
01:01:17,804 --> 01:01:20,537
I'm way too worried about Yun Jae.

857
01:01:20,937 --> 01:01:23,204
I met Gyeong Jun.

858
01:01:26,004 --> 01:01:30,171
You and Yun Jae

859
01:01:30,171 --> 01:01:32,171
need to meet him too.

860
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:35,870
If you're not up to it,

861
01:01:36,503 --> 01:01:39,570
I'll have Yun Jae meet him at least.

862
01:01:41,637 --> 01:01:43,137
Let go.

863
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:45,037
Let go of me.

864
01:01:45,037 --> 01:01:46,770
Stop it.

865
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:48,870
Don't. I can't do it.

866
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,438
Why not?

867
01:01:50,438 --> 01:01:52,670
I told you to wait happily in anticipation.

868
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,670
Why do you keep getting hurt
and crying over it?

869
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:56,171
You're making it hard for me
to see you like this!

870
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:58,603
If it's hard for you to see me like this,
then look away!

871
01:01:58,603 --> 01:02:00,537
I've been doing a good job
being an adult and bearing with it.

872
01:02:00,537 --> 01:02:02,371
Why are you getting in the way?

873
01:02:02,804 --> 01:02:04,171
Taking it all like a fool is being an adult?

874
01:02:04,171 --> 01:02:06,137
Being an adult is bearing with
what you can't change.

875
01:02:06,137 --> 01:02:09,470
Being an adult is about not doing
what you know is bad.

876
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:12,804
It's only kids that do as they please
even when they know

877
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:14,503
what they're doing is bad.

878
01:02:16,338 --> 01:02:19,304
So can I do as I please since I'm a kid?

879
01:02:19,304 --> 01:02:21,004
If you cry one more time,

880
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:22,870
I don't care who you're waiting for.

881
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:25,204
I'm going to take you far away from here.

882
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,404
[Big]

883
01:02:55,603 --> 01:02:57,204
Don't hold onto to the ring like that.

884
01:02:57,204 --> 01:03:00,204
Do you really think I'll take it
while you're doing the dishes?

885
01:03:00,503 --> 01:03:02,071
Are you suggesting we abandon
Gyeong Jun again?

886
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:03,737
You must choose.

887
01:03:03,737 --> 01:03:06,137
Will it be Yun Jae and me or Kang Gyeong Jun?

888
01:03:06,137 --> 01:03:08,304
What is it that you're bearing?

889
01:03:08,304 --> 01:03:09,570
Is it Seo Yun Jae who you miss

890
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:11,704
or is it his mother, the show off?

891
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,071
Gyeong Jun's father was here?

892
01:03:14,071 --> 01:03:15,737
I'm in the hospital lobby

893
01:03:15,737 --> 01:03:17,603
where I've arranged
to meet with your dad.

894
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:19,104
Are you close by?

895
01:03:22,637 --> 01:03:24,570
She was buying a birthday gift for a guy.

896
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:28,770
She took off the wedding ring
as she waited for him.

897
01:03:30,237 --> 01:03:32,237
You're done for, Gil Da Ran.
