1
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,037
I'm reckless because I'm a kid.

2
00:00:06,037 --> 00:00:07,570
[Episode 12]
Should I just whisk you off so that

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,271
you don't have to play Miss Devoted?

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,403
Are you nuts?

5
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:14,937
Even if I were to give up,
why would you whisk me off?

6
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:17,837
It was me who encouraged
you to get married.

7
00:00:17,837 --> 00:00:21,071
Since you want out because it's hard,
I should be held accountable.

8
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:23,737
If you keep that ring on though,
I won't go against my word.

9
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:28,271
But if you do take off that ring,
I'll take that as a green light

10
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,503
to whisk you off.

11
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:33,637
I'm not threatening you to take off
the ring right away.

12
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:37,370
But I won't encourage you
to keep that ring on either.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,470
Just think of it as a proposal
to keep you from crying again.

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,271
You call that a proposal?

15
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:45,171
How can I ever agree to it?

16
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,971
My proposal's on the table.

17
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:49,238
You won't have a lot of time
to mull this over

18
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:51,338
as the switchover might happen soon.

19
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:54,837
I won't break my promise that I'll go
away as soon I return to my body,

20
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:58,870
so if you want to see Kang Gyeong Jun,
take off the ring.

21
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,604
You said you couldn't go up
and see Seo Yun Jae's mother.

22
00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:10,937
Let's go.

23
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,937
Why are you sneaking glances of me?
You can look at me if you want to.

24
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,304
How can you be so unaffected
after making such a proposal?

25
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,071
I'm fine because I have no expectations.

26
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:43,104
You're not going to take off
the ring, are you?

27
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,904
Are you wavering?

28
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:53,737
If you start wavering, I'll
start getting serious, too.

29
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:57,137
Why would I waver?

30
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:59,837
At least you're not calling me
a nursling anymore.

31
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:02,304
If you called me that, I was
going to take it all back.

32
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:04,704
Does this mean you don't
want me to take it back?

33
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:07,403
How can you be joking around

34
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:08,637
after what you just said?

35
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:11,037
So this means you're taking this seriously.

36
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:12,403
Are you really wavering?

37
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:14,071
No.

38
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:16,737
So what does it matter if I joke around?

39
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,904
He's at the hospital.

40
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:28,304
He's in a coma.

41
00:02:29,637 --> 00:02:30,971
So?

42
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:33,971
He saved Yun Jae's life.

43
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:37,737
We can't turn our backs on him.

44
00:02:39,104 --> 00:02:44,670
Yun Jae saved his life.

45
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,637
They were in the same accident,

46
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,637
and Yun Jae saved him.

47
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,804
The debt has been settled, hasn't it?

48
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:59,770
Does this mean

49
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,804
you knew he was in the hospital?

50
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:08,537
Yun Jae's been trying to find his father.

51
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:11,071
Of course, I told him I didn't know anything.

52
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:13,004
Are you going to tell Yun Jae everything

53
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:16,971
and make me out to be the bad person?

54
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,304
Are you suggesting that we
abandon Gyeong Jun again?

55
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:26,704
I can't do that.

56
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:28,971
You must choose.

57
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:32,304
You once left that woman and the kid

58
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:35,171
to be with me and Yun Jae.

59
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:37,104
Who will it be this time?

60
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:41,137
Will it be Yun Jae and me
or Kang Gyeong Jun?

61
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,804
Let me make this clear.

62
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:47,971
If you choose him, you won't
ever see Yun Jae and me again.

63
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:57,704
Gil Teacher,

64
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,937
don't hold onto to the ring like that.

65
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:03,104
I won't whisk you off just because
you don't have your ring on.

66
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,904
That's not why I'm wearing the ring!

67
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:16,537
Did you wash your hair with the ring on?

68
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:19,071
I won't whisk you off just because
you don't have your ring on.

69
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,004
That's not why I kept it on.

70
00:04:35,204 --> 00:04:37,104
Is something bothering you?

71
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,770
No.

72
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,837
I'd be nuts to take a kid's joke seriously.

73
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,437
Whatever it is, you're taking it seriously.

74
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:48,338
You've been staring at your ring all day.

75
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:50,870
Did you and Yun Jae get into an argument?

76
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,137
Ae Gyeong, let's say

77
00:04:54,837 --> 00:05:00,071
a devoted wife doesn't know
when her husband will be back.

78
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:02,204
What can she do to keep
herself from falling for

79
00:05:02,204 --> 00:05:03,770
the guy next door?

80
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,271
You need to keep a silver dagger nearby.

81
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:13,403
I have a silver dagger.

82
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:16,971
You're done for if you approach me.

83
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:19,637
Right?

84
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:22,403
You shouldn't let go of
the silver dagger, right?

85
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:25,570
But the best way is to keep
the guy next door out of your sight.

86
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:31,071
You should either kick the guy out
or move to another house.

87
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:38,470
You're right. It's best just
not to be around him.

88
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,338
Hey. Is that contract teaching position
still available in Chuncheon?

89
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:46,537
They found someone ages ago.

90
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:47,837
Why do you ask?

91
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:52,338
Aren't you going to stay here until
you get your official appointment?

92
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:55,737
I was just curious.

93
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:05,104
You can take off your precious ring.

94
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,503
I won't whisk you off just because
you don't have your ring on.

95
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,737
Let me know when you're done.

96
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,637
I can put the laces on for you.

97
00:06:16,604 --> 00:06:18,204
Kang Gyeong Jun,

98
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:21,937
how can you joke around after
putting me in this predicament?

99
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,737
Having you deal with a predicament

100
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,570
is better than seeing you depressed.

101
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:31,271
I can't play along with your
childish games right now.

102
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:35,670
Would you rather be an adult and bear it all?

103
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,570
I'm just curious.

104
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,804
What is it that you're bearing?

105
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:41,470
What do you find so hard to put up with?

106
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,770
Is it Seo Yun Jae who you miss

107
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,637
or is it his mother who's a show off?

108
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,704
Or is it his unapproachable father?

109
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:49,704
It's you.

110
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:52,338
- Me?
- That's right.

111
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:54,171
I find you the most difficult to bear.

112
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:55,704
Why me?

113
00:06:55,704 --> 00:06:56,971
I've been so good to you.

114
00:06:56,971 --> 00:07:00,071
Yup. Having a great time with you

115
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:03,604
while I'm supposed to be waiting for Yun Jae
has been the hardest to bear.

116
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:05,403
I've been hard to bear?

117
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:07,637
What would you have done
if I were even nicer to you?

118
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:08,804
You would've keeled over.

119
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,171
In any case, it was wrong of me.

120
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:14,837
I should've known better, and I won't
be like that any more.

121
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:17,470
You won't need me once
you find your father, right?

122
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,171
Let's go our separate ways
once you find your father.

123
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:21,503
You don't have to feel responsible for me.

124
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:24,704
Fine. I'm glad we won't need each other.

125
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:27,637
Yup. Let's part ways for good.

126
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:38,104
She's trying to sever her ties with me
now that Yun Jae's about to return.

127
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:33,770
So she's started, eh?

128
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,437
I should start too then.

129
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:52,704
Gil Da Ran,

130
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:55,470
I wanted to throw out anything
that ties me to you too,

131
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,171
but you've never given me anything.

132
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:58,370
See?

133
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,004
You haven't done anything for me.

134
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:03,737
And look.

135
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:05,238
I've done so much for you.

136
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:08,403
So this is why you've
had it so tough, right?

137
00:09:08,403 --> 00:09:10,271
What if I had given you enough
to fill up the whole bag?

138
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:12,004
The stress would've killed you.

139
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,238
I really

140
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,204
haven't done anything for him.

141
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,637
These are all going.

142
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,837
The flowers will wilt eventually.

143
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:39,604
I'll just keep them until then.

144
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:57,470
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm going to throw you out.

145
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,503
I might go to China at some point.

146
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,704
The Great Wall of China.

147
00:11:36,804 --> 00:11:43,071
He's even taken me to the Great Wall.

148
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:51,338
Gyeong Jun,

149
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,071
I'm sorry.

150
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,004
I like you.

151
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:37,604
My dad hasn't heard back from him, either.

152
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:39,837
Why isn't he coming?

153
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:42,670
I think it was the guy
who came by the other day.

154
00:13:43,604 --> 00:13:47,904
So he came for a quick visit and that's it?

155
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:50,670
Will we not be able to find him
if he doesn't call again?

156
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:54,570
It would be his loss.

157
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,704
I'll soon be returning to
my body and waking up.

158
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:59,837
He would then be losing a smart, rich,

159
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:01,204
and very well-behaved son.

160
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:03,870
That's right. It'd be his loss.

161
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:06,971
Don't tell Gil Teacher.

162
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,971
She can't wait for me to find my father
so that she can get rid of me.

163
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:11,437
She'll be disappointed.

164
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:13,338
She's cleaned me out of her life already.

165
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:15,837
Gyeong Jun,

166
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:18,604
it's okay even if you don't find your father.

167
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:22,403
Once you return to your body,
we can go back to the States.

168
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,704
Once my birthday comes around,

169
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:27,271
I'll be fine living alone wherever.

170
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:30,770
I'm going to sever my ties
and take off then.

171
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,470
You startled me.

172
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:36,737
Shouldn't we find out how much money

173
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:39,037
Gyeong Jun will be coming into?

174
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:41,071
Why don't you call the States?

175
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:46,271
I'll look into into it after his birthday.

176
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,238
Good grief.

177
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,470
You've reached Miracle.

178
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:58,071
A reservation?

179
00:14:58,071 --> 00:14:59,238
Sure.

180
00:14:59,238 --> 00:15:01,104
Of course.

181
00:15:01,104 --> 00:15:04,403
Yes.

182
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,470
For two. Great.

183
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,204
You can make your selections
once you get here.

184
00:15:10,204 --> 00:15:11,704
Yes.

185
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:14,704
We'll have a nice table ready for you.

186
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:20,271
Kang Gyeong Jun's friends
are looking for his father.

187
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:22,804
I thought you should know.

188
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:25,637
That side's searching, too?

189
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,437
By the way, do you know

190
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:35,570
if Da Ran was seeing someone
after calling off the first wedding?

191
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:38,437
I don't know. Why do you ask?

192
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:44,503
She came to see me and suddenly
said she didn't deserve Yun Jae.

193
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:49,904
It seemed like she really meant it.
She appeared to be feeling guilty.

194
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:53,171
She did come to me too,

195
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:55,370
and she seemed troubled.

196
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:57,837
Really?

197
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:03,004
Yun Jae is looking out for her
more than he ever used to,

198
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,904
so I don't know what could
possibly be bothering her.

199
00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:10,204
I want the old Yun Jae back,
but Da Ran says

200
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:15,570
she will only stick around
for the current Yun Jae.

201
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,804
That makes me even more wary of her.

202
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:23,071
I figured you wouldn't come.

203
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:25,770
I have to go because it's
an annual family event.

204
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,437
I'll tell them you had to go
to a colleague's wedding.

205
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:30,804
If they call, I'll tell them I'm home.

206
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:35,037
I'm taking your car.

207
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:38,971
Should I have kept these
in the freezer longer?

208
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:45,271
I should cool down the car for you, right?

209
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:50,405
[Remote Engine Start
Temperature Settings: High]

210
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:08,304
It's so hot. What's going on?

211
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,770
I should have turned on the AC,
but I guess hit the heater button.

212
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,870
It's like a dry sauna in there.

213
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,937
Leave the car here.

214
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:34,704
It's my parents. Go on in
so they don't see you.

215
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:36,037
Why should I?

216
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:39,271
I'm not cooperating. It's not like
I'll be seeing them again anyway.

217
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,670
I should turn on the AC.

218
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:51,837
I'm all ready. Let's go.

219
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,503
You were home?

220
00:17:53,503 --> 00:17:55,370
He's on his way out to the wedding.

221
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,770
Dressed like that?

222
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,171
Are you going to your colleague's wedding?

223
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:00,238
No.

224
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:02,137
Then come camping with us.

225
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:03,403
Come on, Yun Jae.

226
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:05,037
I'm not coming.

227
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:15,171
We had a fight.

228
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:17,537
The four of us can go. I'll drive.

229
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:18,704
Let's go, dad.

230
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,804
Did I slam the door too forcefully?

231
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:31,004
I was going to find rocks with Mr. Gil,

232
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:33,004
and Ms. Gil said she was
making kimbap for me.

233
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:34,804
And Chung Sik and I had plans

234
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,637
to watch porn.

235
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,804
What a shame.

236
00:18:43,403 --> 00:18:46,238
Don't you dare call or text Yun Jae.

237
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,937
I'm throwing everything out.

238
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:03,403
This house will be free
of Gil Da Ran's things.

239
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,737
This whole room has to go.

240
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:25,104
Huh?

241
00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:30,737
She brought them back in.

242
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:38,104
But then again,

243
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:40,137
they're not things anyone
can part with easily.

244
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,537
[Father-in-law: Yun Jae, we need
to find a son-in-law stone together]

245
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:26,670
[Mother-in-law: Yun Jae,
guess what I put in the kimbap]

246
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,004
[Come try them and then guess]

247
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:35,004
[Brother-in-law: Yun Jae, you said
to keep one's defiance short]

248
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,604
Good grief.

249
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,770
They all want to see me so badly,

250
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,837
but why aren't they giving me directions?

251
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,271
There are so many stones.

252
00:21:05,137 --> 00:21:08,637
It's pointy, rough, and shiny,

253
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:11,304
just like Kang Gyeong Jun.

254
00:21:23,037 --> 00:21:24,238
Huh?

255
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:26,470
Where is everyone?

256
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,004
Did they go to the supermarket?

257
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:35,870
You must be here alone.

258
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:41,604
I'm here with my family.

259
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:42,637
Hey!

260
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,137
What are you doing here?

261
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:49,704
Your family was begging me to come,

262
00:21:49,704 --> 00:21:51,338
so I had no other choice.

263
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:53,503
But I told them not to call you.

264
00:21:53,503 --> 00:21:55,904
I really didn't want to come either,

265
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:57,637
but your family kept texting me.

266
00:21:57,637 --> 00:21:59,870
See? I just got
another text message.

267
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,537
Did you find the camping site?

268
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:05,304
Make up with Da Ran, okay?

269
00:22:05,304 --> 00:22:07,238
You two have a great time.

270
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:10,737
Why are they telling us to have a great time?

271
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,937
We can have the kimbap by the creek,
spend the night at a hotel,

272
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,837
and pick them up tomorrow.

273
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,971
They don't have a car, and they won't
just leave the tent behind, will they?

274
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:27,870
Wasn't it smart of me to tell
Yun Jae to come in a cab?

275
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,437
Yes. Good job.

276
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:35,670
They really took all the food.

277
00:22:38,271 --> 00:22:40,403
They planned this thoroughly.

278
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:43,470
They want us to make up, cook together,

279
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,804
and share the one sleeping bag
they left behind.

280
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:49,971
Why's my family so clueless?

281
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:55,171
If they weren't so clueless, they'd have
caught on that I'm not Yun Jae by now.

282
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:58,804
Are these the son-in-law stones
they found for me?

283
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:03,537
They're all round and smooth.

284
00:23:03,537 --> 00:23:06,637
They really don't know me, do they?

285
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,370
This one's a bit...

286
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:15,238
Is it a bit like you?

287
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:17,870
Did you find it?

288
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,604
It was one that was getting in the way.

289
00:23:20,604 --> 00:23:22,971
Dad told me to find you a rock.

290
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,904
It's more like you, isn't it?

291
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,904
Yeah, but what does that matter?

292
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:29,238
I'll never be part of your family anyway.

293
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:33,570
Let's go.

294
00:23:34,837 --> 00:23:37,570
I have to keep an eye on
our things. You can go.

295
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,604
Are you just going to sit here?
Let's take a look around.

296
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:41,770
Huh?

297
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,937
Do you really want me to go alone?

298
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:47,870
I'm counting to 3.

299
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,670
1...

300
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,037
Do you really want me to go?

301
00:23:52,037 --> 00:23:53,770
2...

302
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:55,570
This is it.

303
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,503
3.

304
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,537
Let's go.

305
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:06,704
Wow.

306
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,670
They're so pretty.

307
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:13,604
Why did you throw out
the ones I got for you then?

308
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:24,437
You look crazy with
that flower in your hair.

309
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:25,804
Madwoman.

310
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,637
You can just ask me to take
a picture of you.

311
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:40,104
But then again, you can't bear it
if I'm nice to you, right?

312
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,971
Hey!

313
00:24:54,737 --> 00:24:56,271
Geez.

314
00:25:18,304 --> 00:25:20,338
I'm throwing you in if you ever
call me a nursling again.

315
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:21,338
I won't. I won't.

316
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:23,437
Please, sir. Please.

317
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:24,470
Sir?

318
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,704
Please don't, sir.

319
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:29,971
I'm sorry.

320
00:25:32,104 --> 00:25:34,570
You two look so good together.

321
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,171
Is he your boyfriend?

322
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:37,437
No.

323
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:39,971
So you're married.

324
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,704
No. He's my little brother.

325
00:25:43,704 --> 00:25:45,704
Little brother?

326
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:48,870
You must be older than you look.

327
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:51,904
What are you talking about?

328
00:25:51,904 --> 00:25:55,171
Anyone can see that she's old.

329
00:25:56,971 --> 00:25:58,304
Gil Da Ran.

330
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:01,537
Byeong Su.

331
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:02,937
It's so nice to see you.

332
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,537
- I haven't seen you since graduation.
- I know.

333
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:06,437
This is amazing.

334
00:26:07,137 --> 00:26:09,537
How have you been? Are you here camping?

335
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:12,037
Oh, right. You're working
at a school in the area.

336
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,037
Yeah. It's right next door.

337
00:26:14,037 --> 00:26:15,971
- Stop by, will you?
- Okay.

338
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:18,470
This is your younger brother?

339
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,137
Yes.

340
00:26:24,437 --> 00:26:28,770
Say, do you have any contract
positions open at your school?

341
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,071
I'd like to move to another school
before my official appointment.

342
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:32,670
Really?

343
00:26:33,304 --> 00:26:35,304
I can ask around.

344
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:36,238
Is it urgent?

345
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:38,104
Yes. A bit.

346
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,370
- You have a new number, right?
- Yeah.

347
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,437
Give me your number. I'll see
what I can find and then call you.

348
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:44,770
Great. Thank you so much.

349
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,238
I'll call you. See you later, okay?

350
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,437
Bye.

351
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:48,804
Let's go.

352
00:26:50,937 --> 00:26:54,837
Gil Da Ran, are you moving tents?

353
00:26:54,837 --> 00:26:56,971
He and I are just going
to meet up after dinner.

354
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:58,171
Let's go.

355
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,238
I'm sorry, but could you open this for us?

356
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:10,670
Sure.

357
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,271
Thank you.

358
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:16,437
You must be here with your girlfriend.

359
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:21,104
She's my sister, my
significantly older sister.

360
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:26,004
We're trying to set up our tent.
Could you help us?

361
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:27,971
We've never done this before.

362
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:30,004
Of course.

363
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,071
I'd be happy to help.

364
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:37,437
This isn't something ladies should be doing.

365
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:40,304
Move aside. You don't want to get hurt.

366
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:43,837
This is simple.

367
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:45,470
Could you hold this?

368
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:53,971
Gyeong Jun,

369
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:56,071
come on. We need to go.

370
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:58,503
It's not windy. The tent won't fly away,

371
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:00,704
so they'll be fine as is.

372
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,670
Thank you.

373
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,503
I have to go. My sister...

374
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:08,537
Not only is she very old,
but she also loves to nag.

375
00:28:08,537 --> 00:28:09,837
Geez.

376
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,503
Come by our tent later this evening.

377
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:17,137
Definitely.

378
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:18,537
How old are you?

379
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,604
They're all much older than you.

380
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,137
But you're older than me too.

381
00:28:29,271 --> 00:28:31,238
What were you talking about so intimately?

382
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:32,937
They wanted my number.

383
00:28:32,937 --> 00:28:34,670
So you gave it to them?

384
00:28:35,537 --> 00:28:38,870
I told you I can't resist
if women come on to me.

385
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,804
If you want to keep me to yourself,

386
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,470
take off the ring.

387
00:28:46,704 --> 00:28:50,004
Come up with a plan. The old restaurant...

388
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:53,604
He's been sitting there for hours.

389
00:28:53,604 --> 00:28:55,137
I wonder if he's waiting for someone.

390
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,804
It's better than having a
completely empty restaurant.

391
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:01,604
Watch. Quality service.

392
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:06,104
It's his third refill.

393
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:12,271
More coffee, sir?

394
00:29:13,238 --> 00:29:15,403
You're Hui Su's brother, aren't you?

395
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:16,837
Pardon?

396
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,071
I'm Gyeong Jun's father.

397
00:29:28,437 --> 00:29:29,804
I'm okay.

398
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:38,238
I won't get into details as I don't want

399
00:29:38,238 --> 00:29:40,837
to hurt the people around me.

400
00:29:41,537 --> 00:29:43,837
You're a married man, I see.

401
00:29:44,437 --> 00:29:46,304
I had assumed as much.

402
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,870
I'll take care of Gyeong Jun.

403
00:29:53,804 --> 00:29:57,604
We're managing Gyeong Jun's
inheritance though.

404
00:29:57,604 --> 00:30:01,071
You can continue to do that.

405
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:05,071
I just want to take Gyeong Jun
and look after him.

406
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:10,670
So your choice is Gyeong Jun?

407
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:14,804
As you wanted,

408
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:19,570
I will never show myself
to you and Yun Jae again.

409
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,537
I'm taking off with Gyeong Jun
after his birthday.

410
00:30:21,537 --> 00:30:23,503
It's not Gyeong Jun's birthday.

411
00:30:23,503 --> 00:30:25,537
It's the day when Yun Jae
got a second chance at life.

412
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:29,204
Haven't you ever thought of Gyeong Jun

413
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:32,238
as we celebrated the day every year?

414
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:33,804
No.

415
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:43,037
You probably just want to think of me
as Seo Yun Jae's fill-in,

416
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:45,637
but that's more insulting,
so just forget I ever existed.

417
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:47,370
Did I make you feel that bad?

418
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,137
It's just that you kept ruining my pictures.

419
00:30:50,137 --> 00:30:52,338
Then delete them.

420
00:30:52,338 --> 00:30:54,770
You don't like them because I look
more like me than Seo Yun Jae.

421
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,171
Just delete them.

422
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,937
Forget it.

423
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,971
Clean up, okay?

424
00:31:01,971 --> 00:31:03,804
I'm off to see Byeong Su.

425
00:31:03,804 --> 00:31:05,604
But I have something to do too.

426
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:08,470
Those girls earlier keep
telling me to come by.

427
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,904
And you're going to go?

428
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:12,570
You can go see Byeong Su
while I hang out with the girls.

429
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,670
Those girls don't know you're a minor.

430
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,503
And what if something happens?
It's too dangerous.

431
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:18,737
You shouldn't go.

432
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:21,304
I'm going precisely for the danger aspect.
I wouldn't go if it was safe.

433
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:25,370
Fine. Do what you will.

434
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:29,704
You're abandoning me
and putting me in danger's way.

435
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:31,171
Don't hold me accountable
if anything goes wrong.

436
00:31:32,604 --> 00:31:35,104
Always drooling over girls...

437
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,637
I ruined her pictures?

438
00:31:49,637 --> 00:31:51,503
I can just delete them all then.

439
00:32:00,537 --> 00:32:02,637
She brought it back.

440
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,637
Gyeong Jun can be really charming
when he wants to be.

441
00:32:29,637 --> 00:32:32,704
What if those girls fall
head over heels for him?

442
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:35,971
I should head back.

443
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,204
That Gil Da Ran...

444
00:32:41,204 --> 00:32:43,971
I can't believe she brought the rock back.

445
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,137
She's such a scatterbrain.

446
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:49,804
She'll never find her way back in the dark.

447
00:32:49,804 --> 00:32:51,837
Scatterbrain Gil Da Ran.

448
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:11,137
Are you on your way to the girls?

449
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:14,570
Do they need a lamp?

450
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:17,870
Their tent is that way.

451
00:33:21,403 --> 00:33:23,937
I was on my way to see you.

452
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,670
It's getting dark.

453
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,137
Take this with you.

454
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:35,604
I just have something to ask Byeong Su.

455
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:37,570
I'll be right back.

456
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,171
Really?

457
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:40,971
Then

458
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:42,971
should I wait for you here?

459
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:45,971
Are you really not going to the girls' tent?

460
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:48,837
If you want me to wait,

461
00:33:48,837 --> 00:33:50,870
I will.

462
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:54,437
Then wait. I won't be long.

463
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:59,804
If you don't hurry, a virgin ghost
may come and get me.

464
00:34:02,338 --> 00:34:05,171
I'm going with her if she's sexy.

465
00:34:11,437 --> 00:34:14,570
Thank you for coming with me
to see Gyeong Jun.

466
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:18,370
I'm only here because you said
you wouldn't tell Yun Jae if I came.

467
00:34:19,004 --> 00:34:23,037
This is the first time we're going
to see Gyeong Jun together.

468
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,370
[Daehan High School
Mr. Kim Jinguk]

469
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,204
It didn't take long, did it?

470
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,604
Gyeong Jun.

471
00:36:03,904 --> 00:36:05,604
Gyeong Jun.

472
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:16,503
Gil Teacher.

473
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:21,904
Are you okay?

474
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:23,837
Are you in a lot of pain?

475
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:28,804
This time,

476
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:31,470
I don't know if I returned to my own body

477
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:40,370
or dreamed Seo Yun Jae's dream,

478
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,171
but I saw his parents.

479
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:50,403
What are you talking about?

480
00:36:51,104 --> 00:36:53,271
Maybe it was just a dream.

481
00:36:58,704 --> 00:37:01,470
Why does it hurt so much?

482
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,570
Gil Teacher,

483
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:09,637
maybe the ghost will really come and get me.

484
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,670
Gyeong Jun.

485
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,437
They say he's been moving as of late,

486
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:34,137
so he'll wake up soon.

487
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:37,870
You can watch him with ease now,

488
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:42,071
but won't it get more difficult
once he wakes up?

489
00:38:27,604 --> 00:38:30,637
It's a relief that you're always

490
00:38:30,637 --> 00:38:34,004
by my side whenever I emerge
from these painful attacks.

491
00:38:36,304 --> 00:38:40,537
When there's a complete switchover though,

492
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:43,537
I'll be all alone again.

493
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:49,271
It's okay though.

494
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,971
I've always been alone.

495
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:03,704
Though it's not real, right now

496
00:39:03,704 --> 00:39:06,971
I have a mom and dad

497
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:10,204
as well as parents-in-law
who run a dumpling place.

498
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:14,704
And I have Chung Sik.

499
00:39:19,104 --> 00:39:23,470
And Gil Da Ran, too.

500
00:39:28,304 --> 00:39:31,104
When I go back,

501
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,403
no one will remember me.

502
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:46,637
Only Seo Yun Jae will be left,

503
00:39:48,238 --> 00:39:51,904
and Kang Gyeong Jun will be no more.

504
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:58,403
But you know I've been here

505
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:02,570
so even after I leave,

506
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:12,037
couldn't you keep me in your memory?

507
00:40:15,403 --> 00:40:18,037
Don't wipe me out completely.

508
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:25,870
Don't be completely preoccupied
with Seo Yun Jae,

509
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:30,837
and take some time to remember me as well.

510
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,004
What?

511
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,037
You left the two alone at the camping site?

512
00:41:09,037 --> 00:41:12,537
They had had a spat, so we figured
they needed some alone time.

513
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:15,604
It was my idea.

514
00:41:15,604 --> 00:41:19,104
Empty your brain of stupid ideas,
Gil Chung Sik.

515
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,437
Okay.

516
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,704
How was the States?

517
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,470
Is your dad doing well?

518
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:29,470
I've sorted everything out with dad,

519
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,904
so I should head back to the States
with Gyeong Jun soon.

520
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,137
Yeah.

521
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:37,204
You should stop stalking
that old man and Yun Jae

522
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:38,937
and return to the States.

523
00:41:40,238 --> 00:41:41,503
What?

524
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:42,971
You're heading back to the States?

525
00:41:42,971 --> 00:41:44,670
Yeah.

526
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,171
Me too.

527
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,238
America, me too.

528
00:41:49,937 --> 00:41:53,037
Mary, America. Ame...

529
00:41:57,271 --> 00:42:00,238
[Ms. Jang Mary, this is
Gyeong Jun's father]

530
00:42:00,238 --> 00:42:01,770
[Could I meet with you?]

531
00:42:03,238 --> 00:42:05,904
Mary, wait for me.

532
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,537
Mary.

533
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:10,037
Mary.

534
00:42:11,937 --> 00:42:14,171
Your father finally got in touch with me.

535
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:16,171
Come with me to meet him.

536
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:20,004
Why is he so secretive?
Why did he block his number?

537
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:23,304
Is he ashamed of me because
I'm a love child? How insulting.

538
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:26,503
He won't know who you are, so you can
meet him without him knowing.

539
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:29,137
Since he's gotten in touch,
I'll go and see who he is.

540
00:42:29,137 --> 00:42:31,238
Now that you've found your father,

541
00:42:31,238 --> 00:42:34,637
Ms. Gil can move on with peace of mind.

542
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,338
You make it sound so simple.

543
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,637
You want to transfer to
a school outside Seoul?

544
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:49,937
My first appointment will probably
be in that area anyway,

545
00:42:49,937 --> 00:42:52,171
so it wouldn't hurt to get there now
and get myself acclimated.

546
00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:53,971
What about Yun Jae?

547
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:57,937
Is he okay with that?
You only just got married.

548
00:42:57,937 --> 00:43:00,071
We talked it through.

549
00:43:00,804 --> 00:43:03,238
- Dad.
- Yes?

550
00:43:03,238 --> 00:43:06,204
You were 35 when mom, who was 19,

551
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:09,870
came to you against her parents' wishes

552
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,637
and asked you to marry her.

553
00:43:12,637 --> 00:43:14,503
Why did you say yes?

554
00:43:16,937 --> 00:43:18,770
Well...

555
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,238
Why did I say yes...

556
00:43:21,637 --> 00:43:27,770
I had asked for a transfer to a remote island

557
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,171
to keep myself away from your mother.

558
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:36,503
I did all I could not to get
involved with your mother,

559
00:43:36,503 --> 00:43:41,770
but the more I tried, the more
I fell in love with her.

560
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:44,770
I was crying over

561
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:48,437
how I had lost her, how I would
never be able to forget her,

562
00:43:48,437 --> 00:43:51,704
and your mom, thankfully,

563
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:54,271
came to me just then.

564
00:43:55,704 --> 00:44:00,271
But how did you know you'd never forget her?

565
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:02,271
Wouldn't you have only known
at the end of your life?

566
00:44:02,271 --> 00:44:04,770
That's true,

567
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:09,870
but it would've been sad if I had
spent my entire life wondering.

568
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,437
I had the courage to go for it, however,

569
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:17,071
and I got a lifetime of happiness.

570
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:22,037
But how did you work up the courage?

571
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:26,338
I tossed all sense of reason into the ocean.

572
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:29,004
And that's how

573
00:44:29,004 --> 00:44:31,370
I ended up with your mom.

574
00:44:45,937 --> 00:44:50,637
I'm at the hospital lobby where
I've arranged to meet with your dad.

575
00:44:50,637 --> 00:44:51,503
What about you?

576
00:44:51,503 --> 00:44:53,137
I'm at the hospital.

577
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:54,704
I'll meet you at the lobby.

578
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,770
Yun Jae,

579
00:45:02,537 --> 00:45:06,637
Da Ran came to see me recently.
Has she told you?

580
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,137
You told her nothing had gone on between us.

581
00:45:09,937 --> 00:45:10,770
Yes.

582
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:14,804
Has that caused any problems?

583
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,937
I thought she'd be happy,

584
00:45:18,937 --> 00:45:21,037
but she was so shocked.

585
00:45:22,004 --> 00:45:24,503
I'd decided to let you go for your sake,

586
00:45:24,503 --> 00:45:26,870
but she didn't seem too
happy to hear the news.

587
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,503
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.

588
00:45:28,503 --> 00:45:31,837
She was so happy that she was moved to tears.

589
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:37,403
Do you still check in on Kang Gyeong Jun?

590
00:45:37,937 --> 00:45:39,304
Why do you ask?

591
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:41,604
I'm his primary care physician.

592
00:45:41,604 --> 00:45:45,870
I feel sorry for him. You should
continue to look out for him.

593
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,937
Even Lee Se Yeong feels sorry for me?

594
00:45:55,937 --> 00:45:57,338
I can't wait to return my body.

595
00:46:02,437 --> 00:46:04,071
I'm here.

596
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:05,338
I'll be right there.

597
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:47,670
Yun Jae.

598
00:46:49,537 --> 00:46:50,670
Gyeong Jun.

599
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,071
Are you okay, Yun Jae?

600
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:54,804
Are you not feeling well?

601
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,338
What's wrong?

602
00:46:57,338 --> 00:46:59,770
Dr. Seo, are you okay?

603
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,204
I'm fine.

604
00:47:04,204 --> 00:47:07,004
I'm better now. It was just a dizzy spell.

605
00:47:08,904 --> 00:47:10,704
Are you sure you're okay?

606
00:47:12,137 --> 00:47:14,004
- I'm fine.
- No.

607
00:47:14,004 --> 00:47:16,470
Let's get you checked out.

608
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,770
I can't leave things like this.

609
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:21,037
Let's go.

610
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:27,704
Did you come to see me?

611
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:31,137
Yes, and the director of this hospital
is a friend of mine.

612
00:47:32,137 --> 00:47:38,670
Had you come to see a patient here
with mom recently?

613
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,537
What are you talking about?

614
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:45,503
I thought I saw you two.

615
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,071
We were never here together.

616
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:55,171
You don't look well. Let's get you examined.

617
00:47:58,437 --> 00:48:02,470
I know my own body best.

618
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:06,037
I know this isn't something
that requires tests.

619
00:48:08,104 --> 00:48:11,904
Do you get dizzy spells often?

620
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,370
Every now and again.

621
00:48:15,937 --> 00:48:17,870
Yun Jae,

622
00:48:18,804 --> 00:48:21,670
your mother would be very
worried if she found out.

623
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,171
You may not remember,

624
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:26,338
but you were very ill when you were little.

625
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:28,804
If anything bothers you at all,

626
00:48:28,804 --> 00:48:30,670
you should see the doctor right away.

627
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:32,737
Okay.

628
00:48:32,737 --> 00:48:37,204
But don't tell mom.

629
00:48:37,204 --> 00:48:38,971
It will only complicate matters.

630
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:43,604
Okay.

631
00:48:52,437 --> 00:48:56,370
When Yun Jae's test results come out,
please notify me first.

632
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,403
I don't want word getting
out at the hospital.

633
00:48:58,737 --> 00:48:59,870
Yes, Dr. Seo.

634
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,004
So he had you get a whole bunch of tests?

635
00:49:04,004 --> 00:49:05,403
Yeah.

636
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,704
This dude was apparently
very ill when he was little.

637
00:49:08,704 --> 00:49:11,104
His dad was really worried
he'd get sick again.

638
00:49:11,104 --> 00:49:15,704
Does it hurt when your soul
travels back and forth?

639
00:49:17,637 --> 00:49:19,104
It's ridiculously painful.

640
00:49:19,104 --> 00:49:22,704
Seo Yun Jae's father cares
a lot about his son.

641
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:26,403
I don't know why your father never showed up.

642
00:49:27,271 --> 00:49:29,537
I've decided to give up on finding my dad.

643
00:49:30,537 --> 00:49:32,071
Just tell Ms. Gil my dad came,

644
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:34,204
so she won't have to bother with it anymore.

645
00:49:37,004 --> 00:49:40,004
I was going to find your dad for you,

646
00:49:41,338 --> 00:49:44,071
but I guess now I'm the only one

647
00:49:44,071 --> 00:49:46,271
who will be by your side.

648
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:49,204
You brought more of your stuff, didn't you?

649
00:49:49,204 --> 00:49:50,370
I'm throwing everything out.

650
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:51,870
I'll take care of it.

651
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,937
We should get ready to go back to the States.

652
00:50:09,171 --> 00:50:10,804
Yun Jae.

653
00:50:11,604 --> 00:50:12,403
Gyeong Jun.

654
00:50:17,503 --> 00:50:20,937
I thought he was Gyeong Jun's father,

655
00:50:21,737 --> 00:50:23,937
but he turned out to be Seo Yun Jae's father.

656
00:50:31,437 --> 00:50:35,904
I should plan a great birthday party
for Gyeong Jun to cheer him up.

657
00:50:37,437 --> 00:50:41,737
Shouldn't he have come to hold
his sick son's hand?

658
00:50:52,604 --> 00:50:56,238
Warm hands must run in the family.

659
00:51:03,204 --> 00:51:07,604
Ms. Gil, you've been working late these days.

660
00:51:07,604 --> 00:51:10,670
I have some more work to do.
I'll see you tomorrow.

661
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,104
I doubt it's work. You must've
had a spat with your husband.

662
00:51:26,437 --> 00:51:28,570
June 24th.

663
00:51:29,137 --> 00:51:31,837
It'll be Gyeong Jun's birthday soon.

664
00:51:32,637 --> 00:51:35,238
Happy birthday, Gyeong Jun.

665
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:55,204
Gyeong Jun,

666
00:51:56,104 --> 00:51:58,537
you're up!

667
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:09,171
What are you looking at?

668
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:19,171
Gyeong Jun.

669
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:27,304
Gyeong Jun!

670
00:52:28,737 --> 00:52:30,537
Gyeong Jun!

671
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:32,604
Gyeong Jun!

672
00:52:32,604 --> 00:52:33,870
What?

673
00:52:37,304 --> 00:52:39,204
Why were you yelling?

674
00:52:40,271 --> 00:52:42,637
You

675
00:52:42,637 --> 00:52:44,570
disappeared.

676
00:52:45,804 --> 00:52:48,470
Why would I disappear?

677
00:52:49,204 --> 00:52:51,937
Gyeong Jun,

678
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:57,204
I'm fine the way things are right now,

679
00:52:58,271 --> 00:53:01,537
and I'd be fine if you were to
return to your body,

680
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:08,403
but please don't disappear.

681
00:53:12,403 --> 00:53:15,204
You just had a bad dream.

682
00:53:15,204 --> 00:53:17,670
Why would I disappear?

683
00:53:40,904 --> 00:53:41,971
What's all this?

684
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:44,637
I got some groceries.

685
00:53:53,037 --> 00:53:55,437
She must know tomorrow's my birthday.

686
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:01,104
[Incoming Call: Byeong Su]
Byeong Su?

687
00:54:04,704 --> 00:54:07,537
Gil Teacher, phone.

688
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:09,304
Should I get it for you?

689
00:54:12,403 --> 00:54:13,238
What?

690
00:54:13,238 --> 00:54:15,137
Isn't this Da Ran's cell phone?

691
00:54:15,537 --> 00:54:17,370
You must be her brother.

692
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:20,370
I'm the man she's living with.

693
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,071
Keep it short.

694
00:54:22,071 --> 00:54:26,338
Da Ran asked me about a contract
position, and one opened up.

695
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:28,937
I also found a nice apartment
for her near the school,

696
00:54:28,937 --> 00:54:31,770
so please have her call me if
she wants to move in right away.

697
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,037
Okay.

698
00:54:44,904 --> 00:54:46,637
You got a call. Call him back.

699
00:54:47,171 --> 00:54:48,537
Okay.

700
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,737
I heard you met your father today.

701
00:54:51,737 --> 00:54:53,637
Mary told me.

702
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:56,503
Yeah.

703
00:54:56,904 --> 00:54:59,238
What was he like?

704
00:55:00,737 --> 00:55:02,570
Don't worry about it.

705
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:05,770
The more you know, the more ties
you will have to sever.

706
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,004
I suppose.

707
00:55:09,104 --> 00:55:11,470
I have to see Seo Yun Jae's
parents tomorrow.

708
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,004
They say it's a family gathering.

709
00:55:13,004 --> 00:55:15,403
They want it to be just the 3 of us.
What are you going to do?

710
00:55:17,004 --> 00:55:19,904
I won't go if I don't have to.

711
00:55:21,437 --> 00:55:22,937
Okay.

712
00:55:24,937 --> 00:55:26,537
Gyeong Jun,

713
00:55:30,137 --> 00:55:33,004
it's your birthday tomorrow, right?

714
00:55:33,004 --> 00:55:36,037
Do you want to have
dinner with me tomorrow?

715
00:55:36,037 --> 00:55:39,370
Is there anything you want
for your birthday?

716
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:44,338
It just feels like I haven't
done anything for you,

717
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:46,604
so I want to do something for you.

718
00:55:47,937 --> 00:55:49,338
I'm all set.

719
00:55:49,338 --> 00:55:51,437
Once I disappear from here, I'll be
throwing everything out anyway.

720
00:55:51,437 --> 00:55:53,370
I don't want another thing
I'll end up trashing anyway.

721
00:56:04,271 --> 00:56:06,770
I'm just really curious, so let me ask you.

722
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:09,004
What is it that I've done so wrong?

723
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:12,137
What have I done that you want
to get away from me?

724
00:56:12,137 --> 00:56:16,037
Is it because of what I said
about whisking you off?

725
00:56:16,037 --> 00:56:19,104
I told you I wouldn't do anything
so long as you kept your ring on.

726
00:56:19,104 --> 00:56:21,370
I just need

727
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,570
an ocean I can't cross.

728
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:24,937
An ocean?

729
00:56:24,937 --> 00:56:27,537
Are you thinking of transferring
to an island or something?

730
00:56:27,537 --> 00:56:29,271
Fine. Go.

731
00:56:29,271 --> 00:56:32,870
I hate going on ships, so you'll
never have to see me.

732
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:35,071
Don't you ever think of leaving
that island either.

so that you can live with me.

Happy birthday, Gyeong Jun.

00:57:15,637 --> 00:57:18,503
Let's have dinner together.
I have a present for you.

740
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,370
I'm not going.

741
00:57:27,937 --> 00:57:29,604
I'll take this one.

742
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:33,238
We also do initial engravings.

743
00:57:33,238 --> 00:57:35,171
Oh, great.

744
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,403
Please.

745
00:57:46,137 --> 00:57:48,171
It's Da Ran.

746
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,338
Is it someone you know?

747
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:52,704
My friend's wife.

748
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:57,503
Does the engraving take long?
I need to give it to him today.

749
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,804
It won't take long.

750
00:57:58,804 --> 00:58:01,470
Is it a birthday present
for your boyfriend?

751
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,637
Yes.

752
00:58:02,637 --> 00:58:04,370
He's going love it.

753
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:05,338
Birthday?

754
00:58:05,338 --> 00:58:07,870
Why don't you look around
while we get the engraving done?

755
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:09,470
Okay.

756
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:26,104
Those aren't Yun Jae's initials.

757
00:58:58,937 --> 00:59:03,171
I don't have the courage to toss
my sense of reason into the ocean.

758
00:59:04,304 --> 00:59:05,637
Hey,

759
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:07,804
it's that woman from earlier.

760
00:59:07,804 --> 00:59:10,570
What's she doing taking
off her wedding ring?

761
00:59:11,338 --> 00:59:13,171
Do you think she might be having an affair?

762
00:59:14,704 --> 00:59:17,338
He won't catch on, will he?

763
00:59:28,403 --> 00:59:30,904
Gyeong Jun's father was here?

764
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:32,104
Yes.

765
00:59:32,104 --> 00:59:34,137
He says he's taking Gyeong Jun.

766
00:59:34,503 --> 00:59:35,470
Where to?

767
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:37,071
He probably wants his privacy,

768
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:41,204
so we shouldn't pry.

769
00:59:41,204 --> 00:59:45,403
In any case, it's a good thing for Gyeong Jun

770
00:59:45,403 --> 00:59:49,104
that his father showed up
and wants to take care of him.

771
00:59:50,704 --> 00:59:54,437
But his father can't

772
00:59:54,437 --> 00:59:56,737
just take him away.

773
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:02,304
The illness Dr. Seo suffered from
as a child has returned.

774

Find that hematopoietic stem cell donor.

775
01:00:07,238 --> 01:00:11,004
Do you know who the donor is?

776
01:00:12,037 --> 01:00:13,770
I do.

777
01:00:27,937 --> 01:00:29,770
What is it that you have to tell me?

778
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:32,870
It's about Da Ran.

779
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:34,804
What?

780
01:00:34,804 --> 01:00:38,271
She was buying a birthday gift for a guy.

781
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:41,037
I saw her at the mall.

782
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,137
A birthday present?

783
01:00:43,137 --> 01:00:48,171
She was getting it engraved,
but they weren't your initials.

784
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,770
So?

785
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:55,037
She was telling the sales lady
the gift was for her boyfriend.

786
01:00:55,037 --> 01:01:00,037
She took off the wedding ring
as she waited for him.

787
01:01:02,437 --> 01:01:03,604
The ring?

788
01:01:03,604 --> 01:01:06,370
I was with a friend and she saw it too.

789
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,737
She said Da Ran's definitely
having an affair.

790
01:01:10,937 --> 01:01:14,004
Da Ran looked so happy
as she was waiting for him,

791
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:17,904
but she got very dejected
when he didn't show up.

792
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:19,304
Really?

793
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:21,437
Your mother said

794
01:01:21,437 --> 01:01:24,704
Da Ran had said she'd let you go
once you returned to your old self.

795
01:01:24,704 --> 01:01:27,403
Let go of Seo Yun Jae?

796
01:01:27,403 --> 01:01:29,770
She said she was having a hard time.

797
01:01:30,304 --> 01:01:33,604
No wonder. She's in love with someone else.

798
01:01:35,137 --> 01:01:36,937
Really?

799
01:01:37,304 --> 01:01:40,437
I didn't see the guy's face,

800
01:01:40,437 --> 01:01:42,537
but I know his initials.

801
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,770
Do you want me to tell you?

802
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:50,904
KKJ.

803
01:01:52,637 --> 01:01:54,570
Why are you smiling?

804
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:57,004
Do you think I'm lying?

805
01:01:57,937 --> 01:01:59,304
No.

806
01:02:01,238 --> 01:02:03,137
You're not making this up, right?

807
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:04,770
Of course not.

808
01:02:06,037 --> 01:02:07,704
You're sure, right?

809
01:02:07,704 --> 01:02:09,670
I'm sure.

810
01:02:13,338 --> 01:02:15,971
You're done for, Gil Da Ran.

811
01:02:44,171 --> 01:02:48,004
I need to get my sense of reason back.

812
01:02:50,104 --> 01:02:51,604
Gil Da Ran.

813
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:01,171
Gil Da Ran,

814
01:03:01,704 --> 01:03:04,403
are you having an affair?

815
01:03:04,403 --> 01:03:05,804
What?

816
01:03:05,804 --> 01:03:08,704
Is that why you've been
having such a hard time?

817
01:03:09,971 --> 01:03:14,637
Are his initials KKJ?

818
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:18,637
Is it Kang Gyeong Jun?

819
01:03:21,338 --> 01:03:23,537
Don't.

820
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:38,570
The wind has blown,

821
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:42,370
and the ship has already crossed the ocean.

822
01:03:44,537 --> 01:03:46,837
What now?
