1
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:16,104
Are you Gyeong Jun?

2
00:00:18,904 --> 00:00:20,338
Gyeong Jun.

3
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,237
Is it really you...

4
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:36,371
Gyeong Jun?

5
00:00:40,537 --> 00:00:42,637
Gyeong Jun!

6
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,737
Gyeong Jun.

7
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,503
It's probably from the shock.

8
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:08,503
Oh?

9
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:09,870
There's blood.

10
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,970
She must have cut herself
on the broken glass.

11
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:14,670
Fortunately, I don't think it's a deep cut.

12
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,204
I can't stand seeing blood.

13
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:18,837
I'll run over to the pharmacy.
You take care of her until then.

14
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,338
[Episode 7]
The person you're trying to reach...

15
00:01:29,837 --> 00:01:31,670
Why isn't she picking up?

16
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,071
Should I have gone with her?

17
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:41,637
We should go hiking some time.

18
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:43,137
I'd love that, sir.

19
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,503
Where are you going?

20
00:01:45,503 --> 00:01:47,037
To find Mary.

21
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,171
How much have we had?

22
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:08,603
Da Ran.

23
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:10,603
What are you doing here?

24
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:12,870
What happened?

25
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,438
Where's Mary?

26
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:17,770
Mary's hurt.

27
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,570
Hurt?

28
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,438
What's going on?

29
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:32,904
She was helping me move furniture,
and she broke the window by mistake.

30
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,470
She passed out from the shock.

31
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,438
I'll take care of her, so you go, okay?

32
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:39,371
- Jang Mary.
- Chung Sik.

33
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:43,904
Are you okay, Jang Mary?

34
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,338
Jang Mary.

35
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,970
Gyeong Jun...

36
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,470
Where's Gyeong Jun?

37
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,137
What?

38
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:56,704
- Gyeong Jun.
- Mary.

39
00:02:57,537 --> 00:02:58,438
Gyeong Jun?

40
00:02:58,438 --> 00:02:59,970
Gyeong Jun's not there.

41
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,304
Mary!

42
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:04,237
Mary, Gyeong Jun's not here...

43
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:05,537
Da Ran!

44
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:08,670
Why is she looking for Kang Gyeong Jun
who's at the hospital?

45
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:13,970
Mary likes Gyeong Jun.

46
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,804
She must have seen him in her dream.

47
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:17,137
In her dream?

48
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:18,304
Gyeong Jun.

49
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:21,104
Gyeong Jun.

50
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:24,970
Kang Gyeong Jun. Gyeong Jun.

51
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,704
Jang Mary.

52
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,737
Gyeong Jun.

53
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:31,204
Gyeong Jun.

54
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:33,637
You should go on home.

55
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:35,237
Go, go, go.

56
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,870
Just go home.

57
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,837
Dr. Seo.

58
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:55,804
You were here with him?

59
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,970
Just go! I'll explain later.

60
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,870
Let go.

61
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,537
Do you think I can just walk away?

62
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:21,071
Gyeong Jun.

63
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:31,804
Are you okay?

64
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,804
Leave me alone.

65
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:38,470
I don't want your help.

66
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,171
The only person here who
understands your pain is me.

67
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,470
Girls will never know

68
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,837
what you're going through.

69
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,271
Can you move?

70
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:55,071
No.

71
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:00,271
Let me see.

72
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,970
Are you okay?

73
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,304
Are you seeing Dr. Seo again?

74
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:10,271
Don't tell mom and dad.

75
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,104
I just don't get it.

76
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,204
You're seeing the man who left you,

77
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:18,204
and Mary's looking for the boy
she saw in her dream.

78
00:05:18,204 --> 00:05:20,837
I just don't understand.

79
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:23,570
You don't have to understand.

80
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,770
Are you okay?

81
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,537
Leave me alone.

82
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,004
Why didn't you tell me?

83
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:33,438
Why did you pretend to be an old dude?

84
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:36,603
No. Stay away.

85
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,937
I knew how worked up you'd get.

86
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:41,470
I can't look at you right now,
so stay away from me.

87
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,570
Seeing how much you hate blood,
it's obvious you're really Gyeong Jun.

88
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:03,137
Did Ms. Gil know from the get-go?

89
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:04,338
Yeah.

90
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:08,104
Gil Teacher's the only one
who knows I'm Kang Gyeong Jun.

91
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:11,104
We both thought I'd return
to my own body soon, but alas...

92
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:15,037
I'm just waiting for my body
at the hospital to wake up,

93
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:18,438
so you just take care of my body
like you've been doing.

94
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:21,271
Don't come here and cause a scene.
It'll only make things worse for me.

95
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:22,937
You've destroyed my house.

96
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:25,271
I'll get you a new window.

97
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:28,537
And I'll take care of you here
as well as your body at the hospital.

98
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:30,570
You just can't be reasoned with.

99
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,537
Just make sure you keep this a secret.

100
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,470
Of course.

101
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,737
- Chung Sik.
- Hi, Chung Sik.

102
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:52,804
You're gym teacher's the best. We love him.

103
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:56,704
Hyo Sang and I get along very well.

104
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:04,870
Mr. Na's dream has gone
up in smoke overnight.

105
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:08,670
Is that what they call

106
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,904
a "one-night stand"?

107
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:14,137
Did Mary leave?

108
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:19,438
She's getting her cut treated
and coming back tomorrow.

109
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:23,371
Mary's really feisty, isn't she?

110
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:26,570
Why are you here anyway?

111
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:30,837
Didn't we decide never
to see each other again?

112
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,271
I'll deal with Mary, so go.

113
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:37,338
I'll help you.

114
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,037
I'll meet with Yun Jae's mother

115
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:44,637
and tell her I'll be by your side

116
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:47,937
so that she can leave you alone.

117
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:50,470
But you said

118
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,970
seeing this face would make you waver.

119
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,570
I have to be an adult and deal
with that if I'm to help you.

120
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,137
Thanks.

121
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:06,104
I promise you

122
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,371
I'll make it as easy as possible
for you by being a real jerk.

123
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,503
What?

124
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:14,637
I'll be a big jerk so you won't
develop feelings for Yun Jae again.

125
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:17,438
I'll make sure the love beams
in your eyes disappear forever.

126
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:19,670
I'll be the biggest jerk there is
so that you never ever

127
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,438
fall for him again.

128
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:25,670
You'll be the biggest jerk to me?

129
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,104
You're going out of your way
to help me. It's the least I can do.

130
00:08:30,037 --> 00:08:33,837
Clean this up and remove
the plastic covers from the furniture.

131
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:35,537
We need to be able to use them now, right?

132
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:36,570
Do a good job.

133
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,104
You're not helping me?

134
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:41,970
I can't help you if I'm to make sure
you don't fall for Yun Jae again,

135
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,271
so you're on your own.

136
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,438
Thanks.

137
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:50,071
Actually, I shouldn't even thank you.

138
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,071
It's not easy being a jerk.

139
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:54,171
I should study up on it.

140
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:09,371
I'll make sure she learns
a lesson from this nursling.

141
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:11,304
Those love beams will disappear.

142
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:25,304
I heard someone pulled
Gyeong Jun out of the river.

143
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:29,104
Was that someone Dr. Seo by any chance?

144
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:32,371
Yun Jae rescued him?

145
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:36,937
This won't lead to a lawsuit, will it?

146
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:40,704
You don't suppose he's expecting
compensation, do you?

147
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:43,271
Is that why he brought up the inheritance?

148
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:48,237
He's chosen a profession that's
dedicated to helping others.

149
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:53,804
No wonder he asked us to take good care

150
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:55,870
of Gyeong Jun.

151
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:08,937
Is Yun Jae just looking out for him,
because he was the one who saved his life?

152
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:18,104
He's not a relative. He wants compensation.

153
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:20,304
That's what he's after.

154
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,570
But how did he know about the inheritance?

155
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:28,137
He probably did some digging around.

156
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:30,271
What about the password?

157
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,071
Bluffing.

158
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:35,770
Only Gyeong Jun knows the password,
and he's not Gyeong Jun.

159
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:40,537
He's apparently back at work.

160
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:44,570
Should I try to talk to him
or try to avoid him?

161
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,137
Or should I try to talk to him
and then avoid him?

162
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,637
I'm moving in.

163
00:10:56,637 --> 00:11:00,338
The first floor is where I want to be,
but I'll just stay on the second floor.

164
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:06,071
I knew this is how you'd be, but no.

165
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:07,438
No way.

166
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:10,904
I'm having a hard time adjusting
to this situation, too.

167
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:17,503
Let's do this.

168
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:21,904
In fairy tales, princes that have
turned into frogs and beasts

169
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:24,470
return to their old selves through love.

170
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,004
While you've become an old dude,
I know you'll come back.

171
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:32,137
Just think of me as a frog or a beast
and stay away from me.

172
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,737
A kiss usually breaks the curse.

173
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:50,304
I guess fairytales are just fairytales.

174
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:53,071
Listen carefully, Jang Mary.

175
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:55,404
You may think you're with me,

176
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:59,071
but to others, you're with him.

177
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:01,970
Your love for me is an annoyance,

178
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,937
but for him... No way.

179
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:03,770
Why not?

180
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,137
He is Gil Da Ran's.

181
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:07,338
- Ms. Gil?
- Yeah.

182
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:09,904
Gil Da Ran has agreed to be with me
to keep others at bay.

183
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:11,104
So don't ever act like this ever again.

184
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,171
If you do,

185
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:15,603
I won't answer you even if you call my name.

186
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,104
Gyeong Jun.

187
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:25,603
Fine. I won't do it again.

188
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,304
But

189
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:31,104
this is mine, okay?

190
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:36,470
Take your stuff and go.

191
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,071
Gyeong Jun,

192
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:41,237
there was something I wanted
to ask you when you woke up.

193
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:47,438
You don't really have feelings
for Ms. Gil, do you?

194
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:49,004
I was being honest.

195
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:50,438
What?

196
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:52,737
I told her I had feelings for her,
but she rejected me.

197
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,503
Are you sure?

198
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,737
She really rejected you, right?

199
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:58,870
Yup.

200
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,037
She said it was the funniest thing
since "Dumb and Dumber."

201
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,438
What a relief.

202
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:08,503
She helps you and rejects you.

203
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:10,904
She seems like a very nice person.

204
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:15,004
Go. Go.

205
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:17,537
Da Ran, why did you get in
so late last night?

206
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:19,770
We had just a great time with Mr. Na.

207
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,937
Something came up.

208
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:26,537
I'll apologize to Ae Gyeong
and Mr. Na at school.

209
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:29,537
You should apologize to Mr. Na
over lunch or something.

210
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:32,204
- He's a great guy.
- Okay.

211
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:35,271
Dad,

212
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:41,404
what would you do if Yun Jae showed up again?

213
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,970
Yun Jae?

214
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,637
I don't know who or what that is.

215
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:49,404
Me neither.

216
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,737
Da Ran,

217
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:54,304
if I catch you even thinking about Yun Jae,

218
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:58,837
I'm coming after you with my mop again.

219
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,537
Thanks to you,

220
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:12,637
I've made a favorable first impression
on Ms. Gil's parents.

221
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:16,704
I should now throw a straight pitch, right?

222
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:21,670
You can't even look her straight in the eye.

223
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:31,137
Could you throw us the ball, Mr. Na?

224
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:43,737
I can throw a 130 km/hr straight pitch.

225
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:51,071
Yet I still can't look Ms. Gil
straight in the eye.

226
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:53,271
You have to be the umpire

227
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:56,970
and help my pitch go straight
to Ms. Gil's heart.

228
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,137
Please shout out loud,

229
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:01,438
"Strike!"

230
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,770
Strike!

231
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,904
Strike.

232
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:06,937
Ball.

233
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:08,004
Strike!

234
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:18,970
You must have seen her a few times.
Why are you so nervous?

235
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,570
It's different today.

236
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,603
I have to tell her I'm seeing Yun Jae again.

237
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:27,670
Just bear with it.

238
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,970
For my plan to work,

239
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,937
I can't have Yun Jae's mother
meddling in my affairs.

240
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:36,137
What's your plan?

241
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:37,603
Just a plan.

242
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,503
I didn't come back to Seoul
just to play an adult or a doctor.

243
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:45,603
The warm tea will calm you down.

244
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:54,770
She had asked to see me here

245
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,104
when Yun Jae first introduced me to her.

246
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,438
I was even more nervous then.

247
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:05,271
I'm planning to stay in the States,

248
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:09,404
so you and Yun Jae will have to make
the wedding arrangements on your own.

249
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:30,004
The warmth of his hand calmed me down.

250
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:34,371
You might get too calm.

251
00:16:36,137 --> 00:16:38,204
Have some cold water so you can stay alert.

252
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:40,237
But you just offered it to me.

253
00:16:40,237 --> 00:16:42,104
This is what being a jerk is all about.

254
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:44,404
I have to keep you from
falling for him again.

255
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,837
I'll just help myself.

256
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:48,670
You got all dolled up today.

257
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,870
She almost became my mother-in-law.
I can't look sloppy in front of her.

258
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,404
Don't tell me you still have hopes

259
00:16:57,404 --> 00:17:00,737
of becoming her daughter-in-law
should Yun Jae wake up.

260
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:01,970
I just get the feeling

261
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,470
that I've come across
as naive and intimidated.

262
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,904
I don't want to be like that today.

263
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,004
And no to bad manners.

264
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:17,104
Even if she says something that upsets us,

265
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:19,603
we should be courteous and stay put.

266
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,071
Just don't get nervous,

267
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:22,737
because I'm not holding your hand.

268
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:39,637
She's decided to be by my side for good.

269
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:42,237
She'll be by my side from now on,

270
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:45,137
so you don't have to worry about me anymore.

271
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:52,071
Didn't you say you two had broken up?

272
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:58,804
I begged her to stay with me.

273
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:03,137
I need her, so don't push her away.

274
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:18,071
I ordered your favorite.

275
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:25,804
I keep telling you I don't like red meat.

276
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,171
You used to like it.

277
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,904
You should try to return to your old ways.

278
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:31,870
I don't like red meat anymore.

279
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,037
I can't force myself to like it.

280
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,104
I think you need to reacquaint yourself
with what you used to like

281
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:44,770
in order to return to being your old self.

282
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,503
You're right,

283
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:54,438
so I'll be with the woman I used to love.

284
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,137
I'm not talking about Ms. Gil.

285
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,371
If you need someone by your side,

286
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:03,338
I'll move into your place.

287
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:04,770
Stop it.

288
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:09,937
That's enough.

289
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:15,603
Da Ran doesn't want you
coming over to my place.

290
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:19,704
I... Uh... Just meant...

291
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:21,004
He doesn't seem to like it, so...

292
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:23,404
Ms. Gil,

293
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:25,137
you're being very rude.

294
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:26,770
I don't

295
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,271
mean to be rude, but...

296
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:30,137
I told her

297
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:35,404
we'd up and leave if you said
anything to upset us.

298
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:38,670
I'm sorry we couldn't watch
our manners and stay for dinner.

299
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,603
Sit down.

300
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:42,937
You never used to be like this.

301
00:19:43,537 --> 00:19:45,204
That's right.

302
00:19:45,204 --> 00:19:48,837
I used to hold her hand so
she could put up with you,

303
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:52,503
but this time, I'm taking her hand
and taking off.

304
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:56,237
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

305
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,271
This wasn't the plan.

306
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:05,004
Plans change.

307
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,237
You can't just do whatever you want to.

308
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:08,037
I'm a jerk. Let's not forget that.

309
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:10,503
Now what will she think of me?

310
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:12,970
She definitely won't think

311
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,204
you're naive or intimidated.

312
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:17,870
Do you want to see what a real jerk can do?

313
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:35,037
After this, she won't be

314
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:37,904
able to barge into my place anymore.

315
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,603
Thanks, Gil Teacher.

316
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:06,137
Write down the names of the souls
that you want switched over.

317
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:07,438
[Kang Gyeong Jun, Seo Yun Jae]

318
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:10,037
Their souls are in one another's bodies.

319
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:13,304
For black magic like this,

320
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,371
we need someone to divert the evil spirits.

321
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:21,937
He can do it.

322
00:21:22,503 --> 00:21:24,371
Are you sure this is safe?

323
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:26,271
I'll write off your debt completely.

324
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:31,071
If this works, I can return
to the States with Gyeong Jun.

325
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:42,537
You go behind the door
and divert the evil spirits.

326
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:55,570
What is the link between these two souls?

327
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,670
What do you mean?

328
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,537
Are they lovers?

329
00:21:59,537 --> 00:22:02,237
Friends?

330
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,171
Brothers?

331
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:05,004
Nope.

332
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:07,104
Oh, right.

333
00:22:07,603 --> 00:22:09,637
They both love the same woman.

334
00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:12,503
Oh...

335
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:14,304
Rivals.

336
00:22:15,104 --> 00:22:17,004
It's so hot.

337
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,670
I'm thirsty.

338
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:22,137
We might have to see her a few more times.

339
00:22:22,137 --> 00:22:23,837
Just do as you did today.

340
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,104
I'm thirsty.

341
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:32,137
Bona fide jerk.

342
00:22:36,737 --> 00:22:38,737
Where did all this beer come from?

343
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:41,438
Seo Yun Jae's mother stocked the fridge.

344
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:43,338
She said Yun Jae used to like them.

345
00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:45,603
Some are missing. Did you have some?

346
00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:46,870
No.

347
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,304
I threw out a few just to keep
Yun Jae's mother from nagging me.

348
00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:51,137
What a waste.

349
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:58,570
Here. You're drooling over it.

350
00:23:06,837 --> 00:23:08,503
Kang Gyeong Jun,

351
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:12,637
why can't you stand seeing blood?

352
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:15,970
Are you scared of red things?

353
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,837
Why would I be scared of chili paste?

354
00:23:17,837 --> 00:23:21,071
Why are you studying medicine
when you can't even look at blood?

355
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:24,237
It's not necessarily because
I want to become a doctor.

356
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:30,770
I just want to know the condition
my body is in.

357
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:36,271
I may have to take care of it
for the rest of my life.

358
00:23:37,004 --> 00:23:40,603
Plus, being a doctor isn't too bad.
And I can make a lot of money.

359
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,470
Why can't you stand blood though?

360
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,537
Have you ever gotten badly hurt
and bled profusely?

361
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:52,204
Someone died.

362
00:23:53,037 --> 00:23:57,137
My mom died, bleeding profusely.

363
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:06,204
We were leaving mom's restaurant when
we were confronted by armed robbers.

364
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,037
Mom got shot,

365
00:24:10,037 --> 00:24:13,104
but there wasn't anything I could do.

366
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:18,404
I haven't been able to
look at blood since then.

367
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,904
Gyeong Jun,

368
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,737
would you like some?

369
00:24:36,237 --> 00:24:37,770
I'm all set.

370
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,804
That's the last piece anyway.

371
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:42,037
I haven't bit into it yet.

372
00:24:42,037 --> 00:24:44,037
I don't like spicy food.

373
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:48,204
Here.

374
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:49,204
Gross.

375
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:51,104
I'll tear off the top part.

376
00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:55,603
Where did you get that anyway?

377
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:58,970
It was in the kitchen cabinet.

378
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,470
The kitchen cabinet?

379
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,137
I had gotten that a year ago.

380
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:04,704
- What?
- Wasn't it discolored?

381
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:07,271
Food poisoning is rampant in the summer.

382
00:25:10,737 --> 00:25:12,704
- What should I do?
- What can you do

383
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,870
but throw it all up?

384
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:21,104
Stick your tongue out and go, "Eh."

385
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,004
Harder. You have to make yourself sick.

386
00:25:25,004 --> 00:25:27,037
Stick it out as far as you can.

387
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:35,404
You have a pretty long tongue.

388
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:38,271
Try touching the tip of your nose.

389
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:43,371
- You can't do it?
- No.

390
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:46,537
I guess it's not as long as I thought it was.

391
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:52,071
That little twerp.

392
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:55,870
I keep letting him make a fool out of me.

393
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:07,171
I need to overcome my fear of blood.

394
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:11,071
I'll get over it if I see
many injured people.

395
00:26:16,537 --> 00:26:17,704
Yun Jae.

396
00:26:18,037 --> 00:26:19,737
Someone wants to see you. Wanna come?

397
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:20,737
Sure.

398
00:26:21,503 --> 00:26:24,737
You used to dote on Ji Min.
Do you remember her?

399
00:26:24,737 --> 00:26:26,404
She's back.

400
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:29,071
Ji Min's mother has been asking about you.

401
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:30,937
She'll be here soon.

402
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:33,470
You should say hello.

403
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,837
Miss,

404
00:26:48,603 --> 00:26:50,204
don't get so touchy-feely.

405
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:51,637
Rabbits.

406
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:54,704
Just like mine.

407
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,104
No way.

408
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:00,470
Mine are of a whole different class.

409
00:27:00,904 --> 00:27:02,237
Scat.

410
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:04,570
I have bears.

411
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,470
Those aren't bears. They're teddy bears.

412
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,171
Bears and teddy bears are
completely different.

413
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,404
- Doctor...
- I can't look at cuts.

414
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,438
Because kids are small,
their cuts are small, too.

415
00:27:36,904 --> 00:27:39,338
I can deal with this.

416
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:44,204
I'll take a look at it.

417
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:49,470
Yun Jae,

418
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:54,470
you were at here at hospital.
Why didn't you call me?

419
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,304
Were you going to take off
without saying hello?

420
00:27:57,304 --> 00:27:58,870
Haven't you heard?

421
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,037
I'm back together with Gil Da Ran.

422
00:28:01,037 --> 00:28:03,071
We even had dinner with my mom.

423
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:06,804
I won't swap keys with you again.

424
00:28:07,404 --> 00:28:10,870
Do you really have no memories of me?

425
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:17,804
You've become a completely
different person since the accident.

426
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:21,870
Many people change from
near-death experiences.

427
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:24,237
Kang Gyeong Jun...

428
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:37,271
I heard you and Kang Gyeong Jun
were in the same accident.

429
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,804
I also heard you rescued him.

430
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:45,570
That's right.

431
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:48,371
I saved him.

432
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:50,438
You did a good thing.

433
00:28:51,804 --> 00:28:56,637
Since you saved him, you must
feel a strong connection to him.

434
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,338
Is that why you went to see him
before anyone else?

435
00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:04,804
Are you whining because I didn't
come to see you first?

436
00:29:04,804 --> 00:29:07,904
Let me make this clear. I hate whiners.

437
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:10,338
The Seo Yun Jae you used to see is no more.

438
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:25,737
How will he overcome his fear of blood?

439
00:29:27,837 --> 00:29:28,670
Oh?

440
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,237
You have a message.

441
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:32,904
Thanks.

442
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,770
Who is it?

443
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,304
Just someone I know.

444
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:38,037
Who can it be?

445
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:40,171
[BIG: Gil Da Ran, I want bread]

446
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:42,904
"Gil Da Ran"? Not "Ms. Gil"?

447
00:29:42,904 --> 00:29:44,870
Where's the Ms.?

448
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,670
[Get bread on the way home, please]

449
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,770
Whatever.

450
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:52,570
What's going on?

451
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,870
Are you seeing someone?

452
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,137
What? No way.

453
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,870
Then who is it?

454
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,937
No one.

455
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:05,004
Just someone I know.

456
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,304
I'm not seeing anyone.

457
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,338
[Make sure you come with the bread]

458
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,637
He wants me to come and clean his place, eh?

459
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:18,071
Ms. Gil.

460
00:30:24,737 --> 00:30:25,970
What is it?

461
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:29,438
It's a special spell that will get them
to return to their respective bodies.

462
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:31,870
You have to keep it with you
because you are their link.

463
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,271
You have to pray like crazy for it to work.

464
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:39,237
You should pray for your beloved Yun Jae

465
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,770
to come back.

466
00:30:42,204 --> 00:30:46,704
I thought you'd be by Gyeong Jun's side 24-7.

467
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:50,570
He said the body was yours,
so he wouldn't let me.

468
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,804
Mine?

469
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,804
Gyeong Jun's still mine, though.

470
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:57,704
I made him promise me.

471
00:30:59,637 --> 00:31:03,271
I'm glad he has someone
other than me to talk to now.

472
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:07,371
Thank you for helping him and
protecting him from other people.

473
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:11,304
I'll stay with Gyeong Jun's body.

474
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,804
What's going on between you and Mary?

475
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:35,670
Spill the beans.

476
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,338
I've paid off my pizza debt.

477
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:42,237
I'm no longer her pizza "salve."
Now I want to be her love "salve."

478
00:31:42,237 --> 00:31:46,204
Love "salve"...

479
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,737
Do you mean "slave"?

480
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:50,470
Wait. Was it "slip"?

481
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,770
That's too sexy.

482
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,970
Let me know if you see Jang Mary.

483
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,470
I want to turn around and look
real cool when she comes.

484
00:32:01,438 --> 00:32:04,304
It's Jang Mary.

485
00:32:29,804 --> 00:32:32,371
What was that?

486
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:35,870
She completely ignored you.

487
00:32:36,937 --> 00:32:39,271
Now that I worked off my pizza debt,

488
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:43,271
she's simply ignoring me.

489
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:50,304
Maybe we should've opened
a place like this instead

490
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:53,104
of a Western restaurant with the money
we got from Gyeong Jun's house.

491
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:57,104
But it's exactly like the restaurant
his mother used to run in L.A.

492
00:32:57,104 --> 00:32:58,137
I don't get why it's not doing well.

493
00:32:58,137 --> 00:33:00,171
The food doesn't taste the same.

494
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:02,271
Oh, the food...

495
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:05,404
They make good dumpling stew here.

496
00:33:05,404 --> 00:33:07,404
No wonder it's gotten great reviews.

497
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:08,970
- Yeah?
- Yup.

498
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,204
How about putting
ravioli in a stew like this?

499
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:24,837
It would make a great fusion dish.

500
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:28,704
Chicken stock, chili peppers, garlic...

501
00:33:28,704 --> 00:33:31,603
It's a bit tangy too.
I wonder if it's vinegar.

502
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:34,503
It's plum juice.

503
00:33:34,503 --> 00:33:37,004
Try some more of it.

504
00:33:37,704 --> 00:33:39,904
Guess what's in it.

505
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,870
Go ahead and guess.

506
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:49,570
Sesame leaves?

507
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,037
Basil?

508
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,970
Oh my goodness.

509
00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:15,704
- Hyeok Su.
- Jeong Hye.

510
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:17,937
Hi.

511
00:34:22,404 --> 00:34:23,837
Chinese peppers.

512
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:25,603
It's Chinese peppers.

513
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:27,071
I have such a sensitive palate.

514
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:29,637
Yeah...

515
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:33,204
I'm so proud of you.

516
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,937
So this is what Chinese peppers can do.

517
00:34:36,937 --> 00:34:38,670
Cold noodles...

518
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:44,304
Dumpling stew and cold noodles?
Excellent choice.

519
00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:53,503
The thing is, Seo Yun Jae saved
my life and let me use his body.

520
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:55,271
I don't know how this happened.

521
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,371
You can save him and give him
his body back then.

522
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,804
So is he waiting for me

523
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:08,304
to do something for him?

524
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:13,603
You never asked for this to happen,
so don't worry too much.

525
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:21,670
I have a problem

526
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:25,570
you can help me with.

527
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:28,104
I got my report card,

528
00:35:28,104 --> 00:35:32,171
and my homeroom teacher
wants to talk to my parents.

529
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,071
I might get dragged back to the States.

530
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:36,271
You meet with my homeroom teacher.

531
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:37,104
No.

532
00:35:37,104 --> 00:35:39,071
You look like an adult.

533
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:41,503
Tell my teacher you're my uncle.

534
00:35:42,171 --> 00:35:43,670
I don't think I was put in this body

535
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,570
to deal with your report card crisis.

536
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,770
Go.

537
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,404
Gyeong Jun.

538
00:35:49,404 --> 00:35:52,870
If we say you're my uncle,
I could live on the second floor.

539
00:35:53,271 --> 00:35:56,037
No way. Don't even think about it.

540
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:58,537
There are plenty of rooms.

541
00:35:58,537 --> 00:36:01,371
No. No way.

542
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:04,137
- I can pay rent.
- Jang Mary!

543
00:36:04,137 --> 00:36:05,171
What?

544
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:07,004
- Let's go downstairs.
- What's this?

545
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:09,037
A good luck charm from Mary?

546
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:10,804
That's the bathroom, idiot.

547
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:11,870
Go home!

548
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,404
You're such a pain.

549
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:15,670
No.

550
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:20,804
Stop your nonsense.
Go home and hit the books.

551
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:21,937
I'm pretty. Why should I study?

552
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:24,071
I'm handsome, but I study.

553
00:36:24,071 --> 00:36:26,404
Your appearance calls for a lot of studying.

554
00:36:26,404 --> 00:36:27,770
I want to live here.

555
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,071
When did you get here?

556
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:30,304
Say hello.

557
00:36:30,904 --> 00:36:32,237
Hi, Ms. Gil Da Ran.

558
00:36:41,137 --> 00:36:43,271
That's nice.

559
00:36:43,271 --> 00:36:44,837
- Mom.
- Yes?

560
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:46,537
I want to study in the States.

561
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,071
What? You can't even speak English.

562
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:52,870
I want to go to the States
when Mary heads home.

563
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,071
Please?

564
00:36:55,071 --> 00:36:59,338
How about coming with me
to the supermarket instead?

565
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:01,171
Watch your pronunciation, mom.

566
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:02,603
"Market."

567
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:05,404
"Market," mom. "Market."

568
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:10,037
What is this? Where's my bread?

569
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:14,438
You want me to help you keep Yun Jae's
mother from coming here, right?

570
00:37:14,438 --> 00:37:18,870
The fridge needs to be stocked with
healthy food to keep her from worrying.

571
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,204
So where's my bread?

572
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:23,670
These are all organic.
They're all good for you.

573
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,137
So there's no bread?

574
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:28,104
But these need to be cooked.

575
00:37:28,104 --> 00:37:31,271
Are you planning to come over
every day and cook for me?

576
00:37:31,271 --> 00:37:33,004
I guess that would work for me.

577
00:37:33,004 --> 00:37:34,304
You're right.

578
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:36,970
I'll end up doing all the work.

579
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,937
Let's get ready-made foods then.

580
00:37:41,904 --> 00:37:43,637
More potato chips?

581
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,271
- But I like these.
- I only like potato chips.

582
00:37:46,237 --> 00:37:48,071
These are so passe.

583
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:56,837
You should learn how to cook
simple dishes at least.

584
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,304
Simple dishes?

585
00:38:00,937 --> 00:38:03,438
I can even make complicated dishes.

586
00:38:03,438 --> 00:38:04,804
Show-off.

587
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:06,970
If I make you a proper, "complicated" meal,

588
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,071
will you come and have some?

589
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:09,637
What complicated meal?

590
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:12,204
Do you know how to make traditional
Korean court dishes, for instance?

591
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:15,603
If I make you everything I know,

592
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:18,570
you'll have to come over every single day.

593
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:23,371
My mother ran the hottest restaurant in L.A.

594
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:27,237
You must have learned how
to cook from your mother.

595
00:38:27,237 --> 00:38:28,537
Oh, right.

596
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:30,304
I can't touch meat anymore.

597
00:38:30,304 --> 00:38:31,670
Oh, well.

598
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:37,204
You're scared of birds
and you don't like meat.

599
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:40,937
I'm not scared of dead birds,

600
00:38:40,937 --> 00:38:42,503
and I don't mind white meat.

601
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:43,937
Are you planning to make chicken stew?

602
00:38:43,937 --> 00:38:46,704
You said you'd eat with me
if I made something complicated.

603
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:47,770
You're going to cook for me?

604
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,704
You're in for a surprise.

605
00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:51,304
You're really cooking for me?

606
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,371
Shouldn't you pay for that first?

607
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:04,904
Hang on.

608
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,137
I want this, too. I love peppers.

609
00:39:35,204 --> 00:39:38,137
The red ones. No, no.

610
00:39:39,204 --> 00:39:41,137
I can handle this.

611
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,937
Mom, I want to go to the States.

612
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,737
This is made in America.

613
00:39:49,104 --> 00:39:53,404
America! Mommy! America!

614
00:40:01,637 --> 00:40:03,271
We need this, too.

615
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:09,637
Mom.

616
00:40:09,637 --> 00:40:12,071
- Let's open our dumpling shop there.
- What's wrong?

617
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:15,904
Mom and Chung Sik are here.

618
00:40:15,904 --> 00:40:19,071
I thought Chung Sik had told my parents,

619
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:21,237
but he hasn't.

620
00:40:21,237 --> 00:40:23,570
My parents will kill me if they find out.

621
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,503
We can't avoid them forever.

622
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:29,637
Are you really just planning to up and leave
once you're done helping me?

623
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:34,404
If you want to tell your mother
now, I'm up for it.

624
00:40:35,537 --> 00:40:39,037
I can tell her I was the one who
begged you to come back to me.

625
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,870
What do you want to do?

626
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,670
What should I do?

627
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,603
I don't know if it's okay
to get you even more involved

628
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:52,438
in my life and further complicate matters.

629
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:56,104
Stop overcomplicating things. Yes or no?

630
00:41:01,603 --> 00:41:04,737
I'll go alone for now.

631
00:41:04,737 --> 00:41:06,470
Don't butt in.

632
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,637
Mom.

633
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,338
- My goodness.
- Da Ran.

634
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:14,570
Da Ran,

635
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,970
what are you doing here?

636
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,637
I heard you were out grocery shopping.

637
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:19,937
Did you get everything?

638
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:22,438
Pretty much. Let's go.

639
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,171
Should we go to the fish section?

640
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:25,470
Fish? You want to have fish?

641
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,071
- Yeah.
- Okay.

642
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:28,037
Let's go.

643
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:29,937
- Is there something you want?
- Yeah.

644
00:41:32,104 --> 00:41:34,770
Let's have chicken stew tonight.

645
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,171
I don't want any!

646
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:39,037
I'm not eating if you don't
let me study in the States.

647
00:41:39,037 --> 00:41:42,570
Don't eat then. It's your loss.

648
00:41:45,137 --> 00:41:48,970
I said I'd eat with him if he made
a complicated dish.

649
00:41:52,704 --> 00:41:56,970
Mom, I have something to get. See you.

650
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,704
Da Ran.

651
00:41:58,704 --> 00:42:00,637
Da Ran. Da Ran.

652
00:42:34,271 --> 00:42:35,704
Oh?

653
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:41,204
I thought you had left.
Were you waiting for me?

654
00:42:41,204 --> 00:42:43,137
You said you'd help me with
whatever I needed, right?

655
00:42:43,137 --> 00:42:44,704
Carry the groceries and follow me.

656
00:42:45,304 --> 00:42:47,603
How can I carry all these?

657
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,204
Carry them carefully.

658
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:53,304
Why don't you take some?

659
00:42:55,837 --> 00:42:57,271
Hey!

660
00:43:02,104 --> 00:43:04,104
You're not much help, are you?

661
00:43:13,904 --> 00:43:14,937
Here you go.

662
00:43:20,171 --> 00:43:24,271
I won't throw a curve ball. I'll throw
a plain and honest straight pitch.

663
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:31,603
If I have Da Ran come over right now,
will you be able to do it?

664
00:43:35,637 --> 00:43:39,104
A pitcher does not pick and choose his mound.

665
00:43:39,104 --> 00:43:43,004
I'll throw if you get the pitcher here.

666
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:58,904
I don't know.

667
00:43:58,904 --> 00:44:00,670
It looks like plain baked chicken.

668
00:44:09,704 --> 00:44:11,870
When this chicken emerges
from the oven in an hour and a half,

669
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,870
we'll see if you'll still call it plain.

670
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,338
An hour and a half? What do we do until then?

671
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,104
Wait for the chicken to cook.

672
00:44:24,271 --> 00:44:26,837
For a small chicken,
it sure takes a long time.

673
00:44:26,837 --> 00:44:30,970
I didn't know we'd have to wait this long
to have a young, little chicken.

674
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,737
That's right, Gil Da Ran.

675
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:38,637
Be patient and watch.

676
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:41,271
One day, you'll get to have
this young, little thing.

677
00:44:43,004 --> 00:44:45,271
Why would I do that?

678
00:44:46,704 --> 00:44:48,503
Young little nursling.

679
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:55,404
Hi, Ae Gyeong.

680
00:44:57,037 --> 00:44:59,770
Can I see you?

681
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,304
It won't take long.

682
00:45:02,304 --> 00:45:03,904
Right now?

683
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:07,603
Sure.

684
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:09,704
I know where that is. I'll be right there.

685
00:45:12,704 --> 00:45:16,004
But the chicken's cooking.
You're heading out?

686
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:19,304
You'll miss out on its true flavor
if you don't eat it as soon as it's done.

687
00:45:19,304 --> 00:45:21,271
You said it was going to take
an hour and a half.

688
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:23,904
I'll be back before the chicken's done.

689
00:45:31,004 --> 00:45:34,770
You won't get to taste this
if you're even a minute late.

690
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:42,804
- Da Ran, over here.
- Ae Gyeong.

691
00:45:42,804 --> 00:45:45,004
Mr. Na, what are you doing here?

692
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:51,204
- Sit.
- What's going on?

693
00:45:51,204 --> 00:45:53,104
There's something you need to know...

694
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,137
Gil Da Ran,

695
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:20,104
you only have an hour.

696
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,271
Why are you here again?

697
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:34,470
I left something behind.

698
00:46:37,004 --> 00:46:38,404
Something smells good.

699
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:40,271
It's chicken, right?

700
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:48,570
It's really chicken.

701
00:46:49,004 --> 00:46:50,204
Did you make it?

702
00:46:50,204 --> 00:46:51,904
Don't touch it. It's still cooking.

703
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:54,704
Your mom used to cook us
dishes like this often.

704
00:46:54,704 --> 00:46:55,670
Looks good.

705
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:59,171
It has to cook for another hour.
Get your things and go.

706
00:47:23,804 --> 00:47:25,071
Um...

707
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:30,037
I don't know where to take the kids
for summer training this year.

708
00:47:30,037 --> 00:47:33,737
Any suggestions, Ms. Gil?

709
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:38,404
Isn't that just for athletes? I don't know.

710
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:43,104
Da Ran, I have to go.

711
00:47:43,104 --> 00:47:45,637
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

712
00:47:45,637 --> 00:47:48,104
See you.

713
00:47:49,071 --> 00:47:50,237
Ae Gyeong.

714
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:51,570
Bye.

715
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:01,804
This is Da Ran's...

716
00:48:01,984 --> 00:48:03,565
[Incoming Call: BIG]

717
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,071
Big?

718
00:48:08,904 --> 00:48:11,438
Where are you? What's keeping you?

719
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:13,970
Yun Jae?

720
00:48:15,503 --> 00:48:17,071
Who's this?

721
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:22,837
Just listen to me.

722
00:48:22,837 --> 00:48:25,570
Is it Ms. Lee Ae Gyeong? Math?

723
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,204
Huh? Yes.

724
00:48:29,104 --> 00:48:33,338
I thought you should know
the situation Da Ran's in.

725
00:48:33,338 --> 00:48:34,603
What situation?

726
00:48:34,603 --> 00:48:39,937
There's a man who's stepped
on the mound for Da Ran's love.

727
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:42,137
Gym teacher?

728
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,304
Yes.

729
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:49,371
If he throws a straight pitch,
she might hit a homerun.

730
00:48:49,371 --> 00:48:52,670
Are you just going to sit
in the stands and watch?

731
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,737
I'm the umpire.

732
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:57,503
Let me know whether you want
me to keep the game going

733
00:48:57,503 --> 00:49:01,071
or remove the hitter from the batter's box.

734
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,204
I don't care for baseball. Sorry.

735
00:49:03,204 --> 00:49:07,404
Da Ran hasn't gotten over you.

736
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:11,004
She's been so giddy since your return.

737
00:49:11,004 --> 00:49:13,304
Come and stop her.

738
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,438
What's this, Gyeong Jun?

739
00:49:29,603 --> 00:49:32,438
This was with the doctor's things.

740
00:49:32,438 --> 00:49:34,404
Seo Yun Jae's things?

741
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:39,338
He must have gotten it for Ms. Gil.

742
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:43,004
Ms. Gil will be so happy when she sees this.

743
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:50,071
You should go.

744
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:55,204
Can't I have some of the chicken?

745
00:49:55,204 --> 00:49:56,670
Ms. Gil's not coming.

746
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:59,237
Even if she doesn't come,
I'm having it all, so you go.

747
00:49:59,904 --> 00:50:04,338
Just because that body is Ms. Gil's
doesn't mean you have to eat with her.

748
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:09,004
I don't even have to eat the drumsticks
or the legs. I'll have just the neck.

749
00:50:10,904 --> 00:50:13,770
When I return to my own body,

750
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:16,837
I'll make a whole one just for you.

751
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:29,870
Mr. Na, I only planned on staying
for a short while.

752
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,404
Maybe we can discuss this some other time.

753
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,404
I'm sorry.

754
00:50:36,338 --> 00:50:38,004
Ms. Gil Da Ran.

755
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,404
I like you.

756
00:50:43,404 --> 00:50:47,004
I've liked you for a long time.

757
00:50:47,804 --> 00:50:51,737
I've been holding back all this while,

758
00:50:51,737 --> 00:50:55,537
but I decided to be brave today and tell you.

759
00:51:04,204 --> 00:51:08,004
I'm sorry.

760
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:12,037
I've promised someone I'd be with him.

761
00:51:17,404 --> 00:51:19,104
Did you tell her?

762
00:51:22,071 --> 00:51:24,870
Mr. Na told you about me, right?

763
00:51:26,071 --> 00:51:29,304
He's liked me for a long time.

764
00:51:30,037 --> 00:51:33,104
We've decided to see each other.

765
00:51:33,104 --> 00:51:35,204
That's why we had you come and see us.

766
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:36,570
Oh...

767
00:51:37,237 --> 00:51:38,970
I must have misunderstood.

768
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,271
I'm so sorry, Mr. Na.

769
00:51:43,338 --> 00:51:44,271
Oh, right.

770
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:46,904
I grabbed your phone by mistake.

771
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:48,470
Someone kept calling. You should go.

772
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,870
Thanks.

773
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:53,271
Congratulations to you both.

774
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:56,503
Congratulations. And I'm sorry...

775
00:52:01,937 --> 00:52:06,371
I stepped in as a pinch hitter
to stop the game.

776
00:52:07,603 --> 00:52:09,271
Oh...

777
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:10,637
Thank you.

778
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,037
Seo Yun Jae, that bastard.

779
00:53:28,037 --> 00:53:29,704
What were you planning?

780
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:53,603
Gyeong Jun,

781
00:53:53,603 --> 00:53:55,037
I'm almost there.

782
00:53:55,037 --> 00:53:57,304
I might be a couple of minutes late, though.

783
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,670
Forget about it. Don't come.

784
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:03,937
Huh?

785
00:54:03,937 --> 00:54:05,537
But I'm almost there.

786
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:09,071
You can hold off on the jerk routine.
We have yummy chicken to eat.

787
00:54:12,204 --> 00:54:14,737
Get yourself some chicken on your way home.

788
00:54:16,338 --> 00:54:19,071
But we were going to have
your chicken together.

789
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,904
Gil Teacher,

790
00:54:24,338 --> 00:54:26,338
are you giddy?

791
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:27,537
What?

792
00:54:30,104 --> 00:54:32,937
Are you giddy as you're heading over here?

793
00:54:42,204 --> 00:54:45,104
I told you I'd help you not
get giddy over Seo Yun Jae,

794
00:54:45,104 --> 00:54:47,603
so I'm just going to throw the chicken out.

795
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:13,004
Have I been

796
00:55:14,071 --> 00:55:16,770
giddy as of late?

797
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:47,737
Mary,

798
00:55:48,204 --> 00:55:51,737
I don't think I counted the pizzas properly.

799
00:55:51,737 --> 00:55:56,338
I think I still have around
30 pizzas left to pay off.

800
00:55:56,338 --> 00:55:57,770
Really?

801
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,171
How honest.

802
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:00,371
I'll write off 1 pizza for that.

803
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:03,271
Don't just write off my debt so easily.

804
00:56:04,171 --> 00:56:08,071
Make sure each pizza counts.

805
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:13,670
Then don't keep Ms. Gil
from seeing Dr. Seo again.

806
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:16,071
I won't.

807
00:56:18,704 --> 00:56:20,271
Put this on.

808
00:56:21,204 --> 00:56:24,271
Why?

809
00:56:24,271 --> 00:56:26,137
Just put it on.

810
00:56:28,704 --> 00:56:31,470
Is it for me?

811
00:56:39,338 --> 00:56:41,137
It doesn't fit.

812
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:43,770
So it wasn't yours.

813
00:56:44,837 --> 00:56:46,371
Give it back.

814
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:48,870
What's going on?

815
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:52,204
I had gotten this before the accident.
I was wondering whether it was for you.

816
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:53,603
But it's not, so give it back.

817
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:58,637
Then you must have gotten it for Da Ran.

818
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:02,037
You don't even remember getting this for her,

819
00:57:02,037 --> 00:57:04,603
so how can you be so hung up on her?

820
00:57:04,603 --> 00:57:06,438
And why do you only have memories of Da Ran?

821
00:57:06,438 --> 00:57:08,004
Give me the ring.

822
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:12,970
Are you planning to give it to her?

823
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:17,271
She'll be touched.

824
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:20,071
She'll regret having broken up with you.

825
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:25,470
How far did you go with a man
who was engaged to another woman?

826
00:57:26,204 --> 00:57:28,037
You see, I can't remember.

827
00:57:32,603 --> 00:57:35,204
You were definitely wavering
about the wedding.

828
00:57:35,937 --> 00:57:38,271
But now

829
00:57:38,271 --> 00:57:40,704
I don't know anymore whether it was

830
00:57:40,704 --> 00:57:45,704
because you liked me or because
you stopped liking her.

831
00:57:47,204 --> 00:57:52,204
Please come back to your old self
so that you can tell me.

832
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:00,503
- Hope to see you again soon.
- See you.

833
00:58:05,837 --> 00:58:07,037
- Hon, hon.
- Yes?

834
00:58:07,037 --> 00:58:12,004
Don't you think something's up with Da Ran?
She's been coming home late.

835
00:58:12,603 --> 00:58:15,470
It's about time she started
seeing someone again.

836
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:21,104
I hope she's seeing Hyo Sang.

837
00:58:21,104 --> 00:58:22,071
Me too.

838
00:58:22,071 --> 00:58:24,071
Gil Family Dumplings. Na Family Dumplings.

839
00:58:24,904 --> 00:58:26,570
They both sound good.

840
00:58:46,737 --> 00:58:47,570
Coming up.

841
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:50,171
Small dumpling stew, hon.

842
00:58:53,937 --> 00:58:55,503
Welcome.

843
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:03,371
Hon, hon.

844
00:59:03,371 --> 00:59:05,470
You need to come out.

845
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,004
Yun Jae's...

846
00:59:07,004 --> 00:59:09,704
Dr. Seo's mother is here.

847
00:59:30,137 --> 00:59:33,004
Why aren't you giving it to Ms. Gil?

848
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:35,271
She'll love it.

849
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:39,670
- She will love it, right?
- Of course.

850
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:43,304
She doesn't know Dr. Seo
got this ring for her, right?

851
00:59:43,304 --> 00:59:46,503
She'll be elated once she finds out.

852
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:49,037
She'll want to marry him right away.

853
00:59:52,837 --> 00:59:54,503
I'm back.

854
01:00:02,904 --> 01:00:06,271
Are you seeing Yun Jae again?

855
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:11,371
I heard you even met with Yun Jae's mother.

856
01:00:11,371 --> 01:00:13,037
She came by here today.

857
01:00:13,037 --> 01:00:14,970
What do you plan to do?

858
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:21,071
You went to their restaurant?

859
01:00:21,071 --> 01:00:25,438
They were taken aback.

860
01:00:26,204 --> 01:00:30,271
They didn't even seem to know
you were back. What's going on?

861
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,670
Are you sure you're back together with her?

862
01:00:38,137 --> 01:00:41,271
You seem to be using her as a front
to keep me from nagging you.

863
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:43,338
I suggest you stop.

864
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:45,770
Her parents were very upset.

865
01:00:52,338 --> 01:00:55,637
Are you really back together?

866
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,970
Yes. It's true.

867
01:01:01,904 --> 01:01:07,104
We're going to take it slowly though.

868
01:01:07,104 --> 01:01:10,770
Slowly? Forget about it.

869
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:13,670
You broke up after sending out
your wedding invitations.

870
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,804
How can you get back together
and take things slowly?

871
01:01:16,804 --> 01:01:21,603
We also heard you left the furniture
and appliances at his place.

872
01:01:21,603 --> 01:01:24,537
Have you been frequenting his house?

873
01:01:24,537 --> 01:01:28,870
If you want to keep seeing him,
you can just marry him.

874
01:01:29,804 --> 01:01:35,570
If you two aren't planning to get married,
I don't want to see him again.

875
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:38,438
I won't see you, either.

876
01:01:40,737 --> 01:01:43,438
Hon, hon.

877
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,071
We can just tell everyone
we're getting married then.

878
01:01:49,071 --> 01:01:51,570
Are you nuts? We can't do that.

879
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,770
Then let me ask you again.

880
01:01:54,371 --> 01:01:58,237
Are we going to keep seeing each other
or part ways forever?

881
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,171
I'm counting to 3.

882
01:02:02,171 --> 01:02:04,171
If it's the latter, walk away.

883
01:02:07,104 --> 01:02:08,704
1.

884
01:02:11,537 --> 01:02:13,404
Are we going to keep seeing each other?

885
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,503
2.

886
01:02:19,204 --> 01:02:21,104
This is it.

887
01:02:24,237 --> 01:02:26,371
3.

888
01:02:46,603 --> 01:02:48,537
It fits you perfectly.

889
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:51,970
It was for you.

890
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,237
Seo Yun Jae had gotten it
before the accident.

891
01:02:56,204 --> 01:02:58,004
Yun Jae had gotten this?

892
01:03:04,737 --> 01:03:07,404
You can fall back in love with him.

893
01:03:08,637 --> 01:03:11,837
So long as you have that on,
I won't waver, either.

894
01:03:14,804 --> 01:03:18,438
I, Kang Gyeong Jun,

895
01:03:18,438 --> 01:03:21,171
vow to never

896
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:28,603
fall in love with you.

897
01:04:03,004 --> 01:04:04,271
[Big]

898
01:04:04,837 --> 01:04:07,670
Marry me, Kang Gyeong Jun.

899
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:09,037
I'll raise you well.

900
01:04:09,037 --> 01:04:11,037
I heard Ms. Gil's parents

901
01:04:11,037 --> 01:04:13,137
told you to marry Ms. Gil.

902
01:04:13,137 --> 01:04:14,537
You're not marrying her, are you?

903
01:04:14,537 --> 01:04:16,004
I don't care one way or another,

904
01:04:16,004 --> 01:04:17,438
so mind your own business.

905
01:04:17,438 --> 01:04:20,737
Jang Mary, how much do you like me?

906
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:23,904
Are you and Gyeong Jun looking for Chung Sik?

907
01:04:23,904 --> 01:04:25,704
You go and look for him there.

908
01:04:25,704 --> 01:04:28,237
I know the person you're seeing

909
01:04:28,237 --> 01:04:30,204
right now is not Kang Gyeong Jun.

910
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:34,204
I won't be a baby anymore and keep you
from loving the man you want.
