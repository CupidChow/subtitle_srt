What just

3
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:53,770
came over me?

4
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:56,837
Duh.

5
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:59,004
You've having an affair.

6
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,670
I deserve to drown in the ocean.

7
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:15,804
Are you upset?

8
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:19,704
I suppose you should be.
You're having an affair.

9
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,637
You seduced me.

10
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:24,404
I told you not to, but you kept at it,

11
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:27,371
singing around me,

12
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:30,204
bringing me flowers and such.

13
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:35,737
I started wavering, and then fell for you.

14
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:37,470
Wait a minute.

15
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,204
Why are you blaming me?

16
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:42,837
I didn't do anything major.

17
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:45,537
What if I had gone all out?

18
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:48,870
Yeah.

19
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,237
I'm having an affair.

20
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:53,470
But I can pull myself together

21
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,503
and overcome this.

22
00:01:57,503 --> 00:01:59,371
No.

23
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:03,438
You're not overcoming anything.

24
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:07,371
Where are you going?

25
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:10,304
You're having a birthday party
with your new lover.

26
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:14,404
Today's Kang Gyeong Jun's birthday.

27
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:17,737
Yes. He's quite a celebrity at the hospital.

28
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,304

29

Kang Gyeong Jun?

33
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:30,770
If he weren't in a coma, I would've
thought it was the same person.

34
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,004
Dr. Seo,

35

hello.

36
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,537
I'm Lee Se Yeong, Gyeong Jun's
primary care physician.

37
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:49,304
So you're Yun Jae's friend

38
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:52,570
who knows about Gyeong Jun.

39
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,904
Did someone come by looking
to take Gyeong Jun away?

40
00:02:57,904 --> 00:02:59,637
I don't know.

41
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:01,470
Where's Dr. Lee?

42
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,237
She went that way.

From now on, discuss anything that
has to do with Gyeong Jun with me.

You are his father after all.

you insisted on coming to a place like this?

62

This is the perfect place for a kid

an American-style birthday kiss.

67
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:07,104
The first one was a goodbye kiss
and this one was a birthday kiss?

Let's make the third one a comeback kiss.

There won't be a third.

There can be no future for us.

71
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:13,404
Were you trying to run away

72
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:15,171
because you were fearful
of what might lie ahead?

73
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:17,704
You said you were reckless
because you were a kid, right?

It was you who had wanted
to meet me about Gyeong Jun.

81
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:46,904
Does this mean Gyeong Jun
is Dr. Seo's younger brother?

Dr. Seo or Gyeong Jun?

Dr. Seo's more important to you, right?

86
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:02,770
That's why you've been trying
to keep Gyeong Jun a secret.

00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:29,237
It'll be like that for the rest of your life.

166
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,570
No way.

167
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,104
We'll see.

168
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:35,104
People who are timid and indecisive
become hypnotized more easily.

169
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:36,804
You're making me worried.

170
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,304
Snap me out of it. Red sun.

171
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,171
The hypnosis must've worked
seeing that you're nervous.

172
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:44,171
And that means you'll stay with me.

173
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,570
Get me out of it.

174
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,870
Red sun. Snap me back.

175
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,137
Hey.

176
00:10:50,137 --> 00:10:52,004
Are you trying to catch a fly?

177
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:57,204
Snap me out of it.

178
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:58,470
No one can break the hypnosis but me.

179
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,204
I know. Red sun. Sun. Sun.

180
00:11:00,204 --> 00:11:01,371
Alright. Fine.

181
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:03,071
Blue sun.

182
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:04,237
Black sun.

183
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:07,603
- White sun.
- No. Snap me out.

184
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:09,470
It's bothering me.

185
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,104
No.

186
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,704
Wait inside.

187
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:17,470
I threw out your toothbrush, because
you had said you were leaving.

188
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,904
I'll go and get you a new one.

189
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:20,937
When did you throw out my toothbrush?

190
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:23,004
I also threw out your slippers.

191
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,837
Get a carton of milk too.

192
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:29,171
Okay.

193
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,171
10:10.

194
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:33,670
Gotcha.

195
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:37,071
I gotcha. I gotcha.

196
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,004
Mary.

197
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:52,670
Did you get that for Gyeong Jun
for his birthday?

198
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,637
Huh? Yeah.

199
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,338
You should go on inside.

200
00:11:57,338 --> 00:12:00,970
I have to tell Gyeong Jun
something very important.

201
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,237
Then come in with me
and wait for him inside.

202
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:06,670
It's something important about
Gyeong Jun that only I know.

203
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,804
You stay out of it.

204
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:18,004
Gyeong Jun.

205
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,937
I kept calling you yesterday.
Why didn't you pick up?

206
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:24,970
You kept insisting on throwing a party,
and I didn't want you to do that.

207
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,037
I just wasn't in the mood.

208
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,937
Are you in a better mood now
because of Ms. Gil?

209
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:33,338
Yup.

210
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:38,137
Then if I tell you something sad,
I'll put you in a funk again.

211
00:12:38,937 --> 00:12:40,904
It's okay. You can tell me.

212
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:43,904
I'm so happy right now that
a bit of bad news won't hurt.

213
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,371
Are you that happy?

214
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:47,937
Yup.

215
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:56,037
So what is it?

216
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:57,670
No.

217
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,338
I don't want to tell you anything bad.

218
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:02,603
I'll have Ms. Gil tell you.

219
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:06,137
Sounds good. It would be better
coming from Gil Teacher anyway.

220
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:09,438
This looks good.

221
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:18,171
Once Ms. Gil finds out who your father is,

222
00:13:18,937 --> 00:13:21,537
neither of you will be laughing anymore.

223
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,670
[Roundtrip Ticket to the Moon A-1]

224
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,870
A trip to the moon.

225
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:38,071
A submarine adventure.

226
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:44,870
Will we ever get to do such things?

227
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:50,503
Gyeong Jun, it's all thanks to you
that I'm visiting the moon.

228
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:53,970
We can't even see the Great Wall from here.

229
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,004
It makes me realize how trivial the worries

230
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,870
I had on Earth were.

231
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,237
I'm glad I kicked them all aside.

232
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:12,670
Gyeong Jun, thanks for bringing me
on the submarine adventure.

233
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,804
Thanks also for telling me we had a future.

234
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:29,171
Gyeong Jun.

235
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:44,770
How's it going?

236
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:47,670
Good.

237
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:54,837
Where did you get these?

238
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,603
Birthday present from Jang Mary.

239
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:02,770
She had all the kids at school
enter a smart phone sweepstakes,

240
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,870
and one of the kids won all these drinks.

241
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:13,603
When Mary sets her mind to something,
she's like an express train.

242
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:15,704
She charges ahead full steam
until she gets what she wants.

243
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:19,704
No one would mind a pretty express train
like her charging at them.

244
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:21,037
You two look good together.

245
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:23,937
Jang Mary is very pretty.

246
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:26,104
There are oil deposits in her father's land.

247
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:28,804
A full tour of his property takes 30 minutes.

248
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,137
- By car?
- By helicopter.

249
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:35,237
That makes her a golden express train.

250
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:38,770
Unlike someone who can't
even run on well-laid tracks.

251
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,737
You got this again?

252
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,438
I'm sick and tired of this one.

253
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:49,470
Wasn't there anything new?

254
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,804
But you said you liked that bread.

255
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,970
Let's get something else.

256
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,071
Kids tend to tire of things easily.

257
00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:01,404
Are you commiserating with the bread?

258
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:02,804
No.

259
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:06,271
I'll eat the bread for energy
and charge ahead on my tracks.

260
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:08,737
My tracks will be laid toward
the high school in Pocheon,

261
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:12,104
and I'm going to charge ahead
toward my dim and quaint future.

262
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,137
Why did you do that?

263
00:16:16,137 --> 00:16:18,737
If you're going to travel on
the wrong set of tracks,

264
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:21,704
there'll be no energy for you.
Just go hungry.

265
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:30,237
Mr. Kang.

266
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,770
Vice Principal Kim.

267
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,071
My goodness.

268
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:38,570
Why are you in your high school uniform?

269
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,137
Jeong Hye doesn't recognize me,

270
00:16:42,137 --> 00:16:45,670
so I thought this might help.

271
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:48,937
Good grief.

272
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:52,770
You poor soul.

273
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,970
Go on in.

274
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:06,204
Welcome.

275
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:10,770
We have a lot of customers.
Please take this and go.

276
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:17,004
You're old enough to do
better for yourself.

277
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:24,071
Good luck.

278
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:32,637
Who was that?

279
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:35,237
I gave him $2 and sent him away.

280
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:40,537
Did she recognize you?

281
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:44,004
I saw her holding your hand.

282
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:54,004
My goodness.

283
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:57,271
You poor, poor soul.

284
00:18:57,271 --> 00:19:00,237
I really made

285
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:02,438
a fool out of myself.

286
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:08,904
10:10?

287
00:19:13,004 --> 00:19:14,104
10:10.

288
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,503
He got me. He got me.

289
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:19,904
What am I going to do?

290
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:21,503
Ms. Gil,

291
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:25,770
I heard you were transferring
to a school outside of Seoul.

292
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,338
What school?

293
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,503
It's not set in stone yet, though.

294
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,870
Huh?

295
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,937
Where's your wedding ring?

296
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:37,037
Oh, yeah.

297
00:19:37,037 --> 00:19:39,637
I had forgotten about it.

298
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:43,570
Are you saying you had forgotten
about Dr. Seo Yun Jae?

299
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,670
Where did you lose the ring?

300
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,271
We have to find it right away.

301
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,404
I have to give it back.
Maybe someone took it.

302
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,338
I don't think it's here.

303
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:01,271
We should look over there.

304
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:04,404
No. I dropped it here.
If it's not here, it's gone.

305
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,371
If you knew you had dropped it here,
why didn't you look for it right away?

306
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:12,271
Did you have a fight with Yun Jae
and throw it away out of spite?

307
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:15,071
Did you throw it away?

308
00:20:15,904 --> 00:20:18,970
I just forgot. I was in a daze.

309
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,904
How serious was the fight
that it put you in a daze?

310
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:24,904
No wonder you were talking about
transferring outside of Seoul.

311
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:27,670
I must have lost it. I must have lost it.

312
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,037
Ow, my back.

313
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:32,071
Ow.

314
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:34,004
I'll go to the office

315
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:36,804
and see if anyone brought it in.

316
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:42,071
Ms. Gil,

317
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:44,570
I met Gyeong Jun's father yesterday.

318
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,970
But didn't you say you had
met him a while back?

319
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,670
That was a lie.

320
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,537
But I really did meet him yesterday.

321
00:20:51,537 --> 00:20:55,404
He was reluctant to admit it, but he
was definitely Gyeong Jun's father.

322
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:57,904
I didn't want to upset Gyeong Jun,
so I haven't told him.

323
00:20:57,904 --> 00:20:59,004
Really?

324
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:01,704
Gyeong Jun's father doesn't want to
tell me anything because I'm young.

325
00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:03,470
You should go and talk to him.

326
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,537
Yeah. That's a good idea.

327
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,037
Once Gyeong Jun meets his father,

328
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,371
he won't have to be with you anymore.

329
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:15,770
You said you'd feel

330
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,404
free to leave him once he found his father.

331
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:24,704
What's wrong?

332
00:21:25,237 --> 00:21:27,204
Don't tell me

333
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,537
you want to stay with Gyeong Jun.

334
00:21:34,637 --> 00:21:36,104
Da Ran,

335
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,870
they don't have it at the office.

336
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,904
Lunch break is over. Let's go.

337
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:45,570
We have to find your ring
as soon as possible.

338
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,137
I'm worried.

339
00:21:53,637 --> 00:21:55,104
Teddy Bear,

340
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:58,770
why aren't you in the playroom?

341
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,937
Are you alone? Where's Miss Rabbit?

342
00:22:00,937 --> 00:22:03,804
Ji Min's sick.

343
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:04,904
Sick?

344
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:07,737
We're all sick.

345
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:12,237
We're patients and you're a doctor.

346
00:22:13,503 --> 00:22:15,737
You're right.

347
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:18,104
Is Miss Rabbit very ill?

348
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,937
Giving you shots and stitches is what

349
00:22:22,937 --> 00:22:26,137
the old Dr. Seo Yun Jae did for money.

350
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,603
I'm only here to get over my trauma.

351
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:32,004
What's a trauma?

352
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,470
For me,

353
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,371
there's this red thing I can't stand to see.

354
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:42,004
Ji Min,

355
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:44,237
are you okay?

356
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:46,603
Dr. Seo Yun Jae,

357
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,837
Ji Min's condition has deteriorated.

358
00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:01,704
I wish her a quick recovery.

359
00:23:01,704 --> 00:23:03,804
Dr. Seo,

360
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:09,037
could you please hold her hand?

361
00:23:09,404 --> 00:23:12,438
She's not doing very well.

362
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:15,537
She used to do a good job
enduring the treatment

363
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:18,204
when you held her hand.

364
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,770
Doctor.

365
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:39,603
I'm sorry.

366
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,603
"Meeting the 18-Year-Old Me"

367
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:05,470
Are you scared?

368
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,004
But you're an adult.

369
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:09,770
I'm not an adult,

370
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,870
and there are some things you can't do
even after you become an adult.

371
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,737
There'll be things you'll be scared of
even when you grow older.

372
00:25:13,737 --> 00:25:17,970
They say I can't become an adult.

373
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:25,371
Ji Min and I won't live long enough
to become adults.

374
00:25:35,137 --> 00:25:36,770
Yes, you will.

375
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,271
You'll grow into a big bear,

376
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,704
Miss Rabbit will grow into a sexy rabbit,

377
00:25:41,704 --> 00:25:45,937
and Kang Gyeong Jun will grow into
someone cooler than Seo Yun Jae.

378
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:49,837
We'll all continue to grow.

379
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:58,104
It's for the best that I lost it.

380
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:02,970
I never would've been able to return it
and tell him about Gyeong Jun.

381
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,338
I shouldn't look for the ring.

382
00:26:06,338 --> 00:26:08,204
That's just not right.

383
00:26:08,204 --> 00:26:10,804
You have to come clean and apologize.

384
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:14,737
Why did you hide your report card?

385
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:16,770
I wanted to go

386
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,737
to Bali with my mom.

387
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:21,104
Bali! Yeah!

388
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:24,171
If you want to go to Bali,
do it fair and square.

389
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:28,470
Show your mom the report card and
take whatever punishment you deserve.

390
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,071
Fine. I won't go to Bali.

391
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:34,204
You're such a fool.

392
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:36,737
You're right. I am a fool.

393
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:39,137
I'll just say I lost the ring,

394
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:40,904
and I won't be with Gyeong Jun, either.

395
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:45,171
Do you want to be with KKJ?

396
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,670
Pardon?

397
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,570
If you want to be with him,

398
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,503
find the ring, return it, and
ask Yun Jae for forgiveness.

399
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,438
I'm scared.

400
00:26:55,438 --> 00:26:59,237
If you're sure you want to be with KKJ,

401
00:26:59,237 --> 00:27:00,637
you have to have courage.

402
00:27:00,637 --> 00:27:03,438
How can I be sure I want to be with him?

403
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:09,570
10:10, right? Then you can be sure.

404
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,704
10:10?

405
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:16,304
Ms. Gil,

406
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:18,503
what are you doing?

407
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,004
Like you said,

408
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:25,670
I need to check to see how sure I am.

409
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,537
10:10.

410
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:34,104
What's wrong with Ms. Gil?

411
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,970
What is this anyway?

412
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,404
Maybe she's gotten herself into a cult.

413
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:46,071
Hello.

414
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,637
From now on, whenever the watch says 10:10,

415
00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:56,503
you will think of KKJ.

416
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,304
Don't tell me I'm really hypnotized.

417
00:28:02,338 --> 00:28:04,770
It's only 6:00.

418
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:20,737
It's only 6:10. What's wrong with me?

419
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:39,670
It was just 6:10.

420
00:28:41,404 --> 00:28:45,837
I'll distract myself so that
10:10 just comes and goes.

421
00:28:48,404 --> 00:28:51,037
Focus on clothes. Focus on clothes.

422
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,204
Huh?

423
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,537
I'm not hypnotized. I'm not hypnotized.

424
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:04,970
It's always 10:10 for me.

425
00:30:10,037 --> 00:30:11,603
Gil Da Ran,

426
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,338
where have you been?

427
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:17,438
I've been waiting for you forever.

428
00:30:17,438 --> 00:30:18,770
What time is it?

429
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,970
10:10.

430
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,071
What?

431
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,071
It's still light out.

432
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,470
Huh?

433
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,537
10:10?

434
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:29,870
I do want to be with you.

435
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,371
The tracks have been laid toward me?

436
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:38,071
Charge forward, Gil Da Ran Express!

437
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:40,537
I'll go with 10:10.

438
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:42,404
I need to be brave.

439
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:44,204
Before all else, I should find the ring.

440
00:30:46,937 --> 00:30:47,904
What?

441
00:30:47,904 --> 00:30:49,137
Gil Da Ran Express,

442
00:30:49,137 --> 00:30:51,171
are you derailing?

443
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,770
As the eldest son of the Gil family,
I have to save my sister's marriage.

444
00:30:57,204 --> 00:31:00,704
Where are you, ring?

445
00:31:01,704 --> 00:31:04,304
Stop, Gil Da Ran. Wait. Wait.

446
00:31:05,004 --> 00:31:06,870
Why are you looking for
the ring you threw out?

447
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,937
I have to find the ring
to ask for forgiveness.

448
00:31:09,937 --> 00:31:11,570
Forgiveness?

449
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,470
Forgiveness for having an affair?

450
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,404
- Yes.
- And make time go back?

451
00:31:16,404 --> 00:31:20,371
You crossed an ocean you
shouldn't have with KKJ last night.

452
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:23,770
Last night, I was just ashamed
of having been found out,

453
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,970
but if I am to move forward, I need
to be brave and ask for forgiveness.

454
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,470
That's why I have to find the ring.

455
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,704
Will you find

456
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:36,404
the ring and then dump
Seo Yun Jae to be with KKJ?

457
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:40,237
- KKJ...
- Forgiveness has to come first.

458
00:31:40,937 --> 00:31:43,338
And that's something I have to get,

459
00:31:43,338 --> 00:31:46,503
so you should leave and
let me do this on my own.

460
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,171
Sure. If that's what you want...

461
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,004
Affair? Forgiveness?

462
00:31:58,004 --> 00:32:00,104
Cross the ocean?

463
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,271
KKJ...

464
00:32:07,371 --> 00:32:09,537
I know it's a good one

465
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:11,104
just like you.

466
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:14,704
Let's have it now.

467
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:17,503
But Chung Sik's not back yet.

468
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:20,770
He can just have what's left over.

469
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,137
I suppose. We could just...

470
00:32:22,137 --> 00:32:25,271
Father! Mother!

471
00:32:31,904 --> 00:32:36,804
The Gil family name has been disgraced.

472
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:37,904
Disgraced?

473
00:32:37,904 --> 00:32:40,937
The elder daughter of the Gil household...

474
00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:43,237
The elder daughter

475
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:47,304
is having an affair.

476
00:32:54,104 --> 00:32:55,304
Having an affair?

477
00:32:55,304 --> 00:32:57,271
What?

478
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:01,670
Hi, Dong Sik.

479
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,804
Hello, Mr. Gil.

480
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:06,470
My daughter's committing adultery.

481
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,338
Pardon?

482
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:10,704
She has to be arrested this instant.

483
00:33:16,637 --> 00:33:18,338
This is driving me crazy.

484
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:29,503
If she wants to ask for forgiveness,
I could offer her a guiding light.

485
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:37,804
Maybe I can ask the officers for help.

486
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:45,171
Gil Da Ran.

487
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:48,338
Oh? Dad.

488
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:49,770
Ms. Gil Da Ran?

489
00:33:50,503 --> 00:33:53,870
We're arresting you based
on your father's report.

490
00:33:54,503 --> 00:33:56,204
Pardon?

491
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,637
Gil Da Ran...

492
00:34:07,637 --> 00:34:08,837
What's going on, dad?

493
00:34:08,837 --> 00:34:10,438
I heard you were having an affair.

494
00:34:10,438 --> 00:34:12,438
You've committed a crime,
so you have to be punished.

495
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:14,071
Reflect on your transgression in there.

496
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,603
Dad.

497
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:19,371
Dad...

498
00:34:23,704 --> 00:34:25,438
Yun Jae,

499
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,637
I'm sorry.

500
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:33,637
It's my fault that she's having an affair.

501
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:38,970
I'm also having an affair.

502
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,404
Why did you come in here?

503
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:49,904
I confessed too.

504
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:53,904
What do they think they're doing?

505
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:55,804
Mr. Gil,

506
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,271
please just forgive them.

507
00:34:57,271 --> 00:34:59,304
Don't let them out.

508
00:34:59,304 --> 00:35:02,304
I'll keep them locked up for now

509
00:35:02,304 --> 00:35:04,704
and let them leave

510
00:35:04,704 --> 00:35:06,637
once they make up.

511
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,004
I've seen many adulterers,

512
00:35:09,004 --> 00:35:12,271
but they don't seem like the type.

513
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:24,537
You finally worked up the courage,
but we're starting out in a holding cell.

514
00:35:24,537 --> 00:35:26,371
You must be scared.

515
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:27,904
Scared?

516
00:35:28,904 --> 00:35:31,570
I'm good at bearing hardship.

517
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,937
I'm very indecisive,

518
00:35:33,937 --> 00:35:37,470
but once I make my decision,
I can deal with a lot.

519
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,904
If we're together, we won't always go
to fun and places like the moon.

520
00:35:43,904 --> 00:35:46,603
We have to come to ugly places like this too.

521
00:35:58,071 --> 00:36:01,037
This place doesn't look that bad anymore.

522
00:36:01,037 --> 00:36:03,438
Look at how sleek and even the bars are.

523
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:05,937
Is the floor heated?

524
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:12,338
I kind of like the color of the walls, too.

525
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,371
Yeah. It's very modern.

526
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:16,737
Maybe we should paint our house this color.

527
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,704
What...

528
00:37:03,704 --> 00:37:08,704
It's exactly the same as Ms. Gil's
wedding ring. I bought it.

529
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:10,637
Let's just tell her we found it.

530
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,837
Do you think that's okay?

531
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:23,037
Once she found the ring,

532
00:37:23,037 --> 00:37:25,704
she was going to return it to Dr. Seo

533
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,770
and end things with him.

534
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,570
What?

535
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:33,304
End things with Dr. Seo?

536
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:35,637
Yeah.

537
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:41,237
Maybe we shouldn't give
this to her right now.

538
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:43,104
No way.

539
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:47,870
But Ms. Gil has to love
Dr. Seo and Dr. Seo only.

540
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,438
She can't fall in love with another person.

541
00:37:50,438 --> 00:37:51,603
I know.

542
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,338
But...

543
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:58,104
She had promised she'd never fall for him.

544
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,470
Mary.

545
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:08,137
What are you going to do about the ring?

546
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:10,537
I'll have to tell him about

547
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:14,570
the ring and all that he has lost
after you came into my life.

548
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:17,637
When the switchover happens,

549
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:20,071
I have to go to Yun Jae first

550
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:22,737
and apologize to him.

551
00:38:22,737 --> 00:38:24,670
Seo Yun Jae comes first?

552
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,970
Yes. He does.

553
00:38:29,104 --> 00:38:31,338
If that's what you want...

554
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:37,870
But you have to be holding
my hand when I wake up.

555
00:38:39,037 --> 00:38:41,204
I'm scared too.

556
00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:44,837
I don't know if I'll be able to return
to my body safe and sound.

557
00:38:49,304 --> 00:38:50,503
Okay.

558
00:38:50,503 --> 00:38:52,970
Okay. I'll hold your hand then.

559
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:56,438
What will you do

560
00:38:56,438 --> 00:38:58,237
if KKJ gets upset and leaves you because

561
00:38:58,237 --> 00:39:01,603
you're preoccupied with Seo Yun Jae?

562
00:39:01,603 --> 00:39:02,904
What?

563
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:08,304
Kids tend to tire easily.

564
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,704
You saw how I was with
the bread earlier, right?

565
00:39:12,004 --> 00:39:15,338
That would be a shame.

566
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:18,438
So cuff me.

567
00:39:18,438 --> 00:39:20,537
Cuff me so that I can't leave you.

568
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:38,737
What time is it?

569
00:39:38,737 --> 00:39:40,537
10:10.

570
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:42,404
No.

571
00:39:42,404 --> 00:39:44,071
It's been

572
00:39:45,271 --> 00:39:50,171
10:10 for me all day.

573
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,770
Yun Jae has relapsed?

574
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,037
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

575
00:40:45,037 --> 00:40:46,970
It's only right that we wait
for Gyeong Jun to wake up.

576
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,704
Yun Jae comes first.

577
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:51,770
We don't know when that kid will wake up.

578
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,637
You have to put Yun Jae first.

579
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:55,770
I know we don't have much time.

580
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,204
I will meet with Gyeong Jun's
legal guardian.

581
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:04,537
Meet with Gyeong Jun's father
at Gyeong Jun's uncle's restaurant?

582
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:06,837
Yes. He's meeting you there.

583
00:41:09,304 --> 00:41:13,503
Who is he that he's being so secretive?

584
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:15,670
You can find out for yourself.

585
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,603
Oh, right.

586
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,570
Ms. Gil,

587
00:41:23,704 --> 00:41:28,137
did you find the ring?

588
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:30,637
No.

589
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:35,503
Will you put in on again once you find it?

590
00:41:36,237 --> 00:41:38,237
Mary,

591
00:41:38,237 --> 00:41:41,071
I purposely took off

592
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:43,271
that ring.

593
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:45,438
Who cares?

594
00:41:45,438 --> 00:41:47,704
You can always put it back on.

595
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:51,704
I'll find it for you so that
you can put it back on.

596
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:07,570
You want me to meet with
Gyeong Jun's father and teacher?

597
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,570
Yes. The meeting has already been arranged.

598
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:13,670
Isn't Gyeong Jun's teacher
the wife of that doctor?

599
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,704
Yes.

600
00:42:14,704 --> 00:42:17,904
Ms. Gil Da Ran is married
to Dr. Seo Yun Jae.

601
00:42:20,837 --> 00:42:22,670
Hey, Yun Jae,

602
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,171
did you get tests done?

603
00:42:25,171 --> 00:42:26,637
Yeah. Why?

604
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:30,737
The director of internal medicine
keeps asking me about you,

605
00:42:30,737 --> 00:42:33,004
so I thought maybe it was something serious.

606
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,570
Are you ill again?

607
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,503
I am, but I will be okay soon.

608
00:42:38,503 --> 00:42:39,870
Did you check the test results?

609
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,904
I think my father did.

610
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:44,071
You should go and check.

611
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:54,670
Yun Jae has relapsed?

612
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,438
Yes.

613
00:42:56,438 --> 00:43:00,570
He has to start his treatment and
get surgery as soon as possible.

614
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:05,104
Thankfully, Gyeong Jun's here,

615
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:07,171
so the transplant can take place right away.

616
00:43:07,171 --> 00:43:10,970
Hematopoietic stem cells can't be extracted
without the guardian's consent.

617
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,204
We are his parents.

618
00:43:13,204 --> 00:43:17,037
Yun Jae's father will be meeting
with the legal guardian

619
00:43:17,037 --> 00:43:22,004
and then take Gyeong Jun with him.

620
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,603
All we need is his blood

621
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,937
for Yun Jae's surgery.

622
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:34,970
Aren't you going to tell
Yun Jae about Gyeong Jun?

623
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,438
Not all recipients know who their donors are.

624
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:42,970
I don't want him to ever find out.

625
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:45,570
That's why

626
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,870
you need to help me.

627
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,371
So this body's really ill?

628
00:43:53,371 --> 00:43:54,770
Seo Yun Jae's ill?

629
00:43:55,438 --> 00:43:59,704
Your father said he knew the previous donor,

630
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,071
so you should be fine if we hurry.

631
00:44:15,004 --> 00:44:16,970
Seo Yun Jae

632
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,004
is sick?

633
00:44:19,338 --> 00:44:21,271
So the pain I've been feeling

634
00:44:21,271 --> 00:44:24,503
had nothing to do with the switchover?
It was from a real illness?

635
00:44:27,338 --> 00:44:28,837
You may not remember,

636
00:44:28,837 --> 00:44:32,004
but you were very ill when you were little.

637
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:38,470
I realized that my life was possible
because of the warm hand of help...

638
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,071
And that help had come from...

639
00:44:48,204 --> 00:44:49,670
Gyeong Jun.

640
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,404
I'm busy. I need to check up on something.

641
00:44:53,404 --> 00:44:55,371
It's about Ms. Gil.

642
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:57,704
What? Did something happen to her?

643
00:44:57,704 --> 00:44:58,804
Yeah.

644
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:02,404
She's meeting with someone today.

645
00:45:16,204 --> 00:45:20,271
If he's given this shot
for the next few days,

646
00:45:20,271 --> 00:45:23,970
we'll be able to collect the blood
without general anesthesia.

647
00:45:25,637 --> 00:45:29,704
Please start right away.

648
00:45:32,237 --> 00:45:35,171
Yun Jae has to come first.

649
00:46:02,171 --> 00:46:03,737
Who's Gil Da Ran meeting?

650
00:46:03,737 --> 00:46:06,204
Someone you won't like.

651
00:46:06,204 --> 00:46:08,004
You said it would be better

652
00:46:08,004 --> 00:46:10,970
for you to get bad news from Ms. Gil.

653
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,404
Wait until she gets back
so that she can tell you.

654
00:46:18,404 --> 00:46:20,071
Gyeong Jun,

655
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:21,904
are you okay?

656
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,637
Gyeong Jun.

657
00:46:29,737 --> 00:46:31,637
What's going on?
Did he just react to the shot?

658
00:46:31,637 --> 00:46:34,837
No. I haven't given him the shot yet.

659
00:46:42,004 --> 00:46:43,470
What's going on?

660
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,804
Is he unwell?

661
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:46,670
His heartbeat and breathing are unstable.

662
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,603
I don't get it. He's never been like this.

663
00:46:50,603 --> 00:46:52,670
Gyeong Jun.

664
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,804
Gyeong Jun.

665
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:58,438
- Gyeong Jun.
- Gyeong Jun, are you okay?

666
00:46:58,438 --> 00:46:59,937
Gyeong Jun.

667
00:47:03,837 --> 00:47:05,737
Are you okay?

668
00:47:09,804 --> 00:47:12,004
What did I just see?

669
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:19,970
Gyeong Jun.

670
00:47:23,704 --> 00:47:26,704
He's stabilized.

671
00:47:30,937 --> 00:47:32,737
I can't do this.

672
00:47:33,204 --> 00:47:35,304
This isn't right.

673
00:47:35,304 --> 00:47:37,970
We need his consent.

674
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:41,837
Se Yeong,

675
00:47:41,837 --> 00:47:43,837
this is for Yun Jae.

676
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:46,137
And it's not like anything
terrible will happen to him.

677
00:47:46,137 --> 00:47:49,804
You're just giving him a few shots
and drawing blood from him.

678
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:54,037
Be that as it may,

679
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,304
I can't do it.

680
00:47:56,937 --> 00:48:00,503
You should tell Yun Jae everything,

681
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,937
discuss the matter with him,

682
00:48:02,937 --> 00:48:05,970
and then make your decision after
we've checked Gyeong Jun's condition.

683
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:10,537
He's the only one who can save Yun Jae.

684
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:15,704
It won't be easy finding a more ideal donor.

685
00:48:15,704 --> 00:48:19,503
He has the same mother and
father as Yun Jae after all.

686
00:48:21,037 --> 00:48:22,970
But

687
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,404
I don't think it's right to take his blood

688
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,570
as if we're stealing it without consent.

689
00:48:35,904 --> 00:48:37,837
Yun Jae.

690
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,904
What were you two talking about?

691
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:48,037
Seo Yun Jae and Kang Gyeong Jun

692
00:48:48,037 --> 00:48:50,804
have the same mother and father?

693
00:48:50,804 --> 00:48:52,637
Yes.

694
00:48:53,637 --> 00:48:57,670
Gyeong Jun

695
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,171
is your brother.

696
00:49:02,603 --> 00:49:06,870
Your father and I had him

697
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:09,670
through a surrogate in order to save you.

698
00:49:20,004 --> 00:49:23,037
Excuse me.

699
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:33,071
What were you just about to do to the kid?

700
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:35,870
It's what your mother wanted.

701
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,770
Let her explain it to you.

702
00:49:47,004 --> 00:49:51,637
Your eyes are much colder

703
00:49:51,637 --> 00:49:55,004
than when I first told you about this.

704
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:58,171
I don't care though.

705
00:49:58,171 --> 00:50:02,904
I don't care so long as you can live.

706
00:50:02,904 --> 00:50:07,737
You're what's most important to me.

707
00:50:08,704 --> 00:50:10,970
You

708
00:50:13,371 --> 00:50:15,970
are Kang Gyeong Jun's mother?

709
00:50:17,503 --> 00:50:19,637
Yes.

710
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:23,171
Having you wasn't easy.

711
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:26,338
Thereafter, I couldn't have any more babies,

712
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:31,637
so your father and I had this child

713
00:50:31,637 --> 00:50:36,470
through the woman who raised him.

714
00:50:38,204 --> 00:50:40,737
Yun Jae,

715
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:43,338
we did it for you.

716
00:50:43,937 --> 00:50:45,637
You're very ill right now.

717
00:50:45,637 --> 00:50:48,371
You can blame me

718
00:50:48,371 --> 00:50:52,137
to your heart's content once you get better,

719
00:50:52,137 --> 00:50:54,804
but this kid is the only one
who can save you.

720
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:19,470
Gyeong Jun.

721
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,603
He's here.

722
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,804
What are you doing here?

723
00:51:48,804 --> 00:51:50,171
Wait.

724
00:51:50,171 --> 00:51:54,104
Do you two know each other?

725
00:51:54,104 --> 00:51:58,237
Ms. Gil, this is Gyeong Jun's father.

726
00:52:06,837 --> 00:52:10,870
My mom wasn't

727
00:52:12,104 --> 00:52:14,904
really my mom?

728
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:21,470
The switchover makes sense now.

729
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,970
He's lying there in a coma

730
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:29,737
waiting for me to save him.

731
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:34,670
Our souls changed bodies when he saved me,

732
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:39,304
so if I save him, will we switch over again?

733
00:52:40,137 --> 00:52:43,371
It was strictly a give-and-take deal.

734
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,071
Once you return to your body,

735
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:50,404
leave all this mess behind and
return to the States with me.

736
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:55,937
No. I'm not going.

737
00:52:57,338 --> 00:53:00,271
I'm sure Gil Da Ran will stay by my side.

738
00:53:00,704 --> 00:53:02,338
What?

739
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:04,904
I'm going to ignore everything else.

740
00:53:04,904 --> 00:53:07,603
They don't matter to me anyway.

741
00:53:08,537 --> 00:53:10,937
If my blood can save him,

742
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:14,037
the debt will be settled.

743
00:53:14,037 --> 00:53:16,271
You'll just ignore everyone else?

744
00:53:16,271 --> 00:53:19,271
And you're going to stay with Ms. Gil?

745
00:53:19,937 --> 00:53:21,371
Yeah.

746
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:24,537
No,

747
00:53:24,537 --> 00:53:27,503
I don't think so.

748
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:31,037
Ms. Gil already knows.

749
00:53:31,037 --> 00:53:33,171
She knows everything.

750
00:53:38,537 --> 00:53:40,470
This painting...

751
00:53:42,404 --> 00:53:46,737
So it really was painted
by Gyeong Jun's father.

752
00:53:46,737 --> 00:53:50,371
I painted it for Yun Jae and Gyeong Jun.

753
00:53:51,171 --> 00:53:53,870
It will be very hard on Yun Jae
if he finds out.

754
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,137
He may even

755
00:53:56,137 --> 00:54:03,704
refuse to get the surgery
until Gyeong Jun wakes up.

756
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:09,670
But there's no time.

757
00:54:10,537 --> 00:54:18,603
Please talk to Yun Jae.

758
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:25,271
Ms. Gil knows that

759
00:54:25,271 --> 00:54:27,870
Dr. Seo's father is also your father.

760
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:30,137
She's meeting with him right now.

761
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:36,204
Gil Da Ran knows?

762
00:54:36,204 --> 00:54:38,271
Yes.

763
00:54:39,271 --> 00:54:42,271
I was going to tell you the other day,

764
00:54:43,904 --> 00:54:46,338
but you said you'd rather

765
00:54:46,338 --> 00:54:48,770
hear the bad news from Ms. Gil,

766
00:54:50,237 --> 00:54:53,670
so I told Ms. Gil.

767
00:55:01,004 --> 00:55:03,704
There's no way

768
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:05,770
she would have kept it from me.

769
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:09,704
She kept it from you because
she's on Seo Yun Jae's side.

770
00:55:09,704 --> 00:55:15,204
Dr. Seo's more important to her.

771
00:55:15,204 --> 00:55:18,037
No.

772
00:55:18,037 --> 00:55:20,171
You're lying.

773
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:25,704
You can ask Ms. Gil when she gets back.

774
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:31,470
Ask her if she had known or not.

775
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:52,438
Yun Jae.

776
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:56,637
Was Gil Da Ran here?

777
00:55:56,637 --> 00:55:59,670
She must have persuaded you.

778
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,204
I'm so relieved.

779
00:56:36,837 --> 00:56:40,670
Did you meet him, Ms. Gil?

780
00:56:42,804 --> 00:56:44,970
What's wrong?

781
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:49,704
Did he tell you Dr. Seo is ill?

782
00:56:51,438 --> 00:56:54,870
You knew about that too?

783
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,770
Now Gyeong Jun knows too.

784
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,304
What?

785
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:02,004
This is all your fault.

786
00:57:02,603 --> 00:57:06,037
It's all your fault that Dr. Seo is ill

787
00:57:06,037 --> 00:57:08,603
and that Gyeong Jun's upset.

788
00:57:08,603 --> 00:57:11,204
It's all your doing.

789
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:16,304
Gyeong Jun says he's just
going to ignore everything.

790
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:19,837
He says they don't matter to him anyway.

791
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:26,338
He just wants to be with you.

792
00:57:27,438 --> 00:57:31,037
That's why he won't help Dr. Seo.

793
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:37,404
This is all your fault.

794
00:57:38,438 --> 00:57:40,670
You should have

795
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:46,271
kept the promise that you were never ever

796
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:49,137
going to fall for Gyeong Jun.

797
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:56,338
If Gyeong Jun saves Dr. Seo,

798
00:57:56,338 --> 00:57:59,770
their souls will return
to their respective bodies.

799
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:05,071
For that to happen, you need to
distance yourself from Gyeong Jun.

800
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:11,970
I found it.

801
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:17,770
You promised you'd only love Dr. Seo

802
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:21,470
and never fall for Gyeong Jun.

803
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,837
Stay true to your word.

804
00:58:26,438 --> 00:58:28,670
I...

805
00:58:29,438 --> 00:58:31,503
I just can't...

806
00:58:31,503 --> 00:58:34,737
If you can't do it, you can pretend.

807
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:40,304
If you insist on being selfish
and stay with Gyeong Jun,

808
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:42,503
both Gyeong Jun

809
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:47,503
and Dr. Seo will die.

810
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:55,237
I...

811
00:58:55,237 --> 00:58:59,371
I would lie for Gyeong Jun.

812
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:06,037
You can do the same and pretend.

813
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:12,338
Please tell Gyeong Jun

814
00:59:12,338 --> 00:59:14,404
to return to his own body.

815
01:00:56,537 --> 01:00:59,837
Did you

816
01:00:59,837 --> 01:01:02,404
really know everything?

817
01:01:04,104 --> 01:01:06,304
Yes.

818
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,770
Then why

819
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:13,271
did you keep it from me?

820
01:01:23,104 --> 01:01:26,371
You did it because you didn't
want me to worry, right?

821
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:35,204
I'm

822
01:01:36,237 --> 01:01:40,137
so angry and scared.

823
01:01:44,537 --> 01:01:48,171
Please hold my hand.

824
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:11,137
I...

825
01:02:11,137 --> 01:02:14,438
I can't hold your hand.

826
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:19,870
Yun Jae comes first.

827
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:25,870
I'm going back to him.

828
01:02:31,271 --> 01:02:34,271
10:10 has come and gone,

829
01:02:35,503 --> 01:02:38,870
and I've come to my senses.

830
01:02:42,637 --> 01:02:45,970
Gyeong Jun,

831
01:02:46,837 --> 01:02:50,004
please save Yun Jae,

832
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,570
and

833
01:02:58,904 --> 01:03:01,438
go back to your body.

834
01:03:17,071 --> 01:03:22,037
If that's what you want...

835
01:03:56,271 --> 01:03:57,737
[Big]

836
01:03:58,004 --> 01:04:00,904
Promise me you will put Gyeong Jun first.

837
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:03,104
She said she had known everything

838
01:04:03,104 --> 01:04:04,804
and only stayed with me to save Yun Jae.

839
01:04:04,804 --> 01:04:06,204
Did you tell her

840
01:04:06,204 --> 01:04:08,570
you loved her and had her
give you a baby for your son?

841
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:09,438
Yun Jae.

842
01:04:09,438 --> 01:04:11,470
Is that how you got her
to have Kang Gyeong Jun?

843
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:12,637
It was me.

844
01:04:12,637 --> 01:04:15,770
There was nothing I wouldn't do for you.

845
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,004
Stop it.

846
01:04:17,004 --> 01:04:18,470
Then tell me how you really feel.

847
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:20,470
Tell me I should do whatever
I want to in this wretched situation.

848
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:22,271
Tell me I come first no matter what.

849
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:25,071
Stop me by telling me you can let go
of everything else because I come first.

850
01:04:25,071 --> 01:04:27,570
I get the feeling it will be 10:10
for me for the rest of my life.

851
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,304
Find me a house for long-term rental

852
01:04:29,304 --> 01:04:31,371
in Palos Verdes, California.

853
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:35,071
I won't let them use me
like they used my mom.
