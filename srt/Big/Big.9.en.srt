1
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:12,737
Are you saying you were back
in your body at the hospital?

2
00:00:12,737 --> 00:00:14,137
Yeah.

3
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:17,404
Maybe 3... Or 5 seconds?

4
00:00:17,404 --> 00:00:19,503
It was brief but I definitely was there.

5
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,737
If what I felt really did happen,

6
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:41,937
I'm sure there were changes
to Yun Jae as well.

7
00:00:45,438 --> 00:00:46,637
What happened?

8
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:50,304
He was lying still just a while ago.

9
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,438
He's not here.

10
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:03,004
He must have woken up.

11
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:04,804
Gyeong Jun.

12
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:07,670
Is Gyeong Jun really going to wake up?

13
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,904
They're doing tests on him. We'll see.

14
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:29,804
He's not awake.

15
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:31,304
He's still in a coma.

16
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:33,837
But you said you felt it.

17
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:37,104
Something's probably about to happen.

18
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:39,438
Yun Jae.

19
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:43,637
[Episode 9]
Why are you here?

20
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,503
Aren't you two supposed
to be on your honeymoon?

21
00:01:45,503 --> 00:01:48,937
Did you examine Kang Gyeong Jun? How is he?

22
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:52,404
He had a seizure while unconscious
and fell off the bed.

23
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,937
He's not hurt though.

24
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:57,503
We ran tests on him, but nothing's changed.

25
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:00,304
But he moved. That's a change.

26
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:03,970
Did you come here to check on
Kang Gyeong Jun's condition?

27
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,271
Now?

28
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:07,137
And with Da Ran?

29
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:11,137
We came to the hospital for something
else and happened to dropped by.

30
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:12,770
Let's go home.

31
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,404
It looks like you two aren't
going on a honeymoon.

32
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:19,004
Given your special connection with him,

33
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:21,670
I'm keeping a good eye on him.

34
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,204
I'll call you if anything comes up.

35
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:27,704
I'll figure it out on my own,
so don't call me.

36
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:36,637
Excuse me.

37
00:02:36,637 --> 00:02:38,937
Did that doctor ask you

38
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:41,470
about Kang Gyeong Jun's condition?

39
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,404
Yes.

40
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:45,237
He happened to drop by.

41
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:50,804
But I thought he was on leave.

42
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,837
Why's he so interested in Gyeong Jun?

43
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:56,004
I told you. He wants compensation.

44
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:58,837
He went on leave after the accident.

45
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:02,171
He's also scheming to be compensated
for the leave as well.

46
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:04,304
He seemed completely fine though.

47
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:05,603
He's after the money,

48
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,670
which is why he's just waiting around
for Gyeong Jun to wake up.

49
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,271
His timing is too perfect.

50
00:03:11,637 --> 00:03:12,804
Should I ask him?

51
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:14,704
Should I come right out and
ask him what he wants?

52
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,770
There's a possibility now that we
may be returning to our own bodies.

53
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:24,438
Thank goodness it happened
before we took off.

54
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:28,137
It would've been bad if I were
giddy and happy on the trip.

55
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:32,570
Did the prospects of traveling with me
make you giddy and happy?

56
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,804
Huh? I mean...

57
00:03:36,338 --> 00:03:40,171
I was looking forward to it only
because you look like Yun Jae.

58
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:41,870
Not because it's you.

59
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,770
I know. You would've been

60
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,603
over the moon if we had switched
bodies during your honeymoon.

61
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,503
You would've liked it even
more than the Great Wall.

62
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:54,804
I would've been worried about you.
I wouldn't just have been happy.

63
00:03:54,804 --> 00:03:57,637
Don't worry about my feelings.

64
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,937
Right.

65
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:00,904
You must be disappointed
we haven't returned to our bodies.

66
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:03,804
Yes, I am. I couldn't be more disappointed.

67
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:05,171
Fine then.

68
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:07,204
Let's call off this disappointing honeymoon,

69
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:09,603
and you can go on your vacation,
and I can go on my school trip.

70
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:12,870
I don't know what had come over me.
Honeymoon with you?

71
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:15,603
What is this?

72
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:18,271
Who put all this crap on the car?

73
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:26,537
I'll enjoy my vacation,

74
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:28,804
so you enjoy your school trip.

75
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:34,537
Don't call me for the next 4 days.
I'm not picking up.

76
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:36,271
I wasn't planning to call you.

77
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:43,304
He's so rude.

78
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,737
What am I going to do alone for 4 days?

79
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:30,970
Gyeong Jun,

80
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:36,371
while the body you're in
married Ms. Gil today,

81
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:42,104
I'll consider your soul married to me.

82
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:55,670
You saw Da Ran getting married.
It's all over now.

83
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:59,438
I suppose this is the last time you
and I will be hanging out like this, too.

84
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:03,037
I'm sorry for all the trouble
I put you through.

85
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:05,904
I'll make sure to put an end
to the rumor about us at school.

86
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:09,904
Given that this is the last time,
the beer's on me.

87
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,870
Who says this is the last time?

88
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:16,537
You had me fire the start gun,

89
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:18,570
serve as the umpire, and pretend
to be your girlfriend.

90
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,870
A beer won't cut it.

91
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,371
Then how can I make it up to you?

92
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:31,404
Excuse me! A bottle of soju, please!

93
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:34,870
I'd also like Jasmine tea.
Please make sure it's from China.

94
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,304
Okay.

95
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:42,537
I should be in Beijing having
Peking duck over a glass of kaoliang.

96
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:44,737
We did a good job, didn't we?

97
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,804
We should feel rejuvenated
after the sauna, right?

98
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,237
I wonder if Gyeong Jun's gone to Gyeongju.

99
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:32,837
What is this?

100
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:58,371
Gyeong Jun.

101
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:05,704
Gyeong Jun.

102
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:11,271
Gyeong Jun.

103
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,937
Why are you here?

104
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:21,037
You must not have gone on your honeymoon.

105
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,304
The spell must be working.

106
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:28,904
Go back to where you came from!

107
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:34,037
Gyeong Jun, can't you just think of

108
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:37,804
the second floor of your house as
where I've come from?

109
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,470
Don't tell me...

110
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:53,570
What's all this?

111
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,304
I'm not planning to stay here.

112
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,770
I merely decorated the room
to remind you that

113
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:04,837
the person who married Ms. Gil
is Dr. Seo Yun Jae, not you.

114
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,904
When you get confused, you can come here,

115
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:10,438
look at these pictures,

116
00:09:10,438 --> 00:09:12,404
and come back to your senses.

117
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:17,737
I'm not confused at all, okay?

118
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:21,737
I know I can help you.

119
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,704
No.

120
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:36,104
Fine.

121
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:40,637
This is a lot better than
Chinese foot massage.

122
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:50,204
The towel looks better like this.

123
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:54,171
I saw a woman who looked a lot like Da Ran.

124
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:55,404
Da Ran?

125
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:57,004
You're sister's in China.

126
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:59,171
You're so silly.

127
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:00,404
- Right?
- Hon,

128
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:02,371
should we go to the ice room?

129
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:04,904
Sure. Let's finish this though.

130
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,737
Okay.

131
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:08,071
- I'll give Da Ran a call.
- Okay.

132
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:17,171
Hi, Chung Sik.

133
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:19,737
How's Beijing?

134
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:25,704
It's hot, humid, and crowded.

135
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:28,271
Let mom and dad know we got in safely.

136
00:10:28,271 --> 00:10:29,770
Okay.

137
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,171
Are you having dinner right now?

138
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:33,537
Yeah.

139
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,204
What are you having?

140
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:37,737
Oh...

141
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:42,503
Peking duck and kaoliang.
What a great combo.

142
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:45,137
I'm not done yet.

143
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,603
Are you sure you're in China?

144
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:52,637
Of course.

145
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:54,137
Where are you? Are you home?

146
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:55,670
I'm at the dry sauna

147
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,937
with mom and dad.

148
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,837
The strange thing is,

149
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:04,837
there's someone who looks
a lot like you here.

150
00:11:05,804 --> 00:11:07,637
Da Ran,

151
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:09,371
you're definitely in China, right?

152
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,371
You're not at a dry sauna alone,
snacking on a boiled egg, right?

153
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,271
Don't be ridiculous.

154
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:20,304
The duck's going cold. I have to go.

155
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:21,704
Excuse me.

156
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:26,904
Hey.

157
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:29,503
Hey, there. Let me see your face.

158
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:31,137
Hey!

159
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,737
Your face.

160
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:35,237
Geez.

161
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:39,670
Oh, no.

162
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,137
I just saw what I never should have.

163
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:42,171
Chung Sik.

164
00:11:42,171 --> 00:11:43,237
Chung Sik.

165
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:44,904
It's not what you think.

166
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:45,937
Did you go into the women's bath?

167
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:47,204
There was this woman
who looked like Da Ran...

168
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:49,603
Your sister's in China.

169
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:51,570
Porn is one thing, but this...

170
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,737
I swear.

171
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:01,737
The Great Wall of China.

172
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:09,071
The Great Wall of China.

173
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:11,204
Gil Da Ran

174
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:16,204
is standing on the Great Wall of China.

175
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:19,071
It would have been a lot of fun
if we had gone together.

176
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:23,503
I could have held hands with her.

177
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:34,037
But it's not me who makes Gil Da Ran smile.

178
00:12:35,737 --> 00:12:38,237
It's Seo Yun Jae.

179
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:56,171
I wonder if she really did
end up going to China.

180
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:58,237
Why isn't she coming home?

181
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:18,371
Where can she be?

182
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,570
Maybe I should look for her by the bus stop.

183
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:34,470
It's all so odd.

184
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,004
I could've sworn it was Da Ran.

185
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:40,037
But you said Da Ran told you she
was in China having Peking duck.

186
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:41,537
What's so odd about that?

187
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:43,704
But she hasn't answered her phone since.

188
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:45,603
Something's fishy.

189
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:56,570
Huh?

190
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,037
Wait.

191
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:02,204
I thought I just saw Yun Jae.

192
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:04,204
You're saying Da Ran's at the dry sauna

193
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:05,904
and Yun Jae's walking down the street.

194
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:07,970
What's the matter with you?

195
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,970
I know I'm not making sense, but...

196
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:15,837
Dad, dad, dad.

197
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:19,770
Back up a bit. Back up.

198
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,637
Yun Jae.

199
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:28,637
See? It's him.

200
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:30,637
Yun Jae.

201
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,438
What are you doing here?

202
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,970
So there was an emergency at the hospital,
so you couldn't go,

203
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,770
and you had Da Ran go alone?

204
00:14:40,304 --> 00:14:43,503
It's not easy for her to get
time off from school,

205
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:46,637
so I told her she could go alone.

206
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,870
Regardless,

207
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,603
Da Ran's so insensitive.

208
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:54,204
Have you been all alone the whole time?

209
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:56,904
Da Ran told me to stay put at home
so that you wouldn't find out

210
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:59,804
and fuss over us.

211
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,970
I was worried Da Ran had been
left alone at a dry sauna,

212
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,004
but I guess it was you
who had been left behind.

213
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,271
Da Ran has no sense of loyalty.

214
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:09,970
Don't badmouth your sister, Chung Sik.

215
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,637
I told her to go.

216
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,137
Yun Jae.

217
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:20,304
So what's Da Ran doing there anyway?

218
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:24,970
She's probably having Peking duck
over a glass of kaoliang.

219
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,237
Why don't we have some kaoliang too then?

220
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,737
I'll make you stewed chicken.

221
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,237
That goes without saying.

222
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:38,237
I saw them leave, so I should be fine.

223
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:50,137
You said we wouldn't call each other.

224
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:51,438
Are you at a nice place?

225
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:52,371
Of course.

226
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:56,137
Is it nice having boiled egg at a dry sauna?

227
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:58,338
How do you know where I am?

228
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:00,104
Are you here, too?

229
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:01,870
I'm at your parents' place.

230
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:05,537
Why? Did you get caught?

231
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:09,338
I said you took off to China alone,
so go home and stay put.

232
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:12,737
Did you get an earful?

233
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:16,137
Yeah.

234
00:16:16,137 --> 00:16:18,404
I'll call later.

235
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,537
Hon. Yun Jae.

236
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:24,770
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,804
- What's keeping you?
- I'm coming.

238
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:31,338
I hope he didn't get yelled at
too badly because of me.

239
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:38,338
The chicken's cooking,

240
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:41,670
so have some spicy seafood soup for now.

241
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,570
How refreshing. This is so refreshing.

242
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,137
Right? Isn't it refreshing?

243
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,570
Is it really refreshing?

244
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,870
It looks hot and spicy enough
to burn your tongue.

245
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,637
How can this is be refreshing?

246
00:16:56,137 --> 00:17:00,937
It just is.

247
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:04,904
Hotness and spiciness are perceived
by our body as forms of pain.

248
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:08,637
When something's "hot" or "spicy,"
our brain's telling us we're in pain.

249
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:12,970
Finding pain refreshing

250
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,104
is a form of masochism,

251
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:19,770
and cooking something painful
for someone else is sadism.

252
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,470
That's so sexy. So we're having
a deviant dinner, aren't we?

253
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:28,670
But don't people come to enjoy
food like this with age?

254
00:17:29,304 --> 00:17:31,804
I suppose people come to
enjoy more pain with age.

255
00:17:31,804 --> 00:17:33,870
I hate being in pain.

256
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:40,570
Yun Jae can talk even about
hot and spicy food in medical terms.

257
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,503
You should be having a 5-course
meal at a hotel in Beijing,

258
00:17:42,503 --> 00:17:44,037
but Da Ran took off and left you all alone.

259
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:45,904
We apologize on her behalf.

260
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:48,937
I can't believe she took off
because you told her to.

261
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:51,870
She can be a bit insensitive
from time to time.

262
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,237
Don't badmouth your daughter

263
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:59,904
especially if it's to build "Seo Yun Jae" up.

264
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:03,137
Seo Yun Jae's not all that.

265
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:05,537
After getting the house, he doesn't
have much money left.

266
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:07,137
He doesn't make much at the hospital either.

267
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:08,970
All he does is hang out
with little kids all day.

268
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,104
He's not on a particularly
promising career track.

269
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:14,537
So Seo Yun Jae's really not as great
as you make him out to be.

270
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:18,470
You're so modest. Let's eat.

271
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,071
If you don't care for the seafood stew,
would you like something else?

272
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:25,670
Fried egg with lots of ketchup, please.

273
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,470
Me too, please.

274
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:34,537
So you're heading back to the States?

275
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:37,338
Is Dr. Seo not coming?

276
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:39,204
I wanted to meet him.

277
00:18:39,204 --> 00:18:41,004
Something came up,

278
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:44,870
so I'm going back earlier than planned.

279
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,338
I see.

280
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:51,271
Yun Jae must have canceled
the honeymoon to see you off.

281
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:54,004
What do you mean?

282
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:57,204
I saw him at the hospital today.

283
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,937
At the hospital?

284
00:18:59,937 --> 00:19:03,704
The person who was in the accident
with Yun Jae is at our hospital.

285
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:08,271
He's in a coma, and Yun Jae shows
a lot of concern for the patient.

286
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:13,037
Be that as it may, how can he
not go on his honeymoon?

287
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,537
I should have a talk with him.

288
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:19,470
Who is the patient anyway?

289
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:24,104
His name is Kang Gyeong Jun.
A young student...

290
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:26,204
Kang Gyeong Jun.

291
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,837
Did you say

292
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,970
his name is Kang Gyeong Jun?

293
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:41,704
Yes. He's a young kid and
he doesn't have parents.

294
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:45,704
No parents?

295
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:51,071
How old is he?

296
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:53,404
He's in high school.

297
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,737
High school?

298
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:06,438
What was the name of
Kang Hui Su's child again?

299
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:12,537
Gyeong Jun.

300
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:19,603
Hui Su's son's name is Kang Gyeong Jun.

301
00:20:22,637 --> 00:20:26,104
You may not want to be reminded of him,

302
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:31,171
but I have to find him.

303
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:33,537
Do what you will,

304
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:36,271
but I don't want to look for him.

305
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:51,904
Did Yun Jae find him?

306
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:02,404
We've been here a while,
but he's not waking up.

307
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:04,470
Let's go.

308
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:07,104
Gyeong Jun has to wake up if I'm to manage

309
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:11,137
the inheritance Hui Su left for him
with a clear conscience.

310
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,338
Even though Hui Su was a single mother,

311
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:19,371
she sure saved up a lot of money.

312
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,438
She was so different from you.

313
00:21:24,503 --> 00:21:30,204
I just hope I don't end up wasting it all.

314
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:33,237
What are we going to do about our restaurant?

315
00:21:33,237 --> 00:21:36,804
They say he's fine, so
why isn't he waking up?

316
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:39,770
What are we going to do

317
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,438
about our restaurant?

318
00:21:41,937 --> 00:21:44,104
Did you call Yun Jae's mother?

319
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:46,037
She already heard from Lee Se Yeong.

320
00:21:46,037 --> 00:21:48,071
She wants to see me alone tomorrow.

321
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:51,171
She must be angry.

322
00:21:51,737 --> 00:21:54,904
Are you spending the night
at my parents' tonight?

323
00:21:54,904 --> 00:21:55,970
Yeah.

324
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,071
They told me to stay in
your room until you return.

325
00:21:59,071 --> 00:22:00,237
In my room?

326
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,271
Do you want me to stay in Chung Sik's room?

327
00:22:04,338 --> 00:22:08,037
It's strange to be in a room
filled with your things.

328
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:09,204
Why is it strange?

329
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,737
I don't know.

330
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:12,737
The room's very you.

331
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:14,404
It's a bit goofy

332
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:16,037
and silly.

333
00:22:16,037 --> 00:22:17,737
This house, on the other hand,

334
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,870
has nothing that's yours except for the bed.

335
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,937
Right?

336
00:22:20,937 --> 00:22:24,171
My uncle threw out all my things
before he sold the house.

337
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:26,438
It's now filled with Seo Yun Jae's things.

338
00:22:26,937 --> 00:22:28,570
Have you had dinner?

339
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,837
Your mom even brought me

340
00:22:30,837 --> 00:22:32,870
the best wine she had.

341
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,603
She said it was a 20-year-old deodeok wine.

342
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:39,970
That wine is so expensive that
she doesn't even let dad have any.

343
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:41,804
Really?

344
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:43,937
So it'll upset you if
I don't drink this, right?

345
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:45,137
I should throw it out.

346
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:48,104
Throw it out? What a waste.

347
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,870
I can just see you,

348
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,037
drooling at the thought of having the wine.

349
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,603
Have you eaten?

350
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:55,037
I'm about to have cup noodles.

351
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:56,438
Cup noodles?

352
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:58,570
No, don't. That's mine.

353
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,770
But I already poured water into it.
I'll replace it.

354
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,304
You can't have it.

355
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:06,204
But there's nothing else to eat.

356
00:23:06,204 --> 00:23:09,970
I'm about to throw out what
I was given to eat, so wait.

357
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:23,704
I was about to throw this out.
Would you like it?

358
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:40,271
It wasn't easy sneaking out,

359
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,704
and it won't be easy sneaking back in.
Should I just stay here?

360
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:46,670
No way. They'll worry if they see
that you've disappeared.

361
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:50,470
I can eat alone, so you should go.

362
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,470
Now that I've delivered the food,
you want me to go, huh?

363
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,937
Give me money then.

364
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:56,737
Why should I pay you for what my mom made?

365
00:24:57,937 --> 00:25:00,338
I should have just given this
to the dog next door.

366
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,171
20-year-old deodeok wine...

367
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,237
It sure is good.

368
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,237
This wine is older than you are.

369
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:20,137
What?

370
00:25:20,137 --> 00:25:24,071
This is 20 years old. You're 19.

371
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:27,037
I'm going to keep this here
and have a sip of it every day.

372
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:31,438
Are you sure there won't be
any side effects?

373
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:36,537
Your mother said it would
give me stamina.

374
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:40,137
Is that something you want?

375
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:43,338
You watch what you say,
you little nursling.

376
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:46,237
Dear sir,

377
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:48,537
you've come to the wrong place.

378
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:51,870
There's no need for stamina around here.

379
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:55,137
If you get her all hot and bothered,
it'll put me in an awkward position.

380
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:58,804
You seem to be much sought after.
Go back to where you've come from.

381
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:02,004
What are you talking about? Why would
I put you in an awkward position?

382
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:05,271
If you get hot and bothered, I'm not
sure I'll be able to turn you down.

383
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:07,837
I'm just worried, that's all.

384
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:11,137
There's nothing for you to worry about.

385
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:12,338
Go.

386
00:26:14,637 --> 00:26:16,071
So you are worried you might lose control.

387
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:17,804
I'm off.

388
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:28,937
Are you coming with me?

389
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:32,338
No. I'm just seeing you off.

390
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:35,071
Take care and sneak back in quietly.

391
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,137
Yes?

392
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,204
Just tell them you decided to come
home early and pick me up tomorrow.

393
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,503
Tomorrow?

394
00:26:51,503 --> 00:26:53,237
You have to come and get me, okay?

395
00:26:54,304 --> 00:26:55,870
We'll see.

396
00:27:00,837 --> 00:27:02,237
You have to come.

397
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,970
Ms. Lee.

398
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:16,171
Ms. Lee.

399
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:18,870
You can't sleep here.

400
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,071
Please get up. Please.

401
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:30,204
There are no cabs here, so we
need to move to another spot.

402
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:45,104
Na Hyo Sang,

403
00:27:45,104 --> 00:27:49,970
you and I have grown quite close as of late.

404
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:55,271
Let's not end it today.
Let's keep seeing each other.

405
00:27:57,271 --> 00:28:00,304
Say something.

406
00:28:03,037 --> 00:28:07,570
If you want to pole vault, I'll be your pole.

407
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:12,071
If you want to do the long jump,
I'll be your springboard.

408
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:14,304
What do you say?

409
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:19,870
Why are you so quiet?

410
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,737
No?

411
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:26,438
Are you not answering me
because the answer is no?

412
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,937
I'm getting off.

413
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:41,603
Are you okay?

414
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:44,438
You're not mute.

415
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,004
I'm off.

416
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:55,171
Ms. Lee.

417
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:23,603
Strike

418
00:29:23,603 --> 00:29:25,237
out.

419
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,470
She's a bad drunk.

420
00:29:43,171 --> 00:29:47,071
If you get bored, read or listen
to music in my room.

421
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:51,204
Make sure you have breakfast tomorrow
and wait. I'll come and get you.

422
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,904
Integral calculus.

423
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:00,438
She's trying too hard.

424
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,670
Ultimate G-cup.

425
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,704
Gil Chung Sik has quite a collection.

426
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:02,537
Yun Jae,

427
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:04,438
hurry back before

428
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:07,404
I start wanting to be in this body
of yours forever.

429
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:22,570
I didn't

430
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:28,603
even see you when you you were born.

431
00:32:29,704 --> 00:32:34,904
Here I meet you for the first time.

432
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,637
Gyeong Jun.

433
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,304
Wow.

434
00:33:03,304 --> 00:33:05,171
This is cute.

435
00:33:05,603 --> 00:33:07,438
I wonder if they're for sale.

436
00:33:07,438 --> 00:33:10,503
Is your brother-in-law at your place
instead of on his honeymoon?

437
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:11,870
Yup.

438
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,237
But Mary,

439
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:16,338
does it make you that happy that
my sister's alone on her honeymoon?

440
00:33:16,338 --> 00:33:18,670
I'm ecstatic.

441
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,404
The spell actually worked.

442
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:25,071
I'll write off a pizza for a job
well done diverting the evil spirits.

443
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:31,937
I told you to put more thought
into writing off my debt.

444
00:33:34,237 --> 00:33:35,837
Oh, right.

445
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:37,204
Would you like me to get you this then?

446
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:39,537
- Huh?
- I'll get you one.

447
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:41,137
Really?

448
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:42,837
Wow.

449
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:49,503
You promised.

450
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:53,637
Has he not moved since last night?

451
00:33:53,637 --> 00:33:57,137
I was concerned he had fallen off
the bed while I stepped out briefly

452
00:33:57,137 --> 00:34:00,704
that I've been keeping a good eye
on him, but he hasn't moved.

453
00:34:01,404 --> 00:34:04,737
I only stepped out when
a lady came to visit him

454
00:34:04,737 --> 00:34:06,570
last night.

455
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,071
Someone came by?

456
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:09,004
Yes.

457
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:12,371
She seemed to be very rich and cultured.

458
00:34:12,371 --> 00:34:13,804
Gyeong Jun.

459
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:20,537
Gyeong Jun, I heard you moved yesterday.

460
00:34:20,537 --> 00:34:22,570
Are you coming back now?

461
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,438
That's enough.

462
00:34:36,503 --> 00:34:39,438
I'm so glad you're starting to make
your way back to your body.

463
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:41,137
I was actually waiting for you.

464
00:34:41,137 --> 00:34:42,104
You were waiting for me?

465
00:34:42,104 --> 00:34:44,603
Do you know where my uncle's
new restaurant is?

466
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:48,271
This is it, right?

467
00:34:48,271 --> 00:34:49,438
Yeah.

468
00:34:50,537 --> 00:34:52,071
If he hasn't thrown out my furniture,

469
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:54,537
ask him to give them to you.

470
00:34:55,704 --> 00:34:57,438
Okay.

471
00:34:57,438 --> 00:35:01,004
He set this place up exactly
like your mom's restaurant.

472
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,770
Yeah.

473
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,870
Hey.

474
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,271
It's your mom.

475
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,670
This place is so empty.

476
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,737
I had come by once, but the food
was so bad that I never returned.

477
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:31,371
This place is on its way down.

478
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:33,737
Uncle Hyeok Su has always been like this.

479
00:35:40,904 --> 00:35:44,004
It's that doctor.

480
00:35:44,004 --> 00:35:46,338
He's really being blatant now.

481
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:49,304
I bet he's just here to eat.

482
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,470
Does it look like he's here to eat?

483
00:35:53,304 --> 00:35:57,438
It's obvious he's here to see
how our business is doing.

484
00:35:57,804 --> 00:36:01,904
I wonder why Mary's here with him, though.

485
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:04,670
Has she decided to team up with him?

486
00:36:06,104 --> 00:36:08,204
- Hello, sir.
- Shhh.

487
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:14,004
If they ask for us,

488
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:17,338
tell them we're not here, okay?

489
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:18,603
Yes, sir.

490
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,438
They only copied the decor. The food's awful.

491
00:36:27,171 --> 00:36:28,404
Excuse me.

492
00:36:28,404 --> 00:36:29,404
Yes, sir.

493
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:30,837
Is the owner here?

494
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:35,237
He's busy preparing for the launch
of our first branch.

495
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:38,237
When this place is about to go under?

496
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,004
If he wants the branch to do well,

497
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:41,837
have him come talk to us.

498
00:36:43,737 --> 00:36:47,670
He said to give you this and
ask you to come see him.

499
00:36:52,537 --> 00:36:54,071
What is this?

500
00:36:55,404 --> 00:36:56,904
Huh?

501
00:36:56,904 --> 00:37:00,338
This is the Russian chef who used to work

502
00:37:00,338 --> 00:37:02,004
at Hui Su's restaurant in LA.

503
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:06,870
It's that Sergei Malev whatever guy.

504
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,537
But we've been searching
high and low for him.

505
00:37:10,237 --> 00:37:11,670
How does he know where that chef is?

506
00:37:13,904 --> 00:37:15,904
It's good to see you, doctor.

507
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:18,171
Hello, Mary.

508
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,737
I was told you wanted to see me.

509
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:23,637
Do you have Gyeong Jun's things?

510
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:26,970
Yes, I do.

511
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,870
Give them to Mary.

512
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,503
Give Gyeong Jun's things to Mary?

513
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:34,870
I know Gyeong Jun would want me
to hold onto them for him.

514
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,704
But still...

515
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:37,970
In return,

516
00:37:38,737 --> 00:37:42,570
I'll give you the Russian chef's
contact info that Gyeong Jun had.

517
00:37:43,503 --> 00:37:48,338
We've been taking very good care
of Gyeong Jun's personal effects,

518
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:51,570
but

519
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:57,937
we are very curious as to
what Sergei is up to as well,

520
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,670
so it's a deal then?

521
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,837
He's probably still in Korea.

522
00:38:04,837 --> 00:38:08,371
He'll agree to meet with you if you
lure him with top-notch vodka.

523
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,904
Why did they have to keep your
things in the restaurant storage?

524
00:38:14,637 --> 00:38:16,970
It stinks.

525
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,204
I'm just glad they didn't
throw everything out.

526
00:38:20,204 --> 00:38:23,870
I bet he would've given us your things
even without the contact info.

527
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,603
You meant to give him the Russian
chef's number, didn't you?

528
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,937
I can't have him squander
away all my mom's money.

529
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:35,570
He wasn't here to extort money
from us. He came by to help.

530
00:38:36,037 --> 00:38:41,037
Do you think Gyeong Jun's dad
sent him over to help us out?

531
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:43,271
And if that's the case, what do we do?

532
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,071
Just keep our distance

533
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:47,371
or be friendly with him?

534
00:38:47,371 --> 00:38:49,637
Or keep our distance but still be friendly?

535
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:53,004
I have to go somewhere.

536
00:38:53,004 --> 00:38:54,470
Where would you like me to drop you off?

537
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,237
Can't I come with you?

538
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,937
Are you going somewhere fun?

539
00:38:57,937 --> 00:38:58,970
You're not coming with me.

540
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,503
I have to go and see Seo Yun Jae's mother.

541
00:39:02,438 --> 00:39:04,737
I'll wait for you at your place then.

542
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:06,637
I'll help you unpack when you get home.

543
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:08,037
I'm not going home.

544
00:39:08,037 --> 00:39:11,137
I have to wait at Gil Chung Sik's
for Gil Teacher to come and get me.

545
00:39:11,904 --> 00:39:14,904
Is she returning from China today?

546
00:39:14,904 --> 00:39:16,870
Do you have to go home with her?

547
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,037
Yup.

548
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:20,371
She said she'd come and get me if I waited.

549
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:30,870
I heard there's a patient you
canceled your honeymoon for.

550
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:37,737
Yes. He and I were in the same accident.

551
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,937
I heard his name is Kang Gyeong Jun.

552
00:39:40,937 --> 00:39:45,004
Did you know him before the accident?

553
00:39:45,004 --> 00:39:46,904
No.

554
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:51,338
I only came to know him
because of the accident.

555
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:58,071
You're returning to the States soon, right?

556
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:00,770
Yes.

557
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:05,438
There's a lot here that is unsettling.

558
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:09,004
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

559
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:13,271
I hope you can get some peace
of mind once you return.

560
00:40:14,804 --> 00:40:16,371
Yun Jae,

561
00:40:21,438 --> 00:40:23,804
there was someone

562
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:28,037
you've been looking for
for a very long time.

563
00:40:28,537 --> 00:40:30,338
There was?

564
00:40:31,537 --> 00:40:37,171
I didn't want you to find him.

565
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:42,704
I'd hoped you wouldn't recognize him

566
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:47,004
even if he were to show up.

567
00:40:47,004 --> 00:40:49,470
I'm not interested in the past.

568
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,970
No?

569
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,937
Alright then.

570
00:41:04,404 --> 00:41:07,670
Seo Yun Jae was looking for someone?

571
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:10,204
Here you go.

572
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:11,904
Enjoy.

573
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,104
Um...

574
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:17,670
It's you again.

575
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,904
Yes.

576
00:41:22,837 --> 00:41:26,137
Jeong Hye doesn't recognize you, does she?

577
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:29,237
She's still an idiot.

578
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,537
It'd only upset her if she recognized me.

579
00:41:33,537 --> 00:41:36,470
I'm so young and successful.

580
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:40,670
She'll come to regret having married

581
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,737
that decrepit old teacher instead of me,

582
00:41:44,237 --> 00:41:45,503
who's cool and handsome.

583
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,371
I'm sure Min Gyu

584
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:50,470
will come to regret

585
00:41:51,237 --> 00:41:56,870
having married his dumbest student

586
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,171
instead of an intelligent colleague

587
00:41:59,171 --> 00:42:02,737
with whom he could

588
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:04,537
have interesting conversations.

589
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:11,104
We'll just have to let them
both regret their decisions.

590
00:42:12,004 --> 00:42:14,338
- Hon.
- Yes?

591
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:17,970
I might need reading glasses.
How much does it say here?

592
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:21,037
His vision's failing him already.

593
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:25,071
I can read the tiniest letters there are.

594
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:26,470
$21.

595
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,904
3 times 8, which is 21.

596
00:42:28,904 --> 00:42:29,870
$21.

597
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,537
See?

598
00:42:31,537 --> 00:42:34,704
She can't even do multiplication.

599
00:42:34,704 --> 00:42:37,304
Oh, right. 3 times 8 is 24.

600
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,637
Oh, boy.

601
00:42:41,537 --> 00:42:42,970
I charged them less.

602
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,637
That's okay. We'll just sell more dumplings.

603
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:48,237
I'll work extra hard.

604
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:49,570
Sounds good.

605
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:56,770
I'm sure he keeps his regrets
bottled up inside.

606
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,737
That's right.

607
00:43:00,271 --> 00:43:02,304
I'm sure she's regretting it, too.

608
00:43:05,438 --> 00:43:07,637
So Dr. Seo was here last night...

609
00:43:07,637 --> 00:43:09,204
Yeah, because this is my sister's room.

610
00:43:09,204 --> 00:43:11,470
Yun Jae's family now.

611
00:43:12,271 --> 00:43:15,204
Gyeong Jun will be my family.

612
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,937
Why would he wait here?

613
00:43:19,937 --> 00:43:22,004
Does he like it here?

614
00:43:24,037 --> 00:43:26,271
You haven't thrown those out yet?

615
00:43:31,104 --> 00:43:33,737
Please don't get the wrong idea.

616
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:35,637
These are my sister's.

617
00:43:35,637 --> 00:43:38,237
They're in her room after all.

618
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:41,438
What are those?

619
00:43:41,438 --> 00:43:43,404
My sister's.

620
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,371
See?

621
00:43:45,371 --> 00:43:47,770
It's my sister and Yun Jae.

622
00:43:48,204 --> 00:43:51,338
Your sister must really love Dr. Seo.

623
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:52,470
Of course.

624
00:43:52,937 --> 00:43:54,304
Let's take this over to them.

625
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:58,071
No matter how much you wanted to go to China,

626
00:43:58,071 --> 00:44:00,338
how could you just take off alone?

627
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,071
That's why I came right back.

628
00:44:02,071 --> 00:44:04,004
You must have missed him.

629
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,670
Yes.

630
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:09,404
He stepped out. You two go
on home when he gets back.

631
00:44:09,404 --> 00:44:10,837
- I'll be at the restaurant.
- Okay.

632
00:44:10,837 --> 00:44:12,137
See you, mom.

633
00:44:12,137 --> 00:44:13,137
Da Ran,

634
00:44:13,137 --> 00:44:14,304
you're back.

635
00:44:14,304 --> 00:44:15,470
What about gifts?

636
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,204
I saw someone who looked exactly
like you at the dry sauna.

637
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:18,837
It's Chinese tea. Put it
aways in the kitchen.

638
00:44:18,837 --> 00:44:19,937
- Tea?
- Yup.

639
00:44:19,937 --> 00:44:21,137
Just tea?

640
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,470
Ms. Gil,

641
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,770
Gyeong Jun went to see Dr. Seo's mother.

642
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:30,670
Really?

643
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,937
Gyeong Jun says it's uncomfortable
seeing his mother.

644
00:44:35,904 --> 00:44:39,404
That means he should feel
uncomfortable here, too.

645
00:44:39,404 --> 00:44:41,537
They're all fake family.

646
00:44:41,537 --> 00:44:43,970
But I'm going to be his real family.

647
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:49,071
This is Dr. Seo's.

648
00:44:49,071 --> 00:44:50,304
Huh?

649
00:44:50,304 --> 00:44:53,603
You need to keep it by his side
so that you doesn't get confused.

650
00:44:56,338 --> 00:44:58,004
I'm on my way.

651
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,004
You've come to get me already?

652
00:45:00,004 --> 00:45:01,071
Yeah.

653
00:45:01,071 --> 00:45:03,438
You don't have to come here though.

654
00:45:03,438 --> 00:45:05,204
Just go straight to your place.

655
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:06,870
Are you sure?

656
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,670
Are you coming right over, too?

657
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,171
Yeah.

658
00:45:22,404 --> 00:45:25,137
I had all these in here.

659
00:45:25,137 --> 00:45:27,438
I had forgotten about them.

660
00:45:35,104 --> 00:45:38,204
Was it uncomfortable at my parents'?

661
00:45:42,004 --> 00:45:45,904
Oh, these? I had left them in my room.

662
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,171
These are what you had
gone to your place for?

663
00:45:50,171 --> 00:45:51,503
What's that?

664
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:55,404
My things. I got them from Uncle Hyeok Su.

665
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,503
I need to put my things away,

666
00:45:58,503 --> 00:46:01,603
so take Seo Yun Jae's stuff to your room.

667
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:05,371
There's not much. Couldn't we
just leave them in your room?

668
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:07,870
I put them away neatly.

669
00:46:20,171 --> 00:46:22,404
There's no room for my things.

670
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,171
Seo Yun Jae's.

671
00:46:26,737 --> 00:46:29,071
Seo Yun Jae's. Seo Yun Jae's.

672
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:30,438
This is also Seo Yun Jae's.

673
00:46:30,438 --> 00:46:31,904
And this is also Seo Yun Jae's.

674
00:46:33,271 --> 00:46:35,171
Seo Yun Jae's.

675
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:38,503
I had put them away neatly.
Why are you bringing them here?

676
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:42,204
You keep Seo Yun Jae's.
I need room for my things.

677
00:46:42,204 --> 00:46:43,937
Be careful, will you?

678
00:46:54,837 --> 00:46:56,137
It's broken.

679
00:46:56,137 --> 00:46:58,204
It was broken to begin with.

680
00:46:58,204 --> 00:46:59,171
How do you know?

681
00:46:59,171 --> 00:47:02,338
It wasn't working when I tried
to listen to it in your room.

682
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:04,470
Why are you blaming me
for something I didn't do?

683
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:05,537
You went through this box?

684
00:47:05,537 --> 00:47:07,603
You told me to read and listen to things.

685
00:47:09,304 --> 00:47:11,438
What am I going to do? This is Yun Jae's.

686
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:13,438
Who told you to keep that
brick-like ancient artifact?

687
00:47:13,438 --> 00:47:15,404
Do you really think he'll be using that
even if he wakes up?

688
00:47:15,404 --> 00:47:17,704
Yun Jae said this was
something important to him.

689
00:47:17,704 --> 00:47:20,438
He lent it to me to record my classes.

690
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:22,603
I doubt it helped you with your studies.

691
00:47:22,603 --> 00:47:23,970
It did help a lot.

692
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,737
It made me study harder
so I could make him proud.

693
00:47:27,204 --> 00:47:29,338
Yun Jae's something else.

694
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:31,071
He makes you cry, laugh, and study hard.

695
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,438
You're something else, too.

696
00:47:33,438 --> 00:47:35,104
Why do you keep going back and forth,
confusing me to no end?

697
00:47:35,104 --> 00:47:39,237
Let's keep our distance so
we don't confuse each other.

698
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:44,670
Are you being a brat because
you had to be at my parents'

699
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,670
when you didn't want to be?

700
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:50,304
But you said you had a good time
with my family.

701
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:53,570
All the more reason to keep my distance
to keep from getting confused.

702
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,770
It's not me who's going to be
part of your family anyway.

703
00:49:21,237 --> 00:49:23,171
Let's eat, Gyeong Jun.

704
00:49:24,271 --> 00:49:25,603
I'm all set.

705
00:49:36,637 --> 00:49:37,837
Gyeong Jun,

706
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:39,570
would you like some of this?

707
00:49:42,704 --> 00:49:44,271
Nope.

708
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:59,237
Gyeong Jun, you need to water the lawn.

709
00:49:59,237 --> 00:50:00,870
It'll rain eventually.

710
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,770
He's not coming out of his room.

711
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,237
Gyeong Jun.

712
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,004
Gyeong Jun.

713
00:50:18,904 --> 00:50:20,637
Has he stepped out?

714
00:50:32,637 --> 00:50:33,837
Hey,

715
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:40,837
thanks for your help with
my paper for the seminar.

716
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:44,438
I only helped out to see where I stood.

717
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:48,570
You seem better now.
Aren't you returning to work?

718
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:50,537
Are you planning to set up
your own practice by any chance?

719
00:50:50,537 --> 00:50:53,171
I still have a mountain to climb.

720
00:50:53,171 --> 00:50:54,904
What is it?

721
00:50:54,904 --> 00:50:57,104
Let me help you.

722
00:50:58,637 --> 00:51:01,137
Will you co-sign a loan?

723
00:51:01,537 --> 00:51:06,371
In any case, thanks a lot for your help.

724
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:07,804
Oh, right.

725
00:51:07,804 --> 00:51:10,171
These are very expensive tickets.

726
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:12,271
Enjoy the show with Da Ran.

727
00:51:12,704 --> 00:51:13,670
I've got to run.

728
00:51:21,271 --> 00:51:22,171
It's very hot today, isn't it?

729
00:51:22,171 --> 00:51:24,004
- This will cool you down a bit.
- Thank you.

730
00:51:24,004 --> 00:51:25,137
Thank you.

731
00:51:25,137 --> 00:51:26,338
Thank you.

732
00:51:27,438 --> 00:51:28,804
It's hot out, isn't it?

733
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,637
Thank you.

734
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:34,670
Vice Principal Kim.

735
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:38,137
Remember how you said you wanted
to set me up with someone?

736
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:40,804
I'm very interested.

737
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:45,371
Aren't you seeing someone?

738
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,304
Oh, no. We're not dating.

739
00:51:49,304 --> 00:51:50,937
Right?

740
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,603
We're definitely not dating.

741
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:56,637
See?

742
00:51:56,637 --> 00:51:59,503
Please set me up, Vice Principal Kim.

743
00:51:59,503 --> 00:52:01,470
Should I set a time and place?

744
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:07,904
Yes.

745
00:52:34,804 --> 00:52:36,438
Mary,

746
00:52:36,438 --> 00:52:38,237
look what I have on.

747
00:52:40,937 --> 00:52:44,804
I got you something too.

748
00:52:47,204 --> 00:52:48,770
Would you like to watch a movie?

749
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:51,004
Yes.

750
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:55,438
Hey!

751
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,204
How can you run off just with the tickets?

752
00:52:57,204 --> 00:52:59,104
What about me?

753
00:53:06,304 --> 00:53:07,804
Here.

754
00:53:08,204 --> 00:53:09,637
No.

755
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:14,304
How about these?

756
00:53:14,304 --> 00:53:17,970
I don't want to play with you.

757
00:53:20,237 --> 00:53:22,171
Are you playing hard to get, Teddy Bear?

758
00:53:22,171 --> 00:53:23,770
Why don't you play with her?

759
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:26,304
This is too childish.

760
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,537
But you're a child.

761
00:53:33,603 --> 00:53:34,537
What?

762
00:53:34,537 --> 00:53:36,603
Can you get bread on your way home?

763
00:53:36,603 --> 00:53:38,104
I'll make you pizza bread.

764
00:53:38,904 --> 00:53:41,237
No. I'm all set.

765
00:53:42,237 --> 00:53:44,970
I'm fine. I don't want any.

766
00:53:49,804 --> 00:53:51,171
What?

767
00:53:51,171 --> 00:53:53,904
Why are you being like that?
You're an adult.

768
00:53:53,904 --> 00:53:56,237
You're one smart Teddy Bear.

769
00:53:56,237 --> 00:53:59,037
That's right. I'm just
as childish as you are.

770
00:53:59,037 --> 00:54:02,271
These are for you, doctor.

771
00:54:06,338 --> 00:54:08,304
I should go and get bread.

772
00:54:19,204 --> 00:54:22,438
That's my stuff. She did my laundry.

773
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,837
Good grief.

774
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:55,937
Integral calculus? I got that down eons ago.

775
00:54:55,937 --> 00:54:57,537
How cute.

776
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,470
I saw you did my laundry.

777
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,837
Your clothes need to be clean
if you're going to put them away.

778
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:09,637
You went through my things
without my permission.

779
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:11,737
Where are you?

780
00:55:11,737 --> 00:55:13,503
The bakery.

781
00:55:13,503 --> 00:55:14,970
The bakery?

782
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:17,171
But I got bread.

783
00:55:17,537 --> 00:55:19,537
You did?

784
00:55:19,537 --> 00:55:22,670
But you said you weren't going to.

785
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:24,071
Gil Teacher,

786
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,271
this is the last day of your vacation, right?

787
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:27,670
Yeah.

788
00:55:32,137 --> 00:55:34,704
I'm throwing something out
and leaving it under the bread.

789
00:55:34,704 --> 00:55:37,438
Check it out when you get back.

790
00:55:50,537 --> 00:55:53,438
It's something I'm getting rid of,

791
00:55:53,438 --> 00:55:56,570
so if she decides to use it,
there's nothing I can do about it.

792
00:56:13,438 --> 00:56:15,237
Can you fix this?

793
00:56:15,804 --> 00:56:17,937
It'll cost you more than
what this thing's worth.

794
00:56:18,704 --> 00:56:20,204
That's fine.

795
00:56:42,404 --> 00:56:45,404
Why did he leave this here?

796
00:56:45,904 --> 00:56:49,438
It would go to waste if I don't go.

797
00:56:59,204 --> 00:57:01,304
I'll ask Gyeong Jun to come with me.

798
00:57:07,037 --> 00:57:08,937
These are Gyeong Jun's clothes.

799
00:57:11,104 --> 00:57:13,438
Are you going somewhere?

800
00:57:13,438 --> 00:57:14,970
Gyeong Jun's inside, right?

801
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,637
No, he's not.

802
00:57:16,637 --> 00:57:18,904
We're meeting up soon.

803
00:57:18,904 --> 00:57:20,537
Where?

804
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:23,137
It's my last day of vacation,
so we're seeing this together.

805
00:57:23,137 --> 00:57:24,204
Oh?

806
00:57:24,204 --> 00:57:25,737
Ms. Gil,

807
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:27,438
can't I go in your place?

808
00:57:29,104 --> 00:57:32,603
I'll go with Gyeong Jun.
You can watch this instead.

809
00:57:33,804 --> 00:57:38,137
You don't have do this
as a part of your cover-up act.

810
00:57:38,137 --> 00:57:40,837
Do you actually want to go with Gyeong Jun?

811
00:57:42,603 --> 00:57:46,004
It'll probably more fun for him
if you went with him.

812
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,171
Thank you, Ms. Gil.

813
00:57:47,171 --> 00:57:49,404
You really seem like a nice person.

814
00:58:44,204 --> 00:58:46,004
I'm returning to the States tomorrow.

815
00:58:46,004 --> 00:58:48,171
If Hui Su's dead, he's all alone.

816
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:50,770
How does that have anything to do with me?

817
00:58:51,637 --> 00:58:53,537
He's

818
00:58:53,537 --> 00:58:56,104
not my son.

819
00:58:57,237 --> 00:59:00,438
Yun Jae is my only son.

820
00:59:00,438 --> 00:59:02,404
He was only born

821
00:59:02,404 --> 00:59:05,904
to save our Yun Jae.

822
00:59:05,904 --> 00:59:08,237
I don't know any child

823
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,937
named Kang Gyeong Jun.

824
00:59:21,371 --> 00:59:22,603
Gyeong Jun.

825
00:59:25,237 --> 00:59:26,204
Why are you here?

826
00:59:26,204 --> 00:59:29,470
Ms. Gil gave it to me so that
I could watch it with you.

827
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,704
She gave it to you?

828
00:59:32,704 --> 00:59:36,037
I gave Ms. Gil the movie tickets
Gil Chung Sik gave me though.

829
00:59:36,037 --> 00:59:36,937
Let's go.

830
00:59:36,937 --> 00:59:38,004
I'm all set.

831
00:59:38,004 --> 00:59:40,137
You're not going to watch it with me?

832
00:59:40,137 --> 00:59:41,071
No.

833
00:59:41,071 --> 00:59:44,037
It's not something I wanted to see anyway.

834
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,870
So

835
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:49,704
this was something you wanted
to do with Ms. Gil alone?

836
00:59:50,438 --> 00:59:53,737
I ruined her vacation and broke this.

837
00:59:53,737 --> 00:59:55,737
I didn't want to say sorry,

838
00:59:55,737 --> 00:59:57,670
but I wanted to make up with her.

839
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,537
But then you had to butt in.

840
01:00:00,371 --> 01:00:02,371
Don't make up with her.

841
01:00:02,371 --> 01:00:04,237
She can deal with it.

842
01:00:04,237 --> 01:00:06,037
She's an adult.

843
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,371
I can't be a brat like Teddy Bear.

844
01:00:09,837 --> 01:00:10,904
I'm off.

845
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,304
Gyeong Jun,

846
01:00:19,304 --> 01:00:21,137
don't tell me

847
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:24,904
you still like Ms. Gil...

848
01:00:43,204 --> 01:00:46,704
It's not like I really wanted
to see that show,

849
01:00:46,704 --> 01:00:49,603
so I don't get why I'm so upset.

850
01:00:51,438 --> 01:00:53,704
Is it because I can't spend time
with Gyeong Jun?

851
01:01:07,104 --> 01:01:08,704
Gyeong Jun.

852
01:01:09,304 --> 01:01:12,570
This isn't the ticket I threw out.

853
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:17,470
Are you happy to see me?

854
01:01:19,004 --> 01:01:21,404
No? Should I go?

855
01:01:24,204 --> 01:01:26,137
Alright. I'll stay.

856
01:01:30,737 --> 01:01:33,371
This movie's gory, right?

857
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,904
It's not my kind of movie then.

858
01:01:40,104 --> 01:01:41,670
I got this fixed.

859
01:01:43,037 --> 01:01:44,670
You did?

860
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:50,071
The lecture sounds exciting.

861
01:02:28,271 --> 01:02:30,071
What's wrong?

862
01:02:31,637 --> 01:02:33,371
I'm happy.

863
01:02:34,037 --> 01:02:35,837
I'm just happy, that's all.

864
01:02:40,137 --> 01:02:41,670
It's a good thing I got it fixed then.

865
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,338
Gyeong Jun,

866
01:02:57,537 --> 01:02:59,670
something's wrong with me.

867
01:03:00,637 --> 01:03:05,338
I don't know why I'm so happy to see you.

868
01:03:44,937 --> 01:03:46,204
[Big]

869
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:51,037
Does this mean Kang Gyeong Jun
is a son they abandoned?

870
01:03:51,037 --> 01:03:55,603
If you like someone 80%,
there's only 20% to go, right?

871
01:03:55,603 --> 01:03:58,371
Could you run a paternity test for me ASAP?

872
01:03:58,371 --> 01:04:02,271
Scold him if he says he likes
the way things are.

873
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,870
Tell him he has to return to his own body.

874
01:04:05,603 --> 01:04:07,637
My heart's beating.

875
01:04:07,637 --> 01:04:08,603
What's wrong with me?

876
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:11,804
Do you remember that you were
looking for someone?

877
01:04:11,804 --> 01:04:15,071
I found that person.

878
01:04:15,071 --> 01:04:16,171
Gyeong Jun.

879
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:19,737
His body moved again.

880
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:23,037
Will Gyeong Jun be leaving?
