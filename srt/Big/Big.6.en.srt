[Episode 6]

2
00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:26,470
I'm sorry I'm late.

3
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,470
Hurry over.

4
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,171
Congrats on passing the exam.

5
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:32,171
- Congrats.
- Ready.

00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:34,404

[Gil Da Ran]
Meal ticket please.

8
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:37,770
The groom's friends are amazing.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,870
We have to go to the post-wedding bash.

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,904
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

11
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:44,071
Who cares about food?

12
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:48,637
Look at the groom's friends. They're so hot.

13
00:00:48,637 --> 00:00:52,404
I didn't have breakfast.
I'm starving. I'm going.

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,037
Huh?

15
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:58,204
Is that Yun Jae?

16
00:01:20,503 --> 00:01:22,503
Gyeong Jun.

17
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:27,637
Kang Gyeong Jun.

18
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,537
Yun Jae?

19
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,670
Ms. Gil Da Ran,

20
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,637
long time no see.

21
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:08,004
Are you getting in?

22
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:10,404
Pardon?

23
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:12,037
Um... Yes.

24
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:22,670
You're Gyeong Jun, right?

25
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,338
You confused me.

26
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:26,837
Did you pretend to be Yun Jae,
because there are other people here?

27
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:29,237
Why didn't you call or write me?

28
00:02:29,237 --> 00:02:32,537
When did you return to Seoul?
And why are you here?

29
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:35,204
Because my friend's getting married.

30
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,271
Is that you, Yun Jae?

31
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:45,970
It's only been a year,
but you've really aged.

32
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,037
I see a lot of fine lines.

33
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:50,404
You're not that pretty anymore.

34
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,037
So it is you, Gyeong Jun.

35
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:57,837
I fell for you the first time I saw you,
because you were so pretty.

36
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:00,870
Yun Jae?

37
00:03:01,737 --> 00:03:06,371
I must have changed a lot.
You don't recognize me.

38
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:16,204
I threw you for a loop.

39
00:03:20,603 --> 00:03:22,371
It's Kang Gyeong Jun.

40
00:03:27,237 --> 00:03:29,237
Da Ran. Da Ran.

41
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:31,704
Da Ran, guess who I saw?

42
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:33,570
I think I saw Yun Jae.

43
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:36,438
Do you think he's back?

44
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:37,970
Yeah...

45
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:41,137
You must have seen him, too.

46
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:47,104
There he is.

47
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,470
He's changed a lot.

48
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,904
Yeah.

49
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:54,670
He's become devastatingly more handsome.

50
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,104
He's looking this way.

51
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:03,870
Are you okay, Da Ran?

52
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,870
I'm fine. Hold on.

53
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:12,704
She must still have feelings for him.

54
00:04:18,503 --> 00:04:20,470
You're Kang Gyeong Jun, right?

55
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,970
You must have been really confused.

56
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,937
You used to know when to shoot
your love beams and when not to.

57
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:29,937
I was so worried about you.
It's good to see you.

58
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,271
Let me see you. Have you been well?

59
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:35,104
Yes. Apart from the fact
that I'm still in this body,

60
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,338
I'm doing well.

61
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:42,870
I didn't think it would last this long.

62
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:46,371
This place is teeming with friends
of you and Seo Yun Jae.

63
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,870
Is it okay for us to to be this friendly?

64
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:57,537
You used to cajole me into playing
your precious Yun Jae.

65
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:00,937
You must have forgotten what
transpired between you and him.

66
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,804
To me, you're Gyeong Jun,

67
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,404
but to everyone else, you're Yun Jae...

68
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:09,804
What are we going to do?

69
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:12,603
They're watching the couple
that broke off their wedding.

70
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,204
In a situation like this,

71
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:18,570
the person who gets up first
gets the upper hand, right?

72
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,804
Yes.

73
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:22,371
To avoid any one of us looking pathetic,

74
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:25,037
I'll count to 3, and we'll get up together.

75
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:26,271
Okay?

76
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:28,637
1, 2...

77
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:29,804
3.

78
00:05:44,004 --> 00:05:45,870
- Are you okay, Da Ran?
- I'm fine.

79
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,204
- What's going on?
- What happened?

80
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:48,338
It's nothing.

81
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:50,570
- Did he dump you again?
- Um... No...

82
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,104
You're okay, right?

83
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:54,670
It's not that...

84
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:07,904
I'm counting to 3.

85
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:09,937
1...

86
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,970
You're not getting up?

87
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,338
2...

88
00:06:14,338 --> 00:06:15,970
This is your last chance.

89
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:18,737
3.

90
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:22,804
Let's go.

91
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:23,937
Oh my goodness.

92
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:25,537
Da Ran.

93
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:38,204
What a relief. I would've
been so humiliated.

94
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:39,404
You're relieved?

95
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:43,271
Of course. I was the talk of the town
when we called off the wedding.

96
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,804
Now, they'll be gossiping about
how we might be back together.

97
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,670
Get with the program.

98
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,603
The moment we got up together at
the count of 3, we got back together.

99
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:56,570
You came with me, holding my hand.

100
00:06:57,404 --> 00:06:59,837
Oh, right.

101
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:02,870
It didn't occur to me.

102
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,404
You showed up out of the blue
and caught me off guard.

103
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:09,804
Why did you show up here
of all places anyway?

104
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,870
To get you back.

105
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,704
- Me?
- Yup.

106
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:16,371
Something's come up. I need you.

107
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,470
What's come up?

108
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,271
Yun Jae's mother wants me to get married.

109
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:27,171
I'd be grateful if you could
stay by Yun Jae's side.

110
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:31,171
I just don't get why he's being
so cold though.

111
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:34,804
I have to win him over again.

112
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:37,704
You've known him since college.

113
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:40,737
Please be more aggressive and win him over.

114
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:43,637
I'm sorry to be asking so much of you.

115
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:47,104
When Yun Jae said he was getting married,
I pretended to okay with it.

116
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:51,371
Frankly, I regret it.

117
00:07:52,737 --> 00:08:00,338
I don't want him to slip
through my fingers again.

118
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:02,870
Yun Jae's mother keeps pushing me
to see Lee Se Yeong.

119
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,371
She thinks I'll return to being the old
Yun Jae if things go well with her.

120
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:09,737
I'm in a bind.

121
00:08:09,737 --> 00:08:13,004
Yun Jae's mother doesn't know

122
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:16,737
you're but an 18-year-old nursling,

123
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:19,071
so of course she wants you to get married.

124
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,904
Correction.

125
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:27,870
I'm a 19-year-old nursling.

126
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,371
What a pickle.

127
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:32,371
That's why I've come to get you back.

128
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:34,537
Me? Why?

129
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:36,937
You're the only one who
knows who I really am.

130
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:40,904
So if I have to get married,
it has to be with you.

131
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:46,004
Don't tell me you still like me...

132
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:48,071
Things have changed.

133
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:49,371
I was very young then.

134
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,071
You're still young.

135
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:53,904
I'm not proposing that we really get married.

136
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:56,470
Remember how I played
the part of your fiance?

137
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,970
This time, you can help me out

138
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,603
so that Yun Jae's mother
doesn't try to set me up

139
00:09:01,603 --> 00:09:03,204
with Se Yeong or any other woman.

140
00:09:03,204 --> 00:09:05,904
No. I can't.

141
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,304
There are too many people here.

142
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,304
Let's continue this discussion
somewhere more private.

143
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:12,404
Are you serious?

144
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:14,338
- Really?
- No way.

145
00:09:22,304 --> 00:09:25,204
Why are you back? Go.

146
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:26,470
Geez.

147
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,237
Da Ran, where are you going?

148
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,737
He said he'd drop me off.

149
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,371
Don't get the wrong idea, though.

150
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,104
What's going on?

151
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:56,603
You little twerp.

152
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:59,470
Showing up at the wedding
was part of your scheme.

153
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,271
I told you I've come to get you back.

154
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:04,237
You never listen to me.

155
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,404
You need to see girls your age.

156
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:10,870
In this body? Wouldn't that be a crime?

157
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,804
I suppose I wouldn't have to
get married if I went to jail.

158
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:15,837
That's not what I meant.

159
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,737
What are we going to do?

160
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:21,904
See? You're the only way out of this.

161
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:23,970
I still can't help you.

162
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,670
You have no idea how difficult
it was for me to get over Yun Jae.

163
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,071
I can't keep being reminded of him again.

164
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:34,404
Do you still love him?

165
00:10:35,204 --> 00:10:38,104
Does it still pain you to see this face?

166
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,137
It's a wrap for today. Get off.

167
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:56,004
In any case, I can't help you.

168
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:59,770
But you're welcome to call
if you need help with anything else.

169
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,470
After all, I'm the only one who knows
you're Kang Gyeong Jun,

170
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,503
not Seo Yun Jae.

171
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:05,171
How's the dumpling business?

172
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:09,970
You can't do what you did
at the wedding with my family.

173
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,503
You're Seo Yun Jae,
the guy who broke my heart,

174
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:17,171
so if they see you, they'll
mince you into meat stuffing.

175
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,770
Gil Teacher,

176
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,737
call me by my name.

177
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:24,737
Kang Gyeong Jun. Kang Gyeong Jun.
Kang Gyeong Jun.

178
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:27,004
That's good. Get off.

179
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:29,637
Bye, Gyeong Jun.

180
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,970
I missed you.

181
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,770
You're the only person who
calls me "Kang Gyeong Jun."

182
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,570
Have some more. Vitamins are good for you.

183
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,037
I'm back.

184
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:06,037
- Hi.
- Hey.

185
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:07,438
Did you have a good time at the wedding?

186
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:08,804
Yes.

187
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,970
Da Ran must be doing a lot better.

188
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,071
She's started seeing her friends again.

189
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:18,271
That's good.

190
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:22,037
She'd be a fool not to get over
that irresponsible jerk.

191
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,904
Should we set her up with someone?

192
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:28,937
After she passed the exam,
many people seem interested.

193
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:32,503
Bring it up with her when you can.

194
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,837
My only condition is that the guy's
family name is not Seo.

195
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:40,171
I never want to hear that name again.

196
00:13:55,237 --> 00:13:56,837
Have you fully recovered?

197
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,570
Not fully, but I'm a lot better.

198
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:02,271
So you're coming back to work?

199
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:04,670
Soon.

200
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:13,537
I'm almost ready.

201
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:16,371
I'll be ready soon.

202
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,537
Doctor, the patient in room 802
is hemorrhaging.

203
00:14:20,537 --> 00:14:21,870
I have to go.

204
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:29,304
I have the knowledge, but I still
can't stand the sight of blood.

205
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:46,004
Mister,

206
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:52,804
you're really back.

207
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,603
Yes, I am.

208
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:57,104
I shared classified intel with you,

209
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,438
so you need to give me
intel about Gyeong Jun.

210
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:10,438
Gyeong Jun wet his bed until he was 7.

211
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:12,737
Really?

212
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:15,104
That's so cute.

213
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,537
First kiss was not with Amy.
Confirmed by Amy.

214
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,670
Did not date Sally.

215
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,104
Taught Sally a lesson
for spreading a false rumor.

216
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,537
Why don't you put that kind
of effort into school?

217
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,570
Do you even go to school?

218
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,870
I have to be here in Korea
to stay by Gyeong Jun's side,

219
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,371
so I'm putting up with going to school here.

220
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,770
Do you like Gyeong Jun that much?

221
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:52,371
Gyeong Jun lost his beloved mother

222
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:56,304
because of my love for him.

223
00:15:56,304 --> 00:15:58,470
That's why

224
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,870
I've decided never to stop loving him.

225
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:08,104
Wouldn't most people give up
given the extenuating circumstances?

226
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:10,137
That's what traitors do.

227
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,271
I'm going to keep loving him

228
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,804
and become the person he holds most dear.

229
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:21,470
So your love for Gyeong Jun

230
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,570
is a form of loyalty, isn't it?

231
00:16:24,904 --> 00:16:29,737
You seem to share a very
special bond with Gyeong Jun.

232
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:35,271
Are you his father by any chance?

233
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:39,670
No way.

234
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,570
Seo Yun Jae's only 12 years older.

235
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,670
Seo Yun Jae would have...

236
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,371
Never mind.

237
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:50,970
Mary, you never make any sense.

238
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:02,271
That doctor isn't Gyeong Jun's father,

239
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,171
so who can he be?

240
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:07,338
He brought up the inheritance. He's a
relative on Gyeong Jun's father's side.

241
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:09,503
He wants a cut of it.

242
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:15,470
Gyeong Jun's birthday's coming up.
Do you think he'll wake up by then?

243
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,670
Maybe the doctor is Gyeong Jun's uncle.

244
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:23,637
There's no way we'll know
until he wakes up though.

245
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:26,338
There's nothing wrong with him,
so how can he be in a coma for a year?

246
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,037
If he doesn't wake up, how will
we collect his inheritance?

247
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:31,104
I'm sure it's a sizable sum.

248
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,904
If I could open a few more
restaurants with that money,

249
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:38,004
I'd take great care of Gyeong Jun
for the rest of his life.

250
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:49,004
Huh?

251
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:57,204
Why are you here? Go.

252
00:17:57,204 --> 00:17:59,470
You go.

253
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:04,338
Where are you going?

254
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:07,137
Is it wrong of me to want to
see my old school?

255
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:08,404
Geez.

256
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,404
- Hang on.
- Huh?

257
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,970
Yun Jae...

258
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,104
Is that...

259
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:21,770
That's Da Ran's ex-fiance.

260
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,870
What's going on?

261
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,204
You go ahead.

262
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:34,704
Kang Gyeong Jun's been
put on extended leave.

263
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:39,304
How many days does he have to make up
to avoid being held back a year?

264
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:43,637
Hold on.

265
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:48,338
Yun Jae isn't here to see you?

266
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:50,104
Didn't you say you guys
talked things through?

267
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:53,104
Don't worry. Plus, what's there
to talk through anyway?

268
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:55,004
- Are you sure?
- Please take good care

269
00:18:55,004 --> 00:19:02,037
of Kang Gyeong Jun so that he can
return to us sound and healthy.

270
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:04,304
Excuse me.

271
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:07,904
You are

272
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:15,071
Ms. Gil Da Ran's ex-fiance, right?

273
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,304
You came by here a few times.

274
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:19,804
- Yes.
- Oh...

275
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:23,570
I was confused, because you didn't
seem to acknowledge her.

276
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,338
Oh...

277
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,870
It's not that I wanted to ignore her.

278
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,937
She told me to act like we're strangers.

279
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:33,603
Ms. Gil asked you to do that?

280
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,603
I see.

281
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:46,271
But then again, I'm sure she was very hurt.

282
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:50,470
It was me who was more hurt.

283
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:53,837
I don't think you know what really happened.

284
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:56,737
Ms. Gil was the one who
called off the wedding.

285
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:01,104
I had much to work to do
to become a better man.

286
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:03,537
Although I'm back new and improved,

287
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:08,470
she turned down my proposal again,
saying it was the funniest thing

288
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,770
since "Dumb and Dumber."

289
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,037
I see.

290
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:18,503
What's "Dumb and Dumber" anyway?

291
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:19,737
I should get going.

292
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:21,438
Of course.

293
00:20:30,204 --> 00:20:31,737
Bye.

294
00:20:31,737 --> 00:20:33,438
Bye.

295
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:44,570
Ms. Gil wasn't dumped? She did the dumping?

296
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,770
But why?

297
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,637
I don't know. This is news to me, too.

298
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:50,137
Kang Gyeong Jun!

299
00:20:57,904 --> 00:20:59,338
What are you doing?

300
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:02,970
Checking your registration status
was just a front, wasn't it?

301
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,438
Yup.

302
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:07,104
You've gotten smarter.

303
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,904
Did word go around that it was you
who had been dumped by Seo Yun Jae?

304
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,503
That doesn't concern you.

305
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:17,937
I have to build you up for
when we get back together.

306
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:28,537
Why are you so stubborn?

307
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,071
Let's eat first.

308
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,503
You need to eat if you're to go up
against Seo Yun Jae's mother.

309
00:21:32,503 --> 00:21:34,004
Why would I see her?

310
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:35,271
I asked you for your help.

311
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:37,071
We need to get back together.

312
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:39,204
And I said no.

313
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:42,404
What am I supposed to say
to Yun Jae's mother?

314
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:45,770
She won't be your mother-in-law
anyway, so what do you care?

315
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,037
Say whatever you want to.

316
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:48,937
Tell her you want her son.

317
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:51,637
Mind your manners. You're just a kid.

318
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:03,071
I'm not a kid in anyone's eyes but yours.

319
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,338
Be careful.

320
00:22:04,338 --> 00:22:05,837
They might drag you to the funny house.

321
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:09,470
That's why you need to reason
with Yun Jae's mother.

322
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,804
She won't listen to me.

323
00:22:10,804 --> 00:22:12,104
Then go against her wishes.

324
00:22:12,104 --> 00:22:17,438
That's not easy. I'm living
in her son's body.

325
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,870
I suppose it can't be easy for you.

326
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:29,470
Honestly, it didn't sit well with me that
I sent you off with Yun Jae's mom.

327
00:22:30,603 --> 00:22:34,304
Your just a nursling after all.

328
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:41,338
Why's your stuff still at the house?

329
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:44,470
They said I wouldn't even get
half of what I paid for,

330
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,470
so I kept them there for when
I eventually move out on my own.

331
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,037
This works out well.

332
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:53,171
Since your stuff is still there,
we can play newlyweds at that house.

333
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,804
It's a great excuse.

334
00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:56,737
No!

335
00:22:58,237 --> 00:23:00,104
Then move your things out right away.

336
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:03,404
I can't help you. Move everything
out before I return home.

337
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:14,870
By the end of the day?

338
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,870
He's become so mean.

339
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,470
Do you have to stay at that house?

340
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:31,503
If you want to stay there, would you
like me to move in with you?

341
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:34,371
I'd rather stay alone.

342
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:39,171
I don't know what happened that my own
son feels uncomfortable living with me.

343
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,204
I'm sorry.

344
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:43,704
Will you be returning to the hospital?

345
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:48,438
I've worked hard to fill in the gaps,
so I should start working again.

346
00:23:48,438 --> 00:23:54,037
Then you should hang out
with your old friends,

347
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:57,704
especially Se Yeong.

348
00:23:57,704 --> 00:24:02,970
She'll help you return to your old self.

349
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,637
I'm trying to reconnect with my friends.

350
00:24:06,637 --> 00:24:08,338
I'll take care of it.

351
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:20,304
I should've just sold all these.

352
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:46,438
I'll put them in the master bedroom for now
and move them out over the weekend.

353
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:50,371
You won't help me out, and yet
you expect me to help you?

354
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:51,503
Is that what an adult should be doing?

355
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:54,137
When a kid acts up,

356
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:56,237
an adult has to be stern with him.

357
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:58,904
If you're going to be stern,

358
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:01,470
make sure you clean up here
after you remove all your stuff.

359
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:04,304
There are no cleaning supplies though.

360
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:05,637
We can get that.

361
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,470
I'll go get them, so make sure
you clean up before you leave.

362
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,204
He's as mean as can be.

363
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:17,637
All set.

364
00:25:19,438 --> 00:25:21,004
What do you think?

365
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:22,870
Everything looks good on you.

366
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:25,904
One pizza down.

367
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,804
This one.

368
00:25:28,804 --> 00:25:30,304
Okay.

369
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:32,104
- And this.
- Okay.

370
00:25:32,704 --> 00:25:34,570
- This.
- This.

371
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:36,271
You can carry them all, right?

372
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:37,804
Sure.

373
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,670
One more pizza down.

374
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:43,970
I'm almost done paying off my debt.

375
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,271
Are you happy?

376
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,737
When I pay off my debt
and I'm no longer your slave,

377
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,137
I want to tell you something.

378
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,870
I thought Gyeong Jun would've woken up

379
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,438
before you paid off the 300 pizzas.

380
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:04,204
I'll take you to the arcades today. My treat.

381
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,603
You don't have to deduct a pizza for that.

382
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:13,237
Did you hear anything about Dr. Seo
returning to the hospital?

383
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:14,171
Why do you ask?

384
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:18,570
I heard that he's returned.

385
00:26:19,503 --> 00:26:22,338
Dr. Seo...

386
00:26:25,737 --> 00:26:27,470
Oops.

387
00:26:53,338 --> 00:26:54,904
Should I remove the bathroom slippers, too?

388
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,338
You won't need these, right?

389
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:02,204
Why are you here?

390
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:04,537
I'm here

391
00:27:05,171 --> 00:27:07,438
because of my things.

392
00:27:13,371 --> 00:27:15,837
Did you meet up with Yun Jae?

393
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:18,037
Yes.

394
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,271
Seeing that you're here, it must be true

395
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:25,603
that his mother is trying
to set you up with him.

396
00:27:30,537 --> 00:27:34,537
Which cleaner keeps the dirt and grease on?

397
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:40,737
Do you really want to marry him?

398
00:27:40,737 --> 00:27:44,770
Why should I tell you?

399
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,271
You and Yun Jae are now history.

400
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:51,204
I don't want to help you in the least

401
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,470
but I do want to tell you that marrying
Yun Jae won't be a good idea.

402
00:27:56,137 --> 00:27:59,304
You're 31 years old, right?

403
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:03,438
What do you see when you look
at a 19 year-old kid? A man?

404
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:05,603
Pardon? What do you take me for?

405
00:28:05,603 --> 00:28:09,204
You see, inside Yun Jae

406
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:14,371
is an immature little kid.

407
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:17,837
They do say a man is forever a child,

408
00:28:17,837 --> 00:28:19,870
but in Yun Jae's case,
it's more than just figurative.

409
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,304
I know Yun Jae has changed
since the accident.

410
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:28,570
But I still like him nonetheless.

411
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,237
Unlike you, I won't give up on him.

412
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:46,271
That's not fit for a young kid.

413
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,104
Get up.

414
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:53,804
This is my couch.

415
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:55,104
What?

416
00:28:55,837 --> 00:28:58,603
Get up. This is my couch.

417
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,537
Why are you being so childish?

418
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:02,637
All the furniture in here belongs to me.

419
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:04,904
You can't come here until
I remove everything.

420
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:06,271
- Go.
- Ms. Gil Da Ran.

421
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:07,570
Just go.

422
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,904
And don't ever come back here at night.

423
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:13,570
I'll beat you into a pulp.

424
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:36,537
What's going on?

425
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:38,870
Gil Da Ran's at your place.

426
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,237
She said she was moving her things out
and kicked me out.

427
00:29:42,237 --> 00:29:43,503
Really?

428
00:29:43,503 --> 00:29:45,404
What's going on?

429
00:29:45,904 --> 00:29:47,603
What's wrong with her?

430
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:50,737
She told me you've become a child
and that I should give up on you.

431
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:54,737
That's right. I'm a child.
I'm very immature.

432
00:29:54,737 --> 00:29:56,304
Will you be able to handle that?

433
00:29:58,503 --> 00:30:01,770
You were never childish or immature.

434
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,338
She may have given up,

435
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:08,503
but I'm going to wait until
the old you returns.

436
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:13,770
Fine. When he does return,

437
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,104
he's all yours.

438
00:30:17,104 --> 00:30:18,637
Happy now?

439
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,904
I heard you kicked Lee Se Yeong out.

440
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:31,037
You're not as wimpy as you used to be.

441
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,404
Gil...

442
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,870
She brought Yun Jae's things.

443
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,737
These could probably go.

444
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,037
Stop it.

445
00:30:45,037 --> 00:30:48,737
I'm putting them in that room.
Don't throw them out.

446
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:06,071
Have you really been studying medicine?

447
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:08,737
You read all of these?

448
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,104
You must be really smart.

449
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,870
I told you I was skipping.

450
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,137
It's not that bad. I didn't
have to waste time.

451
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:19,004
I got to where I am in the blink of an eye.

452
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:22,404
But getting married is a different story.

453
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:23,570
Yeah.

454
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,470
Seeing that Se Yeong came over
this late at night,

455
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,670
the problem is serious.

456
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,704
I've been telling you it was serious.

457
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:32,137
All alone with a sexy woman like her...

458
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,371
On the inside, I'm a young kid
with raging hormones.

459
00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:43,137
When she finds out about the nursling inside,

460
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:45,304
she'll no longer be chasing you.

461
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:48,503
Really?

462
00:31:48,904 --> 00:31:50,304
This kiddie bed speaks volumes

463
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:54,670
about your childish mental state.

464
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:58,937
So that means

465
00:31:58,937 --> 00:32:00,870
you will

466
00:32:05,004 --> 00:32:06,603
never ever

467
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:11,171
be attracted to me, right?

468
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:13,537
Of course not.

469
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:19,804
That's why you're the only one
who can help me.

470
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:23,904
Please let me hold onto the boy
in this body who likes toy beds.

471
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:32,904
Poor Gyeong Jun.

472
00:32:32,904 --> 00:32:35,237
I can't just turn a blind eye.

473
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,570
Those love beams in her eyes
were still there.

474
00:33:00,904 --> 00:33:03,171
You've wasted so much time.

475
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:06,404
You wasted 6 months
denying that you like Da Ran

476
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:08,404
and another 6 months worrying
that you'll make her uncomfortable.

477
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:12,137
You might lose her again
without having done a thing.

478
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:19,404
Ms. Lee Ae Gyeong,

479
00:33:19,404 --> 00:33:21,637
what do you think I should do?

480
00:33:23,904 --> 00:33:25,937
What do you think you should do?

481
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:29,804
I can run 100 meters in 12 seconds.

482
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:33,004
But it's been a year, and I still
haven't been able to start

483
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:35,770
my sprint toward Ms. Gil.

484
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,537
Please pull the trigger on the gun

485
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:40,004
so that I can start my dash.

486
00:33:40,004 --> 00:33:41,438
Bang.

487
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,371
Shoot it right here. Bang.

488
00:33:47,104 --> 00:33:48,870
Okay.

489
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,171
Bang.

490
00:33:54,371 --> 00:33:56,404
I've started the race.

491
00:33:56,404 --> 00:33:58,271
Please help me.

492
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,171
Shoot the gun one more time

493
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:04,470
so that I can get a better start.

494
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:06,570
Bang.

495
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,670
Good grief.

496
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,237
That male and female are

497
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:12,904
shooting love bullets

498
00:34:12,904 --> 00:34:15,603
on sacred school grounds.

499
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:19,237
This isn't a battleground.

500
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:20,371
Geez.

501
00:34:26,371 --> 00:34:28,503
This could be war.

502
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:30,371
I could get hurt.

503
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:36,670
- Aren't the dumplings delicious?
- Yes.

504
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,503
Guess what's inside.

505
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:39,837
It was so good. Thank you.

506
00:34:39,837 --> 00:34:42,104
Do come back soon. So long.

507
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,804
She's the scariest.

508
00:34:50,237 --> 00:34:51,371
This is it.

509
00:34:52,104 --> 00:34:53,237
Geez.

510
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:10,603
What would you like, sir?

511
00:35:13,037 --> 00:35:14,704
Dumplings, please.

512
00:35:14,704 --> 00:35:16,104
Coming up.

513
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:32,770
I should just do it. They'll go easier on me
because of the customers.

514
00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:39,271
Hon, where's the pork?

515
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:41,770
Inside. Right in front of the fridge.

516
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,037
Here?

517
00:35:43,037 --> 00:35:44,570
I don't see it.

518
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,171
Where can it be?

519
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:49,137
Oh, right. It's in the small fridge.

520
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:51,704
The small fridge? Okay.

521
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:55,570
I'll be minced up like meat stuffing.

522
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:16,837
Sir, your dumplings.

523
00:36:18,037 --> 00:36:19,870
Sir.

524
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,870
It's to go.

525
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,171
Okay.

526
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,204
Hi, Mary.

527
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:30,737
Dumplings, right?

528
00:36:37,271 --> 00:36:41,404
They were holding weapons.

529
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:45,237
You would have been made
into dumplings if they caught you.

530
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,137
They make good dumplings,

531
00:36:47,837 --> 00:36:51,071
so imagine how well they would
have diced and minced me.

532
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,970
Mister,

533
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:58,104
it's one pickled radish per dumpling.

534
00:36:58,104 --> 00:37:00,770
I only make an exception

535
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,404
to the rule for Gyeong Jun.

536
00:37:02,404 --> 00:37:04,071
Then make an exception for me, too.

537
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:05,470
Mister,

538
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,004
you're taking 2 radishes to be
like Gyeong Jun, aren't you?

539
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:11,737
I normally have 3 at a time.
I was just being nice.

540
00:37:12,371 --> 00:37:14,237
In any case, thanks.

541
00:37:14,237 --> 00:37:16,137
You can have the rest.

542
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:19,570
Even if they make dumplings out of me,
I have to go and talk to them.

543
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,670
There's nothing left.

544
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,603
You toss all that into a trash bin.

545
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,904
Are you following me? Don't follow me.

546
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:37,371
I told you not to follow me.

547
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:39,804
I can't open my eyes.

548
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:45,904
Are you okay?

549
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:49,904
Don't touch your eyes.

550
00:37:49,904 --> 00:37:52,004
You'll be fine once they start watering.

551
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,137
Fine. I'll deal with the trash.

552
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:38,770
Please get your things
out of Yun Jae's house.

553
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,503
I'm going to sell the house soon.

554
00:38:42,204 --> 00:38:44,304
The house?

555
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:50,071
But there's someone who
wants to buy it later on.

556
00:38:50,071 --> 00:38:54,004
The house means a lot to that person.

557
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:56,737
How is that your concern?

558
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,004
You want the house and
the furniture left as they are?

559
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,171
You must still be hung up on Yun Jae.

560
00:39:03,171 --> 00:39:05,438
Please move you things out
as soon as possible.

561
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:11,137
Dr. Seo Yun Jae's gotten even more handsome.

562
00:39:11,537 --> 00:39:13,371
Yun Jae was at the hospital?

563
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:15,204
Yes. Right here.

564
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:17,271
Here?

565
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:22,104
How does Yun Jae know this patient?

566
00:39:22,104 --> 00:39:25,970
There was no external trauma.
I don't know why we won't wake up.

567
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,904
I've never seen anything like this before.

568
00:39:29,237 --> 00:39:31,704
This patient was in a car accident, right?

569
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:32,837
Yes.

570
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,603
He's a celebrity around here.

571
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:36,503
The Sleeping Hottie.

572
00:39:39,204 --> 00:39:41,037
Kang Gyeong Jun.

573
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:49,804
He was first taken to Yangpyeong Hospital.

574
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:55,603
Wasn't Yangpyeong where
Yun Jae got into an accident?

575
00:39:56,837 --> 00:40:00,137
The patient who was brought here
with Kang Gyeong Jun

576
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:01,737
was Seo Yun Jae?

577
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,438
You're sure, right?

578
00:40:13,438 --> 00:40:15,304
That's why mom bought me this house.

579
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,837
This house

580
00:40:18,837 --> 00:40:20,804
is all I have left.

581
00:40:30,603 --> 00:40:32,371
Hi, Ae Gyeong.

582
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:34,770
What?

583
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,770
You're at our dumpling place with Mr. Na?

584
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,470
We'll wait for you. Hurry over.

585
00:40:42,338 --> 00:40:46,603
So you went to the same college
of education I had gone to, Mr. Na.

586
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:49,970
Yes, sir. Please call me Hyo Sang, sir.

587
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,670
Well...

588
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:55,304
I don't know...

589
00:40:55,304 --> 00:40:58,503
Hyo Sang? Na Hyo Sang.

590
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:00,137
I like the family name Na.

591
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:04,804
He's certainly sprinting fast.

592
00:41:04,804 --> 00:41:08,704
He did say he could run
100 meters in 12 seconds.

593
00:41:08,704 --> 00:41:10,304
Come on in.

594
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:15,737
As a former teacher, Min Gyu has always
wanted a teacher for a son-in-law.

595
00:41:15,737 --> 00:41:17,404
Right?

596
00:41:17,404 --> 00:41:19,004
Of course.

597
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:21,670
I'd like it too if my brother-in-law
were a teacher.

598
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,737
It would be perfect.

599
00:41:24,237 --> 00:41:26,071
Da Ran's on her way, right?

600
00:41:26,071 --> 00:41:27,338
Yes.

601
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:28,570
Let me pour you a glass, sir.

602
00:41:28,937 --> 00:41:30,937
Bottoms up. No stopping.

603
00:41:30,937 --> 00:41:32,603
What's going on here?

604
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:34,870
What's up with the gym teacher?

605
00:41:37,137 --> 00:41:40,338
And what do your parents do?

606
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,304
They're both civil servants, sir.

607
00:41:42,304 --> 00:41:45,004
- Wow.
- How wonderful.

608
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:46,171
This is great.

609
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:52,804
Are they thinking of setting
him up with Da Ran?

610
00:41:58,237 --> 00:41:59,537
I'd like another glass, sir.

611
00:42:06,404 --> 00:42:08,737
If Da Ran shows up,

612
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:10,904
they're pressure her into dating him.

613
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:20,670
Huh?

614
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,171
What are you doing here?

615
00:42:22,171 --> 00:42:23,704
I need to talk to you. Let's go.

616
00:42:24,204 --> 00:42:26,603
I have guests. I have to go.

617
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:30,470
You said I could come and talk
to you if I had any problems.

618
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,271
You know you're the only one I can talk to.

619
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,171
Fine. Go on in then.

620
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:51,837
It's not easy reconciling the gap between

621
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:54,670
the subject I see in the mirror and myself.

622
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,737
I don't know if I need to come to terms
with having two identities

623
00:42:57,737 --> 00:43:00,637
or destroy my old self and create
a new identity altogether.

624
00:43:00,637 --> 00:43:02,037
That's what has been bothering me.

625
00:43:04,204 --> 00:43:07,670
It's a problem that's probably unique to you.

626
00:43:08,438 --> 00:43:10,603
I don't know what to tell you.

627
00:43:11,438 --> 00:43:13,237
You said you had guests.

628
00:43:13,237 --> 00:43:14,970
- Did the gym teacher come by?
- Yeah.

629
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,770
Have you two gotten closer
while I was away?

630
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,004
No.

631
00:43:18,004 --> 00:43:19,570
No?

632
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:23,770
What should we eat?

633
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,237
I can't decide.

634
00:43:25,237 --> 00:43:28,470
What you said earlier, Gyeong Jun...

635
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,438
Never mind.

636
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:34,371
So you're confused as to who you are, right?

637
00:43:34,371 --> 00:43:36,804
I don't know

638
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:41,104
what I could do for you,

639
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:44,603
but you're just Kang Gyeong Jun.

640
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,537
Don't forget that.

641
00:43:48,603 --> 00:43:51,037
You came up with a short answer
to a very big question.

642
00:43:51,037 --> 00:43:53,837
So don't forget that you're still young.

643
00:43:53,837 --> 00:43:56,371
Don't go to places where adults drink,

644
00:43:56,371 --> 00:43:57,704
and don't smoke, either.

645
00:43:57,704 --> 00:44:02,037
I know you have a license, but
I worry about you driving, too.

646
00:44:02,037 --> 00:44:05,470
Yes, ma'am.

647
00:44:26,171 --> 00:44:27,770
I have faith in you.

648
00:44:35,837 --> 00:44:37,737
Don't touch your eyes.

649
00:44:37,737 --> 00:44:39,837
You'll be fine once they start watering.

650
00:45:00,704 --> 00:45:02,937
How can

651
00:45:02,937 --> 00:45:07,371
two people be so similar?

652
00:45:12,804 --> 00:45:15,904
Hello, Mary.

653
00:45:17,704 --> 00:45:22,670
Do you know how Gyeong Jun
got to know Dr. Seo Yun Jae?

654
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,670
I was wondering whether you knew
anything about their relationship.

655
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,470
I don't know anything, either.

656
00:45:28,037 --> 00:45:30,670
All I know is that they shared a special bond

657
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,970
and that Dr. Seo knows
a lot about Gyeong Jun.

658
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,104
I know.

659
00:45:37,104 --> 00:45:41,637
He even bought Gyeong Jun's house.

660
00:45:41,637 --> 00:45:45,137
They must have shared
an exceptionally strong bond.

661
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:48,737
He bought the house
Gyeong Jun used to live in?

662
00:45:48,737 --> 00:45:49,937
Yeah.

663
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:53,371
Gyeong Jun's mother had bought

664
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:58,637
the house for when Gyeong Jun
would attend college in Korea.

665
00:45:58,637 --> 00:46:04,470
After Gyeong Jun's accident, we didn't
want to leave it empty, so we sold it.

666
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,237
And the person who bought
the house was Dr. Seo.

667
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:14,704
Dr. Seo bought the house
Gyeong Jun used to live in.

668
00:46:14,704 --> 00:46:15,670
Isn't it weird?

669
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,570
Yeah.

670
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:22,071
They were planning to get an apartment
but suddenly changed their minds.

671
00:46:24,104 --> 00:46:26,237
It was probably Dr. Seo.

672
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,904
Really?

673
00:46:27,904 --> 00:46:33,271
Seo Yun Jae used to be a gentleman,

674
00:46:33,271 --> 00:46:35,870
but he became really weird
after the accident.

675
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,204
Accident?

676
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:42,338
Yeah. A car accident.

677
00:46:42,804 --> 00:46:43,804
When?

678
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:46,104
Um...

679
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:49,204
It was probably right before you got here.

680
00:46:50,104 --> 00:46:51,570
Really?

681
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,670
Here's your orange juice.

682
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:57,970
2 Americanos.

683
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,670
Ow.

684
00:47:01,537 --> 00:47:03,371
2 Americanos, right?

685
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:04,904
Please wait.

686
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:06,970
You bring the coffee.

687
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:08,171
Why?

688
00:47:08,171 --> 00:47:09,704
I can't stand seeing blood.

689
00:47:12,338 --> 00:47:15,137
How did he study medicine then?

690
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:30,171
Look at him sitting askew
with one hand in his pocket.

691
00:47:30,171 --> 00:47:32,271
That's how he used to sit in class.

692
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,470
He's so hot.

693
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,670
- Isn't he handsome?
- Yeah.

694
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,104
Oh, no.

695
00:47:59,104 --> 00:48:00,503
I'm sorry. Did I get it on your shirt?

696
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:03,204
She's making a move on him.

697
00:48:05,704 --> 00:48:07,770
I'll pay for the dry-cleaning.

698
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,304
Why don't we exchange numbers?

699
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:12,071
Spilling a drink to get the guy's number.

700
00:48:12,071 --> 00:48:14,704
Classic schemes always work the best.

701
00:48:17,071 --> 00:48:18,737
She's getting his number.

702
00:48:21,071 --> 00:48:23,404
He's really giving her his number.

703
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:26,071
He's really easy, isn't he?

704
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,004
2 Americanos.

705
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:30,438
Thank you.

706
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:36,970
Are you just going to watch?

707
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:38,137
Aren't you going to stop her?

708
00:48:38,137 --> 00:48:39,737
You said you'd take care of me.

709
00:48:52,937 --> 00:48:54,071
Are you his girlfriend?

710
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:55,304
Pardon?

711
00:48:55,304 --> 00:48:58,338
I... Uh... Well...

712
00:48:58,338 --> 00:48:59,870
Sorry about your shirt.

713
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:09,037
I... Uh...Well... Is that a yes or a no?

714
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:12,438
Well... Uh...

715
00:49:21,537 --> 00:49:24,603
So Gyeong Jun used to live here?

716
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,104
So what do you say?

717
00:50:10,104 --> 00:50:11,970
You're going to help me, right?

718
00:50:12,704 --> 00:50:14,570
I need to think about it.

719
00:50:15,537 --> 00:50:19,470
The more you think, the more
delusional you get.

720
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,271
Just make up your mind.

721
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,438
Kang Gyeong Jun's the bait.

722
00:50:25,438 --> 00:50:27,237
Take it.

723
00:50:30,503 --> 00:50:33,304
You're the only one in the whole world

724
00:50:33,304 --> 00:50:35,271
who really knows me.

725
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:42,438
This isn't fun for me. I'm not out
to lure all the fishes out there.

726
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:48,637
There's only one fish for me,
and I'm begging her to take me.

727
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:53,271
It's a sad situation.

728
00:50:55,737 --> 00:50:58,137
So Gil Teacher,

729
00:51:00,837 --> 00:51:03,338
please take the bait.

730
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,870
That's Gyeong Jun's bed.

731
00:52:47,304 --> 00:52:49,570
They're all Gyeong Jun's.

732
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:59,637
They were in the same accident.

733
00:52:59,637 --> 00:53:01,970
One's in a coma,

734
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,304
and the other one lost his memory...

735
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:14,970
If I'm with you like this,

736
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:18,470
people will think

737
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:21,970
I've gotten back together
with Yun Jae, right?

738
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:26,904
That's why we can't just meet up like this.

739
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:31,770
Either we keep seeing each other

740
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,104
or we don't see each other at all.

741
00:53:33,104 --> 00:53:35,837
Gyeong Jun,

742
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,670
I...

743
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:42,570
I really want to stay by
your side and help you,

744
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:47,271
but I don't want to

745
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:50,271
see Yun Jae's face.

746
00:53:51,371 --> 00:53:55,304
It wasn't easy for me to get over him,

747
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:00,404
and I'm not sure I can keep myself

748
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,603
from falling for him again.

749
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:08,237
Will I be

750
00:54:08,237 --> 00:54:10,937
able to hold myself back?

751
00:54:16,704 --> 00:54:18,438
So...

752
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:23,870
You've made your decision.

753
00:54:26,804 --> 00:54:29,037
Let's not see each other again.

754
00:55:37,137 --> 00:55:38,970
Why are you here?

755
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,438
And why are you here?

756
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:48,004
Why are you in Gyeong Jun's house?

757
00:55:49,404 --> 00:55:51,670
Because I bought this place.

758
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:53,837
Why didn't you tell me

759
00:55:53,837 --> 00:55:57,171
Gyeong Jun used to live here?

760
00:55:58,537 --> 00:56:00,503
You're a doctor, right?

761
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:04,204
I have a cut.

762
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:07,004
Could you take a look at it?

763
00:56:11,204 --> 00:56:14,171
Are you scared of blood, too?

764
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,470
Just like Gyeong Jun...

765
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:39,637
You're not a doctor, are you?

766
00:56:41,371 --> 00:56:44,171
You're not Seo Yun Jae,

767
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,770
are you?

768
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:58,770
Are you Gyeong Jun?

769
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:02,470
Gyeong Jun.

770
00:57:16,004 --> 00:57:18,837
Is it really

771
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:21,770
you, Gyeong Jun?

772
00:57:26,104 --> 00:57:28,137
Gyeong Jun!

773
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,171
Gyeong Jun.

774
00:58:00,837 --> 00:58:02,204
