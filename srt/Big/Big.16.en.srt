1
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,460
I'm in love

2
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,770
with KKJ.

3
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,930
Gil Da Ran.

4
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,700
I come first.

5
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,240
If it's as she said, I come first.

6
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,060
Let's go.

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,830
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm sorry for having raised
an awful daughter.

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,520
Was that really my sister?

10
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,690
That doctor deserved it.

11
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,860
If you stab someone in the back,

12
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,320
you get stabbed right back.

13
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,090
[Final Episode]

14
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,770
Why did you do that?

15
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,100
I told you I won't remember anything.

16
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,540
But I'll remember everything.

17
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,370
But you'll only get hurt.

18
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,230
I may get hurt, but I can't pretend
you never happened.

19
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,590
So you won't pretend nothing happened?

20
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,350
No.

21
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,220
I said my love for you was real,

22
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,950
so you did exist.

23
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,300
You still exist, and you always will exist.

24
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,840
But I may forget everything.

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,810
I'll make sure you don't.

26
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,700
Even if your memory is wiped clean,
I'll tell you what happened.

27
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,070
I might call you crazy.

28
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,470
I am already crazy, so you'd be right.

29
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,260
Look at me.

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,920
I've lost my mind.

31
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,820
You're right.

32
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,660
You definitely don't seem sane.

33
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,410
I went on a submarine adventure,

34
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,090
and this is what I found.

35
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,580
You went into that murky water?

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,650
You've lost it, Gil Da Ran.

37
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,510
Yup.

38
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,510
Come on.

39
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,760
This is gross and smells bad.

40
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,700
Even if the miracle

41
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,600
wipes you of your memory,

42
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,150
I will make it come back.

43
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,340
I will hold you tight and won't let you go.

44
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,110
I'll make sure it all comes back.

45
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,280
I won't let you go.

46
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,260
I don't know what to say.

47
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,030
I'm so sorry.

48
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,560
It was as expected.

49
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,840
She told me she would let Yun Jae go
once he got better.

50
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,800
Da Ran said that?

51
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,240
She had said she didn't deserve him,

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,930
but I only just learned what the reason was.

53
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,200
It's absurd that we should be sitting
here face-to-face like this.

54
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,890
Let's go.

55
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,280
Hello?

56
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,400
The hospital?

57
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,430
Gyeong Jun?

58
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,640
His vitals were unstable
and only just stabilized.

59
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,200
His heart rate had gone up
to a dangerous level.

60
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,050
I'll stay at the hospital tonight.

61
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,360
I'll stay with you.

62
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,620
Should we call Yun Jae?

63
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,190
Something has come up for Yun Jae.

64
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,520
We'll stay with Gyeong Jun tonight.

65
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,250
I'll tell you about Yun Jae some other time.

66
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,890
He didn't suffer any external trauma.

67
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,720
I just don't get why he's like this.

68
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,270
Shouldn't you wash up and get changed?

69
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,370
No. I need to get used to
being a crazy woman.

70
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,580
I might have to tell you I love you

71
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,700
after your memory is wiped clean.

72
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,740
I need to prepare for that
and become thick-skinned.

73
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,080
Once I forget everything,

74
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,620
I might be very rude to you.

75
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,570
Wouldn't you get intimidated
and just give up?

76
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,600
Intimidated?

77
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,040
Did you just say I'd get intimidated?

78
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,260
Aren't they pretty, Gyeong Jun?

79
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,490
What if they are?

80
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,410
You had given me flowers,

81
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,060
but I was rude to you then.

82
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,850
Should I pick them for you?
Let me pick them for you.

83
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,400
You can't just pick them.

84
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,680
Hey, miss,

85
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,560
you're not allowed to do that.

86
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,180
Gil Da Ran.

87
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,550
What is the matter with her?

88
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,670
Are you with her?

89
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,290
Has she lost her mind?

90
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,630
I think so.

91
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,690
She's not stable.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,210
I'm sorry, Gyeong Jun.

94
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,880
I haven't done anything for you,

95
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,270
so let me give you these flowers.

96
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,830
Would you like me to sing you a song?

97
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,200
I'll sing for you.

98
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,700

99

♪ Playing is the best ♪

100
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,660
She really must have lost her marbles.

101
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,070
She may have lost it, but isn't she lovely?

102
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,730
I told her we'd go to the moon together.

103
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,910

110
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,500
It would be awesome
if I could remember this.

111
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,180
I could make fun of her
for the rest of her life.

112
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,850
When I thought you'd remember everything,

113
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,060
I held myself back a lot
because I was scared.

114
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,040
That's what I regret the most.

115
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,080
Oh wow.

116
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,310
No one picked up the ring Ms. Gil took off.

117
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,000
Wowee.

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,470
This looks very pricey.

119
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,540
Their marriage may have ended,
but why waste something like this?

120
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,390
I just don't get why she would
throw away something so expensive.

121
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,020
Should I wear it? She did throw it away.

122
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,070
That's mine.

123
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,180
I bought it. Give it back.

124
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,420
This?

125
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,390
I bought it to deceive her,

126
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,780
but I really did buy it.

127
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,480
Give it back.

128
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,360
I'll check up on your claim.

129
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,890
Everyone has left, Mary,

130
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,300
so why are you still here?

131
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,230
I'm leaving now.

132
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,450
Mr. and Mrs. Kang,

133
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,510
when Gyeong Jun wakes up,

134
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,350
you have to let him know

135
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,040
I was the only one who stayed
by his side throughout.

136
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,290
That is true.

137
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,940
You've been the only one who's visited
him every day and looked out for him.

138
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,360
You two also believe I'm the only one

139
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,200
who deserves to be with Gyeong Jun, right?

140
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,220
Ms. Gil Da Ran is a traitor
who didn't keep her promise.

141
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,280
She'll get punished.

142
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,770
But Yun Jae said he was having an affair too.

143
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,940
Shouldn't he have come clean about that?

144
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,870
It was a two-way misdemeanor.

145
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,160
Never mind.

146
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,430
It's not right to bring up his wrong-doing
just to make excuses for Da Ran.

147
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,190
Yun Jae and Da Ran took off together,
so they'll conclude the matter.

148
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,910
So who's that K-guy anyway?

149
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,090
Yun Jae dragged Da Ran out,
so he's probably interrogating her.

150
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,760
I bet things are rather ugly
between them right now.

151
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,550
So when did you start liking KKJ? Be honest.

152
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,280
I'm not sure.

153
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,810
Don't be willy-nilly.

154
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,080
Give me a straight answer.

155
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,860
This is to create a love timeline
for when I lose my memory.

156
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,570
I ask for your full cooperation.

157
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,430
At the movies.

158
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,580
Something felt different.

159
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,030
Wow.

160
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,610
And yet you pretended
you hadn't fallen for me.

161
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,880
At that point though, I thought
it was the outer shell.

162
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,590
I didn't think I had fallen
with the person inside.

163
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,770
And when

164
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,840
did you really realize you'd fallen for me?

165
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,920
At the park.

166
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,400
That's when it hit me I was no longer
waiting for Yun Jae

167
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,750
and wanted to be with you.

168
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,940
I saw you crying.

169
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,050
Really?

170
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,440
If I'd known you were crying because of me,

171
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,090
I would've made sure to keep you
from crying thereafter.

172
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,510
After that, it was a whirlwind.

173
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,100
I felt like I was losing my mind.

174
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,550
That's why you turned to
embroidery and ironing, right?

175
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,830
It was your attempt to be devoted to Yun Jae.

176
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,670
You're the one who'll be losing your memory.

177
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,630
It's you who should be recording
your love timeline.

178
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,670
Come on now.

179
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,460
My end of things were
only filled with frustration.

180
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,580
They weren't beautiful.

181
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,180
When I first told you I liked you, you
called me a nursling and rejected me.

182
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,300
It will only rile me up to
retrace such things.

183
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,200
We need to make this beautiful.

184
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,010
Why wasn't I braver about
telling you how I feel sooner?

185
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,430
I could've done more nice things for you.

186
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,960
Then be good to me from now on.

187
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,510
I'll record every little detail.

188
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,080
I'll definitely write down the shocking
events of earlier this evening.

189
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,010
Aren't I a sweetheart?

190
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,360
No. Not really.

191
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,330
You're lying. Your eyes are
shooting love beams.

192
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,370
Seeing him like this

193
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,840
reminds me of when Yun Jae first fell ill.

194
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,660
Seeing Yun Jae lying helplessly
in bed every day

195
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,690
tore me to pieces.

196
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,670
I had been

197
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,980
denying that Gyeong Jun was my son.

198
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,900
So I don't understand why

199
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,010
it pains me

200
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,500
just as much to see him like this.

201
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,330
I'm off.

202
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,570
My parents are probably waiting
for their terrible daughter.

203
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,010
I'll go and let them know I'm ending
things with Yun Jae once and for all.

204
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,620
To keep my family from getting confused,

205
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,310
we won't be able to see each other
openly for the time being.

206
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,200
You're right.

207
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,960
Should we just run away to that
boarding house you were looking into?

208
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,190
I had to back out at the last minute.

209
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,670
Plus, I'm not going to run away anymore.

210
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,770
I'm sorry about everything.

211
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,230
Go up to your room.

212
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,320
Okay, mom.

213
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,160
Even when your grandmother
cut off all my hair,

214
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,040
I still loved your father.

215
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,190
Is that what you want for yourself?

216
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,730
I don't care.

217
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,570
If I have to deny my own feelings,

218
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:03,980
I won't ever be able to smile
like you're smiling in this picture.

219
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,680
You're out of your mind.

220
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,430
I'm sorry, mom.

221
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,910
Forget about it.

222
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,160
I can't even stand to look at you.

223
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,890
Min Gyu,

224
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:57,170
I never thought I'd tell my daughter

225
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,070
what my mother told me.

226
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:09,150
It must've been so hard for my mother.

227
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,180
She's awful.

228
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,820
She really is.

229
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,100
He seems fine.

230
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,260
So you're saying his heart rate had shot up?

231
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,190
I was scared he was going
to suffer cardioplegia.

232
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,600
I was also hoping he might wake up,
but he didn't.

233
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,610
Was it that bad?

234
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,840
Right. When you first met him,

235
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,440
you had come back after
suffering cardioplegia, right?

236
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,930
Yeah.

237
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,080
I came back from the dead.

238
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,460
You really seem to have
a special connection with him.

239
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,730
First off, Seo Yun Jae's soul must
safely get out of my body.

240
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,330
My body can die for a second, and then
I can re-enter it and bring it to life.

241
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,780
As good as new.

242
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,280
It burst.

243
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,120
I can't die before I get back.

244
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:00,720
The entire family, including Gyeong Jun,
will be returning to Germany,

245
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,690
but what if the same thing
happens to him again?

246
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,160
Dr. Seo and Yun Jae are doctors,

247
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,920
so he's in good hands.

248
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,480
Se Yeong,

249
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,530
you still have feelings for Yun Jae, right?

250
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,210
Pardon?

251
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,650
When Yun Jae recovers,

252
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,630
let's

253
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,600
see each other again.

254
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,950
That's enough.

255
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,840
I'm coming to Germany with you.

256
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,770
I'm not going.

257
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,970
To be more precise, I'll ask
them to leave my body here.

258
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,640
A change of plans.

259
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,420
Then I'm not going either.

260
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,590
As soon as you return
to your body and wake up,

261
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,450
I'll follow you to the end of the earth.

262
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,810
Jang Mary,

263
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,350
don't chase me anymore.

264
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,770
I don't care whom the Gyeong Jun

265
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,220
in Dr. Seo's body likes.

266
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,830
You won't remember a thing once
you return to your old self anyway.

267
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,990
Gil Da Ran said she'd remember
everything for me.

268
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,870
She said she'd stay by my side.

269
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,900
Ms. Gil said that?

270
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,040
You'll be Dr. Seo's family

271
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,050
and wake up having forgotten all about her.

272
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,650
Is she out of her mind?

273
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,530
Yes, she is.

274
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,240
[BIG: I'm in front of the school.
Let's meet up before you go home]

275
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,720
Are you going home, Ms. Gil?

276
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,990
Huh? Yeah.

277
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,840
Mom told me to accompany you
after school for the time being.

278
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,150
Accompany me?

279
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,390
You go ahead.

280
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,050
Are you taking off to meet KKJ?

281
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,160
Hold yourself back.

282
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,790
I'm on your side because I'm your brother,

283
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,700
but what about Yun Jae?
You shouldn't be like this.

284
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,680
Did you leave the house

285
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,830
because Yun Jae said he couldn't
stand to see you anymore?

286
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,080
Huh? Yeah.

287
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,770
I can understand how he must feel.

288
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,380
It must be so hard for him
even just to see you.

289
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,340
Be careful, Da Ran.

290
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,400
Yun Jae's a guy. He could
get very angry and just snap.

291
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,210
Avoid him for now.

292
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,090
She just took off.

293
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,360
Come on out. I miss you.

294
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,170
I want to see you up close.

295
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,490
I'm coming.

296
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,390
Where are you going?

297
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,710
To the store.

298
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,350
Have Chung Sik go for you. You stay put.

299
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,930
Yun Jae lives right around the corner.

300
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,390
Imagine how hard it'd be for him
if he ran into you.

301
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,030
He probably can't even
stand the sight of you.

302
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,580
He lives in the same neighborhood,

303
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,240
so don't go out and create
an awkward situation.

304
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,050
You listen to me.

305
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,910
Good grief.

306
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,320
I haven't been able to give him
his watch I got fixed.

307
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,100
Should I sneak out?

308
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,460
Hi, Gyeong Jun.

309
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,990
How hard is it to see you?

310
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,030
Hang on.

311
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,550
I'll sneak out after 1:00.

312
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,150
Really?

313
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,610
Then I should've waited at home.

314
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,440
Where are you?

315
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,320
In front of our place?

316
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,630
What brought you here at this late hour?

317
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,270
What do you think?

318
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,980
Do you suppose I've come
to admire your parents' trees?

319
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,090
My parents aren't asleep yet.
I can't come down.

320
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,730
Jump down.

321
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,700
What?

322
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,850
It's not high. I'll catch you.

323
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,210
I'm too heavy. You won't be able to catch me.

324
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,980
Yes, I can. Come on. Come on.
Let 10:10 catch you.

325
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,600
Hold on.

326
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,930
He should've called to let me know
he was coming.

327
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,960
What are you doing?

328
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,390
Mom.

329
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,160
Are you going to jump?

330
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,330
What good would it do?

331
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:20,140
When you said you were
in love with someone else,

332
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,140
Yun Jae was on the verge of tears.

333
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,130
You may have lost your mind, but
there are still principles to uphold.

334
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:35,320
If you don't make a clean cut
and leave Yun Jae hanging,

335
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,440
I'll push you off.

336
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,900
Don't be pathetic.

337
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:54,410
So close yet so far.

338
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,490
Why is it so hard to see him?

339
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,960
I don't want to leave him hanging.

340
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,320
Are you hurt?

341
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,660
Are you okay?

342
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,720
I'm fine. I'm not hurt.

343
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,600
Why did you just jump
without signaling me first?

344
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,230
I was in a hurry. I didn't want
to leave you hanging.

345
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,530
Huh?

346
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,550
I got this fixed.

347
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,060
Wow.

348
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,110
I actually came by to ask you for this watch.

349
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,870
Really?

350
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,770
Are you happy to cuff me again?

351
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,760
Yeah.

352
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,210
You're mine now, so let me seal the deal.

353
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:38,230
Mom might look for me again.

354
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,290
I should go back in.

355
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,340
If she wanted to kiss me,
she could've given me a few more.

356
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,220
Just one little peck...

357
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,720
Geez.

358
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,770
I won't be able to sleep tonight.

359
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,330
Gyeong Jun and I are going far away.

360
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,550
- You're taking him?
- Yes.

361
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:32,020
After all, I'm the only one who
stuck with him this whole time.

362
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,480
You want to leave Gyeong Jun here?

363
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,310
Yes. I think it'd be better for him
to be here when he wakes up.

364
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,400
Then I'll stay.

365
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,430
You won't come with your sick son?

366
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,100
I can't leave Gyeong Jun alone.

367
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,060
When he wakes up,

368
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,680
we'll join you and dad in Germany.

369
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,040
Would that be okay with you?

370
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,870
If that's what you want to do.

371
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,460
Yes.

372
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,250
I'm with Yun Jae.

373
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,810
Gyeong Jun has disappeared?

374
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,830
He's not at the hospital?

375
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,750
They tell me

376
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,840
his friend Mary took him.

377
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,580
Jang Mary,

378
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,940
where are you right now?

379
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,640
I'm going to keep your body hidden
until you wake up.

380
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,700
I'll make sure you never see Ms. Gil.

381
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,900
I'll tell you I was the only one
who stayed by your side.

382
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,840
Are you playing the main character
of "Misery" or what?

383
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,600
Yup.

384
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,820
You said Ms. Gil lost her mind, right?

385
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,460
If she's crazy, my craziness is
double, triple, quadruple hers.

386
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,870
Fine.

387
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,050
Then I'll stay in Seo Yun Jae's body.

388
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,060
What?

389
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,060
I won't receive treatment or surgery

390
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,520
nor will I return to my own body.

391
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,780
Then you'll die.

392
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,790
You and I can both be stubborn,
and that will be the end for me.

393
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,950
Make your decision.

394
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,530
What will you do?

395
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,110
If you don't stop, I'm not
returning to my body.

396
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,440
Jang Mary.

397
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,890
Fine. I'll stop.

398
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,290
I'll stop, okay?

399
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,450
You won't

400
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,180
remember having loved Ms. Gil anyway.

401
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,110
That being the case,

402
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,800
you should be with me,

403
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,680
and Ms. Gil should be with Dr. Seo.

404
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,950
That's what the miracle
was supposed to be,

405
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,040
but Ms. Gil ruined everything.

406
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,190
No. That's just what you wanted.

407
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,620
I want Gil Da Ran to remember me
and be with me.

408
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,180
I won't play along if you disregard
what I want and push your agenda on me.

409
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,850
But you're disregarding
someone else's feelings too.

410
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,680
You want to disregard Dr. Seo's feelings
when he bought Ms. Gil's ring.

411
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,120
As soon as he wakes up,

412
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,350
he'll find out Ms. Gil has fallen for you,

413
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,060
and he'll be just as sad as me.

414
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,530
Oh, no.

415
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,700
I was pulling at it, and it ripped.

416
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,800
What if I can't put it back
like it used to be?

417
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,360
Mary,

418
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,350
are you here to see Chung Sik?

419
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,050
Where's Ms. Gil?

420
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,290
She's home.

421
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,600
What brings you here, Mary?

422
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,140
Ms. Gil,

423
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,190
what did you do with the ring
you took off at the restaurant?

424
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,570
Didn't Yun Jae's parents
take it with them?

425
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,720
Nope. No one took it.

426
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,950
It was left on the table, so I took it.

427
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,260
I had assumed I was returning it

428
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,680
to Yun Jae via his parents.

429
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,290
You didn't return it directly to him.

430
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,870
You were disregarding
Dr. Seo's feelings too.

431
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,360
How could you?

432
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,630
Fine. If you took it, give it back to me.

433
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,080
It seemed like you wanted to throw it out,

434
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,150
so I tossed it.

435
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,920
What?

436
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,590
I threw it out.

437
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,890
You can look for it yourself this time.

438
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,660
Where did you toss it?

439
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:05,590
It's where once the shell is sealed,
it becomes very difficult to find.

440
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,130
It's not like I meant to just
discard the ring there.

441
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,540
Da Ran,

442
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,150
what are you doing?

443
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,370
Why are you breaking apart
my dumplings?

444
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,800
She threw it in the stuffing.

445
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,940
Threw what?

446
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,390
Are these all the dumplings
you made today?

447
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,510
I steamed the ones I had made earlier
and sent them out on delivery.

448
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,040
Delivery?

449
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,170
Sir!

450
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,920
Sir!

451
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,980
I was disregarding Yun Jae's feelings.

452
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,440
I got so impatient that

453
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,540
I didn't even want to think about
what Yun Jae would say.

454
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,250
Do you

455
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,000
love me?

456
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,410
Where are you right now?

457
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,080
I'll answer you in person.

458
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,640
Wait.

459
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,620
There's something I have to find.

460
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,040
I'll refund you later.

461
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,710
No. I'll refund you double what you paid.

462
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,960
I'm so sorry. I'm so very sorry.

463
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,950
I won't take Gil Da Ran's hand right away.

464
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,800
I'll wait for you to come to terms

465
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,000
with your stopped time too.

466
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,020
Where are you coming from?

467
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,780
I had to look for something I lost.

468
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,410
Is it what Mary threw away?

469
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,740
How did you know?

470
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,690
Look.

471
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,660
I managed to retrieve it.

472
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,330
We won't be able

473
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,120
to take one another's hands
right away, right?

474
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,690
We'll need some time.

475
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,310
I wonder how long it will take.

476
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,250
I hope it won't be very long.

477
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,520
I'll be losing my memory.

478
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:51,220
What if we stay apart for too long

479
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,860
and miss the chance

480
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,640
to get back together and
take one another's hands?

481
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,360
I'll remember everything.

482
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Don't worry.

483
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,600
If my heart had grown even just a little bit

484
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,020
that it now has room

485
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,740
to be considerate of someone else,

486
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,180
perhaps I may not wake up
an oblivious child.

487
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:25,360
I might be able to remember something.

488
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,100
My heart will grow

489
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,600
as I think of you

490
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,820
every single day.

491
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,310
My heart will grow so that I will never

492
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,950
give up on you.

493
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,740
Okay.

494
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,820
The miracle of a growing heart

495
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,900
will be yours to realize.

496
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,790
I won't be waking up with
Gil Da Ran by my side.

497
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,310
But I don't want you to be there
when I wake up either,

498
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:22,640
so don't chase after me.

499
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,450
I'm holding off on being with
someone I care deeply about,

500
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,700
and I also want to stop you
from clinging on to me.

501
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,990
I've been disregarding your feelings.

502
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,090
Even though you were charging
at me like an express train,

503
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,630
I thought it'd be fine if I avoided you
and just let you be.

504
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,700
I didn't pay attention even when
you hit blockades and got hurt.

505
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,690
You really

506
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,860
never paid any attention to me?

507
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,320
No.

508
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,840
That's why I let you

509
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,800
stay by my side.

510
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,220
But now I feel bad and I can't help
but worry about you.

511
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,610
For your sake,

512
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,600
I'm turning on a clear stop signal.

513
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,120
Mary,

514
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,930
stop charging at me.

515
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,360
Jang Mary,

516
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,490
why are you heading back
to the States so suddenly?

517
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,220
Just for now.

518
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,250
Then what?

519
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,290
I was given a stop signal,

520
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,050
so I'm going to stop and think for a bit.

521
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,460
Bye.

522
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,050
Jang Mary.

523
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,050
Gil Chung Sik.

524
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,450
That's right. I'm Gil Chung Sik.

525
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:21,010
It'll take 10 years to pay this off
in pizzas, right?

526
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,350
And I

527
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,070
want it to take that long.

528
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,830
Wait for me, Jang Mary.

529
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,860
Dad left for Germany with Gyeong Jun.

530
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,680
It got complicated because
Gyeong Jun's in a coma.

531
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,910
We won't be seeing them
until we get to Germany.

532
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,010
So we'll probably be seated
side by side when we head over.

533
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,910
I imagine so.

534
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,980
What are you looking at?

535
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,990
Huh? Oh...

536
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:20,360
I'm studying what Da Ran
told me about Gyeong Jun.

537
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,440
I also got some information
from Mary as well.

538
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,390
He's a picky eater.

539
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,770
Just make nice and healthy foods for him.

540
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,980
When he wakes up...

541
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,730
But I'm worried. I'm not a good cook.

542
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,230
Work at it.

543
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:44,690
Although I'm sure he'll be honest
and not eat if the food's bad.

544
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,780
Really?

545
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,190
Brace yourself.

546
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,770
It won't be a walk in the park.

547
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,030
I am bracing myself.

548
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,640
So you are getting married after all.

549
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
Yes.

550
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,190
We've decided go for
a straight and fast pitch.

551
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,300
Congratulations.

552
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,760
Vice Principal Kim,

553
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,720
I might also

554
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,540
have to ask for maternity leave very soon.

555
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,310
Ms. Gil's leaving next month

556
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,410
to transfer to another school.

557
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,850
Your timing is so off.

558
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,130
You two are a very impatient couple.

559
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,910
Da Ran,

560
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,030
Yun Jae's leaving for Germany tomorrow,

561
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,130
and you're leaving for Pocheon next month.

562
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,060
What's going to happen between you two?

563
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:04,780
Yun Jae's going to Germany with his family,

564
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,490
but he will be coming to see me later.

565
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,370
Really?

566
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,630
Yeah. I think so.

567
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,270
It's been a long detour.

568
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,180
And then what?

569
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:22,350
I'll tell him I'm no longer waiting

570
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,740
for his answer to my question
"Do you love me?"

571
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:32,290
I'll tell him I now love someone else more.

572
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,950
I'll get to meet you soon.

573
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,500
Yun Jae,

574
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,420
how are you feeling?

575
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,820
Your entire family, including Gyeong Jun,
is leaving tomorrow, right?

576
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,040
Yeah.

577
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,430
I hope you get healthy and that
Gyeong Jun can wake up soon.

578
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:45,590
The Seo Yun Jae you know
will probably return.

579
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,390
I've been very rude to you, haven't I?

580
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,920
I should've been more respectful
given that you're much older.

581
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,670
What are you talking about?

582
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,810
When you first saw me,

583
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,310
you went like this, right?

584
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,930
It was a bit sexy.

585
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:06,690
Try it on Yun Jae when he returns.

586
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,840
[Help would be appreciated]

587
00:45:30,252 --> 00:45:31,305
[Gil Da Ran: Please contact if misplaced]

588
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,050
This is in very bad shape.

589
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,480
You should just throw it out

590
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,470
instead of wasting the money
to get it repaired.

591
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,670
I had lost it a long time ago,

592
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,820
but it's come back to me.

593
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,980
Really?

594
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,300
That hardly ever happens.

595
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,100
It's like a miracle, isn't it?

596
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,960
This is a memento of a miracle.

597
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,440
I was worried they'd all die before I left.

598
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,760
Do you remember the first day we met?

599
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,460
On the bus?

600
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,710
It was raining that day,
and I lost my umbrella.

601
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,420
Yup.

602
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,150
Ms. K of Dongjak-gu.

603
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:21,600
Give me some rain.

604
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:28,670
When it rains, we will return to that day.

605
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,750
That umbrella...

606
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,640
I had lost it that day, but I found it.

607
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:05,580
Now that I think about it,

608
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,790
I chased after you that day too.

609
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,290
You chased after me?

610
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,900
Wasn't it because I had
taken your umbrella?

611
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,560
The thing is, I actually
switched the umbrellas.

612
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,680
We were seated like this
when we first met, right?

613
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,290
You were so funny.

614
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,050
You yelled out "pressure cooker,"
so everyone knew

615
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,710
that it was your story on the radio.

616
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,720
Was it really love at first sight for you?

617
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,050
Let's not go overboard.

618
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,880
I just found you funny.

619
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,810
But you said you switched the umbrellas.

620
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,320
I did.

621
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,890
Our umbrellas looked similar,

622
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:57,700
so I put mine next to yours,

623
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,600
and lo and behold, you walked off with mine.

624
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:05,160
Little boys tend to pull pranks
on girls they like.

625
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,130
If I did start liking you back then,

626
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,300
I'll probably try to hit on you again

627
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,570
when we meet after the switchover.

628
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:17,120
If you did start liking me then,

629
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,960
you will at least be interested in me

630
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,760
once you return to your own body.

631
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,920
Even if you lose your memory,

632
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,110
I wish a miracle would unfold

633
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:40,950
and you would fall for me

634
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:47,750
when we see each other again.

635
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,860
When I come to hit on you again,

636
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,010
you latch on to me first.

637
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:02,660
Even if I'm mean and rude

638
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,450
when I appear before you,

639
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,660
endure and don't let me go.

640
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:11,740
I'll continue to remember as I've promised.

641
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,810
Be honest and sincere like you're being now

642
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,320
when I wake up and can't remember.

643
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,110
Then

644
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,900
we will be able to return
to our time right now.

645
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:31,220
Okay. Look at me.

646
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:37,530
If I'm honest and sincere,

647
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,840
you will

648
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,730
return to our time right now.

649
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,780
I've just hypnotized you.

650
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:52,800
Yup.

651
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,350
You should go, right?

652
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,870
We should say goodbye.

653
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,240
So long.

654
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:21,720
Bye.

655
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:34,280
It makes no sense that my memory

656
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,150
of all this will vanish.

657
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:49,190
I was going to leave without
saying this to you.

658
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:54,920
I wanted to tell you when I returned,

659
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,440
but Gil Da Ran,

660
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,340
I love you.

661
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,950
[1 year later]

662
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,500
The two have returned
to their respective bodies.

663
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,020
Neither of them remembers anything
that happened after the accident.

664
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:21,590
Gyeong Jun doesn't ask me about you,

665
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,930
so I won't tell him anything

666
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,370
just as I had promised him.

667
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:33,160
And I will continue to remember

668
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,630
just as I had promised Gyeong Jun.

669
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:49,050
She's gotten a lot better.
I think you can take her home.

670
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,700
Thank you, doctor.

671
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,370
Yay!

672
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,220
[What do you need?]
Play music.

673
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,240
Geum Dong.

674
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,410
I think he moved.

675
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:37,270
Okay.

676
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:38,750
Da Ran's coming today, right?

677
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:42,610
Yes. She said she'd stop by
at her old school first though.

678
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,760
We should pack some dumplings
and side dishes for her.

679
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,220
I've already packed them.

680
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,580
Is that for Da Ran?

681
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,070
Nope. I'm sending this to Mary.

682
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,630
Again?

683
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:59,860
Does Mary actually eat the dumplings?

684
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,920
I'll be right back.

685
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:11,690
Gil Chung Sik, long time no see.

686
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,840
Mary.

687
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,100
Ashley likes

688
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,320
the dumplings you send every week.

689
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,150
Who's Ashley?

690
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,080
Our dog.

691
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:29,190
I'm glad the dog you love so much
likes my dumplings.

692
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,360
What are you doing in Korea anyway?

693
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,390
I'm here to receive an award.

694
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,770
What award?

695
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:38,710
My entry for the Seoul International
Photography Contest won.

696
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:42,550
Wow. Are you using the skills you honed
as Kang Gyeong Jun's paparazzi

697
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,100
to become a photographer?

698
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,650
Yup.

699
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,580
Mary,

700
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,640
I realized I don't have

701
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,400
a single picture of us together.

702
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,750
Would you snap a picture of us for me?

703
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,060
- Really?
- Yup.

704
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,380
- Ready?
- Yeah.

705
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,100
1, 2, 3.

706
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:20,830
What do you think?

707
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,500
Not bad.

708
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,660
I'll value and cherish it.

709
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,290
Have you tried any of my dumplings

710
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:33,910
that Ashley couldn't finish?

711
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,150
Yup.

712
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,880
How would you rate it?

713
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,310
Huh?

714
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,880
The taste of the dumplings.

715
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,780
How would you rate my dumplings?

716
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,560
Just the taste? 1 point.

717
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,020
I finally got 1 point.

718
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,140
It's just 1 point. Geez.

719
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,920
I'll keep sending them

720
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,170
until you give me 2 points.

721
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,320
Ashley will turn into a pig.

722
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,140
How can a dog turn into a pig?

723
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,770
May I help you?

724
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:21,350
Oh.

725
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:24,250
Hello. I used to live here.

726
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,640
I was just passing by.

727
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,810
It's just as it used to be.

728
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,370
There was a guy who came by earlier
who said he used to live here too.

729
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:42,890
A guy?

730
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:46,260
He said he used to live here alone.

731
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,360
Today is when the love of my life was born.

732
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,990
Please wish him a happy birthday.

733
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:03,390
I wish everyone else

734
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:06,400
who was born on June 24

735
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,990
a happy birthday.

736
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,840
And happy birthday to you too, Gyeong Jun.

737
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,960
I'm planning to go and see him next month

738
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,090
for the comeback greeting
that has been a long time coming.

739
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:25,040
He won't remember,

740
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,330
but I'll tell him everything
I've kept in my memory.

741
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,590
10:10.

742
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:39,330
The time is now 10:10.

743
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,510
Gil Da Ran,

744
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:25,860
when I come to hit on you again,

745
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,690
you latch on to me first.

746
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,260
Hi, Kang Gyeong Jun.

747
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:38,540
It's been a long time, Gil Teacher.

748
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,280
I just came by to see how you were.

749
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:45,660
I know you're here to hit on me.

750
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,160
Don't go overboard.

751
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,980
Give me some personal space, will you?

752
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,330
Even if I'm mean and rude

753
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,590
when I appear before you,

754
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,290
endure and don't let me go.

755
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,050
Be honest and sincere like you're being now

756
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:30,270
when I wake up and can't remember.

757
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,670
Then

758
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:41,760
we will be able to return
to our time right now.

759
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:10,300
I love you.

760
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,600
At the moment,

761
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,690
my heart will grow

762
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:21,930
as big as it is now

763
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:26,290
like a miracle.

764
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:58,200
Thank you for watching "Big."

765
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:21,406
[Big]
