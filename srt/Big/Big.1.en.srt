00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,843
[Episode 1]
Excuse me.

2
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:12,010
Sorry. Excuse me.

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,044
Oops.

4
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:14,843
Sorry. Excuse me.

5
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:16,910
Thank you.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,511
Please be careful. It's the bridal bouquet.

7
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,511
Bouquet delivery. The bouquet is here...

8
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:40,344
What took you so long...

9
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:42,944
Da Ran.

10
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:44,377
Huh?

11
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,843
Min Ju... You're the bride?

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,077
Hi.

13
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:53,010
Hi. Long time no see.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,511
You guys are all here.

15
00:00:55,611 --> 00:01:00,477
I figured you'd be busy studying
for the teacher certification exam.

16
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,444
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:03,010
Don't worry about it.

18
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:05,244
Congratulations.

19
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:06,678
Thanks.

20
00:01:06,678 --> 00:01:09,010
Could the friends gather closer to the bride?

21
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,710
Closer.

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,344
Would you like to be in the picture?

23
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:21,843
It's okay. I have other deliveries
to make. I have to run.

24
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:23,077
It was nice seeing you.

25
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:25,077
Congratulations, Min Ju. Bye.

26
00:01:25,077 --> 00:01:27,077
Bye!

27
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:30,777
Could I get a parking stamp?

28
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:47,611
I'd also like a meal ticket.

29
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:51,843
I have to pass the exam this time.

30
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,010
They're excluding me, because
they all passed and I didn't.

31
00:01:56,843 --> 00:01:58,544
I'll never get married if I don't pass.

32
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:06,977
Hello?

33
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:10,411
Of course, it's been delivered.
I'll be right there.

34
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:14,010
Pardon? It was the wrong bouquet?

35
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,311
Of course, the ceremony has started.

36
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:21,010
How is that my responsibility?

37
00:02:27,977 --> 00:02:29,843
Da Ran, you haven't left yet?

38
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:33,544
As a friend, I figured I should stay
until the very end.

39
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,277
That Minju is one lucky girl.

40
00:02:37,277 --> 00:02:40,144
She got a $1,000 bouquet
when she only paid $300.

41
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:43,077
I have to get that back.

42
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:46,743
I made my cash gift, too.
I deserve to be here.

43
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:48,110
Come on.

44
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:44,377
I didn't get to catch my friend's bouquet,

45
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:46,777
but I made a much bigger catch.

46
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:49,644
I fell down 36 steps of stairs

47
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:52,077
and fractured my tailbone and wrist.

48
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:54,044
I couldn't take the certification exam,
which was just a week away

49
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:56,411
as I was hospitalized for 2 months.

50
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,810
The guy from the wedding
took care of me the whole time.

51
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,977
Turns out, he was a doctor.

52
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,210
He proposed to me on the day
he removed my cast,

53
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,110
and we're getting married in a month.

54
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,444
I'd fall down 36 steps of stairs

55
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:12,010
for such a serendipitous encounter.

56
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,511
I'm back to studying
for the teacher certification exam.

57
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:18,344
I've taken on a temporary teaching position
at a high school this spring.

58
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:22,477
Please cheer me on so that I can be
a good wife and a good teacher.

59
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:24,977
Thank you for sending us your story,
Ms. K of Dongjak-gu.

60
00:04:24,977 --> 00:04:27,877
We're rooting for you.
We're also sending you a gift.

61
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:31,044
It's an electric pressure cooker.

62
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:35,277
We'll say bye for today with
Lee Seung Gi's "Will You Marry Me."

63
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:18,710
Why was he staring at me like that?

64
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,044
Excuse me.

65
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:49,843
Are you following me?

66
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:52,611
I'm so sorry,

67
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:59,344
but I'm engaged.

68
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:05,544
And I'm a lot older than I look.

69
00:06:05,544 --> 00:06:07,144
Please don't be like this.

70
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:12,944
This is a no-no.

71
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:16,077
This is mine. It's my umbrella.

72
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,077
Huh?

73
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,311
You took my umbrella,
which is why I followed you.

74
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:21,678
- Let go.
- Huh?

75
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:22,877
Oh, no. Oh, no.

76
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:24,377
Then where's my umbrella?

77
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:25,377
You left it on the bus.

78
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:27,344
So you didn't bring it?

79
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:29,944
Why would I touch someone else's umbrella?

80
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:33,843
If I took your umbrella, you should've
brought me mine.

81
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,044
You need to take better care
of your own things.

82
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:38,177
Hey!

83
00:06:38,177 --> 00:06:40,077
You kept staring at me,

84
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,910
so I got flustered and got off
with the wrong umbrella.

85
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,210
You did stare at me, didn't you? Didn't you?

86
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,244
So?

87
00:06:45,244 --> 00:06:46,511
You did stare at me.

88
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:49,277
You were staring at me
with a strange smile on your face.

89
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:51,477
- I did.
- Yes, I did.

90
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,910
You made me laugh.

91
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,511
I was listening to the radio and looked over
because you looked funny.

92
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:02,544
It's an electric pressure cooker.

93
00:07:02,544 --> 00:07:04,843
Alright!

94
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:17,743
So that's why you were staring at me.

95
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:18,944
And I wasn't the only one.

96
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:21,743
Everyone on the bus was staring at you.

97
00:07:21,743 --> 00:07:24,344
But I must've been the only one you noticed.

98
00:07:25,977 --> 00:07:27,444
I'm not surprised.

99
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:29,710
You didn't take notice
of the older men or ladies.

100
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,511
All you cared about was
the young, handsome guy.

101
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:35,877
You got caught up in your own fantasy
and took off with my umbrella.

102
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:37,810
What?

103
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,244
"Are you following me?"

104
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:41,910
Oh my god!

105
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,944
Are you going to keep following me around?

106
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,344
No. I'm taking off.

107
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,944
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
I do wish you had picked up my umbrella.

108
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:56,177
Bye.

109
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:03,977
This is where you work?

110
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,743
It's none of your business.

111
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:17,578
Good morning.

112
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:18,710
Hi.

113
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:28,611
Ms. Gil Da Ran.

114
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:30,511
You look cool and refreshed.

115
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:35,710
I lost my umbrella, so I got a bit wet.

116
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,444
Ms. Gil,

117
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:40,411
did you have time to have breakfast?

118
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:41,710
Yes.

119
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,544
Wow.

120
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:49,377
Seems like your stomach is
smarter than your head.

121
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:52,077
Even though you're only here temporarily,

122
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:54,944
don't forget you're a teacher.
Act accordingly.

123
00:08:54,944 --> 00:08:59,877
If you're going to keep losing
your umbrella, put it in your stomach.

124
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:15,544
What do you want?

125
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:17,810
I'm a transfer student.

126
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:30,344
Kang Gyeong Jun has transferred

127
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:32,877
from Benjamin Franklin High School,

128
00:09:32,877 --> 00:09:36,810
one of the most prestigious schools
on the West Coast.

129
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,544
His academic records are impressive.

130
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:42,777
Now that he's joining us,

131
00:09:42,777 --> 00:09:49,210
please show him Jeil High School is
just as good as any American prep school.

132
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,611
Ms. Gil Da Ran.

133
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:51,743
Yes?

134
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:54,210
Were your eyes closed just now?

135
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:59,877
No, ma'am. I was just blinking.

136
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:05,010
If you're done with your
extremely long blink,

137
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,611
please take Gyeong Jun
on a tour of the school.

138
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:17,311
Ms. Gil Da Ran,

139
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:19,644
may I follow you this time around?

140
00:10:21,877 --> 00:10:23,311
Follow me.

141
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:29,277
Korean schools are no different
from American schools, right?

142
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:33,344
I'm sure Benjamin whatever school
is similar to this place.

143
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:36,210
This school's much smaller.

144
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,177
Be that as it may, we have
everything you need.

145
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:40,110
I don't think there's much here.

146
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:43,910
Kang Gyeong Jun,

147
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,678
I let it slide earlier thinking
we'd never meet again,

148
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:52,544
but you should mind your manners.
Address me as ma'am or Ms. Gil.

149
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:54,511
I was just talking to myself.

150
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:57,611
I can't even talk to myself?

151
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:01,277
Sure you can,

152
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:03,411
but you should be more courteous, okay?

153
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:05,977
I'll show you the library first.

154
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,710
I'm all set with that.

155
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,344
Where's the gym?

156
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:14,477
Where is it?

157
00:11:14,477 --> 00:11:17,810
Don't tell me you were
talking to yourself again.

158
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,077
My Korean is still shoddy.

159
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:23,210
Sorry.

160
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:29,477
You need to learn how things
are done here in Korea.

161
00:11:29,477 --> 00:11:33,277
Commit this to memory
as it is very important.

162
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,244
I'm a teacher, and you're a student.

163
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:41,244
I'm a teacher, you're a student, okay?

164
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:42,843
Okay, Gil Da Ran.

165
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:44,210
Gil Da Ran?

166
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,110
Teacher. Teacher. I'm your teacher.

167
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,977
Okay, Gil Teacher.

168
00:11:48,977 --> 00:11:50,944
Gil Teacher?

169
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:53,444
This is the computer room.

170
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,377
Don't get on my nerves or you're dead meat.

171
00:11:58,377 --> 00:12:00,544
How would I say that in English?

172
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:02,611
It's Yun Jae.

173
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:04,311
Yun Jae.

174
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,044
I can talk. I wasn't doing anything.

175
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:14,244
Where should we meet for dinner tonight?

176
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:18,544
Oh, you're busy.

177
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:20,344
It's okay.

178
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:21,743
She got stood up.

179
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:25,244
Really? I can come to the hospital?

180
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,444
No. I'm free as a bird. I can come.

181
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:33,110
Okay. I'll bring you something delicious.

182
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,877
Okay. See you later.

183
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:42,544
The doctor you snatched
by fracturing your tailbone?

184
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:45,910
Radio. Ms. K of Dongjak-gu.

185
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,210
Kang Gyeong Jun, can you keep
the radio story a secret?

186
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,743
I had no idea a student at this school

187
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:56,678
would ever find out

188
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:59,177
I was the Ms. K of Dongjak-gu.

189
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:01,344
I had only sent in my story for fun...

190
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:03,244
And for the pressure cooker.

191
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:05,044
That's true...

192
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:06,010
Okay.

193
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,110
Okay?

194
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,444
But stop pestering me about
my lack of courtesy,

195
00:13:12,444 --> 00:13:14,511
Ms. Gil Da Ran.

196
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,810
I won't nag you anymore. But I do hope
your Korean becomes more courteous.

197
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,743
Let's go.

198
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,177
I'm all set.

199
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:26,511
Kang Gyeong Jun!

200
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:28,077
Geez.

201
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:32,411
Why jump out the window
when you can use the door?

202
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,977
Kids will be kids. He thinks he's so cool.

203
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,344
Good grief.

204
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,210
Hey.

205
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,877
I heard you're from the States.

206
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:03,944
I have a friend who's going
to school in the States.

207
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:10,344
Do you know Bang Min Sik?

208
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:11,843
He left for the States in middle school.

209
00:14:19,411 --> 00:14:20,710
Wow. He spoke English.

210
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,377
He's good.

211
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,344
My name is Gil Chung Sik.

212
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:37,877
Are you... Can... Korea?

213
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:41,743
Hey,

214
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:44,810
can't you speak Korean?

215
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:48,377
Can't you understand me?

216
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:49,843
Stupid.

217
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:50,877
Stu...

218
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:53,210
Hang on.

219
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,311
What did he just say?

220
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,077
That's what Krystal always
says in that sitcom.

221
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:01,411
Stupid.

222
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:04,644
That's an insult.

223
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:08,010
You understood what I said
and insulted me.

224
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:16,144
If you understand Korean,
speak Korean, jerk.

225
00:15:16,144 --> 00:15:18,843
Stop getting on my nerves.
Leave me alone.

226
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:22,110
What the...

227
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:24,843
Hey!

228
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,810
Really?

229
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,144
Gil Chung Sik, you know school violence
is unacceptable.

230
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:53,344
Do you want a beating?

231
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:54,877
I haven't thrown a single punch yet.

232
00:15:54,877 --> 00:15:57,810
Yet? So you mean...

233
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,244
Can teachers beat up students
like that in Korea?

234
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:02,144
No.

235
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:04,477
Shouldn't someone report her?

236
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:07,611
She's Chung Sik's sister.

237
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:11,644
Sister?

238
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,311
Let me see.

239
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,110
No. Leave me alone.

240
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:25,910
You don't have to get good grades,
but violence is a no-no.

241
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,411
He disrespected me and got on my nerves.

242
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:31,477
That's no reason to resort to violence.

243
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:33,444
Oh, look.

244
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:36,044
You got a scratch.

245
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,877
Am I bleeding?

246
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:40,578
I'm going to tell dad you beat up a student.

247
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:43,010
You'll get an earful from mom if you do.

248
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,777
I don't think it'll leave a scar.

249
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:46,777
You should get to class. Let's go.

250
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:49,144
I'm sorry I beat you up.

251
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,077
I let you beat me up.

252
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,077
Hello.

253
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:49,477
Hello.

254
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,411
Are you here to see Yun Jae?

255
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:53,944
Yes. I'm here to have dinner with him.

256
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:57,644
The wedding's coming up, right?
When is it exactly?

257
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,877
Didn't he give you an invitation?

258
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:05,244
No. He hasn't given them out yet.

259
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:07,377
He's been so busy. It must've
slipped his mind.

260
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,077
You should remind him.

261
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:10,477
Okay.

262
00:18:57,377 --> 00:19:01,611
The furniture and appliances are new,
so we don't need anything.

263
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:06,177
But still...

264
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:10,277
At the very least, we should
get a nice big bed.

265
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:14,810
That's true. We do need a new bed.

266
00:19:15,777 --> 00:19:18,311
There's a bed I've had my eyes on.

267
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:23,277
It's nice and big. It's comfortable, too.

268
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,210
How wide is it?

269
00:19:25,843 --> 00:19:28,777
This wide.

270
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:31,877
Wait. Maybe it's wider.

271
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:35,311
This wide?

272
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,277
Pardon?

273
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:44,611
Yes.

274
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:49,377
That should be wide enough.

275
00:19:50,777 --> 00:19:52,743
Yes.

276
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:21,477
He hasn't even opened
the box of invitations.

277
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,344
Isn't he even curious how they came out?

278
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:27,777
[Groom: Seo Yun Jae
Bride: Gil Da Ran]

279
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:28,777
[200 wedding invitations]

280
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,743
Dad.

281
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:48,010
Hi, Da Ran.

282
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,944
You're still here?

283
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:51,311
Yeah.

284
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:54,843
Are you on your way back
from seeing Yun Jae?

285
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:56,810
Yes.

286
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,644
It would be nice if you could
have the wedding

287
00:20:59,644 --> 00:21:02,244
after you pass the exam
and become a certified teacher.

288
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:04,444
There's no guarantee that I'll pass though.

289
00:21:04,444 --> 00:21:05,877
You have to pass.

290
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,977
You have to take the exam seriously

291
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,477
even if you're marrying a doctor.

292
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:14,110
I'm studying hard for it.

293
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:18,244
I have to focus on schoolwork.

294
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,578
Look who's talking.

295
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,644
What's that?

296
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:22,944
I'm planning to turn your room

297
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:26,544
into a fitness room once you get married.

298
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:30,877
Your sister has to study.
That would just clutter up her room.

299
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:32,877
This isn't the time for Da Ran
to be studying.

300
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:37,044
She has to focus on dieting
and getting facials before the wedding.

301
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:40,578
Getting her teaching certificate is how
she can best prepare for her wedding.

302
00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:43,411
Wash up and hit the books, Da Ran.

303
00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:45,010
Okay.

304
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,511
Hon. Hon.

305
00:21:47,511 --> 00:21:49,710
Are you upset?

306
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:55,010
Da Ran.

307
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:58,444
How's Yun Jae doing at the hospital?

308
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,877
I should stop by one of these days.

309
00:22:02,877 --> 00:22:06,644
Don't you ever show up
there unannounced.

310
00:22:12,377 --> 00:22:15,843
You seem busy, so I'm taking off.

311
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:20,077
We're going furniture shopping
tomorrow, so see you then.

312
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,210
This is the bike you wanted, right?

313
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,444
Here are the keys.

314
00:22:42,177 --> 00:22:47,944
It took a lot of effort for me
to find this for you.

315
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:52,477
Let's set the record straight.

316
00:22:53,277 --> 00:22:55,277
You got it with the money mom left behind,

317
00:22:55,277 --> 00:22:59,311
so technically, you didn't buy it.

318
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:04,810
Fine. I merely did the shopping.

319
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,010
Gyeong Jun.

320
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:13,611
That bed you brought from the States
is for little kids.

321
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:16,277
Would you like a new one?

322
00:23:17,177 --> 00:23:18,477
I'm all set.

323
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:20,710
It's the only bed I can fall asleep in.

324
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:23,010
Maybe you're having
a hard time sleeping

325
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,810
because this place is
way too big and empty.

326
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,977
Yeah.

327
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:32,044
It's a bit big for one person.

328
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:37,177
How about moving to a smaller place?

329
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:39,177
I'm all set.

330
00:23:39,177 --> 00:23:43,010
Mom bought this place. I want to stay here.

331
00:23:58,411 --> 00:24:02,010
You're a big boy now, aren't you?

332
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:09,877
Being able to sleep alone is a sign
that you're big enough.

333
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:11,377
Ready to go to sleep?

334
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:15,177
Good boy.

335
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:18,377
Close your eyes.

336
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:21,277
You're my angel.

337
00:24:24,044 --> 00:24:25,678
Big enough.

338
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:28,444
I'm big enough now.

339
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:39,743
Isn't it a nice bed?

340
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:43,010
This is the last one we have left.

341
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,843
It looks okay, but I need to test it out.

342
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,044
I'll take it if it lulls me to sleep.

343
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,210
You're back.

344
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,044
I wanted to see that bed one last time
before buying it.

345
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:06,077
Someone else is looking at it right now.

346
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,877
Huh?

347
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:11,777
Is he sleeping?

348
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:15,077
He said he'd take it
if he could fall sleep on it.

349
00:25:15,077 --> 00:25:17,144
And I think he just might.

350
00:25:17,144 --> 00:25:18,578
Excuse me.

351
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:21,843
But I had been eyeing it.

352
00:25:24,511 --> 00:25:25,644
But...

353
00:25:25,644 --> 00:25:29,177
I really want this...

354
00:25:49,177 --> 00:25:50,411
Huh?

355
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:57,311
I'm here to get furniture
for my marital home.

356
00:25:57,311 --> 00:26:01,710
Are you really going to buy this bed?

357
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,444
I'm thinking about it.

358
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,511
This place has a lot of nice furniture,

359
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:08,277
but this bed isn't all that great.

360
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,411
I think it's fine.

361
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:11,977
I've been looking at
a lot of furniture lately,

362
00:26:11,977 --> 00:26:14,710
and I heard this kind of material
aggravates atopic dermatitis.

363
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:16,678
I don't have atopic dermatitis.

364
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:21,244
And this may look fancy,
but the poles are flimsy.

365
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:23,977
With your long legs, you could
accidentally knock this down.

366
00:26:23,977 --> 00:26:25,944
See how this thing shakes.

367
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:27,544
Yeah?

368
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,777
Look how thin and flimsy it is up here.

369
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:32,810
Look at this.

370
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,377
Why would I ever pull down on it like that?

371
00:26:34,377 --> 00:26:37,177
Who knows? You might grab it as you wake up.

372
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,044
This thing would snap
if you pulled down on it.

373
00:26:42,944 --> 00:26:48,444
Please fill out this form
for the damaged bed.

374
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:56,010
He liked it, too.

375
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:04,277
This place has the best beef stew in Korea.

376
00:27:04,277 --> 00:27:06,044
Eat while it's still nice and hot.

377
00:27:15,578 --> 00:27:17,777
About the bed earlier...

378
00:27:17,777 --> 00:27:21,144
The damaged part won't compromise
the bed's quality in any way.

379
00:27:21,144 --> 00:27:24,244
And once it's repaired, you won't
even notice the damaged area.

380
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:26,511
It's not like anyone would
look way up there anyway.

381
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,743
That's right.

382
00:27:27,743 --> 00:27:31,044
How about I give you a great deal on it?

383
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:32,544
How great a deal?

384
00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:34,743
- I'll slash $200.
- $500.

385
00:27:34,743 --> 00:27:37,144
- $300?
- $500.

386
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:39,910
- $400?
- $500.

387
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:42,611
Fine. $500.

388
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:43,977
So you're taking it, okay?

389
00:27:43,977 --> 00:27:45,411
No.

390
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:47,710
But you were going to get it earlier.

391
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,944
No, I wasn't.

392
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,910
But I want a perfect marital bed.

393
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,377
Couldn't you just be
a good sport and take it?

394
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:58,210
I wasn't going to buy it.
I was just taking a look at it.

395
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,477
I'm just a kid. I don't have the money.

396
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:03,244
Weren't your parents
going to get it for you?

397
00:28:03,244 --> 00:28:06,344
Didn't you see my papers?

398
00:28:06,344 --> 00:28:07,944
I'm an orphan.

399
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:09,977
I don't have parents who can
buy me such things.

400
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:11,444
I'm sorry.

401
00:28:26,177 --> 00:28:27,843
Yun Jae.

402
00:28:29,277 --> 00:28:32,277
Oh, you can't come?

403
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,144
You're busy.

404
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:37,944
Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

405
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:41,277
Okay. Okay.

406
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:09,977
- Are you done with the surgery?
- Yeah.

407
00:29:09,977 --> 00:29:11,611
I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.

408
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:14,678
Seo Yun Jae, when are you giving us
the wedding invitations?

409
00:29:14,678 --> 00:29:17,678
Yeah. Haven't they been printed yet?

410
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:20,977
No. Not yet.

411
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:24,277
Get changed. Let's go eat.

412
00:29:24,277 --> 00:29:25,511
Okay.

413
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,578
I can't be dozing off right now.

414
00:30:00,044 --> 00:30:02,444
The vice principal will kill me if I'm late.

415
00:30:02,444 --> 00:30:04,277
Oh, boy.

416
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:22,977
Darn it.

417
00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:24,611
Come here.

418
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:29,910
Hey, transfer student.

419
00:30:31,311 --> 00:30:33,843
Where's your uniform?

420
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:35,678
I haven't been able to get it yet.

421
00:30:35,678 --> 00:30:39,344
You don't want penalty points.
Get it by the end of this week.

422
00:30:39,344 --> 00:30:40,544
Yes, sir.

423
00:30:42,244 --> 00:30:44,344
Good morning, Mr. Na.

424
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:49,877
Come this way. Your buttons.

425
00:30:51,411 --> 00:30:52,910
You.

426
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,843
Come here.

427
00:31:04,144 --> 00:31:05,810
Sit down.

428
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,611
What is it?

429
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:13,678
I saw earlier.

430
00:31:15,544 --> 00:31:17,477
You can't come to school dressed like that.

431
00:31:17,477 --> 00:31:20,210
Schools have rules.

432
00:31:24,411 --> 00:31:29,110
It didn't cost me anything,
so don't worry, okay?

433
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,777
Wear this uniform from now on,
and don't forget your name tag either.

434
00:31:33,777 --> 00:31:36,578
I saw you had your hands
in your pockets earlier.

435
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:38,144
That's considered impolite in Korea.

436
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,611
I said I was an orphan.
I never said I was poor.

437
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,210
She has a wild imagination.

438
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,244
Gil Teacher.

439
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:06,477
I can see why this didn't cost her anything.

440
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:08,144
What cheap fabric.

441
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,904
[Seo Yun Jae, Incheon to LA]

442
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,144
Let's start the class.

443
00:32:48,644 --> 00:32:50,544
Attention. Hello, Ms. Gil.

444
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:52,144
Hello, Ms. Gil.

445
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,843
What page are we on?

446
00:33:01,843 --> 00:33:05,477
Why don't you sit down and teach, Ms. Gil?

447
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:09,877
I've never seen that cushion before.

448
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:12,077
We got it just for you.

449
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:16,110
You suffered a fractured tailbone.

450
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:25,044
Don't write anything on the board.
You might strain your wrist.

451
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,877
I'm fine.

452
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,611
Let's settle down.

453
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:37,611
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

454
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:40,578
Thank you for the broken tailbone

455
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:45,077
that got me my husband. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

456
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:50,177
Thank you even more
that he turned out to be a doctor.

457
00:33:50,177 --> 00:33:51,411
Be quiet.

458
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:54,810
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. Everybody!

459
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,977
Be quiet and take down these notes.

460
00:33:56,977 --> 00:34:02,977
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

461
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:04,210
Stop it.

462
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,644
They're kids. They goof around.

463
00:34:15,644 --> 00:34:17,444
Don't worry about it.

464
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,110
It's still embarrassing though.

465
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,877
What's there to be embarrassed about?

466
00:34:24,877 --> 00:34:28,678
Your broken wrist got you a fine husband.

467
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:30,311
What's wrong with that?

468
00:34:30,311 --> 00:34:33,244
What if it was the other way around?

469
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:36,678
What if I were marrying a nobody whose wrist
I had accidentally broken?

470
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:38,144
That would be a real shame...

471
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:39,910
Oh, boy.

472
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,877
I mean, it would be

473
00:34:43,877 --> 00:34:45,477
a romantic love story.

474
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:48,144
Yeah. A love story.

475
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:51,810
Love story...

476
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,210
That's right.

477
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,678
A couple that marries without
considering one another's jobs

478
00:34:55,678 --> 00:35:00,344
or backgrounds is a truly romantic one.

479
00:35:00,344 --> 00:35:03,010
Let's clock out.

480
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:07,810
You and Yun Jae are going to see
your marital home, right?

481
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,144
Wow.

482
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:12,710
I'm so jealous.

483
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,544
I'll see you tomorrow.

484
00:36:05,877 --> 00:36:08,477
[Yun Jae, when will you be getting here?]

485
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,044
Yun Jae.

486
00:36:21,044 --> 00:36:23,444
Where are you?

487
00:36:25,944 --> 00:36:29,344
Oh, really?

488
00:36:30,544 --> 00:36:36,144
But you should see it. It'll be our home.

489
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,743
I'm sorry, Da Ran.

490
00:36:40,277 --> 00:36:42,910
Is it that busy at the hospital?

491
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,377
Something came up unexpectedly.

492
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,010
Oh, really?

493
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,611
It's okay.

494
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:57,544
I'm sure you have no other choice.

495
00:36:59,544 --> 00:37:03,411
Are you sure you're okay?

496
00:37:08,344 --> 00:37:10,210
Honestly,

497
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:14,843
I'm not okay.

498
00:37:14,843 --> 00:37:17,077
This is really hard.

499
00:37:17,077 --> 00:37:24,644
You said you'd marry me, because you were
sorry about what happened.

500
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:27,044
Are you...

501
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,611
Are you really

502
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:34,110
just marrying me because you're sorry?

503
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:39,843
Do you even love me at all?

504
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:43,511
If you don't, you don't have to marry me.

505
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:50,344
Not bad.

506
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:51,777
She laid it all out.

507
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,544
Oh, no.

508
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,777
I must have lost it.

509
00:38:01,777 --> 00:38:04,010
What's the matter with me?

510
00:38:05,177 --> 00:38:07,411
What am I going to tell him?

511
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,277
What should I say?

512
00:38:11,277 --> 00:38:12,977
Give it back.

513
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:16,644
Are you out of your mind?

514
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,411
Yeah.

515
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:43,578
I don't know how you managed
to talk me into coming here,

516
00:38:43,578 --> 00:38:47,710
but had I called him back
and said I was taking it all back,

517
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,743
it would've made me feel very pathetic.

518
00:38:50,877 --> 00:38:53,477
Thank you for stopping me, Gyeong Jun.

519
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,910
How did we end up all the way out here?

520
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,877
And why I did I have to get myself
involved in this mess?

521
00:39:00,377 --> 00:39:02,177
I know how you feel.

522
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:04,377
What do you know?

523
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:06,877
Why are you smiling?

524
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,344
What's your delusion this time?

525
00:39:09,344 --> 00:39:10,944
What do you know about my feelings?

526
00:39:10,944 --> 00:39:13,177
I know you're sorry.

527
00:39:13,177 --> 00:39:16,910
You told the whole school
about the radio story.

528
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,144
What?

529
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,843
It's okay. It's not like you made up a lie.

530
00:39:22,377 --> 00:39:24,010
It wasn't me.

531
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,644
I've better things to do than gossip.

532
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:27,977
Okay. Fine.

533
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:30,044
I swear it wasn't me.

534
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:34,144
I'm not like my immature classmates.

535
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:38,743
To me, you're a kid, just like them.

536
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,411
What can you do? You're young.

537
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:44,144
It must be very nice to be so old.

538
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:47,344
Thank you for being so understanding
of my immaturity.

539
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,311
That's not how you do it.

540
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:51,777
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

541
00:39:51,777 --> 00:39:53,044
There's a rhythm to it.

542
00:39:53,044 --> 00:39:54,877
Forget it.

543
00:39:54,877 --> 00:39:57,578
Thank you very much. This comedy routine
is all the rage these days.

544
00:39:57,578 --> 00:40:00,077
You can't make friends if you don't know
the latest in pop culture.

545
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:02,210
Don't tell me you don't know this.

546
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,678
I don't.

547
00:40:03,678 --> 00:40:05,611
No?

548
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,277
How educational.

549
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:09,444
Do it. You need to know these things.

550
00:40:10,877 --> 00:40:12,144
What are you doing?

551
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,578
Come on. You need to be able to do it.

552
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:16,810
Your phone.

553
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,277
Yes.

554
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:25,244
Yun Jae.

555
00:40:27,444 --> 00:40:31,444
I'm sorry I upset you.

556
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:39,277
Could you ask me the question
you had asked earlier?

557
00:40:41,344 --> 00:40:43,377
Do you

558
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:47,944
love me?

559
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:51,910
Where are you right now?

560
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,810
I'll answer you in person.

561
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,544
You want to come to where I am?

562
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:02,810
I'm... I'm...

563
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,477
Where am I?

564
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:08,144
I came down along the river

565
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,244
past the Olympic Expressway.

566
00:41:12,877 --> 00:41:14,578
Giddy as can be.

567
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:18,077
I think I also passed Misari.

568
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,177
It'll be a long way back. I need gas money.

569
00:41:31,544 --> 00:41:33,010
Gyeong Jun.

570
00:46:59,377 --> 00:47:03,810
Once you ID the deceased, please contact
the rest of his family.

571
00:47:04,244 --> 00:47:05,644
Okay.

572
00:47:08,678 --> 00:47:09,944
I...

573
00:47:09,944 --> 00:47:12,843
Wait. I can't walk.

574
00:47:12,843 --> 00:47:14,710
Are you okay?

575
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:17,977
I'd like to sit here for a while.

576
00:47:17,977 --> 00:47:20,177
Then collect yourself here.

577
00:47:20,177 --> 00:47:21,544
Okay.

Do you know Gyeong Jun?

603
00:52:43,944 --> 00:52:49,144
I got into an accident on my way home
from where I left you.

604
00:52:49,144 --> 00:52:51,477
I think I hit the guard rail
and fell into the river.

605
00:52:51,477 --> 00:52:54,743
And this is how I was when I woke up.
I don't know how this happened.

606
00:52:55,511 --> 00:52:59,511
You were on your way to see me
when you got into an accident.

607
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:01,611
They said you had died.

608
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,077
They said you were dead.

609
00:53:04,077 --> 00:53:05,910
I couldn't believe it...

610
00:53:06,678 --> 00:53:09,678
Where am I then?

Is this me?

616
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:29,277
Am I dead?

617
00:53:29,944 --> 00:53:31,743
Yun Jae.

618
00:53:32,444 --> 00:53:34,544
Am I really dead?

619
00:53:36,144 --> 00:53:38,077
I was only 18.

620
00:53:38,077 --> 00:53:41,210
What's the matter with you, Yun Jae?

621
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,678
I'm dead?

622
00:53:45,344 --> 00:53:47,377
This is me.

623
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:53,344
What are you doing to the deceased?

624
00:53:59,411 --> 00:54:00,944
It's not me.

625
00:54:02,344 --> 00:54:05,678
Are you not feeling well?

626
00:54:05,678 --> 00:54:08,210
Let's go and get some tests done.

627
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:09,644
Gil Da Ran,

628
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:11,644
do I still look like Yun Jae to you?

629
00:54:12,277 --> 00:54:15,277
What's wrong, Yun Jae?

630
00:54:16,444 --> 00:54:20,344
It must be from the shock.

631
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,044
Please retrace your memory.

632
00:54:22,044 --> 00:54:24,411
You were on your way to see me.

633
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:27,477
You had something to tell me.

634
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:29,044
Don't you remember

635
00:54:29,044 --> 00:54:30,777
what I had asked you?

636
00:54:31,377 --> 00:54:33,444
What had you asked me?

637
00:54:36,144 --> 00:54:38,910
What I had asked you to tell me.
You remember, right?

638
00:54:41,944 --> 00:54:43,910
Go ahead. Tell me.

639
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:01,244
That's what you had asked me to say.

640
00:55:06,644 --> 00:55:09,277
What I had asked you was

641
00:55:09,277 --> 00:55:11,611
to tell me you loved me.

642
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:16,077
No. You had asked me to do this.

643
00:55:16,077 --> 00:55:18,110
How do you know that?

644
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,877
How do you know what I had
asked Gyeong Jun to do?

645
00:55:21,877 --> 00:55:24,644
Because I'm not Yun Jae.
I'm Kang Gyeong Jun.

646
00:55:39,311 --> 00:55:41,477
We're very puzzled ourselves,

647
00:55:41,477 --> 00:55:44,244
but Mr. Seo Yun Jae's condition
is surprisingly stable.

648
00:55:44,977 --> 00:55:49,311
But he seems like a different person.

649
00:55:49,311 --> 00:55:50,444
He's acting strangely.

650
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:51,977
It could be from shock.

651
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:54,944
We'll run more tests.

652
00:56:02,444 --> 00:56:05,010
Are you Seo Yun Jae, Gil Da Ran's fiance?

653
00:56:08,544 --> 00:56:13,544
There's not a scratch on you, but where am I?

654
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,678
We got a call about a traffic accident.

655
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:22,644
Where's Kang Gyeong Jun?

656
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:24,144
Kang Gyeong Jun?

657
00:56:24,144 --> 00:56:25,144
- Please come with me.
- Uncle Hyeok Su.

658
00:56:25,144 --> 00:56:26,444
Thank you.

659
00:56:36,244 --> 00:56:37,344
Gyeong Jun.

660
00:56:37,344 --> 00:56:39,477
Gyeong Jun. It's Uncle Hyeok Su. Gyeong Jun.

00:56:39,477 --> 00:56:40,611
Gyeong Jun.

662
00:56:40,611 --> 00:56:43,578
Gyeong Jun. Gyeong Jun.

663
00:56:43,578 --> 00:56:46,578
What's wrong with him? What's going on?

664
00:56:46,578 --> 00:56:49,743
He's in a coma.

665
00:57:38,344 --> 00:57:39,877
Mom.

666
00:58:16,877 --> 00:58:18,810
Yun Jae.

667
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,644
Yun Jae.

668
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,277
Yun Jae.

669
00:58:36,344 --> 00:58:37,977
Are you Kang Gyeong Jun's family?

670
00:58:37,977 --> 00:58:39,444
Yes.

671
00:58:41,377 --> 00:58:43,277
What happened? How did he get hurt?

672
00:58:43,277 --> 00:58:44,977
Was it a big accident?

673
00:58:44,977 --> 00:58:48,977
We were told his bike hit the guard rail
and then fell into the river.

674
00:58:49,511 --> 00:58:50,910
Kang Gyeong Jun?

675
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:55,611
I got into an accident on my way home
from where I left you.

676
00:58:55,611 --> 00:58:58,044
I think I hit the guard rail
and fell into the river.

677
00:58:58,044 --> 00:58:59,644
And this is how I was when I woke up.
I don't know how this happened.

678
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:01,843
No...

679
00:59:02,678 --> 00:59:06,877
It was Kang Gyeong Jun who got into
an accident with Yun Jae?

680
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,311
Because I'm not Yun Jae. I'm Kang Gyeong Jun.

681
00:59:12,377 --> 00:59:14,843
This can't be...

682
00:59:15,544 --> 00:59:18,877
Yun Jae. I have to find Yun Jae.

683
00:59:27,077 --> 00:59:28,777
Yun Jae.

684
00:59:30,843 --> 00:59:33,044
Yun Jae.

685
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:03,578
I'm not Yun Jae. I'm Kang Gyeong Jun.

686
01:00:08,286 --> 01:00:09,644
[Cute Aekyung, Mr. Na, Little Bro, Dad...]

687
01:00:09,644 --> 01:00:10,644
[Mr. Na]

688
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:19,210
I'm sorry to bother you so late at night.

689
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:20,810
It's an emergency involving
your homeroom student.

690
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:25,611
I need Kang Gyeong Jun's
home address.

691
01:01:35,578 --> 01:01:37,678
Kang Gyeong Jun?

692
01:01:38,144 --> 01:01:41,843
Yes, Ms. Gil.

693
01:02:12,177 --> 01:02:13,544
[Big]

694
01:02:15,611 --> 01:02:16,777
I'm huge.

695
01:02:17,377 --> 01:02:18,311
Let's go back to the hospital.

696
01:02:18,311 --> 01:02:20,743
They'll lock us all up
in a mental institution.

697
01:02:20,743 --> 01:02:23,678
Should we ask Yun Jae over for grilled eel?

698
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:29,210
Such a vile act

699
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,077
on school grounds!

700
01:02:31,077 --> 01:02:33,411
Yun Jae's at the hospital?

701
01:02:33,411 --> 01:02:35,910
Who was it that I saw earlier?

702
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,110
Who was the guy who pretended
he didn't know me?

703
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,544
There's a kid named Kang Gyeong Jun
at your school, right?

704
01:02:39,544 --> 01:02:40,777
Kang Gyeong Jun?

705
01:02:41,777 --> 01:02:43,444
I took his hand.

706
01:02:44,944 --> 01:02:46,344
Da Ran.
