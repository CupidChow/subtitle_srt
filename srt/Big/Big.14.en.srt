1
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:21,137
Gyeong Jun.

2
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:28,037
Yun Jae?

3
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:36,737
Are you Yun Jae or Gyeong Jun?

4
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,937
Who are you?

5
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:42,670
Whoever you want me to be.

6
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,171
Who's that?

7
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:56,837
The one who Gil Da Ran left.

8
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:12,870
The one you leave

9
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,237
will disappear forever.

10
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,537
Gyeong Jun.

11
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:39,371
Why aren't you in bed?

12
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:41,637
Are you in pain again?

13
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:44,137
Yes. Thanks to Yun Jae.

14
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,304
The pain is for me to bear.

15
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:48,670
Shouldn't you take some medicine?

16
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,537
Let's go to the hospital.

17
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:51,371
Don't touch me.

18
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:54,770
It's Yun Jae's body that's unwell.
Don't treat me like a sick person.

19
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,271
I cannot help but worry
that Yun Jae's unwell.

20
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:01,371
I'm going to have you take medicine
and make you go to the hospital.

21
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:05,603
If you're concerned for this body,
don't touch it.

22
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:08,670
If you get on my nerves,
I'll just run away.

23
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,837
Aha.

24
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:13,338
You cuffed me so I wouldn't run away.

25
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:17,470
Now I know what your true motive was.

26
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,904
You're right.

27
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:21,037
But you said you'd do whatever I wanted.

28
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:22,271
Don't run away.

29
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,904
As you wish.

30
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:39,670
Make sure you eat, and go
to the hospital today.

31
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:47,637
Gyeong Jun,

32
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,704
was I right?

33
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,837
Ms. Gil knew everything, right?

34
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:55,704
Yes.

35
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:57,970
She said she had known everything

36
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,037
and only stayed with me to save Yun Jae.

37
00:03:00,537 --> 00:03:02,603
See? I told you.

38
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:05,704
Did you tell her to lie to me

39
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:07,171
to get me to leave her?

40
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:08,804
What?

41
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:11,704
No.

42
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:13,171
It doesn't matter.

43
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,404
She wants to leave me,
so I won't beg her to stay.

44
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:21,603
I will never cling to Gil Da Ran

45
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:23,237
or my biological parents.

46
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:25,470
I'll give them what they want and take off.

47
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:32,670
So you won't ask Ms. Gil
to stay with you anymore?

48
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,237
I understand Seo Yun Jae comes first

49
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:37,804
and that the situation has
gotten very serious,

50
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:40,338
but I can't forgive her for letting go of me.

51
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:43,737
The moment she learned Seo Yun Jae was sick

52
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:46,870
and who my parents were, she thought
the best way was to let me go.

53
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:50,704
She's just like my biological parents.

54
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:56,470
You need to persuade Yun Jae

55
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,271
to start his treatment right away.

56
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:05,204
All Yun Jae needs is the surgery,

57
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,537
but what about Gyeong Jun?

58
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:09,537
Yun Jae's father will take care of him.

59
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:12,704
Once Yun Jae undergoes the surgery,
Gyeong Jun will wake up.

60
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:14,071
That's hard to say...

61
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:15,937
That's what will happen.

62
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:18,904
It's not like

63
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:22,104
I want him to remain in a coma either,

64
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:25,137
although it'll be hard for me
to face him if he does wake up.

65
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:27,537
Why do you think it'll be hard for you?

66
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:30,870
It's Gyeong Jun who has it the hardest.

67
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,470
Just beg for his forgiveness.

68
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,438
Even he tells you to leave him alone,

69
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:40,704
stay by his side and spend the rest
of your life making it up to him.

70
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:44,304
Don't ever let him be alone.

71
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:49,704
He's not for you to worry about.

72
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:50,737
Yun Jae comes first.

73
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,704
No.

74
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:55,004
Gyeong Jun comes first.

75
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:59,404
Promise me you will put Gyeong Jun first,

76
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:06,171
and I will persuade Yun Jae to save himself.

77
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:10,037
I know very well

78
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:12,737
I can no longer pretend
Gyeong Jun never existed.

79
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:14,670
You have

80
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,004
a lot more thanking to do to him.

81
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:22,104
Alright.

82
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:26,104
But you have to help us convince
Yun Jae to get the surgery.

83
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:30,338
Please thank Gyeong Jun and apologize to him

84
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:32,770
before all else.

85
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:36,171
Have dinner with them?

86
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:38,271
And you set up the dinner?

87
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:42,704
You should come so that we can talk
about the treatment and surgery.

88
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:47,071
You're already a devoted wife
and daughter-in-law, aren't you?

89
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:52,338
But I have no interest in playing
the son or husband.

90
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:55,570
You really are a kid after all.

91
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,037
Are you going to let the adults
decide and just go along?

92
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:03,271
If you treat me like a kid and drag me
there, I'll only act like a brat.

93
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:05,071
That would be fine.

94
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:07,037
You're their child after all.

95
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:09,637
Fine. I'll go and be a brat then.

96
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:23,804
Da Ran told me

97
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:28,104
to apologize to Gyeong Jun
in front of Yun Jae.

98
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:32,737
I imagine she wants you to let Yun Jae
know what you will tell Gyeong Jun.

99
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:46,004
This isn't the place. It's
the restaurant next door.

100
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:47,503
I want to have Korean food.

101
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,770
They're already there, waiting for us.

102
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,338
I want to eat here.

103
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:55,404
If they want to eat with me,
have them come over here.

104
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,804
To the restaurant next door?

105
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:04,004
But we already ordered the steaks.

106
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,670
Okay.

107
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:14,537
Yun Jae wants to us to come
to the restaurant next door.

108
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:18,004
Let's go.

109
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:25,137
I'm sorry. There has been a change of plans.

110
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,104
This is for Seo Yun Jae,

111
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:34,503
so should I order what he likes?

112
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:36,071
What does he like?

113
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:38,904
Get what you want.

114
00:07:39,438 --> 00:07:41,570
But Yun Jae comes first.

115
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,670
I wonder how it was when
they made me to save Yun Jae.

116
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:51,704
Meat and vegetables for Yun Jae.

117
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:55,371
But Yun Jae can't have mushrooms,
so veggies minus mushrooms.

118
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:57,004
Maybe that's how it was.

119
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:59,338
Don't be like this, Gyeong Jun.

120
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:01,237
They're your parents.

121
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:04,670
I know it's tough, but try
your best to accept them.

122
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:07,603
Try my best?

123
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:11,338
Should I just tell them I'm actually
Kang Gyeong Jun?

124
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:14,271
Would my parents be able to accept that?

125
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,071
It's here, right?

126
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:23,603
I even have this to prove my identity.

127
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,204
And you can be the witness. We're all set.

128
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:30,537
You'll be returning to your own body soon.

129
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:33,071
This will all be too shocking for them.

130
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:35,438
That's exactly why I want to tell them.

131
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:38,371
They definitely will be shocked
that the son they abandoned

132
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:42,004
is in their precious Yun Jae's body.

133
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:45,171
It will only make it harder
for you to find your place.

134
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,237
They're going to be your family.

135
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:49,204
Who says I want to be their family?

136
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:51,870
I don't plan to see them again
after I return to my own body.

137
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,670
I was going to slip back in quietly,

138
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,704
but I don't think it's a bad idea

139
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,470
to see them suffer from the shock first.

140
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,470
If they know who I am, they won't
insist on taking me out to dinners

141
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,171
or push me to get the treatment and surgery.

142
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:13,804
They'll be on tenterhooks.

143
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,637
Please don't be like this, Gyeong Jun.

144
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:22,637
Because you might lose Seo Yun Jae?

145
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:24,004
Yes.

146
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:25,737
So stop it.

147
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:35,670
What's the matter?

148
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,503
Hello.

149
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:45,004
Please sit down.

150
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:54,371
Yun Jae,

151
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:57,737
why didn't you tell me that
you wanted Korean food?

152
00:09:58,237 --> 00:10:00,470
How are you feeling?

153
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:05,371
I can eat what I want to eat
on my own. And I don't feel well.

154
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:15,371
Yun Jae,

155
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:20,804
are you still upset because of Gyeong Jun?

156
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:27,737
We're sorry for what we've done to
Gyeong Jun and also very grateful.

157
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:31,171
When he wakes up,

158
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:35,603
we'll make it up to him.

159
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:38,104
He won't care for that.

160
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,404
Just leave him alone.

161
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:40,804
Da Ran told us to always stay by his side

162
00:10:40,804 --> 00:10:45,171
even if he tells us to leave him alone.

163
00:10:46,904 --> 00:10:49,870
You must not like beans.

164
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,870
I don't like the taste.

165
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,137
Gyeong Jun doesn't like beans either.

166
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:03,704
That means there are some things
he takes after me.

167
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,770
Even though he tells you

168
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,171
to stop nagging him about eating beans,

169
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:11,570
he does eat them eventually.

170
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:17,237
He's a nice kid who listens
if you are sincere.

171
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:21,404
His mother must've raised him well.

172
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:25,804
He's also very smart and
does very well in school.

173
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:27,970
That he must take after his father.

174
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,171
It's fascinating that he takes after
parents he has never even met.

175
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:35,837
You're not his parents. You didn't
give birth to him or raise him.

176
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:39,737
It could've been him,

177
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:44,104
not you, that I might've had and raised.

178
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:50,970
I was too weak to conceive naturally,

179
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,937
so I had you through in vitro fertilization

180
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:58,204
while my other egg was kept stored.

181
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:03,970
In some sense, you and Gyeong Jun
aren't brothers 12 years apart

182
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,304
but are fraternal twins.

183
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:12,304
If we had decided to go with the other egg,

184
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:17,603
I would've had Gyeong Jun
and raised him instead of you.

185
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:24,470
So that's when Seo Yun Jae and
Kang Gyeong Jun's order was decided?

186
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,603
Seo Yun Jae first, Kang Gyeong Jun on standby

187
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:30,137
to be brought to life when needed.

188
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:31,937
That was the setup?

189
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,503
Who told you to hold my hand?

190
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,371
It's Seo Yun Jae's turn to wait this time,

191
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:43,237
so wait anxiously.

192
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,104
Yun Jae.

193
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:48,537
Yun Jae.

194
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:51,937
Gyeong Jun.

195
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:54,271
Gyeong Jun.

196
00:12:56,837 --> 00:13:01,637
You said Seo Yun Jae's hands were
warm while mine were cold, right?

197
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:05,404
No wonder. My hands froze over
during my long wait.

198
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:09,137
You knew right away.

199
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:27,137
How much more of what I don't want to know

200
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:29,071
do I have to find out?

201
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,304
If this is a miracle,

202
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:44,304
there has to be a happy ending
for Gyeong Jun.

203
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:54,737
- Tada.
- Yum.

204
00:13:56,338 --> 00:14:01,438
You're sure Da Ran found the ring
and is wearing it around, right?

205
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:03,404
Yeah...

206
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:08,338
It's a long story how she found it,
but she does wear it around.

207
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,737
Have you found out who KKJ is?

208
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:17,304
I scoured the names of the teachers
at our school and Da Ran's alumni

209
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:19,204
contact lists from primary school,

210
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:21,637
but I haven't found a KKJ.

211
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:24,104
No?

212
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:30,071
Maybe it's not a person but a secret code.

213
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:32,937
KKJ...

214
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,570
Kiss, kiss, and joy?

215
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:39,637
What?

216
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,037
That makes sense.

217
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:45,704
You've gotten smarter, son.

218
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:48,537
I'm working very hard at
my English these days

219
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:50,537
because I have to go to the States with Mary.

220
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:55,837
Just forget about Mary and find KKJ.

221
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:58,271
There's no one with those initials

222
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:02,071
around Da Ran except Kang Gyeong Jun.

223
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:06,137
You're going to manage the inheritance
Gyeong Jun's mother left behind?

224
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:07,637
With what right?

225
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:12,171
I had gotten Gyeong Jun's consent and
have taken necessary legal measures.

226
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:15,404
I told you to look into it!

227
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:18,870
We're Gyeong Jun's relatives.

228
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,804
But what right do you have?

229
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:22,503
Seo Yun Jae, yours truly,
is Kang Gyeong Jun's brother.

230
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:25,071
If you don't believe me, take a strand
of my hair for DNA testing.

231
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:33,037
Thank you for taking care of Gyeong Jun.

232
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,271
You opened this restaurant with
the money Gyeong Jun's mother

233
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,004
left behind. Do a good job with it.

234
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,204
Business picked up after
the Russian chef came, right?

235
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:45,603
Are you suggesting that
we call it even steven?

236
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:49,304
So Gyeong Jun's father who came by

237
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:52,537
is also your father?

238
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,670
Unfortunately, yes.

239
00:15:57,104 --> 00:16:01,404
But your father said he wasn't
interested in the inheritance

240
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:04,171
and just wanted the son he had
with Hui Su, the woman he loved.

241
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,271
Was that a lie?

242
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:08,171
The woman he loved?

243
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:11,804
That can't be.

244
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,937
If he loved her, he couldn't have
asked her to have Gyeong Jun.

245
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:17,970
Didn't Ms. Kang Hui Su have
Gyeong Jun for money?

246
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,503
Is that what your father told you?

247
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:23,603
Watch what you say. Hui Su was
brought up like a princess.

248
00:16:23,603 --> 00:16:25,970
She never would've done
something like that for money.

249
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:30,104
I don't know how things
were with your father,

250
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:33,804
but Hui Su had the baby at a young age

251
00:16:33,804 --> 00:16:35,304
and took off to the States

252
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:38,603
like a fugitive.

253
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:43,970
The poor thing left home to raise the baby

254
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,071
and endured hardship when
she didn't even have to.

255
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:53,104
What's wrong?

256
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:56,704
Those people used my mother's love for him.

257
00:16:56,704 --> 00:16:59,037
They had her believe he loved her

258
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:01,237
and then ruined her life.

259
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:10,737
- Gyeong Jun.
- Don't follow me.

260
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:17,338
Yun Jae, why did you take off earlier?

261
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:19,304
Hey, you.

262
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,804
Did you love Ms. Kang Hui Su?

263
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,438
Did you tell her you loved her and
had her carry a child for your son?

264
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:28,304
Yun Jae.

265
00:17:28,304 --> 00:17:30,737
Is that how you got her
to have Kang Gyeong Jun?

266
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:35,137
Yes.

267
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,503
I have no right to say I loved Hui Su.

268
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:41,737
But how?

269
00:17:41,737 --> 00:17:43,071
How could you make her do such a thing?

270
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:45,704
I implored her.

271
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:49,970
She was a nice person, so she
eventually agreed to do it.

272
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:56,503
She said she'd have the baby
for the man she loved.

273
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:04,137
If she loved you, you should've stopped her.

274
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:06,371
How could you just let her
go through with it?

275
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:08,737
You used her love for you.

276
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:12,371
It was me.

277
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:17,970
There was nothing I wouldn't do for you.

278
00:18:20,503 --> 00:18:24,470
Then I should be able

279
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,071
to do whatever I want to from now on.

280
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,904
The person you're trying to reach...

281
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:17,937
I implored her.

282
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:22,204
She was a nice person, so she
eventually agreed to do it.

283
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:29,904
He's a nice kid who listens
if you are sincere.

284
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,037
It won't take long. I won't drink.

285
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:37,537
Sorry.

286
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:40,037
I'll bring someone who can take me in.

287
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:42,704
Please take good care of the guy
at the bar until then.

288
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,104
Why aren't you home yet? Where are you?

289
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:57,770
At a bar. I'm drinking.

290
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,404
What?

291
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:01,037
Don't be like this.

292
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:03,104
Stop me if you can.

293
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:07,637
I am a nice kid who listens
if you are sincere.

294
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:09,804
Where are you?

295
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:21,870
Don't be like this. Let's go.

296
00:20:24,438 --> 00:20:27,637
If you want me to stop,

297
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:30,304
you have to be sincere.

298
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,670
If you're earnest, I'll do as you say.

299
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:51,438
Do you really

300
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:55,104
consider them to be my parents?

301
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:59,137
Yes.

302
00:20:59,137 --> 00:21:01,271
Give me a break.

303
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:18,404
Do I have to understand and accept them

304
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:23,404
when they don't act anything
like real parents?

305
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:28,404
Yes.

306
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:31,537
Don't take me for a fool.

307
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:39,237
Stop being a child.

308
00:21:39,237 --> 00:21:41,237
You can't stop me with that.

309
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:57,304
Do you think it's fair that
I have to give everything

310
00:21:58,438 --> 00:22:01,237
to Seo Yun Jae?

311
00:22:06,204 --> 00:22:08,371
Yes,

312
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:10,904
because that's the only way
Yun Jae will be able to live.

313
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:13,004
But it's killing me.

314
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,637
Stop it.

315
00:22:15,637 --> 00:22:18,304
Then tell me how you really feel.

316
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:21,004
Tell me I should do whatever I want to
in this wretched situation.

317
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:22,670
Tell me I come first no matter what.

318
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,404
Stop me by telling me

319
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:27,570
you can let go of everything else
because I come first.

320
00:22:28,404 --> 00:22:30,904
I can't.

321
00:22:30,904 --> 00:22:33,904
You'll never forsake Yun Jae

322
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,171
because you're a good kid.

323
00:22:39,603 --> 00:22:42,204
You truly believe that.

324
00:22:44,037 --> 00:22:47,470
You really believe that

325
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,371
I'll do whatever you want me to
because I love you.

326
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:56,537
Yes.

327
00:22:57,704 --> 00:23:00,004
I believe in you.

328
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:09,704
You were sincere,

329
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:13,770
so let's stop here.

330
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:35,603
I won't

331
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:39,570
let them use me

332
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,870
like they used my mom.

333
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,537
Chaperone. Chaperone.

334
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:01,338
Huh?

335
00:24:01,338 --> 00:24:03,637
Where's the guy who was sitting here?

336
00:24:03,637 --> 00:24:05,637
He left with someone.

337
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:06,804
Who?

338
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:07,970
A woman.

339
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,171
Oh...

340
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:10,937
He had left

341
00:24:10,937 --> 00:24:12,870
this on the wash basin in the men's room.

342
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,237
KKJ should be engraved in the back.

343
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:18,737
Yes.

344
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:20,603
I'll return it to him.

345
00:24:36,137 --> 00:24:38,037
Miracle?

346
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,304
For Seo Yun Jae, because he got to live,

347
00:24:41,937 --> 00:24:45,637
but it made my life nothing but misery.

348
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:20,503
Gyeong Jun was born for Yun Jae

349
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:23,104
and saved Yun Jae's life.

350
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:27,603
Then

351
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:31,503
Yun Jae saved Gyeong Jun's life,

352
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:37,470
and it's now Gyeong Jun's turn
to save Yun Jae's life.

353
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:45,503
If this is the end,

354
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:48,503
how can the ending be a happy one?

355
00:26:06,137 --> 00:26:10,237
The amnesia was probably a blessing.

356
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:14,970
I think Gyeong Jun would also be
happier not knowing anything

357
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,537
when he wakes up.

358
00:26:17,537 --> 00:26:20,304
Yun Jae has to be treated right away.

359
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:23,503
Is Da Ran working on persuading him?

360
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:25,204
Yes,

361
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:31,404
but even Da Ran says
Gyeong Jun should come first

362
00:26:31,404 --> 00:26:33,271
and is putting a lot of pressure on me.

363
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:34,603
That's strange.

364
00:26:34,603 --> 00:26:39,770
Shouldn't Yun Jae come first for Da Ran?

365
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:46,404
And Yun Jae said he should be able to do
whatever he wants to from now on.

366
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,603
I don't know why he said such a thing.

367
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:59,837
Do you have a hangover? I made you soup.

368
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:01,137
Thanks.

369
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:03,371
You should go to school.

370
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:07,704
Okay. Go to the hospital
after you finish breakfast.

371
00:27:07,704 --> 00:27:09,237
I will.

372
00:27:09,237 --> 00:27:11,970
I should do as I'm told and get this
over and done with quick.

373
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:17,171
Are you happy that I'm being a nice kid?

374
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:18,837
It's in your best interest, too.

375
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,537
How considerate.

376
00:27:20,537 --> 00:27:22,371
You just worry about yourself.

377
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:24,338
Aren't you late for work?

378
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:35,837
Enjoy the breakfast. I have to get ready.

379
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:55,670
Did I leave it at the bar?

380
00:27:57,304 --> 00:27:59,204
Yes, mother.

381
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,737
Yun Jae's having breakfast.

382
00:28:02,737 --> 00:28:04,970
He says he'll go to the hospital today.

383
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,737
We had a good talk.

384
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:08,670
Yes.

385
00:28:14,537 --> 00:28:16,004
I'll see you at the hospital.

386
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:18,670
I can go by myself. Go.

387
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:20,904
Gyeong Jun,

388
00:28:20,904 --> 00:28:24,837
did you lose the watch at the bar last night?

389
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,071
The watch?

390
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:31,271
I don't know.

391
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,603
See you.

392
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:45,904
I'm taking off anyway,

393
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:47,637
so what's the point in
looking for the watch?

394
00:28:48,304 --> 00:28:51,603
If I had just given it to him
as a birthday present,

395
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:55,004
I could've asked him to keep it.

396
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,837
What time is it?

397
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,937
10:10.

398
00:29:05,237 --> 00:29:07,338
Ae Gyeong,

399
00:29:07,338 --> 00:29:11,670
I get the feeling it'll be 10:10
for the rest of my life.

400
00:29:12,537 --> 00:29:14,837
What's wrong, Da Ran?

401
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:16,970
Are you okay?

402
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:22,071
Vice Principal Kim, did you
yell at Ms. Gil again?

403
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:25,704
No, I didn't.

404
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:32,004
Is something the matter?

405
00:29:35,737 --> 00:29:40,570
I'm never returning it.

406
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,970
Wow.

407
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,570
He really is okay when you do it.

408
00:29:55,338 --> 00:30:01,037
Did he lie here for a year to make me
study medicine for this?

409
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:03,470
He got me good.

410
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,904
What are you talking about?

411
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,404
Seo Yun Jae's a real lowlife.

412
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:10,071
Yun Jae,

413
00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:12,570
Gyeong Jun's your brother.

414
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,737
I don't think he'd consider you
a lowlife for getting his help.

415
00:30:15,737 --> 00:30:17,137
You're wrong.

416
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:19,904
Gyeong Jun thinks Seo Yun Jae
is a real lowlife.

417
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,837
He'll be getting the shots this week,

418
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:26,304
and next week, we'll be able
to draw blood from him.

419
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,304
I hope it'll make you healthy again

420
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:32,570
and bring Gyeong Jun out of the coma.

421
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,237
It'll make Seo Yun Jae happy.

422
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,404
I'll start the treatment,

423
00:30:40,503 --> 00:30:43,904
but I want to be treated in Germany

424
00:30:43,904 --> 00:30:45,770
where dad works.

425
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,503
Sure.

426
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:49,603
I think it would be better

427
00:30:49,603 --> 00:30:52,937
for you to be treated there
than here at your workplace.

428
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:56,404
You can go with Da Ran when break starts.

429
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:57,704
No.

430
00:30:57,704 --> 00:31:00,237
I want to go alone and as soon as possible.

431
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:02,470
Then I'll come with you.

432
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,637
Dad, mom,

433
00:31:05,237 --> 00:31:07,104
how much do you love your son here?

434
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:10,804
I won't be able to live should
anything happen to you.

435
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:15,371
Then stay by your son at the hospital for me.

436
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:17,837
That's how you can help me.

437
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,371
What are you thinking of doing?

438
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:24,704
I'm doing as I'm told.

439
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:26,404
If you want to go to Germany,
I'll come with you.

440
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:28,037
Gil Da Ran,

441
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:31,137
just keep one promise you made with me.

442
00:31:31,137 --> 00:31:33,737
You said you'd be by my side
the moment I returned to my own body.

443
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:35,904
Will you not keep that promise?

444
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,537
I will.

445
00:31:38,537 --> 00:31:42,338
Then wait around with those folks.

446
00:31:49,338 --> 00:31:51,071
What's Yun Jae up to?

447
00:31:52,304 --> 00:31:56,470
He's going to Germany for work,

448
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,371
so I'll be here while he's gone.

449
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,770
Germany?

450
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,603
What for?

451
00:32:03,603 --> 00:32:07,171
Yun Jae's father's at a hospital there,

452
00:32:07,171 --> 00:32:10,037
and Yun Jae has to do
something at that hospital.

453
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:11,204
Wow.

454
00:32:11,204 --> 00:32:14,304
Does this mean Dr. Seo's going to
make it big in Germany?

455
00:32:14,304 --> 00:32:16,570
He's going "globalous"?

456
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,304
Are you going with him?

457
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:23,404
No. I won't be going with Yun Jae.

458
00:32:23,404 --> 00:32:27,237
Are you really having an affair, Da Ran?

459
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,870
No.

460
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:34,870
I'll tell you what's going on

461
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,503
with Yun Jae later on.

462
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,937
Yun Jae's leaving Da Ran here
and going to Germany.

463
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:53,071
That ring you got is not doing
its money's worth.

464
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,537
No. It was totally worth it.

465
00:32:55,537 --> 00:32:57,837
Why aren't you eating?

466
00:32:57,837 --> 00:33:01,237
I'm letting dad know it might take
longer than expected.

467
00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:03,470
I have to take off to go after someone.

468
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,770
Where?

469
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,603
None of your business.

470
00:33:07,304 --> 00:33:09,371
Who are you going after this time?

471
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:11,104
What about me?

472
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:13,537
Chung Sik,

473
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:16,271
erase me from your mind.

474
00:33:16,271 --> 00:33:19,637
If we're far apart and don't see
or talk to each other,

475
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:21,104
you'll be able to erase me from your mind.

476
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:24,104
No.

477
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:26,004
You're not here

478
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,804
but here.

479
00:33:28,804 --> 00:33:31,204
I'll never be able to erase you
from my heart.

480
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:39,371
This is your ticket to Germany.

481
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:41,338
Your father wanted me to give it to you.

482
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:43,171
They're coming to the airport
to see you off.

483
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:44,704
They don't have to.

484
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,071
I'm going to stop by there to say
goodbye and then take off alone.

485
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:50,670
Someone will be there at
the airport in Germany.

486
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,503
You'll head straight to the hospital, right?

487
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:55,271
Yes.

488
00:33:57,304 --> 00:33:59,404
Do you have to go?

489
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:03,503
If it's because you're uncomfortable
having me around,

490
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:06,870
I can move out of this house.

491
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,737
I put the house up for sale anyway.

492
00:34:09,737 --> 00:34:14,304
While I'm away, throw out
everything I gave you.

493
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,937
I'll dispose of anything you've given me.

494
00:34:16,937 --> 00:34:18,438
Oh, right.

495
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:22,171
The watch was the only thing
you had given me, right?

496
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:25,804
I've lost that already, so I have
nothing to throw out.

497
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,004
Okay. See you.

498
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,304
Did you find a watch in the men's room?

499
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:43,537
KKJ is engraved on the back.

500
00:34:43,537 --> 00:34:46,870
A young female student
came by and took it.

501
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,237
I only gave it to her, because
she said she knew you.

502
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:53,438
Did she have long hair and a pretty face?

503
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:55,438
Yes.

504
00:34:57,271 --> 00:34:59,004
Thank you.

505
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:01,737
Give me my watch.

506
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:02,770
Don't have it.

507
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,704
Liar.

508
00:35:03,704 --> 00:35:05,870
- I don't.
- Liar.

509
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,870
I threw it away.

510
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,271
Jang Mary,

511
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:10,171
I know you're lying,
so stop being a brat.

512
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:11,837
I'm going to keep being a brat.

513
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:14,770
If I keep being a brat and insist
that I've thrown it out,

514
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,770
you'll throw it out yourself one day.

515
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,704
Fine. Keep being a brat

516
00:35:18,704 --> 00:35:21,137
and convince me you've really thrown it out.

517
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:26,438
A gentleman was here earlier
for the same watch.

518
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:28,904
He was here to look for it?

519
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:44,804
Would you like me to help you pack?

520
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,637
I'm all packed. I'm just sorting
through things to throw out.

521
00:35:52,637 --> 00:35:54,904
You're throwing that out?

522
00:35:56,171 --> 00:35:57,204
Yeah.

523
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:59,937
Didn't you just go to find it at the bar?

524
00:35:59,937 --> 00:36:02,004
I told you I was throwing it out.

525
00:36:03,804 --> 00:36:07,837
What? Do I have retrieve it
and put it back on?

526
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:13,104
Unlike someone, I don't want to put
something I've thrown out back on.

527
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:16,237
You, on the other hand,
can keep that ring on

528
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:20,237
and wait for the day you can have
Yun Jae back.

529
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:36,670
Why did he go to retrive it when
he was going to throw it out?

530
00:37:07,104 --> 00:37:10,004
I wanted to see you off at the airport.

531
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:13,804
This is it, so give your son a hug.

532
00:37:21,371 --> 00:37:25,904
Hold your breath and pray
for your son's safe return.

533
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:28,404
You too, dad.

534
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,837
I'll get going now.

535
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,637
Goodbye.

536
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:42,904
I'm heading straight to the airport.

537
00:37:42,904 --> 00:37:45,304
Why don't you hug Seo Yun Jae too?

538
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,338
Why are you being like this?

539
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:48,071
You said I should accept my parents.

540
00:37:48,071 --> 00:37:50,704
In my own way, that's what I'm trying to do.

541
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:58,271
Here.

542
00:37:59,804 --> 00:38:06,204
I thought a lot about the miracle
that put you in Yun Jae's body.

543
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:09,204
Maybe it happened

544
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,804
to give you a big heart
befitting the big body

545
00:38:11,804 --> 00:38:14,137
in which you suddenly found yourself

546
00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:16,304
so you'd be prepared to overcome
the challenges that come your way.

547
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:17,837
The body did suddenly grow,

548
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,171
but nothing happened to my heart.

549
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:21,870
I don't feel older or wiser.

550
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,503
It all happened for you to be happy.

551
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:29,304
When you return to your body,
you will have a family.

552
00:38:29,304 --> 00:38:31,670
You just need to open your heart
to be able to accept them.

553
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,137
There won't be a miracle
if I open my heart.

554
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:36,037
Gyeong Jun,

555
00:38:36,837 --> 00:38:41,937
I'd like you to be happy
once you return to your body.

556
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:44,804
I said the miracle was only for
Seo Yun Jae's happiness, didn't I?

557
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:46,204
I'm bailing out, so you can wait to see

558
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:49,704
just how happy Seo Yun Jae
and his family become.

559
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:16,937
They're extracting the blood

560
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:20,537
needed for Yun Jae's surgery
from Gyeong Jun tomorrow.

561
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:27,404
Yun Jae's father will go to
Germany with that blood.

562
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:32,837
Please stay by Gyeong Jun's side.

563
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:38,404
Will Gyeong Jun really wake up
once Yun Jae receives surgery?

564
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:42,737
I think so.

565
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:48,737
Stop avoiding him and be sincere with him.

566
00:39:48,737 --> 00:39:51,104
Make him happy.

567
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:59,870
It has been hard for me to accept him because

568
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:03,237
the woman my husband loved
had given birth to him.

569
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:06,704
It must've been even harder
for Yun Jae's father,

570
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,004
given how much he loved her.

571
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:13,637
I couldn't be with him anymore
as it seemed as though

572
00:40:13,637 --> 00:40:15,438
he was in hell every waking moment.

573
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,271
Gyeong Jun,

574
00:40:58,737 --> 00:41:00,637
I'm coming.

575
00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:03,737
I'll come to Germany with you.

576
00:41:03,737 --> 00:41:06,137
Stop your nonsense and go away.

577
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,137
Let me come with you.

578
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:11,071
I can take a step back and follow you
from a comfortable distance.

579
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,970
You can go to Germany.

580
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,104
I'm not going anyway.

581
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:18,004
No?

582
00:41:18,004 --> 00:41:20,371
I'm not going to do what they tell me to.

583
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:23,537
I'm going to disappear in Seo Yun Jae's body.

584
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:25,870
I'll make them wait anxiously.

585
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,470
I'll make sure they suffer.

586
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:31,470
But that body is unwell.
That puts you in danger too.

587
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,271
I don't care.

588
00:41:35,438 --> 00:41:36,837
Oh!

589
00:41:36,837 --> 00:41:39,338
Once I leave, why don't you tell them
it was Kang Gyeong Jun

590
00:41:39,338 --> 00:41:43,104
who left and the one in the coma
is actually Seo Yun Jae?

591
00:41:44,237 --> 00:41:46,603
It would torment them even more.

592
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:48,503
Don't, Gyeong Jun. It's too dangerous.

593
00:41:48,503 --> 00:41:50,104
What if something goes wrong and you die?

594
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:53,804
I'm sure Seo Yun Jae will wake up
if his body's about to die.

595
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:56,637
This miracle is for Seo Yun Jae.

596
00:41:56,637 --> 00:41:59,537
Gyeong Jun, you're scaring me. Don't go.

597
00:41:59,537 --> 00:42:01,037
Don't stop me.

598
00:42:01,037 --> 00:42:02,670
I'm not listening to anyone.

599
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:05,770
Gyeong Jun.

600
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:15,637
What am I supposed to tell him
when he wakes up?

601
00:42:16,071 --> 00:42:18,237
He probably doesn't know anything.

602
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,904
We'll first have to explain
to him who we are.

603
00:42:29,404 --> 00:42:30,937
Hi, Mary.

604
00:42:30,937 --> 00:42:32,804
Ms. Gil,

605
00:42:33,704 --> 00:42:36,137
Gyeong Jun says he's running away.

606
00:42:39,237 --> 00:42:43,338
Please come and stop him.

607
00:42:44,171 --> 00:42:47,204
Gyeong Jun says he'll disappear
in the state he's in.

608
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:22,570
If you want me to stop,

609
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,904
you have to be sincere.

610
00:43:36,438 --> 00:43:37,537
If you're earnest, I'll do as you say.

611
00:43:47,904 --> 00:43:49,603
Gyeong Jun,

612
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:59,704
I want to talk to you earnestly.
Will you let me?

613
00:44:04,137 --> 00:44:09,371
Your father truly loved your mother,

614
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:16,137
but there was no other way
for him to save his dying son.

615
00:44:16,137 --> 00:44:18,071
That's why

616
00:44:19,271 --> 00:44:22,037
he's spent his entire life in misery.

617
00:44:23,237 --> 00:44:25,237
Gyeong Jun,

618
00:44:25,237 --> 00:44:27,137
don't go.

619
00:44:27,137 --> 00:44:29,404
Please save Yun Jae.

620
00:44:29,404 --> 00:44:33,237
I know it's hard, but please do it.

621
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,371
In return,

622
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:39,737
I'll spend the rest of my life in misery.

623
00:44:39,737 --> 00:44:43,804
That's probably what will happen

624
00:44:45,104 --> 00:44:47,503
because I love you.

625
00:45:10,304 --> 00:45:12,171
This is so unfair.

626
00:45:14,037 --> 00:45:17,837
Now

627
00:45:17,837 --> 00:45:20,637
you will be miserable too.

628
00:45:47,438 --> 00:45:49,470
Isn't it pretty?

629
00:45:50,904 --> 00:45:53,404
- I found it.
- They're angels.

630
00:45:53,404 --> 00:45:55,770
Angels are good.

631
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,937
I'll give this to you, so don't be sick.

632
00:45:58,937 --> 00:46:04,204
This is the Dr. Seo angel.

633
00:46:04,204 --> 00:46:05,837
Have you seen this before?

634
00:46:05,837 --> 00:46:13,704
I saw the angels in the book
Dr. Seo showed me.

635
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:19,037
Yun Jae has the same picture book.

636
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:23,004
I had said this looked familiar, right?

637
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,737
I don't want to read it.
For me, it's a tragic miracle.

638
00:46:27,737 --> 00:46:29,770
I doubt Yun Jae was looking for you

639
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:32,104
to make you miserable.

640
00:46:32,104 --> 00:46:35,171
Then he should've woken up
in my body too.

641
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:37,904
He needs to take on his share
of the suffering.

642
00:46:37,904 --> 00:46:41,438
I'm finding out one by one
things I never wanted to know.

643
00:46:41,438 --> 00:46:44,804
I wonder why he's not waking up.

644
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:47,171
Maybe there's a reason for that too.

645
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:52,837
I need to find out why
my father made this book.

646
00:47:01,704 --> 00:47:05,570
I did the illustrations,

647
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,503
but it was Gyeong Jun's mother
who wrote the book.

648
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:13,670
Ms. Kang Hui Su wrote this book?

649
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:17,438
It was when you turned 18.

650
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:22,637
She had this sent to you through
Professor Park Min Gyu.

651
00:47:23,937 --> 00:47:27,371
Park Hui Su asked me to pass this along

652
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:30,037
to Yun Jae.

653
00:47:30,037 --> 00:47:31,503
What did she say?

654
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:33,338
She said she hoped

655
00:47:33,338 --> 00:47:36,937
there would be a miracle
when the two kids meet.

656
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:41,470
Yun Jae and Gyeong Jun share a miracle,

657
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,603
so when the two meet again,

658
00:47:43,603 --> 00:47:46,371
I'd like for there to be a happy miracle.

659
00:47:46,371 --> 00:47:48,503
That's why I've titled it "Miracle."

660
00:47:49,137 --> 00:47:51,904
You seem happy.

661
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:56,603
I got to have Gyeong Jun thanks to Yun Jae.

662
00:47:56,603 --> 00:48:00,804
When Gyeong Jun becomes
as old as Yun Jae is now,

663
00:48:00,804 --> 00:48:02,870
I will tell him about

664
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:07,404
his nice mother, father, and older brother

665
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:09,570
so that he won't feel lonely.

666
00:48:12,637 --> 00:48:15,737
So she wrote this book to let
Gyeong Jun know about his family.

667
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:19,037
In any case, Yun Jae and Gyeong Jun

668
00:48:19,037 --> 00:48:23,271
have reunited and Gyeong Jun now
has a family as Hui Su had wanted.

669
00:48:23,271 --> 00:48:25,937
It's a miracle for Gyeong Jun.

670
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:30,204
I don't think it'll be a particularly
happy miracle for Gyeong Jun.

671
00:48:30,204 --> 00:48:32,737
Why do you think that?

672
00:48:33,503 --> 00:48:37,004
All that has happened since their reunion

673
00:48:37,004 --> 00:48:39,271
are things he'd be better off not knowing.

674
00:48:39,271 --> 00:48:40,870
What does it matter?

675
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:43,438
He doesn't know anything.

676
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,371
Isn't he in a coma?

677
00:48:48,271 --> 00:48:49,104
Yes.

678
00:48:49,104 --> 00:48:53,104
Time stood still for him when
he got into an accident with you.

679
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:57,237
It was his brother who saved him,

680
00:48:57,237 --> 00:49:01,037
and he will have parents waiting
for him when he opens his eyes.

681
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:04,837
Isn't that a happy miracle?

682
00:49:04,837 --> 00:49:07,704
If this miracle turns out
as Hui Su hoped it would,

683
00:49:07,704 --> 00:49:13,104
Gyeong Jun will wake up happy.

684
00:49:17,837 --> 00:49:21,338
For this to be a happy miracle
as mom wanted it to be,

685
00:49:22,237 --> 00:49:25,503
I have to forget all that transpired
after the accident.

686
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:30,371
Did Seo Yun Jae remain asleep in my body

687
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:36,570
to keep the time still and
bring me happiness?

688
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:42,371
If this is indeed another miracle,

689
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:45,371
I will forget

690
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:47,770
all that happened

691
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:51,503
when I return my body.

692
00:50:01,404 --> 00:50:04,371
Thank you for talking
Gyeong Jun out of going.

693
00:50:05,704 --> 00:50:09,970
But why did you tell him what you told him?

694
00:50:10,804 --> 00:50:15,970
Because I had to be sincere
to keep him from leaving.

695
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:18,371
Does that mean

696
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:21,304
you will try to be with Gyeong Jun again?

697
00:50:22,037 --> 00:50:24,004
No.

698
00:50:24,904 --> 00:50:29,637
I love him so much that I'll let him go.

699
00:50:31,837 --> 00:50:37,104
I wanted to keep my feelings hidden
and have things find their places,

700
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:40,404
but that didn't happen.

701
00:50:41,804 --> 00:50:44,237
Erase those sincere feelings

702
00:50:44,237 --> 00:50:46,603
from your mind.

703
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:50,304
You'll be able to do it.

704
00:50:55,304 --> 00:50:57,937
I hope so.

705
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,404
Kang Gyeong Jun,

706
00:51:12,404 --> 00:51:14,304
are you really not eating?

707
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:17,937
I won't make beans tomorrow,
so please come and eat.

708
00:51:24,271 --> 00:51:27,037
I vacuumed,

709
00:51:27,037 --> 00:51:29,470
so you're done for if you get
anything on the floor.

710
00:51:49,737 --> 00:51:51,670
Something's wrong with me.

711
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:57,503
I don't know why I'm so happy to see you.

712
00:52:12,304 --> 00:52:15,603
Should we go camping again?

713
00:52:18,004 --> 00:52:23,470
That's strange. Pandas have
black eyes, ears, and bellies.

714
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,470
Who's prettier?

715
00:52:25,837 --> 00:52:27,037
Gil Panda.

716
00:52:27,037 --> 00:52:28,937
Gil Panda wins.

717
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,037
You can have Kang Panda then.

718
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:46,104
10:10.

719
00:52:46,804 --> 00:52:49,570
Snap me out of it.

720
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,704
What if I stay like this the rest of my life?

721
00:53:25,837 --> 00:53:29,637
Where is the long bread
that's normally here?

722
00:53:29,637 --> 00:53:31,603
It's coming out of the oven soon.

723
00:53:31,603 --> 00:53:34,970
He'll like the fresh-baked bread.

724
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,670
Maybe I should get something new, too.

725
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:43,137
Something smells good.

726
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,404
What is it?

727
00:53:45,937 --> 00:53:47,904
The chicken you didn't
get to eat the first time.

728
00:53:47,904 --> 00:53:49,603
We made up, so this is to celebrate.

729
00:53:50,237 --> 00:53:53,404
I got bread. Your favorite.

730
00:53:54,171 --> 00:53:57,071
This is so good.

731
00:53:57,071 --> 00:53:59,704
You were right. It's no
ordinary baked chicken.

732
00:54:01,704 --> 00:54:03,804
Gil Da Ran,

733
00:54:03,804 --> 00:54:06,237
they're drawing blood tomorrow.

734
00:54:08,237 --> 00:54:14,237
I don't know if the switchover will occur

735
00:54:14,237 --> 00:54:18,404
when they take what
Seo Yun Jae needs from me

736
00:54:18,404 --> 00:54:20,071
or when it is put in his body.

737
00:54:22,237 --> 00:54:24,004
That means

738
00:54:25,837 --> 00:54:28,704
tomorrow may be the end.

739
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:32,071
Yeah.

740
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:40,637
I'll be holding your hand as promised.

741
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:42,737
No.

742
00:54:43,171 --> 00:54:44,737
Be by Seo Yun Jae's side.

743
00:54:47,904 --> 00:54:50,304
Stay by this body.

744
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:56,470
You have to promise me.

745
00:54:56,470 --> 00:55:00,271
Don't be by Kang Gyeong Jun's side
when I open my eyes.

746
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:05,837
Yeah. That would probably be best.

747
00:55:05,837 --> 00:55:09,438
Seo Yun Jae's been asleep
since the accident,

748
00:55:09,438 --> 00:55:12,304
so you can get your answer.

749
00:55:13,004 --> 00:55:15,371
What you've been wondering all this time.

750
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:21,104
His answer to "Do you love me?"

751
00:55:22,271 --> 00:55:24,404
He has kept you waiting

752
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,970
for a year.

753
00:55:29,837 --> 00:55:35,338
I'm not curious anymore though.

754
00:55:36,404 --> 00:55:38,603
I'm going to do the same.

755
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:47,171
I'm going to forget all that's happened

756
00:55:47,171 --> 00:55:49,137
since the accident.

757
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:53,304
You're going to forget everything?

758
00:55:53,304 --> 00:55:58,104
That's what I'm going to do,

759
00:55:59,104 --> 00:56:01,670
so even if I pretend I don't
remember anything

760
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:05,503
and don't love you, don't be sad,

761
00:56:05,503 --> 00:56:07,637
and you do the same too.

762
00:56:09,171 --> 00:56:11,271
Promise me.

763
00:56:13,171 --> 00:56:17,137
Okay. Let's do that.

764
00:56:18,071 --> 00:56:20,603
If you pretend nothing happened,

765
00:56:22,937 --> 00:56:25,837
I'll do the same.

766
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:33,304
Would you like more milk?

767
00:57:48,937 --> 00:57:51,470
So the switchover could
take place today, right?

768
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:59,470
We're all set to collect the blood.
You should do it, right?

769
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,470
Yeah.

770
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,438
I can do it alone, so could you wait outside?

771
00:58:02,438 --> 00:58:04,037
Sure.

772
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:30,503
This angel's prettier.

773
00:58:31,104 --> 00:58:34,737
No. This angel's prettier.

774
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:56,438
Da Ran, Yun Jae passed out.

775
00:59:11,371 --> 00:59:12,737
Gyeong Jun.

776
01:00:25,704 --> 01:00:27,570
Gyeong Jun.

777
01:00:54,503 --> 01:00:56,737
It's you, Gyeong Jun, right?
