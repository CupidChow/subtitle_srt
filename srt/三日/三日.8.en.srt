1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
<i>3 Days</i>

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,280
<i>March 8, 8PM
The bill of impeachment introduced.</i>

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,770
If I don't stop at this point,

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:18,700
there will be another person who gets sacrificed.
Whenever that happens, I'm going to ask myself again.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,510
"Will you continue on this path?"

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,210
The answer is always the same.

7
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,550
I will not give up.

8
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,060
Because I am a President, who gave an oath,

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,860
to protect this country's constitution and justice.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,980
I cannot step back.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,130
Until I finish that work, I...

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,420
have to be the President of this country.

13
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,830
Until then,

14
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,530
will you be able to protect me?

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,880
<i>This is your first actual experience, right?</i>

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,340
<i>I... have been doing this for 13 years up to now.</i>

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,420
<i>But, it's the same for me.</i>

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,420
<i>I am nervous just as much as you are.</i>

19
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,050
<i>Especially... on a day like today.</i>

20
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,670
<i>Ok. Let's start!</i>

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,060
<i>When did you exactly hear the election results?</i>

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,140
<i>December, 2012</i>

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,100
<i>Right now, the Blue House PSS Agents have arrived at the 
newly elected President Lee Dong Hwi's house.</i>

24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,990
<i>As soon as the results were announced 
by the National Election Committee,</i>

25
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,340
<i>the same security services given to the current president has started.</i>

26
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,380
<i>Episode 8</i>

27
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,040
<i>You came later than I thought you would.</i>

28
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,090
<i>Congratulations on being elected.</i>

29
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,210
<i>This is the PSS team who will be with you, 
from today until the day you finish your term.</i>

30
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,070
<i>You look very young. 
 How long have you been with the PSS?</i>

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,290
<i>He's a rookie PSS Agent, but he has great abilities.</i>

32
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,140
<i>I heard that the PSS Agents can die for the President.</i>

33
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,070
<i>But, you're too young to die instead of me.</i>

34
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,350
<i>I can do that.</i>

35
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,820
<i>You're the first President that I'll be serving.</i>

36
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,810
<i>No matter what happens, I will protect you.</i>

37
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,910
<i>I am the Chief of PSS, Ham Bong Soo.</i>

38
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,280
<i>I am PSS Agent, Kim Han Joon.</i>

39
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,360
<i>I am PSS Agent, Kim Hyo Sung.</i>

40
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,340
<i>I am PSS Agent, Han Tae Kyeong.</i>

41
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,390
Back then, I

42
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,160
thought I had it all.

43
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,070
I had an illusion that I could change the world according to my thoughts.

44
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,650
What I have left now is...

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,440
Nothing.

46
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:47,190
The NIS, the police, the prosecutor, 
and even the people inside the Blue House...

47
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,650
I can't trust anyone.

48
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,130
The person I can trust,

49
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,460
is only PSS Agent Han Tae Kyeong.

50
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,270
I am the President, only in name,

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,530
but there is something I must do.

52
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,580
Until then,

53
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,810
can you protect... me?

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,350
I...

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,210
am not sure.

56
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,060
Back then, everything was clear,

57
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,830
but now,

58
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,230
I lost my confidence.

59
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,460
In this state,

60
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,350
I can't remain at the PSS.

61
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,290
I think this is the end for me.

62
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,940
It's not just one.

63
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,910
The NIS material that the Chief Economist
 Han Ki Joon investigated,

64
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:13,550
The army investigation material from then,
 that General Kim Ki Beum and Colonel Yang Dae Oh, investigated.

65
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,860
Material from fund manager, Kim Woo Young, who investigated

66
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,400
the source of the slush funds that were delivered to North Korea.

67
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,640
With the evidence that was collected from 
the different organizations each person belonged to,

68
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,680
and the confidential documents that each collected,

69
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,410
were what your father had put together,

70
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,480
the file for Confidential Document '98.

71
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,620
He passed away while tying to deliver that to me,
 and the Special Prosecutor Choi Ji Yoon.

72
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,210
Your father fought and struggled alone for 16 years.

73
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:52,000
He told me the truth and won over other people 
who shared the same thought.

74
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,180
He didn't know how to give up, even once.

75
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,270
The biggest reason why he did that, 
was because more than anything else,

76
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,460
he wanted to be honorable for his son.

77
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,740
Even if you... don't believe me, 
please don't question

78
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,130
your father's... sincerity.

79
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,850
<i>Special Prosecutor's</i>

80
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,170
<i>investigation results,</i>

81
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,180
<i>are true.</i>

82
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,550
<i>It's not important what kind of a person the President is.</i>

83
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,450
<i>He was elected by the people.</i>

84
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,380
Why?

85
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,180
Do you want to sit there?

86
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,610
I wouldn't dare.

87
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,860
What do you want?

88
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:48,140
The Chief of Civil Administration and the Chief of Political Affairs, along with the other office secretaries,

89
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,810
and the employees of the Blue House. 
 35 people have submitted their resignation letters.

90
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,060
Other employees are also in agreement.

91
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,430
What about you, Chief Secretary?

92
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,440
Why isn't there a resignation letter from you?

93
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,310
I...

94
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,630
will protect you till the end.

95
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,420
We were together in the beginning,

96
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,370
so we should be together at the end as well.

97
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,910
The Prime Minister will soon be arriving back from China.

98
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,160
Do you have any message for him?

99
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,800
Then... I'll be back.

100
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,390
<i>While the impeachment of the President
 Lee Dong Hui, is being processed,</i>

101
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,040
<i>Prime Minister Lee Kyeong Wan is returning to Korea 
 after an unofficial visit to China.</i>

102
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,880
<i>Prime Minister!
Prime Minister!</i>

103
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,460
<i>They announced an impeachment.
What is your thoughts on it?</i>

104
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,880
<i>Did you know about his criminal activities?</i>

105
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,700
<i>What do you think will happen?</i>

106
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,960
<i>Please give a comment!</i>

107
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,210
What happened with the thing I asked?

108
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,830
It was handled as you had ordered.

109
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,420
This has to be a secret between,

110
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,730
the Director and me.

111
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,740
I know that.

112
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,220
What was the Blue House doing till it got to this point?

113
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,150
We had no choice.

114
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,670
What do you mean you had no choice?

115
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,710
The Special Prosecutor's investigation results

116
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,560
are true.

117
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,470
Are you serious?

118
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,760
You're going to have to prepare to replace the President.
The Republic of Korea's fate,

119
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,490
is hanging on your shoulders.

120
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,010
The Blue House will do our best to help.

121
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,590
And before that,

122
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,370
There is someone who wishes to meet you, Prime Minister.

123
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,910
So, how will Chief Ham Bong Soo's funeral be taken care of?

124
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:37,260
Ahh... I heard he doesn't have any family members
 who can take care of his body.

125
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,050
Chief Ham Bong Soo tried to kill the President.
 He even shot his agents himself.

126
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:47,130
But still, I feel bad for him. 
He didn't get married and dedicated himself only to PSS.

127
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,700
So, are you saying that he should be buried at the National Cemetery?

128
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,290
It was a one-time mistake.

129
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,950
He's never wavered in his life,

130
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,750
but this was a one-time mistake.

131
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,620
So . . . Are you regretting it?

132
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:09,000
You'll still have to shoot if the same situation arises again.

133
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,080
If you can't, you should leave from this position.

134
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,580
Yes.

135
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,170
That's why I'm thinking of doing that.

136
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,370
Tae Kyeong.

137
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,410
Hey, Han Tae Kyeong.

138
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,540
Tae Kyeong, why are you being like this?

139
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,640
<i>Resignation letter</i>

140
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,370
Hand this in for me.

141
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:51,340
Are you really thinking of leaving the PSS?

142
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:57,000
Chief Ham Bong Soo, it was his only mistake,

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,250
but it was a mistake that should never have been made.

144
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,660
Don't be shaken. It's not like you.

145
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,120
If it were you, what would you have done?

146
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,350
If it was me who made that mistake...

147
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:16,720
If I was pointing my gun at the President, and you were there...

148
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,340
And if you had to shoot and kill me, how would you have felt?

149
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,040
PSS Agents must protect the President.

150
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,390
You can't waver and you can't think about anything else.

151
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:39,370
But, I am a human with emotions and a heart.

152
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:46,200
I won't be able to kill someone

153
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,510
to protect another person again.

154
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,450
So, I have to leave.

155
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:25,070
♫ <i>In my room that is only full of darkness,
A single ray of sunlight comes in. </i> ♫

156
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:39,290
♫ <i>I cover my eyes, and to run away from that light,
I hide in a different space.</i> ♫

157
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,370
I heard you were suspended.

158
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,290
Because of me...

159
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,830
I'm sorry.

160
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,200
It's not finalized yet.

161
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,870
I will prove to the disciplinary committee that my actions were justifiable.

162
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,120
Do you need the report of my father's case 
as materials for explanation?

163
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,580
Did you come from the funeral?

164
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,580
I did too.

165
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,810
I came from three funerals.

166
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:36,580
Commander Kim Ki Beom, Fund Manager Kim Moo Young,
 and Colonel Yang Dae Ho.

167
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,660
I wanted to meet with the families of the deceased,

168
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,870
to see if any of the articles that were left behind 
could be used as materials for explanation.

169
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,800
So, were you able to gain any?

170
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,790
No,

171
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,830
materials to explain my case weren't what was important.

172
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,120
I want to reveal the truth.

173
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,870
Everything started with your father's incident.

174
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:13,890
If we start searching from this, we'll find out why 
they died and what they were involved in.

175
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,160
Constable Yoon.

176
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,550
Of course, I'm just a Constable from the country side.

177
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,040
But, I will do the best I can.

178

<i>Confidential Document 98 - Han Ki Joon</i>

187
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:25,410
<i>1998, February.
 Due to about 10 reconnaissance scouts sent from the North,</i>

188
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,750
<i> including civilians, there were 24 casualties</i>

189
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:35,170
<i>and 19 injuries, becoming one of the worst incidents ever.</i>

190
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:41,330
<i>I am reporting the dirty truth behind this incident.</i>

191
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:48,910
<i>The main culprits who concocted the Yangjinri Incident 
were high-ranking officials, and chaebols.</i>

192
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:54,620
<i>With Falcon backing, the first time they contacted
 the North was January of 1998.</i>

193
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,410
<i> They met in Beijing, after an unofficial economic cooperation conference with between the South and the North. </i>

<i>January, 1998

195
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,950
<i>- Here, please accept my drink. 
- We should try to meet more often.</i>

196
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,790
<i>Thank you. </i>

197
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,490
<i>Please accept this drink.</i>

198
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,290
<i>We should do our best to help each other out.</i>

199
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,250
<i>From the North, there were</i>

200
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,300
<i>People's Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff Hwang Kyeong Joon .</i>

201
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:31,580
<i> And People's Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff Lee Chul Gyu. </i>

202
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,220
<i>Okay, now shall we actually start the meeting?</i>

203
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,200
<i>Let me ask you straightforwardly.</i>

204
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:46,330
<i>For the submarine to just go down for a bit and come back up, 
is that really all you need?</i>

205
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,200
<i>Would that level of a boat ride seize the people's attention?</i>

206
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,200
<i>I'll also ask straightforwardly.</i>

207
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,850
<i>A submarine and the lives of some tens of people.
 How much are they worth?</i>

208
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:12,870
<i>A downpayment of 10 million dollars. After everything is successfully accomplished, 90 million dollars.</i>

209
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,370
<i> In all, I'll pay 100 million dollars. </i>

210
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,600
<i> All of this is the testimony of
 Lee Chul Gyu of People's Armed Forces. </i>

211
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,970
<i>However, there is no evidence to support his testimony.</i>

212
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,580
You're saying this is all true?

213
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,080
I am. The Prosecution has already given indictment 
and a written arraignment has been filed.

214
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,200
Then...

215
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,370
He'll be the first incumbent President to stand trial.

216
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,520
Korea is now in crisis.

217
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,780
The citizens are uneasy.

218
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:08,300
You are the only one that can

219
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,500
control this crisis.

220
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,940
I, just as the law provides,

221
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,520
can only execute duties in lieu of the President.

222
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,240
But, during that time,

223
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,580
you are the number one person in Korea.

224
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,950
As part of the financial world,

225
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,270
I want to be help to you, Prime Minister, whether it be big or small.

226
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,930
For the sake of this country.

227
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,550
He's a typical second-in-command style.

228
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,950
While he is good at doing his job, he doesn't have ambition.

229
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,590
For him, his own safety is important. 
We don't know when he'll switch sides.

230
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,720
So, you need to watch him.

231
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,790
There's not much time left until D-Day.

232
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,620
Just until then, we just have to use the Prime Minister well.

233
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,110
Someone asked to give this to you, Chairman Kim Do Jin.

234
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,570
<i> People's Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff Lee Chul Gyu was </i>

<i>- Asylum?

237
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,150
<i>Soon, the government will start its extensive purge. </i>

238
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,860
<i>Professor Han Ki Joon,
 you're the only one I can trust from the South.</i>

239
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,820
<i>Wait... But first, give me some time.</i>

240
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,240
<i>There is no time.</i>

241
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,450
<i>What is this?</i>

242
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,950
<i>The Yangjinri Incident, A Unilateral Provocation from the North</i>

243
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,050
<i>Last time, remember the 10 million dollars you gave me?</i>

244
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,360
<i>You mean the fund to provide food for the North?</i>

245
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,450
<i>Do you still believe that lie?</i>

246
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,690
<i>That money was a down payment.</i>

247
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,130
<i>Wh...what do you mean?</i>

248
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,290
<i>It was the price of the people who died here.</i>

249
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,380
<i>That makes no sense!</i>

250
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,100
<i>That was a fund for food.</i>

251
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,800
<i>That was just something that the Americans and South Korean government fabricated.</i>

252
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,430
<i> was a deal to achieve several billion dollar deal</i>

253
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,070
<i>involving weapons.</i>

254
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,820
<i>I'll contact you again after a month.</i>

255
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,530
<i>Then, I'll bring evidence to substantiate what I said.</i>

256
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,800
<i>Until then, please complete my asylum preparation.</i>

257
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,240
<i>Say that again.</i>

258
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,880
<i>You're lying, right? 
 Answer!</i>

259
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,210
<i>Answer! That's a lie, right?</i>

260
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,370
<i>Why can't you say anything? Answer me!</i>

261
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,090
<i>Answer! That's a lie, right?</i>

262
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,540
<i>Answer me!</i>

263
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,920
<i>Dad!</i>

264
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,060
<i>What did you say? What did you say? Talk!</i>

265
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,790
<i>-Dad... stop. 
 -You're lying, right?</i>

266
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:59,370
<i>Dad... stop... Please don't. do that.</i>

267
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,980
<i> After that day, I couldn't contact Lee Chul Gyu </i>

268
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,170
<i>and I, through the refugee human rights organizations in Incheon,</i>

269
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,350
<i>started to inquire whether or not he was alive.</i>

270
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,790
<i> However, eventually. Lee Chul Gyu,</i>

271
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,180
<i>during the 1998 purge,</i>

272
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,330
<i> was executed.</i>

273
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,030
Deputy Chief of Staff Lee Chul Gyu?

274
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,940
How would I know that person?

275
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,750
I'm only a restaurant manager.

276
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,800
How many years in prison does a broker for North Korean defectors get?

277
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,400
Gosh... this guy ..

278
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,720
What are you trying to do?

279
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,910
Go back quietly.

280
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:53,480
You know Chief Han Ki Joon who recently died?

281
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,030
I have all the information he investigated about you.

282
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,660
You said you knew Chief Economist Han Ki Joon?

283
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,670
Yes.

284
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,850
Are you really sure the People's Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff was executed?

285
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,150
That man...

286
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,610
That he was executed during the purge,

287
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,310
the rumor spread everywhere.

288
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,070
Then possibly... does anyone here

289
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,370
know him well?

290
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,610
Relative,

291
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,420
or the same department?

292
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,860
Han Ki Joon asked the same thing.

293
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,320
<i> I am Han Ki Joon. </i>

294
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,200
<i> Do you know him by any chance? </i>

295
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,720
<i> Lee Chul Gyu. </i>

296
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,020
<i>There is no one like him here.</i>

297
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,060
Yes, this is Han Tae Kyeong.

298
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,730
Agent, did your father have any acquaintance in Incheon?

299
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,740
Incheon? Why are you suddenly...

300
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,870
What? Where?

301
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,480
Well.. this place is...

302
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,360
<i>Yoon Bo Won was here.</i>

303
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,480
Someone sent me this picture.

304
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,310
<i> 1998. North Korea-South Korea Economic Cooperation Meeting </i>

305
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,290
This picture... who...?

306
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:04,160
This conference was secret. No news article was on this.

307
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,620
Who do you think it was?

308
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,700
This person requested it from the employee.

309
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,550
You!

310
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,450
Major Lee Chul Gyu!

311
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,860
How did he...

312
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,580
Didn't you tell me this definitively back then?

313
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,790
That as the North purged the opposition party,
 he was executed.

314
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:33,350
That he can never say anything again!

315
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,120
There's no dangerous material.

316
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:26,000
Chief Economist Han Ki Joon was the first one to think about this method.

317
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,190
You also contacted me using the same way.

318
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,910
<i> 99 + 06000 = 5578 </i>

319
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,330
Haven't you told me?

320
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,600
That you don't feel safe even inside the Blue House.

321
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,250
99, Urgency 
 06000, 6AM

322
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:51,210
5578, the point at which I would be 
getting in and out of the car for the event at Cheongju Station.

323
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,200
What is the urgent reason for which you have called me out here?

324
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,580
I have met Major Lee Chul Gyu.

325
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,490
from the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces (MPAF) of North Korea.

326
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,790
Major Lee Chul Gyu is deceased.

327
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:13,500
I checked multiple times through the other organizations.

328
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,910
No. That person is alive.

329
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:21,370
He's alive, and he's in our country right now.

330
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,250
If you use him, you can do what you're planning to do.

331
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,680
I have issued a search warrant for Lee Chul Gyu as a North Korean spy.

332
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,990
I also called for support.

333
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,370
Since he smuggled himself in from China, 
there's a high possibility that he's in Incheon.

334
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:45,370
What would be the reason he has sent this to me?

335
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,790
If his existence gets revealed,

336
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:53,160
he would clearly know his life would be in danger.

337
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,450
He probably wants money.

338
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:07,000
He probably didn't come empty-handed. He must have something worth making a deal with me.

339
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,160
So he contacted me.

340
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,620
And so he should be killed all the more silently and surely.

341
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:28,040
Lee Chul Gyu was an elite secret agent that the North revered.

342
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:34,440
He has a lot of experience and is a fast thinker. 
If we underestimate him, we'll suffer.

343
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,540
Even if we kill him, it's after we confirm what information he has

344
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,410
that we must kill him.

345
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,870
Why did you change your mind?

346
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,290
Why did you decide to work again?

347
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,510
Someone has said this.

348
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,250
That she wants to reveal the truth.

349
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,860
It's someone who only went through hardships because of this case.

350
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,160
She has no reason to be responsible for this at all.

351
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,120
But she still said that she just wanted to reveal the truth.

352
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,510
After hearing that, I came to know what's really important.

353
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:36,750
That's why I intend to do the same.

354
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,000
Agent Han Tae Kyeong.

355
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,450
I want to ask one more thing.

356
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,410
Do you trust your fellow agents?

357
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,660
What are you saying?

358
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:01,290
Is Agent Lee Cha Yeong... someone you can trust?

359
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,580
Yes. She's a trustworthy colleague and friend.

360
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,270
Why... are you asking that?

361
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:15,450
I just wanted to know what you thought.

362
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:19,330
Then, be careful.

363
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,410
<i>Briefing on Induction Ceremony of New Employees</i>

364
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,350
<i>Report on Modifications of Safety Personnel 
of the Presidential Security Service</i>

365
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,350
<i>Presidential Security Service</i>

366
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,290
<i> 09000 + 3595 = rain shower </i>

367
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,200
- Chief Secretary! 
 - Let's talk later.

368
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,850
This is an urgent matter. The President has asked to hold a special press conference.

369
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,910
A special press conference?

370
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,450
A press conference?

371
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,540
He is probably trying to create public sympathy.

372
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,790
I'll pressure the press and other media

373
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,330
to handle this situation without compromise.

374
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,290
The problem is not the press conference.

375
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:00,080
He scheduled it without even discussing it with the PR department.

376
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,580
How about the text of the speech? What is he announcing?

377
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,290
There was no talk about that either.

378
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,410
The President wrote it himself.

379
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,010
What's going on?

380
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,040
We have only received the message.

381
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,950
Where is he holding the press conference? In the Chunchugwan (Press Hall) or the Sungjoogwan?

382
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:25,500
Neither of them. The VIP is planning to hold his press conference outside the Blue House.

383
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,580
Outside?

384
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,410
Press conference for President usually takes place at Chunchugwan in Blue House.

385
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:37,450
However, why did Lee Dong Hwi

386
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,500
choose to hold his press conference on the outside?

387
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,140
How did it go? Did you find Lee Cheol Gyu?

388
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,170
Yes, we found him.

389
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,740
He was staying long-term at a nearby motel.

390
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,630
However when we arrived, he had already checked out.

391
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,520
So, you can't find him?

392
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,190
Rather than that, there is something more important.

393
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:19,410
According to the woman in charge of the model, someone came to meet Lee Chul Gyu.

394
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,420
After I asked about their appearance, I showed her a picture.

395
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,380
They were Agent Han Tae Kyeong and the woman police officer.

396
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,840
Then, are you saying he went with them?

397
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,830
Circumstantially, yes.

398
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,250
Lee Chul Gyu is siding with the President.

399
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,560
The PSS and the President are planning something.

400
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,720
What do you mean?

401
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,080
I found a code at the security office.

402
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,380
It's the code that body guards use.

403
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,100
Deceased Chief Han Ki Joon and General Yang Gi Ho

404
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,850
also used this technique to pass information to the president.

405
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,760
I have seen the code book at the investigation for the attempted assassination.

406
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,280
So, exactly what information did they exchange?

407
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,340
0900 + 3595 = Rain shower

408
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,840
0900 is 9 AM

409
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:26,740
35 is press, 95 is meet. Press conference.

410
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,920
So...

411
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,700
What does "rain shower" (<u>son</u>ahgi) mean?

412
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,190
A guest ("<u>son</u>")

413
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:42,120
A guest has been prepared for the special press conference today.

414
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,100
What? What is it?

415
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,920
The Blue House can't have outside people.

416
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:58,170
All the more if it's a North Korean refugee who was smuggled in.

417
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,160
What are you speaking of?

418
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,700
That's why the press conference is outside.

419
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:08,800
To hold a press conference together 
with a guest who is not able to enter the Blue House.

420
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,460
Surely not...

421
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,510
It's true.

422
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:16,980
Lee Dong Hwi is planning to put Lee Chul Gyu on the stand at the Press Conference.

423
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,010
Lee Chul Gyu

424
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,350
must be blocked.

425
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,700
<i>It's breaking news.</i>

427
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,480
<i>After maintaining silence, what is it that the President wants to say to the people?</i>

428
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,090
<i>The citizens of South Korea will be waiting to hear the voice of the President Lee Dong Hwi.</i>

429
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,040
It's me.

430
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,460
I need the security plan for this event.

431
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,550
I don't need to know how Lee Dong Hwi is getting there.

432
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:53,640
I need to know which way Lee Chul Gyu will be entering the Press Conference.

433
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,910
The security plan is secured even inside the security.

434
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,910
If they're not the body guards assigned to that day's event, it's impossible to obtain it..

435
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,320
Nothing is impossible.

436
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,370
If they find out what we've done,

437
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,840
Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon's will also becomes a lie.

438
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,190
You wouldn't want the special investigation to start over, would you?

439
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,420
This is the East Entrance. 
Lee Chul Gyu is not here yet.

440
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,890
-There's no abnormality, right?
-Right.

441
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,050
There's nothing wrong at the West Entrance, either.

450
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,060

Let's go.

455
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:46,520

No, there isn't.

459

They are planning on transporting him in a car with license plate 5198.

Where is Agent Han Tae Kyeong?

He is planning on meeting the security team at basement 5 parking lot at 8:53am and move together.

Did they arrive?

00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:40,540
The press conference must have started already.

476
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:45,490
I'm looking forward to what he will say without you, 
Major Lee Chul Gyu.

477
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,390
The Special Prosecutor's investigation announcement
 on March 6th,

478
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,930
is not the truth.

479
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,230
Are you denying the investigation itself?

480
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,190
Do you not have any connection to the Yangjinri incident?

481
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:08,750
Do you have concrete evidence to refute the 
Special Prosecutor's investigation announcement?

482
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,610
<i>If you use him, you will be able to do the things
 you want to accomplish.</i>

483

<i>The people you are up against are</i>

00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,650
<i>people who move the Republic of Korea.</i>

<i>They're monsters without justice, blood, or tears.</i>

<i>You have to be prudent.</i>

488
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:35,810
<i>Are you saying, I need concrete evidence, that 
no one could deny?</i>

489
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:39,460
<i>Yes. To gain that evidence</i>

490
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,230
<i>I need the President's and the PSS's help.</i>

491
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,460
Yes.

492
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,660
I have the evidence.

493
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,980
What is that?

494
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,390

<i>President Lee Dong Hwi Special Press Conference</i>

496
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,710

Didn't you want to make a deal with me?

498
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,240
I am a business man.

499
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,620
Since you made me move all the way here,

500
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:29,010
it must be information that is commensurate, right?

501
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,660
What information?

502
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:41,650
The evidence that you caused the Yangjinri incident?

503
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:45,400
It's hard to establish that, just with your testimony.

504
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,630
Who will listen to the testimony of a North Korean defector?

505

I'll give you a new identity and 5 million dollars.

506
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,010
Hand over the evidence you brought with you.

507
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,430
Your words are right.

508
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:02,710
It will be hard with just testimony from a 
North Korean defector.

509
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,230
Unless there is other evidence.

510
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:11,570
That's why... I became the decoy.

511
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:18,100
To be exact, it's not evidence,

512
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,350
but a witness.

513
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:20,820
The evidence that will make it impossible
