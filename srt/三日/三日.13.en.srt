Episode 13

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,230
Who will be first?

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,670
Who will I kill first?

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,840
From now on...

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,590
there will be no one...

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,660
...in my way.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,900
If you want to fight...

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,500
...fight me.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,500
Other people...

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,770
...are not at fault.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,340
That's for me to decide.

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,820
Gun! Eleven o'clock!

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:08,560
Go!

15
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,130
Under provision 19, article 2 
of Presidential Security rules,

16
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,160
while the agent is carrying out his duties,

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,970
he can choose to use his 
weapon within reason.

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,370
At a time like this when someone is 
attempting to shoot the President,

19
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,610
I can shoot my gun.

20
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,380
Shoot the President?

21
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,010
I never did such a thing.

22
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,160
How is it over there?

23
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,620
Nothing.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Vent looks good, too.

25
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,870
Behind the CCTV...

26
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,260
everything is fine.

27
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,780
Are you sure?

28
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,780
We're returning to the Blue House.

29
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,960
See? I said I never did that.

30
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,390
Lower your guns.

31
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,810
Agent Lee Cha Young...

32
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,900
Officer Yoon Bo Won...

33
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,850
Are they well?

34
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,300
Why don't you try calling them?

35
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,660
Wait...

36
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,690
Your voice sounds familiar.

37
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,600
Get her!

38
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,450
Agent!

39
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,950
What?

40
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,980
Where are you?

41
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,770
How about Officer Yoon? 
You're with her, right?

42
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,050
No.

43
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,350
We parted at the hospital.

44
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,390
Hey, she told me not to worry since the 
police are throughout the hospital.

45
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,260
Go back.

46
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,040
What?

47
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,410
Go back!

48
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,480
All vehicles. Return to the Blue House.

49
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,530
Who will be first?

50
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,970
Who will I kill first?

51
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,310
No.

52
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,960
Let's go to the hospital where 
Agent Lee Cha Young is.

53
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,130
It's dangerous for you to 
remain outside much longer.

54
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,880
Let's go to the hospital.

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,690
Okay.

56
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,840
All vehicles.

57
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,860
Head over to the Bumjoong Hospital.

58
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,490
What happened?

59
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,060
I'm back but don't see anyone.

60
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,810
The nurses say the police took 
her for an emergency transfer.

61
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,040
When?

62
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,140
Just now.

63
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,620
What precinct?

64
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,740
We're from the Gangnam district.

65
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,910
We were ordered to transfer the witness.

66
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,050
Are you talking about 
the Special Prosecution?

67
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,200
Officer Yoon.

68
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,070
Officer Yoon, are you okay?

69
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,480
Agent Lee Cha Young.

70
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,270
Where's Agent Lee Cha Young?

71
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,480
One of the special prosecution 
team member was here.

72
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,240
He had been here with the Special Prosecutor.

73
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,090
You're headed to the Jaesin Headquarters?

74
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,230
No, you can't.

75
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,730
You saw it yourself.

76
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,330
The ones who kidnapped 
Agent Lee Cha Young today...

77
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,110
They're all Chairman Kim Do Jin's people. 
We can't neglect this any further.

78
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,810
That's why you can't go.

79
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,740
We're supposed to protect the President.

80
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,350
As you say...

81
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,320
if Chairman Kim Do Jin is a threat,

82
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,630
you, too...

83
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,020
...will be in danger.

84
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,450
With all due respect,

85
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,400
I'll meet him.

86
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,970
As the Chief said, you may be in danger.

87
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,630
Your guest has arrived.

88
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,910
A call from the Blue House itself...

89
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,900
This is an honor.

90
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,340
What do you want?

91
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,900
I don't quite follow you.

92
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,120
What do you want?

93
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Surely, you know.

94
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,030
Everything we do is all 
for the sake of money.

95
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,870
It's the same as Chairman Kim Do Jin.

96
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,820
It's all about money.

97
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,870
Mr. President.

98
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,630
Your refusal to import weapons from Falcon 
has caused us to suffer significant losses.

99
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,520
Surely...

100
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,870
compensation on that 
level would be appropriate.

101
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,960
Or we can become partners 
as we were in the past.

102
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,680
It's your decision to make.

103
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,380
I want to do something to help.

104
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,710
She was kidnapped right in front of me. 
I couldn't do anything to help her.

105
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,900
You can't go out without me.

106
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,370
I put some food in the 
kitchen, so eat something.

107
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:01,140
And there are police patrolling the area, 
so report right away if something happens.

108
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,440
Come over here.

109
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,690
I understand your frustration.

110
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,640
But you can't leave this room.

111
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,190
I understand.

112
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,130
Cha Young...

113
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,050
She will be okay.

114
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,050
Yes.

115
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,270
We'll find her for sure.

116
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,090
So, stay strong.

117
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,990
I'm ashamed.

118
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,810
Did you find out where your team is?

119
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,510
We're placing him on the 
most wanted list, but...

120
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,110
his phone is off and he escaped 
in an unregistered vehicle.

121
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,460
Finding him is difficult.

122
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,900
At this point...

123
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,220
the way to find Agent Lee 
Cha Young is questionable.

124
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,010
We should...

125
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,890
...convince Chairman Kim Do Jin somehow.

126
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,530
What's going on with his arrest warrant?

127
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,070
We were denied again.

128
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,340
We know Jaesin was behind the 
dynamite terrorist incident.

129
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,670
Whether Chairman Kim knew about it or not,

130
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,040
we can't prove it.

131
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,010
Also with Yangjinri,

132
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,330
all suspects were indicted without detention.

133
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,750
We can't only arrest Chairman Kim who 
was added to the indictment list later.

134
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,100
Then there's no way...

135
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,160
to arrest that crazy bastard?

136
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,460
He won't respond as a 
witness reference either.

137
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,310
If we push him further, just like he did with 
Director Byun Tae Hoon or Representative Min Hyun Ki,

138
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,480
he can kill Agent Lee Cha Young 
and make it appear as a suicide.

139
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,610
Just move.

140
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,020
I'm in a bad mood.

141
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,960
Chairman Kim is waiting for you.

142
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,200
I was wondering when you would come by.

143
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,890
Where's Cha Young?

144
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,390
Where is she?

145
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,560
Do you want to rescue her?

146
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,300
Do you want me to tell 
you the way to save her?

147
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,190
The Presidential security 
system is near perfection.

148
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,980
As long as Secret Service is around,

149
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,910
assassination of the President 
is nearly impossible. But...

150
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,280
that doesn't mean it can't be done.

151
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,320
It happened in Chungsoodae, too.

152
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,230
Either there's inside help or the 
President can step outside by himself.

153
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,400
What the heck are you babbling about?

154
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,420
It's impossible to do him harm 
during the official event.

155
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,740
But isn't it easier to get to 
him during his personal outings?

156
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,520
At the moment, you're the 
President's most trusted agent.

157
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,760
Aren't you, Agent Han?

158
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,670
What do you think?

159
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,190
Take the President out for an 
outing, just the two of you.

160
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,160
These days...

161
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,810
With all that stuff about Yangjinri and 
impeachment, I'm sure he's been down lately.

162
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,280
Take him out to see a movie or 
suggest he take a short trip.

163
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,690
It's simple.

164
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,160
If only you can do that, 
Agent Lee will be safe.

165
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,930
She'll be back at the hospital.

166
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,780
Your shooting attempt at the gym...

167
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,150
You tested the Secret Service, right?

168
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,220
When that didn't work,

169
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:48,880
you're blackmailing the Secret Service 
agent to lure the President to his death?

170
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,470
Well then...

171
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,530
Why don't you sit back and watch...

172
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,680
Agent Lee Cha Young's death?

173
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
Did you do the same thing to...

174
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,110
Chief Ham Bong Soo?

175
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,610
Did you hold something over his head 
and coax him to kill the President?

176
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,470
You must think the Secret Service is a joke.

177
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,060
We don't fall for it twice.

178
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,850
You'll suffer from guilt 
the rest of your life.

179
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,930
You're the one...

180
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
who killed Agent Lee Cha Young.

181
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,280
If Cha Young dies...

182
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,050
I'll kill you myself.

183
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,550
I heard the shareholders called a 
meeting about dismissing you as CEO.

184
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,580
The Jaesin Group's stock price is plummeting.

185
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,400
And you being indicted for 
treason. It's no wonder.

186
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,230
It's not over until it's over.

187
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,440
What's the status of the President's 
emergency financial order?

188
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,410
If that gets passed in the National Assembly,

189
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,640
then we're finished.

190
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,580
There won't be anything like that.

191
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,230
If we get anymore bad news...

192
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,620
then you'll have to take responsibility for 
all the time and money Falcon investment here.

193
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,090
This is your last chance.

194
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,410
Don't take the same path as your father.

195
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,130
Agent Han Tae Kyung isn't the 
only agent in the Secret Service.

196
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,420
Just as there was Yangjinri 
for Chief Ham Bong Soo,

197
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,940
everyone has...

198
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,670
...their own weakness.

199
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,160
A green circle.

200
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,230
899.

201
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,180
Gyungil Gas Station.

202
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,650
Yeouido Retail Store.

203
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,070
I'll find a way to stop Chairman 
Kim no matter what it takes.

204
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,130
No more victims.

205
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,100
I will...

206
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,940
...stop him.

207
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,870
Gyungil Gas Station.

208
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,020
Here are the keychains.

209
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,940
Here you go.

210
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes.

211
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,320
The guy arrested from Jaesin filled 
up his gas tank at this gas station.

212
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,510
I think he came here often.

213
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,960
There has to be something 
relevant to Jaesin in this area.

214
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,160
But it's hard to start your 
investigation with one gas station.

215
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,000
Also, Agent Lee was kidnapped 
after that guy was arrested.

216
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,440
I'll do my best to look for her.

217
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,610
I'll call you if I find a clue.

218
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,330
Hold on as long as you can.

219
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,690
Until I find you.

220
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,160
It has to be around here somewhere.

221
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,560
You two alone couldn't have stolen 
the explosives and put them in place.

222
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,170
Isn't Chairman Kim of 
Jaesin Group behind this?

223
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,800
If you tell us who's behind this, 
you may get a reduced sentence.

224
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,010
Yes.

225
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,530
We're continuing our investigation.

226
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,070
We need only one confession 
to arrest Chairman Kim.

227
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,590
But he won't talk.

228
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,810
The same sticker I saw at Jaesin 
underground parking lot.

229
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,090
There's definitely something here.

230
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,330
It's okay.

231
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,520
Don't you feel better now?

232
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,510
How are you feeling?

233
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,080
Kidnapping me...

234
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,080
...won't change anything.

235
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,980
The act of terror with explosives or...

236
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,990
the Yangjinri incident...

237
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,590
You will definitely...

238
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,650
...be found guilty.

239
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,160
I'm...

240
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,290
...innocent in any case.

241
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,460
I worked hard to make money 
in this capitalistic society.

242
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,130
Is that a crime?

243
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,820
So, you should...

244
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,080
...just stay put.

245
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,710
That's how I can make money.

246
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,400
And...

247
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,820
just die quietly.

248
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,050
Agent Han Tae Kyung is...

249
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,380
...looking for Agent Lee Cha Young?

250
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,040
You don't need to worry about that.

251
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,650
He'll never find her.

252
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,390
More importantly...

253
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,430
...watch Lee Dong Hwi closely.

254
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,590
The important person is...

255
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,580
Lee Dong Hwi.

256
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,770
Daeseungri Power Plant Construction.

257
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,170
Chungsoodae, Fishing location.

258
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,710
Origin of the dynamite.

259
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,370
Everyone, be careful.

260
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,150
Oh no, what's going on?

261
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,860
What did you just say?

262
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,950
Can you repeat that?

263
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,000
I will...

264
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,330
...leave the Blue House myself.

265
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,390
But...

266
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,490
...I have one request.

267
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,310
Release Agent Lee Cha Young before that.

268
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:52,930
And...

269
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,710
I don't want...

270
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:59,120
Agent Han Tae Kyung or any other agents

271
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,350
to get hurt or be in danger...

272
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,390
...because of me.

273
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,710
Of course.

274
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,010
I don't want agents getting 
in the way either.

275
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,640
If you cooperate,

276
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,760
I'm sure you can distract them.

277
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,450
Where should I go?

278
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,270
Citimax Theater #7.

279
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,960
Come by 7:30pm.

280
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,230
There will be a good movie on.

281
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,800
From Secretary Han Gi Joon's death and 
all criminal activities started here.

282
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,870
If we interrogate the suspects 
with all this evidence,

283
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,640
there has to be a clue as to 
where Agent Lee is being hidden.

284
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,440
I can probably get an arrest 
warrant for Chairman Kim, too.

285
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,850
There's one concern.

286
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,650
All the materials here...

287
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:14,260
are relevant to past crimes.

288
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,260
But one thing...

289
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,560
I saw the blueprint to a place 
where nothing has happened yet.

290
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,580
Citimax Theater Emergency Route.

291
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,400
Citimax Theater.

292
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,880
Plan A, 20:00 Fire Alarm.

293
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,020
It looked like they were planning 
another crime in that building.

294
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,950
Please look into that please.

295
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:23,120
There's a voicemail. Press 
"Call" to hear your message.

296
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,930
I found the hangout for Jaesin's people.

297
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,830
I found blueprints showing a shooting 
plan at the Citimax Theater.

298
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,030
I'm reporting it because it makes me nervous.

299
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,070
Please call me when you receive this message.

300
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,890
Everyone get ready to go.

301
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,410
The VIP is going out.

302
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,080
So suddenly?

303
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
Where is he going without prior notice?

304
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,150
The location is the Citimax Theater.

305
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:53,950
Hurry up.

306
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,350
Yes, sir.

307
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:54,840
Yes, sir.

308
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,250
Han Tae Kyung.

309
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,830
I heard you're back on duty.

310
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,540
What brings you here at this hour?

311
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,140
Did Chief go home? 
He's not answering the phone.

312
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,010
He left with the VIP.

313
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,980
With the VIP?

314
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,040
Where did he go?

315
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,880
Not sure...

316
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,730
I think it's personal business.

317
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,380
Ah...

318
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,920
Someone came by to visit you, 
so I took her to your desk.

319
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,130
Officer Yoon, I told you to 
stay home. Why are you here?

320
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,970
Did you find Agent Lee Cha Young?

321
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,390
I'll find her soon.

322
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,070
Nothing happened, right?

323
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,010
Well, actually...

324
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,980
What? Did something happen?

325
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,000
A guest came by earlier this afternoon.

326
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,540
Weren't you in the ambulance 
with me at the time?

327
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,370
Seojo Police Station, Officer Yoon Bo Won.

328
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,340
Am I right?

329
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,380
Yes.

330
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,450
Is your wound healing nicely?

331
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,510
Yes, I'm okay.

332
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,520
I came to ask you a favor.

333
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:43,730
Agent Han Tae Kyung knows 
how to protect others.

334
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,630
But he doesn't know how to protect himself.

335
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,200
He always runs looking ahead.

336
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,910
But he may miss...

337
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,070
...something important.

338
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,300
So, I worry.

339
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:04,480
You should stay by his side and protect him.

340
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,250
Will you do that?

341
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,520
And...

342
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,330
can you deliver this to Agent Han Tae Kyung?

343
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,830
Did you open it?

344
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,280
No.

345
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,420
How can I dare...

346
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,750
The USB drive.

347
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,210
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

348
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,440
Hello.

349
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,790
I'm President Lee Dong Hwi.

350
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,180
What?

351
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,350
Is something wrong?

352
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,720
We must stop him.

353
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,310
The President is...

354
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,960
...on his way to his death.

355
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,920
Five minutes to the destination.

356
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,720
There are many civilians.

357
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Walk naturally and protect your boundary.

358
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,170
The President...

359
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,310
...has arrived.

360
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,420
I'm almost there.

361
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,640
I can't miss out on a good show.

362
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,530
There are no elements of danger inside.

363
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:56,740
Please go ahead.

364
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:44,490
Hello.

365
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,460
Agent Lee Cha Young?

366
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:51,310
Ready?

367
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,130
Yes.

368
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,390
Prosecutor, this is Officer Yoon.

369
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,560
I found out where Agent Lee is.

370
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,990
I can't trust the police. 
That's why I'm calling you.

371
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,900
It starts at 8pm.

372
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,950
I must stop him.

373
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:23,930
The fire alarm will go off at 8pm.

374
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:28,030
Leave the theater before then.

375
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,230
Stay put.

376
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:36,910
Plan A.

377
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,160
20:00 Fire Alarm.

378
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:40,890
Fire!

379
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,420
Fire! Fire!

380
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,710
The VIP disappeared.

381
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,140
Check all the exits!

382
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,190
Yes!

383
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,870
20:01.

384
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,700
Citimax Theater #7.

385
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,860
Shut the emergency exits and fire doors.

386
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:59,800
Mr. President!

387
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,520
Mr. President!

388
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,530
Secret Service agents are...

389
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,090
...live shields.

390
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,730
You instinctively huddle 
up when you hear a gunshot.

391
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,570
But agents work counter 
intuitively. They instead...

392
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,310
throw themselves to their death. They're 
trained that way 365 days a year.

393
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:27,450
So if you don't want to see 
those agents die like dogs

394
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,180
in your place,

395
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,670
you must...

396
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,350
...show up alone.

397
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,780
Mr. President!

398
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:42,090
Block the fire wall!

399
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,360
Fire wall!

400
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,560
Fire wall!

401
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:45,710
Mr. President!

402
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,170
We located the VIP.

403
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,340
He's walking toward the N3 exit.

404
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,390
We found the VIP.

405
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:04,780
Step aside.

406
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,550
No one is allowed beyond this point.

407
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,220
Let go!

408
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,180
Let go!

409
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,170
You guys, over there.

410
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:21,920
Yes.

411
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,400
Agent!

412
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,680
Are you okay?

413
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,080
The Blue House.

414
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,410
I heard Chairman Kim Do Jin...

415
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,450
speaking to someone...

416
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,050
...inside the Blue House.

417
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:01,000
Agent Han Tae Kyung is...

418
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,410
...looking for Agent Lee Cha Young?

419
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,680
You don't need to worry about that.

420
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:10,000
He'll never find her.

421
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:11,310
More importantly...

422
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:13,750
...watch Lee Dong Hwi closely.

423
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,720
The important person is...

424
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,800
Lee Dong Hwi.

425
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:32,020
Are you saying Chairman Kim still 
has a mole inside the Blue House?

426
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,780
What are you doing here?

427
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,320
How about the VIP?

428
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,320
Where is he?

429
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,690
We lost him inside the theater.

430
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:57,090
An assassination attempt was 
planned for this building.

431
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:58,230
What?

432
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,230
20:05.

433
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,450
N3 exit atrium.

434
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,750
Eliminate the target.

435
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,600
He's at the N3 exit.

436
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,500
We must find the VIP first.

437
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:14,470
All agents!

438
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:16,140
Gather at the N3 exit!

439
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:16,980
VIP is in danger.

440
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,580
Go that way!

441
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,410
- Let's go! 
- Okay!

442
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:35,490
Follow me.

443
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,110
Everything is...

444
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,660
...going as planned.

445
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:50,380
Okay.

446
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:01,730
I failed as a President.

447
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,120
I will not...

448
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,280
let my mistakes...

449
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:10,040
hurt any more people.

450
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:18,190
I wish that the people of this nation will 
regain hope through someone other than myself.

451
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:21,030
I hope you can build your future again.

452
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,520
I wish to let go of this heavy burden...

453
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,070
...as the President.

454
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:28,500
So...

455
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,210
as of now, I would like to...

456
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,910
resign my position...

457
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,140
...as the President.

458
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:36,800
Please respect...

459
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,210
...my decision.

460
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,680
What I started...

461
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,020
I will end it.

462
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,070
I will...

463
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,340
...take the blame with me.

464
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,040
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

465
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,530
Please understand my decision.

466
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,360
I started this.

467
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,560
It's only right that I end it.

468
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,420
No!

469
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,950
I'll protect you 'til the end.

470
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,360
Today...

471
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,520
the President...

472
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,550
...will die.

473
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,800
March 13, 20:04.

474
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,550
Phone call list.

475
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,850
We checked the list of 
calls from Chairman Kim.

476
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,940
We found he made calls to a 
phone inside the Blue House.

477
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:26,820
To where?

478
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,350
The Secret Service Office number.

479
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:29,720
What do you want to say?

480
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,290
If Chairman Kim's mole is 
inside the Secret Service...

481
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,120
Please cancel your plans for today.

482
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,090
I can't cancel.

483
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,020
I will go by myself if I have to.

484
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:41,770
Isn't Chairman Kim's mole 
still inside the Blue House?

485
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,530
How about you?

486
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,100
Are you prepared?

487
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,300
I'm asking you if you're...

488
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:47,870
...prepared to die.
