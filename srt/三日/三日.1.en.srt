<i>[16 years later, March 2nd, 2014]</i>

4
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,550
Just like 16 years ago, you always
ask for something difficult.

5
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,470
We're old friends.

6
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,040
<i>Blue House Staff.</i>

7
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,050
This is Han Ki Joon.
I must speak to the President.

8
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,340
Can I ask for a favor too?

9
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,740
<i>The President is unavailable.</i>

10
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,170
It's an emergency.
This is important!

11
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,140
<i>Mr. Minister of Finance?</i>

12
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,540
Do not do anything.

13
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,380
Stop everything you are about to do.

14
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,970
Also...

15
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,540
Let's stop seeing each other like this.

16
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,430
If you have something to tell me,
make an official visit.

17
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,980
To the Blue House.

18
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,580
Is there something else sir?

19
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,270
No.

20
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,260
Let's head back.

23
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,700
I'm looking for a patient.

24
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,680
I heard he was transferred here
from Cheongju this morning.

25
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,640
This way please.

26
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,270
<i>These are the recovered articles
from the accident site.</i>

27
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,010
Do they belong to your father?

28
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,340
The paramedic says that he was found
in Highway 17 near Cheongju.

29
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,840
They believe that he fell
asleep while driving.

30
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,180
Father...

31
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,910
Are you okay?

32
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,690
Are you?

President Lee in '98 is in the spotlight.

38
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:09,130
<i>The Lee administration will face a serious
ethics problem if the firm is found guilty.</i>

39
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,590
<i>Meanwhile, the President hopes
to get his support back</i>

40
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,410
<i>from the lower class by
visiting a traditional market.</i>

41
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,470
<i>But his efforts appear to be in vain.</i>

42
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,340
The VIP will be walking on foot

The staff of the local borough
inspected it for seven days.

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,910
Our agents are continuing to observe it.

47
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,660
The VIP?

48
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,470
<i>[Director of Secret Service Kim Sang Hee]</i>
He will leave the Blue House in five minutes.

49
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,260
Move it, Agent!

50
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,440
Han Tae Kyung!
You better shape up, soldier.

51
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,260
- Why are you late?
- I'm sorry sir.

52
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,790
To your post, damn it.

53
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,260
<i>VIP is coming out.</i>

54
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,940

30 minutes before arrival.

56
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,760
Control the drop-off zone.

57
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,660
You can't park here.

58
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,040
Please don't unload here.

59
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,300
You have to peel it like this.

60
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,850
<i>What's going on?</i>

61
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,370

No sir, he did not call.

65
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,480
What are you doing?

66
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,820
Is something going on?

67
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,380
No sir. Nothing sir.

<i>He just crossed the bridge.
One minute until arrival.</i>

69
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,860
9882, VIP-1250.
One minute until arrival.

70
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,450
The traditional market is the easiest place
for anyone to attack the President.

71
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,650
<i>It's full of unidentified subjects.</i>

72
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,690
<i>We cannot perform screenings
to find explosives or weapons.</i>

73

<i>Arrived.</i>

79
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,840
The President of the Republic of Korea!

80
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,680
Make way! Make way!

81
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,780
<i>Excuse me!</i>

82
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,080
Have a fish cake sir!

83
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,450
It's good.

84
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,200
You're doing so much hard
work in this cold weather.

85
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,850
Thank you!

86
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:58,350
<i>Lee Dong Hee!</i>

87
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,190
<i>It's 100% organic rice.</i>

<i>Try this.</i>

89
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,170
<i>This is 9882. VIP is 10 meters
away from the destination.</i>

90
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,630
Control traffic on-foot.

91
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,050
11 o'clock! Get him!

92
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,670
The VIP?

93
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,200
Entourage! Report!

94
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,680
Report. Entourage! Report!

95
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,230
Entourage! Say something!

96
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,110
<i>Get the vehicle ready at the exit route.
The VIP is evacuating.</i>

97
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,650
Is VIP safe?

98
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,390
Entourage! Report!

99
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,350
Vehicle at the exit route!

100
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,150
Oh my God, what's going on?

101
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,890
Get him on his feet.

102
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,440
Hey, clean this up right here.

103
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,550
Hey!

104
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,750
Are you mad?

105
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,550
This concerns you right now?

106
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,470
What are you doing?

107
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,200
<i>[Your father just passed away.]</i>

108
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,380
If that had been a bomb
instead of flour...

109
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,570
then we would have lost the VIP.

110
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,890
Do you know what that means?

111
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,640
No matter what!

112
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,180
You should never miss your mark.

113
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,300
<i>[Chief of Staff Shin Gyu Jin]</i>
Is it he?

114
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,790
Yes, it was all my fault.

115
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,990
I'm prepared for any disciplinary action.

116
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,890
The news is covered with pictures of the
President running covered in flour.

117
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,790
I don't even want
to talk about the internet.

118
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:04,860
Will disciplining you make
those pictures go away?

119
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,210
You think it will be as if it
never happened?

120
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,850
That's enough sir.

121
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,700
Are you standing up for your team
right now?

122
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,580
The Secret Service was
against today's event.

123
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,380
Traditional market is dangerous.

124
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,650
You think the Staff didn't know?

125
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:32,390
Isn't it your job to make it safe?

126
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,730
And I'm in charge of the Secret Service.

127
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,110
You can direct your complaints to me.

128
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,670
Then will you resign in place of this agent?

129
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,470
Agent Han is the son of
the Minister of Finance Han.

130
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,390
We were informed just 30 minutes ago.

131
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,990
This morning, he was in a coma
from a traffic accident.

132
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:14,950
He had just passed away
during the visit at the marketplace.

133
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,900
It's my fault sir.

134
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:27,190
Like you said, no matter what...
Even if my father had passed away...

135
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,410
I should have not missed my mark.

136
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,140
The Secret Service will discipline him.

137
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,190
So please stop.

138
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,030
Give me your ID and your badge.

139
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,370
You're on probation.

140
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,840
Dismissed.
They will need you at the funeral.

141
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,060
I will go after making my report.

142
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,880
- I don't need it. You can go!
- No sir.

143
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,530
It's my fault.
I'm accountable.

144
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,450
Get in.

145
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,860
I'm sorry sir.

146
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,800
It's all my fault.

147
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,030
So this is what the Presidency is.

148
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,810
I get an apology from a son
who couldn't be at his father's death.

149
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,600
You did nothing wrong, Agent Han.

150
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:17,210
There is someone who did wrong.

151
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,700
We're here sir.

152
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,030
This is as far as I can take you.

153
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,190
It's okay. Thank you.

154
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,990
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

155
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:04,150
Did you get the lost
articles of your father's?

156
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,100
Yes sir.

157
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:16,000
If you may, could you
tell me what they were?

158
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,420
His cell phone, wallet, and car keys.

159
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,680
May I be dismissed?

160
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,670
Yes you may.

161
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:34,730
You have my condolences.

162
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,180
Are you Han Ki Joon's family member?

163
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,510
Can I help you?

164
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,310
I'm Yoon Bo Won from Seojo PD.

165
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,960
The accident site was on Highway 17
between Cheongju and Seojori.

166
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,640
Do you know the reason why he went there?

167
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,970
No.

168
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,570
Any friends or relatives in the area?

169
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,660
No one.

170
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,500
Had he been acting strangely lately?

171
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,210
Like anxious or worried?

172
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,250
I was outside Korea because
of work right before the accident.

173
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,900
I couldn't see my father for a month.

174
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,120
I also want to know why he
was found there. Happy?

175
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,340
Back in the traffic accident
team in my area...

176
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:28,890
they already concluded this case as a simple
traffic accident from falling asleep while driving.

177
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,320
Are you saying that it's not?

178
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,090
Was there a white document
envelope in his retrieved articles?

179
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,820
What are you talking about?

180
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,450
It was about this big.

181
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,560
No such thing.

182
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,220
It was his cell phone, wallet,
and car keys.

183
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,940
Why are you doing this?

184
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,950
I'm sorry to trouble you during your
funeral. Thank you for your cooperation.

Why did you come here?

If you ever find out who your
father went to see in Cheongju...

188
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,740

Yes, I'd like to check
starting 8:25 PM.

201
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,050

00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,180
Hey! Hey!

10 seconds before the VIP arrival.

00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,270
Are we going as we planned?

224
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,800
We are preparing as you requested.

225
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,600
But this could be dangerous.

226
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,690
This is very important to me.

Please move at my discretion.

228
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,040

he was on the verge of death.

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,970
Yes.

230
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,220
I saw a man leave right before I came here.

231
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,820
I didn't see his face.

232
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,510
But he was in his late twenties.

233
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,930
His height was about six-foot-one.

234
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,230
I saw a CCTV at the alley.

235
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,340
You can check it.

236
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,500
How do you know the victim?

237
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,550
He knew my late father.

238
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,950
How long do I have to stay here?

239
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,800

Okay! Okay!

00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,240
You're going to have to pay
quadruple, and you too!

246
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,410

<i>A car accident.</i>

00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,650
Officer Yoon Bo Won!
I got this.

250
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,580
Highway 17 between Seojori and Cheongju.
A traffic accident.

251
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,090
Requesting ambulance.

252
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,560
Are you all right? An
ambulance will be here.

253
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:51,480
Envelope.
Envelope.

254
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,550
Calm down. Talking may be harmful.

255
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,160
The ambulance is here.
You need to wake up.

256
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,140
They are going to take the envelope.

257
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,460
It's important.

258
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,180
A simple accident?

259
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,720
My team concluded that
it was a simple accident.

260
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,470
An envelope seems to be missing
from the retrieved articles package.

261
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,330
An envelope?

262
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,010
I didn't see it.

263
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,820
What about the vehicle?

264
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,850
Because of the damage, they
are going to wreck it.

265
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,020
Will you stop? I'm busy.

266
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,130
Officer Yoon!

267
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,570
Are you still after this case?
How about tonight?

268
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,030
Are we playing?

269
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:11,430
Oh come on. I'm a cop.

270
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,200
Stop tempting me while
I'm solving my case.

271
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,630
You know Mrs. Seo that
lives down there says...

272
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:25,100
that she saw a car passing by at that time
when she came out to check her greenhouse.

273
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,150
Really? What did it look like?

274
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,790
A large white car passed by.

275
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:37,170
It had a big circle in the back.

276
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,960
A circle?

277
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,390
Can you be out already?

278
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,660
- What about your father's funeral?
- It went well.

279
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,680
Is something wrong?

280
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:06,120
It's...
Where's the Chief of Secret Service?

281
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:10,340
He went to Cheongsuho with the VIP. Why?

282
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,810
I heard something strange.

283
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,690
I did too.

284
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,170
What did you hear?

285
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,060
The man caught confessed.

286
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,960
He was hired by someone.

287
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,650
If you do me a favor, I will give you this.

288
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,460
On my mark, you throw it at him.
Do you understand?

289
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,130
Why would anyone hire him for that?

290
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,620
If he didn't like the President,
he could have done it himself.

291
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,510
Are you sure that he isn't
lying to avoid charges?

292
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,550
No, we found the person who hired him.

293
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,560
- What?
- He needed to get close to the President.

294
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,230
Like a camouflage.

295
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,180
He did it to get to the President?

296
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,150
He's crazy.

297
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,760
I don't know if he's crazy.

298
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,480
But it's true. They got it on the news.

299
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:50,150
<i>President Lee was hit by a pack of flour
while he was visiting a traditional market.</i>

300
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,860
<i>Reporter Joo, reporting.</i>

301
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,640
It's him. The man caught pointed him out.

302
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,000
It's impossible to identify him
with just his face alone.

303
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,410
We will need to look into
why he did this.

304
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,450
Do you remember seeing him there?

305
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,770
What's wrong?

306
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,530
This man.

307
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,990
- I know who he is.
- What?

308
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,200
His name is Yang Dae Ho.
Colonel of the Army.

309
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,200
Throw it on my mark.
Do you understand?

310
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,060
This morning.

311
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,040
He said that the President is
going to die on March Fifth...

312
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,510
Then he was killed.

313
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,400
Go! We don't have time.
Get ready!

314
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:24,030
<i>Check the security marking before
letting the vehicle pass.</i>

315
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,950
<i>If someone is in the car, then
it's a VIP's personal guest.</i>

316
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:10,120
- It's this.
- Are you sure this is what he gave to the President?

317
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,360
The Entourage Captain saw this
note being passed to the President.

318
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,780
He checked it himself after that.

319
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,590
We checked for any toxic substance.

320
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,290
But the test came clean.

321
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,610
Yang Dae Ho is a colonel.
<i>[I own a small supermarket. Help us.]</i>

322
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,300
He never owned a grocery shop.

323
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:34,050
But nothing suspicious
was found on this note.

324
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:37,750
Because they thought it was
from a civilian.

325
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,710
There is something here.

326
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,960
Was this written too?

327
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,680
Yeah.

328
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,750
What are you doing?

329
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,350
They are the pass codes we used
during the market operation.

330
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,770
Only the Secret Service would know that.

331
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,500
Yang Dae Ho worked as a colonel
at the confidentiality division.

332
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,030
What if he had known?

333
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,240
What's the first number?

334
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,110
1250.

335
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,250
<i>[Event place.]</i>

336
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,830
And then it's 2005.

337
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:56,150
<i>[Planned]</i>

338
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:01,440
The last one is 1007.

339
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:08,240
<i>[Assassination]</i>

340
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:23,650
Colonel Yang tried to alert
him of an assassination?

341
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,260
That's impossible.

342
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,560
Who?

343
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,820
Why would he want to kill the President?

344
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:44,720
You go report the situation.

345
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,990
And look into Yang Dae Ho's case.

346
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,940
The person who killed Yang could have done
it to cover up the assassination attempt.

347
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,250
If we catch him, we can find out
who and why he did this.

348
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:01,940
What about you?

349
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,150
I should go to Cheongsuho.

350
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,170
The Secret Service will not make
a move even if I reported it.

351
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:10,520
Do you really think this is true?

352
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,050
I wish that it weren't too.

353
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,990
But what if it's true?

354
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,800
Yang Dae Ho told me.

355
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,990
That the President is going to die.

356
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,920
I don't have much time. I need to go
there myself and tell him.

357
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,760
And we have to get ready for the worst.

358
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,870
<i>Eagle Six, the guest is going back home.</i>

359
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:38,950
<i>Let it pass without checking.</i>

360
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:55,840
<i>Eagle Six, the VIP is moving
to the fishing area.</i>

361
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,740
The embankment road is too
dangerous due to fog. Closing.

362
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,200
<i>Highway 22. We have a report of
broken repeater. Go check.</i>

363
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,360
Copy that.

364
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,150
Good evening Officer.

365
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,080
I need to inspect this vehicle.

366
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,160
Did you have drinks tonight?

367
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,080
- You drive rather roughly.
- I'm sorry, Officer.

368
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,110
I'm not familiar with the road here.

369
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:25,740
- What are you doing here?
- I got a call that the repeater is broken.

370
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:31,030
But you're not the guy
who came last time.

371
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,760
<i>Officer 36, go check Highway 30.</i>

372
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,080
This road is dangerous due to fog tonight.

373
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,450
I will go check quickly and leave.
You don't need to worry.

374
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:11,210
The scheduled time is 20:00 hours.
Don't be late. Not even by a split second.

375
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:14,180
- Got it?
- Yes sir.

376
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,940
<i>She said that there was
a circle in the back.</i>

377
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,430
What is that?

378
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,500
I'm Agent Han Tae Kyung
from the Blue House.

379
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,230
I need to see the Chief of Secret Service.

380
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,870
Identification and pass mark.

381
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,510
Please call him. He can verify my ID.

382
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,790
You cannot enter without
your identification.

383
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,010
- It's an emergency.
- Call him!

384
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,790
<i>It's not a bomb?</i>

385
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:52,470
<i>[March Fifth, 20:00]</i>

386
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:11,410
Hello? Hey!

387
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,080
Can you hear me?

388
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:18,550
- What the heck?
- What just happened?

389
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,720
<i>We have a blackout!</i>

390
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,720
<i>Eagle Six!</i>

391
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:49,990
No.

392
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:54,950
<i>We have a blackout!</i>

393
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,550
<i>We have a blackout!</i>

394
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,690
Call the fishing area! Now!

395
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,830
No.

397
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,710
<i>- What now?
- This happened in Cheongsuho.</i>

398
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:41,190
- What were you doing?
- Everyone at the fishing area is KIA.

399
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,420
Fire the flare!

400
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,890
- Where is the President?
- Han Tae Kyung must have smuggled the insider information.

401
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:50,470
- Someone must have sniped the President.
- How do you know this?

402
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:53,500
<i>There is no proof that your father's
death had to do with this.</i>

403
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,200
It's even more clear to me.

404
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,180
This is impossible without
help from the inside.

405
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,510
Are you suspecting us?

406
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:03,760
The prime suspect of Colonel Yang
is Agent Han Tae Kyung.
