Episode 2

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,170
One of the culprits who attempted to

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,900
assassinate the President was found.

5
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,740
It is none other than

6
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,480
Security Service Agent, Han Tae Kyeong.

7
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,630
<i>March 5th 08:00PM, 90 minutes earlier</i>

8
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>There's a blackout!</i>

9
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,690
Blackout! Blackout! Situation room, report.

10
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,990
<i>Sector 13, there's a blackout.</i>

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,820
<i>Blackout, blackout!</i>

12
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,560
<i>At master, there is a blackout.</i>

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,820
<i>Sector 3, blackout.</i>

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,770
Call the fishing area! Hurry!

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,980
The radio is down.

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,200
The phone line is also down.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,560
The system is down!

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,440
Nothing is working.

19
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,140
What is happening?

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,830
The power seems to be out in the entire building.

21
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,810
The radio does not work either.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,460
Get situation from the fishing area! Hurry!!

23
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,030
Morse code is being sent from the fishing area.

25
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,900
At point 207,

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,320
the current situation.

27
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,630
Move!

28
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,270
The Department Head is dead.

29
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,250
The whole fishing team...

30
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,880
is dead.

31
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,630
What about the VIP?

32
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,130
What about the President?!

33
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,380
There's no sight of him.

34
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,660
There were three gunshots.

35
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,010
But there are two dead bodies.

36
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,610
Looking from the situation,

37
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,160
there is a possibility that he was shot and fell into the sea.

38
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,000
Set up the flares.

39
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,090
There is still a possibility of him being alive.

40
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,720
We have to quickly find the President!

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,380
Yes, I understand.

42
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,740
-Team 2, come this way.
-Yes.

43
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,690
Team 2, go!

44
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,930
<i>Cheongwadae [Blue House] Situation Room</i>

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,500
This is the current satellite image of Cheongsoodae.

46
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,700
There was a large scale blackout,

47
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,700
and at the same time,
at Cheongsoodae where the President is staying,

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,980
three flashes of light were sighted.

49
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,540
No matter how I think about it...

50
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,880
I think there was a shooting.

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,970
Call the Chief Secretary.

52
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,370
What is the matter?

53
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,530
I have something urgent to report.

54
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,180
What do you have to report so late?

55
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,460
Yes, this is Shin Kyu Jin (Chief Secretary).

56
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,980
Control all entrances into Cheongsoodae
and count the number of persons.

57
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,220
Call the Vice Chief to control the regular soldiers.

58
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,340
Confiscate all forms of communications from everyone.

59
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,340
Until the VIP's condition is confirmed,

60
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,810
information of any sort must not be leaked to outside sources.

61
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,050
Yes.

62
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,520
Where did the gunshot come from?

63
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,040
I'm not sure about the distance,
but it came from southwest, from the 7 o'clock direction.

64
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,060
In the 7 o'clock direction,
the only possible shooting points are 301, 302.

65
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,380
Send out teams to those points.

66
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,670
Cheongsoodae is not the only place.

67
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,380
Across the lake towards Seojori,

68
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,380
there is also a blackout.

69
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,600
<i>March 5, 20:20.
 Twenty minutes after the shooting</i>

70
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,820
Chief, there is something I must report.

71
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,830
What is it?

72
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,130
I don't think this is a normal blackout.

73
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,640
What?

74
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,970
Electricity is not the only thing that has died.

75
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,330
Cars, radios, phones, laptops, computers inside Cheongsoodae,
<i>Communications Chief Lee Dong Seong</i>

76
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,200
and all other electronic chips were damaged.

77
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,890
The way I see it,

78
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,700
I think we've been hit with EMP.

79
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,410
<i>EMP: electromagnetic pulse, strong waves are emitted </i>

80
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,340
<i>high above ground to destroy or paralyze electronic devices</i>

81
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:59,170
The electronics that were inside lead containers in case of EMP are all safe and in working condition.

82
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,470
The Inspection Team is setting up lights inside the main and surrounding buildings.

83
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,050
In 30 minutes, all the preparations will be done.

84
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,610
Even though there are only small quantities,

85
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,780
we've distributed radios to those in the field.

86
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,160
We've also requested transportation from a nearby military base.

87
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,360
The autopsy result from the agents at the fishing area reveal that
<i>Chief of Administration Kim Yeong Hwan</i>

88
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,820
the Department Head, who was closest to the President,

89
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,940
was shot in the head and died immediately.

90
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,880
The Security Service Agent was shot above a left rib
 in the heart and immediately died.

91
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,760
This is the bullet from the body,

92
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,580
It has been confirmed as a 7.6 mm bullet.

93
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,220
We've searched points 301, 302 as you have ordered.

94
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,950
We've found a hiding spot for the shooter.
<i>Terror Prevention Chief Ahn Jong Ho</i>

95
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,650
We've found something here!

96
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,770
Inspecting the pit,

97
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,240
it looked like he was in hiding more than a week ago,
 before our team started inspection.

98
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,480
So, did you catch the shooter?

99
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,900
Due to the blackout and the absence of radio...

100
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,030
We're continuing to look for him,
 but the possibility is less than 10%.

101
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,630
How could

102
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,180
something like this happen inside Cheongsoodae?

103
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,330
Military units, what were you doing?

104
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,400
Advance Team, what have you been doing?

105
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,540
What did you do for a week?!

106
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,400
What's important right now is

107
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,960
who shot the President.

108
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,650
The EMP

109
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,940
which paralyzed all electronic devices in a matter of seconds,

110
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,130
is a newly developed type of bomb to sever communication systems.

111
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,330
It's a weapon that even terrorists
like Al-Qaeda have difficulty acquiring.

112
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,060
Who and how in the world did someone plant that bomb?

113
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,910
Currently, there are only a few countries who have the technology to build EMP bombs,

114
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,380
such as the United States and Russia.

115
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,400
Although our country is currently developing it, but

116
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,740
it is not perfect yet.

117
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,370
And also, I've found countries with a high interest in EMP bombs.

118
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,740
Recently, there was intelligence that <i>North Korea has purchased EMP bombs in top secrecy.</i>

119
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,830
The Intelligence and Security Department also noticed that

120
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,830
North Korea's actions have been strange lately.

121
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,350
So right now,

122
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,480
are you saying that North Korea killed the President of South Korea?

123
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,770
We must alert the ambassadors in China.

124
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,940
We must hold a conference for the sake of national security.

125
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,500
You can't go in!

126
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,810
Someone see who it is.

127
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,260
Yes.

128
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,910
He entered without warrant at the entrance.

129
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,730
He said he is the member of the Presidential Security Service, but he does not have an ID with him.

130
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,650
Han Tae Kyeong,

131
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,980
why did you come here?

132
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,290
What happened to the President?

133
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,370
Did someone...

134
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,190
really try to assassinate the President?

135
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,480
How did you know about it?

136
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,620
The General of the Army Yang Dae Ho

137
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,730
said that there will be an assassination on march fifth.

138
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,500
Who is that person and how did he know about it?

139
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,520
"The President will be assassinated on march fifth" were his last words before he died

140
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,270
and therefore, I have not found out as to why and who would do that.

141
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,000
He died?

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,190
Someone blocked his words and he died.

143
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,400
The culprit has definitely something to do with today's event.

144
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,960
The police are looking for the culprit.

145
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,600
If we can find who he is, we can figure out the culprit.

146
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,550
Where is the precinct? Mobilize Cheongwadae's (Blue House) Legal Department!

147
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,900
I am there already.

148
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,810
He has just arrived on the helicopter.

149
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,920
What brings you here?

150
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,500
Is the President safe?

151
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,310
The Cheongwadae Situation Room reported that
 they were suspicious of possible gunshots.

152
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,350
It is true that someone tried to assassinate the President,

153
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,270
but there has been no evidence found to prove his death.

154
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,100
The whole team is looking for the President.

155
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,520
It's not yet time to notify anyone on the outside.

156
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,190
First, we have to find the President,

157
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,190
then we have to investigate who and why they want to assassinate the President.

158
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,230
But...

159
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,100
what were you saying earlier?

160
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,310
Have you found out about the case that the
Security Service Agent Han Tae Kyeong was talking about?

161
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,000
After I heard the story from
Security Service Agent Han Tae Kyeong,

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,350
in order to investigate that case,

163
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,500
I had personally gone to that doctor.

164
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,560
<i>The medical examiner who looked at the body
said that the artery has been cut precisely.</i>

165
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,940
<i>There is a high probability that the murderer has been trained in high degree of martial arts as a special forces agent.</i>

166
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,700
<i>According to Agent Han Tae Kyeong who witnessed the incident,</i>

167
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,940
<i>the culprit should have been caught on the CCTV.</i>

168
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,980
<i>Did you check the CCTV?</i>

169
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,900
<i>Yes, we've looked through them.</i>

170
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,510
So, is the culprit's...

171
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,950
face confirmed in the CCTV?

172
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,500
The results from the CCTV,

173
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,400
on that day, during that time,

174
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,020
the only person who went into general Yang Dae Ho's house,

175
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,770
was agent Han Tae Kyung.

176
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,460
That is not possible.

177
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,100
I definitely saw the culprit.

178
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,020
Before I came in, the culprit went out of his house.

179
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,230
No,

180
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,170
I checked them with my own eyes.

181
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,020
That is not possible.

182
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,810
What about the USB?

183
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,150
Did you find it?

184
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,520
The USB that you talked about, it wasn't found in Yang Dae Ho's house.

185
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,690
The culprit took it, I'm sure.

186
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,230
Is it true that general Yang Dae Ho went to search your house?

187
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,700
Yes, I am sure.

188
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,850
After we heard this, we investigated your house.

189
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,080
But the security guard at your apartment,

190
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,250
said that you never came.

191
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,660
And...

192
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,980
even on the apartment's elevator, Yang Dae Ho was not shot.

193
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,200
That is not possible!

194
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,980
Who and how did they snipe the President?

195
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,190
We found a pit in the northwest region, in point 302.

196
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,560
The sniper was hiding there,

197
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,980
sniped the President,

198
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,020
and ran away.

199
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,440
The security system of the Presidential Security Service

200
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,060
is close to perfect.

201
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,480
But, there's someone who tricked the cameras,

202
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,060
and succeeded in sniping the President.

203
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,900
How is that possible?

204
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,520
The Presidential Security Service are the only ones who understand the system.

205
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,790
Right now, are you suspecting the Presidential Security Service?

206
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,020
No,

207
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:11,040
not the Presidential Security Service, but I'm suspecting agent Han Tae Kyung.

208
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,290
The most important suspect in Yang Dae Ho's case is...

209
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,420
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

210
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,230
Are you saying I sniped the President?

211
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
I didn't even come to Cheongsoodae.

212
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,060
You could have... handed over the security details to the snipers.

213
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,980
Lee Cha Yeong!

214
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,500
There was a formal request to hand over Service Agent, Han Tae Kyeong at the precinct.

215
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,550
But before that,

216
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,980
we need to investigate and find the truth.

217
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,290
Chief,

218
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,270
it's not me.

219
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,940
This time, too, will you protect him because
he's part of the Presidential Security Service?

220
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,230
Agent Lee Cha Yeong.

221
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,270
You can start investigating Agent Han Tae Kyeong at the Presidential Security Service's lodging.

222
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,350
Yes, I understand.

223
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,480
It is not me!

224
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,700
We are currently under an emergency situation.

225
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,270
You know that in an emergency situation,
 we are allowed to shoot.

226
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,300
Shoot it.

227
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,900
Do you think an agent of the Presidential Security Service is scared of guns?

228
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:34,150
Your thoughts don't matter to me right now.

229
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,400
What's important right now is the fact that the president is in danger.

230
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,980
So, therefore, everyone!

231
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,400
I hope that all of you follow my orders!

232
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,980
It goes the same to you too, Han Tae Kyeong.

233
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,850
<i>March 5, 8:30 pm. 30 minutes after the incident.</i>

234
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,220
Yeah, we're just packing up now.

235
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,680
Yeah.

236
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,680
Everything is proceeding as planned.

237
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,720
OK. Let's go!

238
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,310
What the...

239
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,480
<i> Yun Bo Won, Chief Service ID Card </i>

240
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,540
Turn this way!

241
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,970
This is a humiliation to The Presidential Secret Service.

242
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,680
The army, the police, and the Presidential Secret Service,

243
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,150
there are over 1000 people.

244
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,550
Han Tae Kyeong

245
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,660
I will investigate him myself.

246
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,470
Han Tae Kyeong

247
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,310
definitely leaked internal information.

248
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,970
It's not Han Tae Kyeong.

249
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,520
Han Tae Kyeong

250
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,340
wouldn't do such things.

251
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,730
EMP is sure something.

252
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,350
Neither clocks nor cellphones are working.

253
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,360
The evidence that you've said weren't even found.

254
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,590
Therefore I can't side with you.

255
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,680
If I were the culprit, I wouldn't even use an EMP.

256
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,780
I would have shot the President.

257
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,000
Then neither General Yang Dae Ho

258
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,460
or my father would have been killed.

259
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,990
There is no evidence that your father's death is related to this case.

260
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,600
I'm becoming more and more sure of it.

261
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,700
My father

262
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,310
passed away because of this case.

263
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,830
Even if a soldier who had special training
was hiding under the pit,

264
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,050
there's no way that all these
 Special Team couldn't locate them.

265
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,770
Unless someone in the inside,

266
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,500
let the shooters know the movements of the Special Team.

267
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,500
Why did they blow up the EMP?

268
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,050
If they dug the pit and planned the shooting,

269
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:59,090
they wouldn't have to include EMP bomb,
which is hard to obtain.

270
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,100
If our communication is paralyzed,

271
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,870
it'll be easier for the shooter.

272
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,190
The EMP blew up before the sound of the gunshot.

273
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,910
It's unfavorable even to him to shoot in the darkness.

274
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,380
But why did he necessarily

275
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,510
blow up the EMP before shooting?

276
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,210
Why did he want to cover our ears and eyes at that moment?

277
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,430
The pit is located in the northwest was point 302, right?

278
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,590
Point 302 is here,

279
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,020
and the fishing place is there.

280
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,590
What are you doing right now?

281
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,860
Please stop and just go to the interrogation room.

282
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,190
He can come through here too.

283
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,350
What are you saying?

284
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,890
You said even if it's a soldier who received special training,

285
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,720
It'd be hard to avoid the
Presidential Security Services for a week?

286
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,350
Don't tell me...

287
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,270
The pit was a disguise?

288
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,000
Let's go now!

289
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,930
Wait a minute. Please don't fire!

290
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,120
Han Tae Kyeong!

291
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,300
If this gate was opened when the shooting happened,

292
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,100
from somewhere else in the inside of the Cheongsoodae

293
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,140
the shooting towards the fishing place becomes possible.

294
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,250
Security service headquarters on the second floor.

295
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,920
- Let go of me!
 - Stay quiet!

296
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,200
Right now, you're an accomplice in the case of the President's shooting.

297
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,930
You can't interfere with this case anymore.

298
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,630
Call the chief. I have to go meet him.

299
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,890
Please escort him to the interrogation room.

300
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,560
Someone opened that gate!

301
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,180
What do you want to say?

302
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,760
Just like the Chief Secretary said,

303
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,460
there must be a betrayer in the inside.

304
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,790
Yeah, it's me. Has the body turned up yet?

305
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,830
One problem has arisen? No.

306
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:29,170
Nothing to worry about. We'll take care of it.

307
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,140
Are you OK?

308
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,770
Did you get hurt a lot somewhere?

309
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,650
Sergeant Constable Yoon!

310
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,380
Where have you been? The village is in an uproar!

311
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,130
Electricity won't go on and cellphones aren't working.

312
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,350
Even on the roads over there

313
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,210
buses and cars had a huge accident.

314
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,880
Since you were here,

315
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,900
we called to report about it.

316
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,250
Did something happen?

317
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,330
No, it is okay.

318
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,690
I think I heard gun sounds from Cheongsoodae,

319
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,770
Gun sounds?

320
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:17,490
We are really anxious because of it. Is there going to be a war coming up?

321
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,030
Please just go inside for now, I will investigate it first.

322
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,740
It is okay, you could go inside.

323
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,680
Please go back safely.

324
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,190
Aigoo.

325
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,770
What should we do?

326
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,280
Agent Han Tae Kyung

327
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,650
said that he has something that he really needs to say.

328
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,960
I want to talk to the chief privately.

329
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,740
It is an important matter.

330
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,010
Wrap it up in 5 minutes.

331
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,820
The things that I am going to say from now on,

332
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,470
is coming from someone who is insane,

333
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,510
so please consider it as nonsense and listen to me.

334
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:23,490
March fifth, 6:40 pm. 15 minutes before the shooting.

335
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,850
The culprits who want to assassinate the President,

336
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:34,460
set up the EMP bombs to cover our eyes.

337
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,560
Keep moving.

338
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:44,600
In 15 minutes all electronic chips inside area would be fried.

339
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,410
March fifth, 20:00

340
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,990
We already knew that the culprits were using EMP bombs.

341
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,070
If you're going to say something useless like that, then,

342
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,210
I am going to go first.

343
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,010
The gun was at 7 o' clock position from the northwest.

344
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,000
The position point to shoot from there to the fishing spot

345
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,480
is the position 302

346
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,420
and 310.

347
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,480
But then,

348
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,630
other than these two locations

349
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,680
It could be that they are shooting from somewhere else.

350
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,790
There is no such point that exists other than these two shoots towards the fishing place.

351
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,250
What if someone

352
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,180
made that point?

353
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,060
What's happening?

354
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,090
Hurry!

355
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,330
The culprits didn't blow up the EMP for their escape.

356
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,170
But to cover up the true shooter.

357
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,380
So you're saying that

358
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,680
the shooting took place from within the Security Service headquarters?

359
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,000
At that time in the headquarters,

360
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,120
there was more than 30 security officers on their guards.

361
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,850
Deceiving all the eyes of these people,

362
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,730
do you think the shooting can still be possible?

363
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,390
The security service headquarters have no restriction on their moves.

364
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,740
While they are resting,

365
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,630
it is a time when vigilance fades away the most.

366
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,560
Besides, the EMP happened.

367
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,140
In an emergency case,

368
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,900
security service officers are the first ones to run to the VIP.

369
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,900
There aren't any Special Agents who would take interest
in the Presidential Security Service's lodging area.

370
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,400
Of course, not only these reasons,

371
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,300
there was this most important reason whose security officers didn't catch at all.

372
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,940
That's because right here,

373
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:24,180
the shooting happened in Chief's headquarters.

374
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,560
I don't think you have done such a thing.

375
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,100
At 20:00, when the shooting happened,

376
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,380
who was here?

377
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,880
That's only your assumption.

378
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,410
The shooting took place in position 302.

379
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,380
If an EMP bomb explodes,

380
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,020
all the electronic devices get paralyzed.

381
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,200
Cars, walkie-talkies,

382
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,100
notebooks, cellphones, fluorescent lights and also

383
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,630
clocks.

384
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,720
To be protected against this type of EMP bomb,

385
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,280
I have heard there was a watch developed in Russia.

386
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,380
In ordinary times,

387
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,860
it seems like you had a lot of interest in EMP bombs.

388
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,290
Or...

389
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:57,920
you knew beforehand that there would be an EMP attack.

390
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,710
Was it really...

391
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,080
you?

392
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,920
The President

393
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,810
is not someone who deserves to be protected by us.

394
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,050
This person has done things he should have never done.

395
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,160
So?

396
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,200
So you killed the performance executive officer

397
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,510
and an officer from the performance team?

398
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,660
It was to prevent a greater sacrifice.

399
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,600
What kind of sacrifice?

400
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,930
Why on earth...?

401
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,290
I'm sorry.

402
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,550
Because of you...

403
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,460
no one else will get hurt again.

404
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,190
What about my father?

405
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,170
Did you also

406
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,050
dispose of my father?

407
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,770
Confidential Document 98!

408
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,640
Was it because of this you killed my father?!

409
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,860
Who is it?!

410
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,630
Who shot right now?!

411
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,610
Take your positions!

412
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,760
Chief!

413
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,020
He ran away.

414
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,130
This way.

415
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,840
What happened here?

416
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,760
What's happening with the President?

417
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,230
We are continuing the search.

418
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,180
But, what on earth... who?

419
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,380
One of the culprits who attempted to

420
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,180
assassinate the President was found.

421
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,080
It is none other than...

422
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,130
Security Service Agent, Han Tae Kyeong.

423
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,710
<i>Did you also...</i>

424
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,090
<i> dispose of my father?</i>

425
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,530
<i>Confidential Document 98!</i>

426
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,430
<i>Was it because of that, that you killed my father?!</i>

427
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,530
<i>The things your father left behind.</i>

428
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,350
<i>Did you receive them?</i>

429
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,360
Among your father's belongings, was there a white envelope?

430
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,660
<i>Confidential Document 98</i>

431
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,140
<i>Yoon Bo Won</i>

432
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,380
Hey, you bastard! Get out!

433
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:01,080
Now!

434
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,840
Han Tae Kyeong!

435
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,190
<i>March 5, 21:30
 30 minutes after the shooting</i>

436
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,270
What is this?

437
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,120
Why doesn't this work?

438
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,560
<i> This is the emergency situation room of Cheongju. </i>

439
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,710
I am officer Yoon Bo Won, I have an emergency to...

440
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,460
Hello? Hello?

441
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,670
What is this?

442
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:07,240
<i>Telcom JAESIN</i>

443
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,680
Stay still.

444
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,330
Agent!

445
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,550
Can you run?

446
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:40,060
Who on earth are those people?

447
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,510
I thought they were chasing me at first,

448
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,560
but I think they're trying to kill you.

449
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,240
Cellphone! Don't you have a cellphone?

450
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,410
I need to report those people.

451
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,490
What about a gun?

452
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,240
You are a Security Service Agent after all. Don't you have a gun?

453
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,590
I don't have a gun.

454
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,130
What kind of security agent doesn't have a gun?

455
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:59,660
If I had a gun, would I be running away like this?

456
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,270
Who on earth are those people?

457
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,840
Those people are

458
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,070
the suspects for your father's murder.

459
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:15,030
What are you talking about?

460
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,630
You say that those people killed my father?

461
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,070
So, they got away?

462
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,500
Yes.

463
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,930
However, we called the police and
 put an emergency warrant nationwide.

464
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,920
I got it, you can go.

465
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,550
I have one thing,

466
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,880
to ask.

467
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,080
Speak.

468
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,110
Did

469
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,990
Security Agent Han Tae Kyeong

470
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,710
really shoot you?

471
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,820
What do you mean?

472
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,120
Security Agent Han Tae Kyeong

473
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:13,580
was suspecting that the shots were
fired inside Cheongsudo.

474
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:21,700
He lied so he can be alone with me to kill me.

475
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,750
The tennis court gate was

476
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,850
opened once.

477
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,170
If

478
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,290
at the time of the shooting, the court gate was really opened,

479
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,530
even from within the Security Service Headquarters

480
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,370
the shooting was still possible.

481
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,920
I checked the tennis court earlier in the afternoon,

482
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,650
It must have been opened then.

483
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,980
2001, we have spotted the V.I.P.

484
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,290
I repeat, 2001, we have spotted the V.I.P.

485
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,090
Put it on screen.

486
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,300
We found him!
We found him!

487
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,670
It was there.

488
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,270
It was at around 02:00 A.M.

489
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:13,120
I dispatched after I received a report saying there were dangerous driving.

490
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:21,180
I am sure there was another car at that time.

491
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,450
The sound was there, and the skid marks were left.

492
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,800
I wasn't a witness,

493
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,530
Did the ambulance

494
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,260
come right away?

495
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,470
Yes.

496
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,810
He wasn't in too much pain?

497
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:13,760
♫ <i>Is your heart aching too? </i> ♫

498
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:21,580
♫ <i>The precious love in my ardent heart </i> ♫

499
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:29,300
♫ <i>Because my heart is aching after crying again </i> ♫

500
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:35,050
♫ <i>like a flower shrinking in a cold wind.</i> ♫

501
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:43,280

502
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:49,570
♫ <i>I'm moving tentatively upstream against the memories. </i> ♫

503
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,530
One, two, three.

504
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:50,130
One, two.

505
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,590
Did the President...

506
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,160
die?

507
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,110
I think it's best that you check yourself.

508
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,790
What you just said,

509
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,410
are you sure that's correct?

510
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:20,940
That those were the people who killed my father.

511
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,170
I'm correct.

512
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,540
Your father said that they'll be after the file envelope.

513
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,470
What do you mean?

514
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,070
<i>The... the document.</i>

515
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:36,950
<i>The file en... envelope.</i>

516
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:41,560
<i>The file envelope... they'll be after it.</i>

517
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,490
<i>It... it's important.</i>

518
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,520
Are you sure?

519
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,110
That document...

520
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,940
On the envelope of the document,

521
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,270
was there written Classified Document 98?

522
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:57,800
Yes.

523
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,650
But the envelope disappeared.

524
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,500
Are you sure

525
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,290
it was the Classified Document 98?

526
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,830
It is not the President.

527
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,820
Who is this person?

528
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,980
How...

529
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,740
did this...

530
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,480
Then what about the President?

531
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,370
Where on earth is he now?

532
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:25,190
<i>March 5.</i>

533
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:30,760
<i>On that day, will everything finally end?</i>

534
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:37,890
<i>During your 3 nights and 4 days trip to Cheongsoodae,</i>

535
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:41,280
<i>if we miss that period, we'll be in danger.</i>

536
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,870
<i>That's our last chance.</i>

537
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,130
<i>It won't be as easy as you think.</i>

538
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,870
<i>President, you might find yourself in danger.</i>

539
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:01,840
<i>But this is the final opportunity.</i>

540
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,910
<i>You must be careful.</i>

541
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,950
<i>The Presidential Security Service nor the Secretary Office,
do not trust anyone.</i>

542
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,190
<i>You cannot trust anyone but us.</i>

543
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:54,990
<i>Preview</i>

544
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,630
<i>What's important now is to find the President as soon as possible.</i>

545
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:01,110
<i>Before we find out who and why someone tried to kill the President,</i>

546
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,820
<i>you cannot let anyone outside know.</i>

547
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,940
<i>The President has left Cheongsoodae on the 8911 vehicle.</i>

548
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,710
<i>If, by any chance, something happens,</i>

549
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,050
<i>I'll take all responsibility.</i>

550
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:13,690
<i>License plate, 07 Na 8911, please put it as the most wanted.</i>

551
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:17,520
<i>Finding out who killed my father and why
is the most important for me right now.</i>

552
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,480
<i>You're saying that there is a possibility that
he shot his shoulder himself.</i>

553
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,270
<i>We have to find the President before Han Tae Kyeong.</i>

554
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,980
<i>The President is in danger.</i>

555
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,200
<i>We have to report to the top as soon as possible.</i>

556
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,170
<i>And this time... make sure to kill him.</i>
