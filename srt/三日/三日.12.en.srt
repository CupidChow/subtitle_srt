1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,239
Postpone the impeachment.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,240
And if I refuse?

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,560
In here,

4
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:13,809
there is a contract with
your signature on it.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,999
Are you planning to use
personnel inside the Blue House?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,940
Have you brought it?

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,620
Classified Document 98 I...
told you...

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,540
I'm different.

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,350
Empty folder

10
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,159
Dynamite?

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,999
Incident Report It was
a record showing...

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,770
Quantity 16, 1 box. Total 35 lbs.

13
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:51,299
Industrial-grade dynamite
disappearing from various locations.

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,270
An enormous amount.

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,790
Conspire with the North a terrorist
attack in the middle of Seoul...

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,249
If you compare the missing dynamite
locations with the cell phone GPS,

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,710
we can find out where
they took the dynamite.

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,800
Jaesin Group stole the dynamite.

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,900
Where they took it is more important.

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,510
Where they moved it and their
targets. We must find out.

21
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,840
Visitor

22
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,640
Episode 12

23
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,890
There were 24 causalities
and 19 injured in Yangjinri.

24
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,560
How many this time?

25
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,600
Long ago,

26
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,600
you told me.

27
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,890
An assassination attempt on the
President or blow up key industries,

28
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,870
or a terrorist attack
in the middle of Seoul.

29
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,910
When, where, how?

30
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,250
Aren't you curious...

31
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,020
how people will die?

32
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,650
Are you...

33
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,119
threatening me?

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,170
Of course not.

35
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,910
I'm asking for your help.

36
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,260
Pretend...

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,629
this legislation never happened.

38
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,630
No.

39
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,370
You give up.

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,060
As long as this legislation exists,

41
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,379
whether you can detonate explosives

42
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,480
or start a second IMF crisis.

43
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,100
You will never...

44
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,880
make a profit off Korea.

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,309
Fine.

46
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,520
I'll make you an offer.

47
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,820
Let's join hands.

48
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,200
If a second IMF crisis occurs,
Yangjinri will be forgotten.

49
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,050
And you can be the one...

50
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,120
who rescues the nation from IMF.

51
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,640
You're an economic President.

52
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,470
You really are...

53
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,120
an insane...

54
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,790
bastard.

55
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,830
You're the one who gave me the idea.

56
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,630
That idea was wrong.

57
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,450
I was wrong.

58
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,089
So stop now.

59
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,880
I already invested millions.

60
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,190
It's not just my money.

61
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,000
Even if I give up, they will never...

62
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,930
give up.

63
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,720
Are you referring to Falcon?

64
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,470
Are you replacing...

65
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,180
me as...

66
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,810
Falcon's dog?

67
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,890
Think over...

68
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,070
my offer.

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,980
Where is...

70
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,480
the bomb?

71
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,400
Bomb?

72
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,800
I don't know what you mean.

73
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,140
I can arrest you right now.

74
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,940
Will you speak in the interrogation room?

75
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,430
Arrest me.

76
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,780
I'll be released quickly
since there is no evidence.

77
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,150
But...

78
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,040
What if the bomb you're speaking of...

79
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,290
is detonated then?

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,650
Where is the GPS document?

81
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,010
After they left Daeseungri
by train, where did they go?

82
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,330
They got off the train
and onto the freeway.

83
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,599
Then they stayed at...

84
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,130
Latitude 37.5, Longitude 127.

85
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,040
Jaesin Headquarters.

86
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,690
After that?

87
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:22,629
Latitude 37.55...
Longitude 127.2.

88
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,080
They stayed there for
around thirty minutes.

89
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,170
That's Cha Young's hospital.

90
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,210
That's when he asked the nurse
about Agent Lee's condition.

91
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,130
The reason is more important.

92
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,320
Where did he go before
going to the hospital?

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,800
There's a high probability
he installed the bomb there.

94
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,570
Latitude 37.6, longitude 126.9.

95
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,080
He stayed there for two or three hours and
arrived at Agent Lee's hospital at 8:30pm.

96
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,300
The place he went before the hospital...

97
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,900
It's just an open field.

98
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,739
We should find something
there. I'll meet you there.

99
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,140
Call me if you receive the
investigation results on the way.

100
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Yes.

101
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,350
What?

102
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,600
No bomb was found?

103
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,770
Alright.

104
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,430
We have identified the perpetrator.

105
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,070
He's a US citizen and a US marine.

106
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,470
He was a mercenary soldier
working for Falcon.

107
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,670
Where are his personal items?

108
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,590
Here you go.

109
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,410
Prosecutor.

110
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,497
This is not the prosecution's
investigation.

111
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:47,850
We have no right to investigate.

112
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,820
So you stay out of it. I'll
do the investigation myself.

113
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,099
This is a residential area.

114
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,599
If it's a terrorist plot
big enough to start a war,

115
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,500
it will be a heavily populated
area with a lot of movement.

116
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,539
But this area is a quiet residential area.

117
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,740
Let's split up and search.

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,540
It's probably in this area.

119
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,030
Chairman Kim Do Jin.

120
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,140
Make him give up.

121
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,339
What do you mean?

122
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,940
I don't understand.

123
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,810
The truth of the Yangjinri
incident has been revealed.

124
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,460
All the powers protecting
you will all fall away.

125
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,180
I really... don't know what...

126
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,139
Hundreds of lives are at stake.

127
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,310
Do you think Chairman Kim
will take responsibility afterward?

128
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,930
Either you or Representative
Min Hyun Ki will take the blame.

129
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
The bomb...

130
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,870
must be stopped.

131
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,740
This is an order.

132
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,936
A strange piece of paper
was discovered from

133
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:17,720
one of the captured
Jaesin Group members.

134
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,890
What is it?

135
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,530
I don't know.

136
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,300
There are numbers on it.

137
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
What numbers?

138
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,670
Is it a street address?

139
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,850
Look for anything similar in the area.

140
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,540
9078.

141
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,070
455.

142
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,480
8723.

143
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,290
674.

144
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,510
1545.

145
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,120
8000.

146
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,280
5129.

147
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
2318.

148
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
That's it.

149
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,390
What was the last number?

150
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,660
51292318.

151
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,830
51292318.

152
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,140
51292318.

153
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,310
It's a bus.

154
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,660
A bus number.

155
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,400
Are these the bus numbers
that left from this station?

156
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,529
Who are you?

157
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,270
We're the police. It's urgent.

158
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Yes, that's right.

159
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,170
They're all Najin company buses.

160
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,610
Can you tell me their route?

161
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,010
Yes.

162
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,140
Over there.

163
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,350
Jamsil Station - Samsumg
Station - Apgujungdong Station

164
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,950
455.

165
00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:58,049
673.

166
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,170
8000. 2318.

167
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,040
There are bombs on these buses.

168
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,460
They're all city buses.

169
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,739
7:30pm.

170
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,320
The buses are leaving at the busiest time.

171
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,270
We have to stop the buses.

172
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,550
Let's go.

173
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,700
Let's see who wins this.

174
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,120
Have you dispatched the police?

175
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,980
Yes.

176
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:57,660
Per your orders, we have dispatched
two mobile police bomb squads.

177
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,800
Bomb squad

178
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,780
Over there.

179
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,920
2318.

180
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,050
5129.

181
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Maintain your distance.

182
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,910
What are you doing?

183
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,260
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:26,149
We are the police.
This is a dangerous situation.

185
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,080
Everyone get off.

186
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
I'm sorry.

187
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,790
I think they found out.

188
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,180
What should we do?

189
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,480
Please get off the bus due to malfunction.

190
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,430
Hurry.

191
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,000
Everyone get off.

192
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,919
Move back.

193
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,250
It's dangerous.

194
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,150
What should we do?

195
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,580
Detonate?

196
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,680
There is a suspicious bag.

197
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,290
It's a bomb.

198
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,529
A black bag has been
found on bus 455. A bomb.

199
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,800
A bomb found on bus 673.

200
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,070
Detonate.

201
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,450
Get off!

202
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Run!

203
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,050
Stop and retreat.

204
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
He says to retreat.

205
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,400
The time is 19:50.

206
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,900
We've disabled all the bombs.

207
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,080
What... are you doing?

208
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,109
This is Seoul, not Yangjinri.

209
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,790
Seoul, our capital city with a
population of over a million people.

210
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,140
How can you do this without
even a word of discussion?

211
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,370
And...

212
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,409
when Lee Dong Hwi's urgent
economic order is given,

213
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,990
there is no benefit to
setting off the bombs.

214
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,080
You must stop now.

215
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,550
How dare...

216
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,420
you stop me?

217
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,620
Who do you think you are?

218
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,440
Falcon...

219
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,530
contacted me.

220
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,420
Stop this...

221
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,640
immediately.

222
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,670
You'll have...

223
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,540
another opportunity next time.

224
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:07,970
Good job.

225
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,670
You, too.

226
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,030
Good job.

227
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,570
It's me.

228
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,440
The last bomb.

229
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,980
What should I do?

230
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,900
Are you going to visit
Agent Lee at the hospital?

231
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,700
What about you?

232
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,329
Before I go back to Seojori,

233
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,750
I want to say goodbye to Agent Lee.

234
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,760
Then I'll see you at the hospital.

235
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,340
Yes, Chief?

236
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,390
Tae Kyung.

237
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:26,939
The President...

238
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,540
wants me to tell you, "A job well done."

239
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
What about the bombs?

240
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,050
Are they all disabled?

241
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,340
We disabled 44 pounds of
dynamite each on four buses.

242
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,189
A cell phone was used as the detonator.

243
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,540
We're going to trace that phone
call to find the perpetrator.

244
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,780
Four buses...

245
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,059
with 44 pounds each?

246
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
Are you sure?

247
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
Yes, I'm sure.

248
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,070
The total weight of the missing
dynamite is over 220 pounds.

249
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,010
If it's 44 pounds for
each of the four buses,

250
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,540
that's only 176 pounds.

251
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,510
There are still...

252
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
44 pounds left.

253
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,850
What do you mean?

254
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,860
Latitude 37.55, longitude 127.1

255
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,860
He stayed there for around thirty minutes.

256
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,360
It's Cha Young's hospital.

257
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,820
It was when he was asking
about Agent Lee's condition.

258
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,799
He arrived at the hospital at 8:30pm.

259
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,010
But he tried to kill Cha
Young after 10:00pm.

260
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,010
What did he do...

261
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,930
at the hospital for two hours?

262
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,640
The last bomb.

263
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,589
Detonate it.

264
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,850
Right now.

265
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,380
Whatever you do, people will die.

266
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,960
One by one.

267
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,180
When the people around you die,

268
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,500
remember this.

269
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,540
Those people...

270
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,120
are dying because of you.

271
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,430
Yoon Bo Won!

272
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
Yoon Bo Won.

273
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,970
Wake up.

274
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,680
Wake up.

275
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:46,699
Yoon Bo Won. Wake up.

276
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,470
Wake up!

277
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,140
Please wake up.

278
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,690
Thank goodness.

279
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,690
Thank goodness.

280
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,770
The impeachment vote will be announced.

281
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,480
56 in favor.

282
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,779
23 opposed.

283
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,809
123 abstained.

284
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:37,820
The impeachment of President
Lee Dong Hwi has been rejected.

285
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,160
Special Report.

286
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,809
The impeachment of President
Lee Dong Hwi has been rejected.

287
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,576
In light of the new
evidence on the Yanjinri

288
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:49,050
incident by the
Special Prosecution,

289
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,970
most representatives abstained from voting.

290
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,759
With 56 in favor.

291
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,990
And 23 opposed.

292
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,240
This is...

293
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,610
not the end. I know it.

294
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,780
You are not...

295
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,140
someone who gives up.

296
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,309
March 11, 20:00,
72 hours after the

297
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,960
Impeachment initiated.
Impeachment rejected.

298
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,930
March 14, 20:30

299
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,893
72 hours earlier, March 11, 20:30
- Around 8pm, there were

300
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:17,920
shocking terrorist bombing
attempts on four buses in Seoul.

301
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,659
One suspect was arrested at the scene
and transported to the police station.

302
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,710
The police state they are questioning
him for other accomplices.

303
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,869
So far the terrorists' motive is unknown.

304
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,269
The President is strongly condemning this
incident which promotes civil unrest.

305
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,840
He has ordered a thorough investigation
to uncover the perpetrators.

306
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,310
Move.

307
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,300
I have a search warrant in connection
with the Yangjinri incident.

308
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,090
Seize everything.

309
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,850
Chairman Kim Do Jin.

310
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,670
As the prime suspect in the Yangjinri
incident, you must come in for questioning.

311
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,890
Are you...

312
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,310
saying you're going to question me?

313
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,250
It's not just us.

314
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,840
We identified the terrorist
bombing suspects.

315
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,460
They are all Jaesin Group's people.

316
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,010
The police headquarters is also...

317
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,500
planning to call you in.

318
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,040
Is that the person who set off the bomb?

319
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Yes.

320
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,240
He used his cell phone as the detonator.

321
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,970
Dynamite was stolen from
various construction

322
00:31:31,982 --> 00:31:33,799
locations throughout the nation.

323
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,050
This person has something
to do with that as well.

324
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,650
That person...

325
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,790
works for Jaesin's Chairman Kim Do Jin.

326
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,590
Chairman Kim is behind this.

327
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:50,500
We are in the middle of questioning him.

328
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,840
Did you know those two were planning this?

329
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,610
Had I known, I would have
notified authorities.

330
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,110
The two terrorist suspects are
both from the Jaesin Group.

331
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,479
Additionally,

332
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,720
they worked most closely with you.

333
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,350
So?

334
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,490
Am I responsible for what my employees do?

335
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,060
Aren't you the one...

336
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,740
who gave the bombing order?

337
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,060
Look here.

338
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,570
I am the person in charge
of this nation's economy.

339
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,509
While I am in here, Jaesin's
stock is plummeting.

340
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,149
That means this nation's
economy is being ruined.

341
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,410
Will you be responsible for that?

342
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,080
When you have actual
evidence, call me...

343
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,070
then.

344
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,490
Let him go.

345
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,420
Be thankful...

346
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,530
we're in a police station.

347
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,420
If not...

348
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,270
I wouldn't let you go.

349
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,530
Do you know...

350
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,450
how much I lost today?

351
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,980
The likes of you...

352
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,750
interferes with my work?

353
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,770
Back then...

354
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,950
When I said I wouldn't kill you,

355
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,330
I take it back.

356
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,320
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

357
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,420
That female police officer.

358
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,570
Agent Lee Cha Young.

359
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,210
President Lee Dong Hwi.

360
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,110
All who oppose me.

361
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,150
I will kill you all.

362
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,580
All.

363
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,520
Do it if you can.

364
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,870
Look forward to it.

365
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,140
It begins... tomorrow morning.

366
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:00,200
Are there still guards stationed
outside Cha Young's hospital room?

367
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,230
Yes.

368
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:02,480
I am continuously checking.

369
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,480
Why?

370
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,940
Can we dispatch more people? I'm worried.

371
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,290
Yes.

372
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,340
Alright.

373
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,559
I'll be going, too.

374
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,960
To Seojori?

375
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Yes.

376
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,920
Come in.

377
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,010
There is still time to
catch a bus to Seojori.

378
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,199
I'm really okay.

379
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,430
Stay here for the time being.

380
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,300
What?

381
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,510
I have to see you for reassurance.

382
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
Are you uncomfortable?

383
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,630
No.

384
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,630
It's...

385
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,660
not that.

386
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,490
I can sleep in my own clothes.

387
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,410
How can you sleep in clothes
you rolled around in?

388
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,730
Rest up.

389
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,700
Where... will you sleep?

390
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,400
The sofa outside.

391
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,370
Call if anything happens.

392
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:27,990
What is it?

393
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,960
There's a wooden sword next to the bed.

394
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Just so you know.

395
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Goodnight.

396
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,440
In any situation, remain calm...

397
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,269
so that I may fulfill my responsibilities.

398
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,840
Give me the wisdom and courage...

399
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,189
May this life and body...

400
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,699
be used according to your will.

401
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,850
But please protect one life.

402
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,340
President Lee Dong Hwi.

403
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,440
All who oppose me.

404
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,809
I will kill you all.

405
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:52,810
Every...

406
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,430
one.

407
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,360
How much do you need?

408
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,330
How much did Falcon pay you?

409
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,390
Is this enough...

410
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,650
to follow only my orders from now on?

411
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,710
From now on,

412
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,100
If I say, "Push it." You push it.

413
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,550
If I say, "Detonate." You detonate it.

414
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,170
Kill if I say, "kill."

415
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,190
Chairman... Kim Do Jin?

416
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,720
What is this?

417
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,700
Why are you doing this to me?

418
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Now...

419
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,840
do you know who's on top now?

420
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,890
I give...

421
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,180
orders.

422
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,300
Representative!

423
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,210
Why are you doing this?

424
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,230
We're on the same side.

425
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,060
Yes, we are.

426
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,009
But you also know...

427
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,730
the most about what I did.

428
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,349
Chairman Kim.

429
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,350
Why?

430
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:00,080
We can join forces and blame Lee
Dong Hwi for the Yangjinri incident.

431
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,740
Yes.

432
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,180
That's why... I'm going
to kill him, too.

433
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,060
You two are just the first ones.

434
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,590
Kill him.

435
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:16,910
No.

436
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,530
No.

437
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,530
Chairman Kim.

438
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,279
Chairman!

439
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
Chairman!

440
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Let go!

441
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,050
Why ask me to come so early?

442
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,740
I'm tired because I was up all night.

443
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
Hey.

444
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,050
Sorry, sorry.

445
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,170
Hey.

446
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,870
What is that?

447
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,840
You're off today, right?

448
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:07,530
Stay here today...

449
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,910
and guard Officer Yoon.

450
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:12,930
Officer Yoon?

451
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,200
That's...

452
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,720
Officer Yoon?

453
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,300
What is your relationship?

454
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:23,770
Don't think weird thoughts.

455
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,930
Take care of her until I get back.

456
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,860
If you do anything weird, I'll kill you.

457
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,579
National Intelligence
Director, Byun Tae Hoon...

458
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,520
would never commit suicide.

459
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,560
This is Chairman Kim Do Jin's doing.

460
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,710
Have you found Representative, Min Hyun Ki?

461
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,480
I sent people to his home
and office like you said,

462
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,599
but there's no sign of him.

463
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,020
His cell is off, too.

464
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,740
Chairman Kim...

465
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,660
Arrest him no matter what.

466
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,510
Chairman Kim is a walking time bomb.

467
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:05,110
We're investigating all computers
and documents from Jaesin.

468
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,330
But there is insufficient evidence
to issue an arrest warrant.

469
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:10,950
Prosecutor.

470
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,309
Representative Min Hyun Ki...

471
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,310
has been found.

472
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,780
Special Report.

473
00:45:25,781 --> 00:45:28,270
National Intelligence
Director, Byun Tae Hoon

474
00:45:28,282 --> 00:45:30,620
was found deceased at
his home by hanging.

475
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,980
He left a will expressing
his sense of injustice.

476
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,260
Look forward to it.

477
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,480
It begins... tomorrow morning.

478
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:48,850
Representative Min was found...

479
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,360
by a highway near Seoul.

480
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:58,270
His will said he was not behind Yangjinri
and someone was defiling his reputation.

481
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,140
Kim Do Jin speaking.

482
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:11,780
Yes.

483
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,500
I...

484
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,250
would like to meet, too.

485
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,210
What is it?

486
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,830
Are you going out?

487
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,290
Are you going to meet Chairman Kim?

488
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,340
Must you go?

489
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,730
I know what you'll say.

490
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,490
I'll tell him instead.

491
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,960
It's too dangerous.

492
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,730
Isn't it dangerous for you, too?

493
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,439
Chairman Kim Do Jin...

494
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,919
In order to conceal his
part in the terrorist plot,

495
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,109
he used dynamite from a
small construction company.

496
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,110
However...

497
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,760
if he decides...

498
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,730
He has a much bigger weapon.

499
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,480
Force One.

500
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,560
I will stop him myself.

501
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,790
Then... Let me go with you.

502
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,950
If I can...

503
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:26,650
I'd like to return to the Secret Service.

504
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
I...

505
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,140
will...

506
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:32,940
soon resign as President.

507
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,760
I don't deserve the protection
of the Secret Service.

508
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,060
Until you resign...

509
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,700
Let me be by your side.

510
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:45,750
Back then...

511
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,020
you asked me to protect you.

512
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,390
Like you asked,

513
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,780
let me protect you.

514
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,060
I beg you.

515
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,650
I heard from the VIP.

516
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:24,990
You...

517
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,420
Are you a parachute?

518
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,230
Shouldn't you have asked me first?

519
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,730
I'm sorry.

520
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,440
There's no time.

521
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:44,610
Get ready to go.

522
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,180
Yes.

523
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,610
Did you have a good break?

524
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,489
There's no time.

525
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,490
Get your gun.

526
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,250
Get ready.

527
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,230
Will you really be okay alone?

528
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,210
I'm going to get in trouble with Tae Kyung.

529
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:15,559
It's okay.

530
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,749
There are police guarding
Agent Lee Cha Young's room.

531
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,570
Thank you for everything.

532
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,210
That's all I know about the dynamite.

533
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:38,570
I know about as much as the public
about the Yangjinri incident.

534
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,920
But... one thing is certain.

535
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,810
Chairman Kim Do Jin and...

536
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,580
deceased Chief of Staff
Shin were involved in...

537
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,400
the bus terrorist plot.

538
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,090
What's this about?

539
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,650
I came to see Agent Lee Cha Young.

540
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:24,750
You're here.

541
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,649
How do you feel?

542
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,650
I'm alright.

543
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,270
He's here to investigate
the bus terrorist plot.

544
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,849
But...

545
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,730
isn't the special prosecution only
investigating the Yangjinri incident?

546
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:43,950
We think they might be related.

547
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,650
The prosecutor sent me.

548
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,920
Can I speak to Prosecutor Choi Ji Hoon?

549
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,029
He's in a meeting.

550
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,759
Agent Han Tae Kyu
requested witness protection.

551
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,760
Yes.

552
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,540
We received the request earlier.

553
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,000
The police are on the way.

554
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,670
They'll be arriving soon.

555
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,540
What is it? Is something wrong?

556
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:16,450
I never received a request
for witness protection.

557
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:19,180
You were in a meeting,
so I told an employee.

558
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:20,740
Me, too.

559
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,920
It was a young man.

560
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,920
Chairman Kim has a mole
inside the special prosecution.

561
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,500
Are you alright? Sit down.

562
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,530
No, it's okay.

563
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,860
What's the reason...

564
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,590
for wanting to meet?

565
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,660
Did you think...

566
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:49,970
I would withdraw the urgent
economic authority order?

567
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,540
I would be grateful...

568
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,510
if you did.

569
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,280
Since millions in emergency
funds are already deposited...

570
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,110
a lover of money like yourself...

571
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,720
won't let this chance go by.

572
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,850
I was taught never to take a loss.

573
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,620
Then how about this?

574
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,320
I'm thinking about passing
another special law.

575
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,139
Offshore accounts with...

576
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,230
illegal accounts in false names,

577
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,630
whose funds can be fully
returned. A special law.

578
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,200
You won't give up.

579
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,210
But neither will I.

580
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,140
You want to...

581
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,580
play to the end.

582
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,640
Be reasonable.

583
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,280
The prosecution and the police.

584
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:36,380
All the powers that are protecting you...

585
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:39,920
are leaving you one by one.

586
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,590
You will be cornered soon and
sentenced according to the law.

587
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,050
The person who made me this way...

588
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,460
is you.

589
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,470
All the events to come...

590
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,890
are because of you.

591
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,050
Agent.

592
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,449
I was in a hurry and didn't bring anything.

593
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,050
I'll go buy drinks downstairs.

594
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:16,850
Okay.

595
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:20,210
Oh...

596
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,780
Your voice sounds familiar.

597
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,050
It's time for a rotation.

598
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:46,530
Can I see your ID?

599
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:54,390
Take care.

600
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:17,010
Who will be first?

601
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,450
Who will I kill first?

602
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:37,830
From now on...

603
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,370
there will be no one...

604
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,440
to get in my way.
