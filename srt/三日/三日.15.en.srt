00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,880
Episode 15

2
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,260
1998 Yangjinri incident,
list of 24 victims.

3
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,840
Police officer, student, army sergeant...

4
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,690
March 14, 18:00.

5
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,740
We must...

6
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:37,190
return to the Blue House quickly.

7
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,180
What are you talking about?

8
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,340
Freeze!

9
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,710
What's going on?

10
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,580
Where is the Chief of Police?

11
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,950
He just left.

12
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,330
EMP.

13
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,500
An EMP bomb exploded.

14
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,870
Hurry.

15
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:21,000
You must hide.

16
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,620
Go!

17
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,049
I'll contact the Blue House.

18
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,190
No, don't!

19
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,269
There were EMP grade four
explosions in Chungsoodae.

20
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,370
It paralyzed a twenty mile radius.

21
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,570
Grade one this time.

22
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,740
Going off from inside a car will
only affect 1.5 miles at best.

23
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,680
It's possible that it paralyzed
our radios, cell phones and cars.

24
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,780
This is the Yangjinri Memorial.
People are hurt. Come fast.

25
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,220
How about the VIP?

26
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,560
He's in front of the Memorial.

27
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,300
He's with the Chief.

28
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,140
Wait a little bit more.

29
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,140
I'll cover.

30
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,099
Hide!

31
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,399
We'll block them!

32
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Go!

33
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,190
The VIP...

34
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
is missing.

35
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,900
What?

36
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,180
You're the only one I can
trust inside the Blue House.

37
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,690
Meet with the National Security Chief and
let the Prime Minister know about this.

38
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,260
What are you talking about?

39
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,060
The President is missing?

40
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,790
Agent Lee Cha Young will
tell you the details.

41
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,319
There was a shoot out?

42
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,629
In front of the Memorial?

43
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,849
Yes.

44
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,669
Also, an EMP exploded.

45
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,539
We're unable to contact the Chief and
agents who were with the President.

46
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,739
We must dispatch the local
military and police force.

47
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,499
We don't know where the President is.

48
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,649
Where will we dispatch them to?

49
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,140
I don't think he can use the vehicle.

50
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,359
He's still probably...

51
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,120
nearby by Yangjinri somewhere.

52
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,320
Who would do something like this?

53
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,970
It's Chairman Kim Do Jin.

54
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,460
Are you...

55
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,030
prepared?

56
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,300
I'm asking you if you're...

57
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,320
prepared to die.

58
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,999
According to the police report who
was following Chairman Kim Do Jin,

59
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,740
he disappeared in a
helicopter after fleeing jail.

60
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,910
I'm sure...

61
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,860
he went to Yangjinri.

62
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,110
Inspection. Open the trunk please.

63
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,110
Do not enter.

64
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,479
- Hurry up.
- Nothing.

65
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,549
Team one, go to the lower end of town.
The other team, to the upper end of town.

66
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,689
- Yes.
- Move fast, hurry. Hurry.

67
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,700
Geez...

68
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,000
Did something happen?

69
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:35,559
Yeah, I heard a gunshot near the memorial.
Are there spies from the North?

70
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,239
Well, please go home for now.
Please? Hurry, hurry.

71
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,710
What, what... wait...

72
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,560
Anticipate.

73
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,709
The truth you wanted to protect...

74
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,750
so badly...

75
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,070
I'll show you what the price is for that.

76
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,890
Today... you'll see
what a ruin...

77
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,710
Yangjinri will become.

78
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Yes, I understand.

79
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,950
Still no contact on site?

80
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,199
Because of the EMP...

81
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,339
we lost contact with the
agents who are with the VIP.

82
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,040
According to Agent Han Tae Kyung
who arrived later on site,

83
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,240
there's still no sign of VIP.

84
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,259
After evaluating the situation,
he believes the VIP is in hiding

85
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,670
with the Chief and other agents.

86
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,309
At the time of an emergency, it's a basic
rule to run to an emergency hideout.

87
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,400
They're probably there.

88
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,809
Where is the hideout for this event?

89
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,297
It's about 1.5 mile from the memorial.
There are

90
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,860
two agents and two emergency
vehicles on standby.

91
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,250
Agent Han Tae Kyung is on his way now.

92
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Is the helicopter ready?

93
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,300
It will be ready in ten minutes.

94
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,100
Do not enter.

95
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,070
Did you...

96
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,740
put me in situation...

97
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,590
just for this stupid stone?

98
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,040
Anticipate.

99
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,880
Because of you...

100
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,020
you will experience a
ruined Yangjinri today.

101
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,140
There may be another...

102
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,460
meaningless stone like this.

103
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,940
March 14, 18:35.

104
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,060
Primary emergency hideout.

105
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,874
Location photo. Two
agents, one bullet proof

106
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:11,580
vehicle, two regular
vehicles on standby.

107
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,380
Chief of Police.

108
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
Han Tae Kyung.

109
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,640
How did you get here?

110
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,940
I was at the memorial site.

111
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,660
The VIP disappeared.

112
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,360
I was wondering if he would be here.

113
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,030
Me, too.

114
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,349
I was shot in the CP bus.

115
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,350
I fainted.

116
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,420
After I came to,

117
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,560
the VIP and Chief were gone.

118
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,180
I came here immediately to wait for them.

119
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,720
Where are the standby agents?

120
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,490
After I arrived...

121
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,660
they left to inspect the surrounding area.

122
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,730
There was an EMP.

123
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,100
How could a VIP's vehicle have such a bomb?

124
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,040
It's the Communications Director's doing.

125
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,510
When the Secret Service
checked out the vehicle,

126
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,340
everything was fine.

127
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,240
The Communications Director...

128
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,030
was the last to check the vehicle.

129
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,030
That's when he installed it.

130
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,150
More importantly,

131
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,870
where is the VIP?

132
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,890
You don't know either?

133
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,370
Didn't you get a call from the Chief?

134
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,490
Who is it?

135
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,820
Agent Lee Cha Young.

136
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,140
What happened?

137
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,250
The military and police...

138
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,100
they're on their way to Yangjinri.

139
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,350
And?

140
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,620
I got it.

141
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,580
I'll be on my way.

142
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
What happened?

143
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,800
Did you find out...

144
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,870
where the VIP is?

145
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,140
The Chief called her.

146
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
Where is...

147
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,780
that?

148
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,200
He called from the
emergency call box on

149
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,920
Highway 17 between the
memorial and Yangjinri.

150
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,720
He's waiting for a Secret Service vehicle.

151
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,690
Emergency call box on Highway 17...

152
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,230
Yes.

153
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,590
Thanks for...

154
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,110
letting me know.

155
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,509
The Chief contacted the Blue House

156
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,190
using an emergency call box on Highway 17.

157
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,160
Go to Highway 17.

158
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,299
What happened?

159
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,600
The Chief didn't use this phone.

160
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,230
This phone is out of order.

161
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,100
We were deceived.

162
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,960
What are you saying?

163
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,260
Did you lie...

164
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,450
to deceive me?

165
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
This is Han Tae Kyung.

166
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,490
We found the Communications Director.

167
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,219
We're interrogating him.

168
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,540
He has a contradictory testimony.

169
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,909
What are you saying?

170
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,350
He says it was the Chief of Police
who left the room, not him.

171
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,930
We're all Secret Service agents.

172
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,840
How can you?

173
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,250
Where is that?

174
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,250
Three o'clock.

175
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,620
Move fast.

176
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,810
Blue House...

177
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,630
Secret Service.

178
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,590
Lower your guns.

179
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,850
Lower your guns.

180
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,079
Someone is trying to kill the President.

181
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,480
The suspect ran away.

182
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,630
Eleven o'clock.

183
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,050
Black jacket and black pants.

184
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,720
It's Agent Han Tae Kyung.

185
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,130
Radio everyone and put
him on the Wanted List.

186
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,110
When you find him...

187
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,390
you can shoot him on sight.

188
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,570
The CP doesn't know where
the VIP is either.

189
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,280
The President is still safe.

190
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,530
If so...

191
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,050
where can he be?

192
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,290
The EMP got us.

193
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,640
The necessities are car and phone.

194
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,779
If they knew the CP was an accomplice,

195
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,740
they wouldn't have gone
to the emergency hideout.

196
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,580
The only other place to
get a car and phone is...

197
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,440
in Yangjinri.

198
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,110
Highway 17 and 20 are the only
routes into town from the memorial.

199
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,900
But...

200
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,240
Getting caught by Kim Do Jin's people
are very likely on those highways.

201
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,349
Please endure a little more.

202
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,020
We're entering the town soon.

203
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,390
Must we do this?

204
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,700
Is there another way...

205
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,800
besides going to Yangjinri?

206
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,650
Are you afraid of...

207
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,870
repeating what happened sixteen years ago?

208
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,170
Are you afraid of hurting more people?

209
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,650
Don't worry.

210
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,680
We won't run into any
townspeople at this hour.

211
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,999
And even if... there
is a shoot out,

212
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,630
we'll protect the civilians
just like we protect you.

213
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,580
I promise.

214
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,819
If they want to avoid the highway
and minimize hurting civilians,

215
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,090
they'll probably avoid
the main roads into town.

216
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,530
The basic rule during an emergency is

217
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,710
to move to an emergency hideout
as stated in our manual.

218
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,419
If the primary hideout isn't available,

219
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,319
you can use the secondary hideout.

220
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,499
Since we're talking about
an emergency situation,

221
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,829
shouldn't we consider
the worst case scenario?

222
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,559
Primary and secondary hideouts
can be inaccessible.

223
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,600
Then the next place would be a local
police station or military base.

224
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,860
Our adversaries can discover
the same solutions.

225
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,870
That can be our trap.

226
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:27,020
But if we move without a plan, it can
cause confusion with the support troops.

227
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,250
Let's say there are shots fired
and bombs explode during an event.

228
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,420
Everyone's dead and only the
VIP and one of you are alive.

229
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,510
That's called an emergency.

230
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
What is the most important
thing to consider then?

231
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,880
Figuring out the VIP's intention.

232
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,850
How does the VIP move normally?

233
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,680
What does he prefer and why
did he make such a decision...

234
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,890
You must be clear...

235
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,910
about the VIP's thoughts.

236
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,730
That's how you increase the
VIP's chance of survival.

237
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,530
During an emergency,

238
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,169
a basic rule of thumb,

239
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,800
emergency hideout, support troops...

240
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,390
All these are for the VIP's survival.

241
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
But...

242
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,380
the most important thing
about securing the VIP is

243
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,730
figuring out the VIP's intention.

244
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,879
That takes...

245
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,870
priority over your basic rule
of thumb during emergency.

246
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,310
Figure out the VIP's intention.

247
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,390
If you remember that,

248
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,130
you'll find your answer.

249
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
If that's the case...

250
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,720
where it's empty...

251
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,820
gone home after work...

252
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,390
Yangjinri Elementary School.

253
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,500
Move inside the building. Find a land line.

254
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,530
There's a land line in here.

255
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,860
Let's go.

256
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,070
We must prepare for the worst.

257
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,290
The President already
spoke of his resignation.

258
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,329
Prime Minister,

259
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,880
you must prepared to take over.

260
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,990
This is the Blue House status room.

261
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,210
It's the Chief.

262
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,280
We're with the President right now.

263
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,050
Please send military troops to
the Yangjinri Elementary School.

264
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,340
Yes, sir.

265
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,960
We've located...

266
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
the President.

267
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,059
Please send military support to
the Yangjinri Elementary School.

268
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
Hurry!

269
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,489
All military support in Yangjinri, dispatch
to the Yangjinri Elementary School.

270
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,110
I repeat.

271
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,580
Let's go back.

272
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:01,741
All military support in Yangjinri, dispatch
to the Yangjinri Elementary School.

273
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,999
What's going on?

274
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,450
What happened to the VIP?

275
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,570
Is the President safe?

276
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,070
Not sure.

277
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,470
The Chief of Police got us.

278
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,960
The information held by the CP on site is

279
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,560
greater than that of the
Presidential Bodyguard.

280
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,460
The President's route,

281
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,360
emergency hideout, emergency road,

282
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,920
the CP knows everything.

283
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,740
We must arrest the CP right away, if not...

284
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,500
we can't protect the President.

285
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,190
I repeat.

286
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:51,351
All military support in Yangjinri, dispatch
to the Yangjinri Elementary School.

287
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,500
I repeat.

288
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:55,661
All military support in Yangjinri, dispatch
to the Yangjinri Elementary School.

289
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,190
Which precinct are you from?
Present your ID.

290
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
What are you doing?

291
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,530
Chief.

292
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,820
The troops will arrive momentarily.
Go ahead.

293
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,369
Let's go together. We must go together.

294
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,370
No, we can't.

295
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,469
Go ahead.

296
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,240
Chief.

297
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,980
Go and do what you must do.

298
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,590
I'll stay behind and protect you.

299
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,650
Go!

300
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,250
I will survive this.

301
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,290
Chief...

302
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,830
you must survive as well.

303
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,850
Yes.

304
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,350
The VIP is alone.

305
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,769
Hurry up and go.

306
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,770
Hurry!

307
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,910
Freeze!

308
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,020
We don't have time for this.

309
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,890
We must find the President.

310
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,370
I don't have time.

311
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,139
Listen up all troops.

312
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,939
The VIP is headed to the Yangjinri Shrine.

313
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,329
All troops, dispatch to the
Yangjinri Shrine parking lot.

314
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,220
I repeat.

315
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:08,739
All troops, listen up.

316
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,570
The VIP is headed to the Yangjinri Shrine.

317
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,199
Stop the car for minute.

318
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,170
We must go to the Yangjinri
Shrine parking lot.

319
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,300
Just a moment.

320
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,540
Stop.

321
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,780
What's...

322
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,989
He's at the Yangjinri Shrine parking lot.

323
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,269
Hurry.

324
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,310
We must get there before the troops.

325
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:02,850
What's going on?

326
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,990
For sure they said...

327
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,660
it was here on the radio.

328
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,420
They'll show up right behind us...

329
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,730
Drop your guns.

330
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,770
Drop your guns and lay down on your chest.

331
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,659
The Blue House status room
confirmed your identity.

332
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,080
Agent Lee Cha Young was
concerned she lost contact with you.

333
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,180
How about the President?
Did you find out where he is?

334
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,420
No. We're continuing our search.

335
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,870
We'll put the CP on the
Wanted List as well.

336
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,630
Wait.

337
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,430
The soldiers who are with the CP...

338
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,620
can you send out radio messages
to those soldiers only?

339
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,630
What?

340
00:37:28,631 --> 00:37:30,390
Please send radio message to them only.

341
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,290
Say you found out where the President is.

342
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,040
Because of you...

343
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,890
do you know how many agents died?

344
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,150
Why?

345
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
Why?

346
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,350
Hold yourself back.

347
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,220
March 14, 19:10.

348
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,650
They just arrested the CP and the
others going after the President.

349
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,720
And the President?

350
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,140
We still can't locate...

351
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,710
whereabouts of the President.

352
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,060
We're searching through
Yangjinri inside and out.

353
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,679
Where could he be?

354
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,650
As soon as I hear any news...

355
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,670
I'll report back to you.

356
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,680
Someone is urgently looking for you, Agent.

357
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,850
Lee Cha Young speaking.

358
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,050
This is Yoon Bo Won.

359
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,950
Who did you arrest?

360
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,290
He sneaked into the special prosecution
office about thirty minutes ago.

361
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,410
Have you gone as far as
setting things on fire?

362
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,410
Killing Prosecutor Choi wasn't enough.

363
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,210
Now you want to get rid
of the Yangjinri evidence?

364
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,610
Do you think this will get
rid of your dirty past?

365
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,450
Do you think you can stop me on your own?

366
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,960
I have no intention of stopping you.

367
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,560
Set... the fire.

368
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,229
Since you've been placed
on the Wanted List,

369
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:24,040
the Prosecutor relocated the most
crucial evidence to a safe place.

370
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,770
He also told me that you'd come back here.

371
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,210
He asked me to look out for you.

372
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,150
He asked you to look out for me? Who?

373
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,080
Special Prosecutor...

374
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,020
Choi Ji Hoon.

375
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:38,149
Choi Ji Hoon died!

376
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,150
No.

377
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,300
He's alive.

378
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,500
You're mistaken about one more thing.

379
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,740
I...

380
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,710
didn't come here alone.

381
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,910
Do whatever you want if you want to add
arson to the list of charges against you.

382
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,920
Or come with us and cooperate
in our investigation.

383
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,460
Whichever way is more
advantageous to you...

384
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,140
you were a prosecutor.

385
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,090
I'm sure you know better.

386
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,830
Arrest him.

387
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Let's go.

388
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,220
He's different since he was a prosecutor.

389
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,890
He's cooperating after we mentioned
lessening his sentence.

390
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,390
So, did he confess the whereabouts
of Chairman Kim Do Jin?

391
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,590
No.

392
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:57,599
He doesn't know where he
went after they left jail.

393
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
But...

394
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,200
there's one thing that bothers
me about his confession.

395
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,870
Let's go.

396
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,710
He said he saw them take off
in several different trucks.

397
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,780
He doesn't know what's inside the truck.

398
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,820
I'm nervous Chairman Kim
is up to another scheme.

399
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,450
Yangjinri...

400
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,200
Trucks...

401
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,990
Just a moment.

402
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,109
As for the President...

403
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:20,340
I'll guard him closely.

404
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Don't worry.

405
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:34,890
Alright.

406
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,250
They are all arrested.

407
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,090
It doesn't matter.

408
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,409
Everyone arrested are refusing to talk.

409
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,780
They belong to Chairman
Kim Do Jin of the Jaesin Group.

410
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,780
Chairman Kim is probably here somewhere.

411
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,220
We must find out where he is.

412
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,620
Alright.

413
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,620
And...

414
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,310
We still have to arrest one more person.

415
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,390
He's wearing a police uniform.

416
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,820
He probably has a fake ID.

417
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,050
Where are you coming from?

418
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,850
Coming from the next town.

419
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,710
Did you spot...
anyone suspicious?

420
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,449
Anyone suspicious?

421
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:48,530
Like how?

422
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,880
Thank you for your cooperation.

423
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,100
Okay.

424
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,020
Did you say you were going
to a nearby military base?

425
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:22,890
Yes.

426
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,210
You can drop me off there.

427
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,990
Was that a gunshot?

428
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:40,970
Get in.

429
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,560
Standing here is dangerous.

430
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,380
Hurry!

431
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,080
Hurry!

432
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,950
Back then...

433
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:52,790
Sixteen years ago...

434
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,320
my husband died.

435
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:01,369
He left saying he'll have
some sushi with his friends.

436
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:02,770
That was the last time I saw him.

437
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,420
I don't know what others think.

438
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,090
But I'm grateful.

439
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,559
For the past sixteen years,

440
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,830
I set the table for his memorial day.

441
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,800
My daughter...

442
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,649
asked... why her dad died then.

443
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,190
I couldn't answer her.

444
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,239
My husband wasn't a police
officer or a soldier.

445
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,440
He was an ordinary taxi driver.

446
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,210
Why a spy killed an ordinary
man like my husband...

447
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,700
I couldn't understand.

448
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,430
But...

449
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,990
you opened everything up.

450
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:51,210
I feel a lot better now.

451
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,420
Agent Lee Cha Young wants
to speak with you urgently.

452
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:05,890
Hello.

453
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,730
I'm pretty sure Chairman Kim sent
something down to Yangjinri.

454
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,160
What are you talking about?

455
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,870
He sent his people on
four trucks somewhere.

456
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,370
Trucks?

457
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,672
I ordered the status
room to track all trucks

458
00:47:19,684 --> 00:47:22,370
that passed through
Yangjinri toll gate.

459
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,070
But if they passed through the highway,

460
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:27,930
it'll be hard to chase.

461
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,709
I told you no.

462
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,470
Brother... No...

463
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,220
Alright, alright...
Alright, alright...

464
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,960
Are you still here?

465
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,280
The trucks...

466
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,500
I'm concerned.

467
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,220
The Special Prosecutor told me...

468
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,270
you did a lot of good work
regarding this investigation.

469
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,909
But just because you're standing here...

470
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,390
It's not like the suspects will
start talking all of a sudden.

471
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,780
Go home.

472
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,350
If you want to observe
from the next room...

473
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,220
go ahead.

474
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,380
Thank you.

475
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,670
The assassination attempt wasn't the only
time the refrigerated truck was used.

476
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,889
Secretary Han Gi Joon's car accident.

477
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:51,430
It's also related to the
precinct fire earlier.

478
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:54,299
But someone is hiding the
evidence. Investigate further.

479
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,430
Are you sure?

480
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,680
Do you have proof?

481
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,430
I don't have proof but...

482
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,890
Okay.

483
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:05,740
Let's wrap it up for the day.

484
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:11,260
A committee will be forming soon.
Please cooperate with us until then.

485
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,710
But...

486
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,580
The license number...

487
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,719
Aren't you going to ask me that?

488
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,720
If...

489
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,139
your testimony is actually true...

490
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,690
it's probably an unregistered vehicle.

491
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,830
We will...

492
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,550
look into it further.

493
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:31,530
Go home.

494
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:35,950
Prosecutor.

495
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,060
I think I know...

496
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,580
why the suspect...

497
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:43,210
won't talk.

498
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,330
Detective Jung Yoon Suk?

499
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,350
Yes.

500
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:57,410
You're dismissed from this
investigation going forward.

501
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,630
What are you...

502
00:49:59,631 --> 00:50:01,380
Your interference with the investigation...

503
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,930
We'll look into that later.

504
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,769
I have no idea what you're talking about...

505
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:09,850
Please...

506
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,090
leave this room.

507
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:20,910
Take him outside.

508
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,050
You!

509
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,140
Remember...

510
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,860
I'm not finished.

511
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,940
Chairman Kim Do Jin.

512
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,340
Where is he right now?

513
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,880
What did he send to Yangjinri
inside the trucks?

514
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,650
This is...

515
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,890
your last chance.

516
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,690
I have no choice if you're
going to act this way.

517
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,140
Chairman Kim Do Jin is...

518
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,010
merely a toy being used by Falcon.

519
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:28,080
Falcon needs a crazy like
Chairman Kim Do Jin.

520
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,510
The more they shake up South Korea...

521
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,580
the better off Falcon will be.

522
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:33,850
And?

523
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:34,910
What's...

524
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,550
inside the trucks?

525
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,960
What do you think?

526
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,800
It's what you're thinking.

527
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,330
Much bigger and stronger than...

528
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,640
last time.

529
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,830
You should be careful.

530
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:06,119
There are many people who hate you.

531
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm referring to the gunfire earlier...

532
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,790
and seeing strangers around
town since last night.

533
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,390
Since last night...

534
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,630
you spotted strangers around town?

535
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,299
Yes.

536
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:27,990
I saw scary looking men roaming
around town in trucks late last night.

537
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,940
It makes me nervous seeing
strangers like that

538
00:52:30,952 --> 00:52:33,370
because of what happened
sixteen years ago.

539
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:35,110
Trucks?

540
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,370
Yes.

541
00:52:36,371 --> 00:52:38,450
They all looked the same.

542
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,280
Those trucks with those men...

543
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,690
Are they still in town?

544
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,570
I think they parked them on the bridge.

545
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,510
You can see over there.
It's that truck over there.

546
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,239
You still can't find Lee Dong Hwi?

547
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,240
Yes.

548
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,970
There are military and
police all over the place.

549
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,500
If we make a false move,

550
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,950
we can get caught, too.

551
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,120
Then...

552
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,310
we should force him to crawl out.

553
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,550
We're almost at the military base.

554
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,950
♪ 51292318, Send.

555
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,630
You've...

556
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,330
finally...

557
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,900
come to Yangjinri.

558
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,960
A message came from the Blue House.

559
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:10,400

Tomorrow at 5:30pm.
Yangjinri Memorial visit planned.

561
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Go!

562
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,550
A place you've been avoiding for so long...

563
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:50,940
I gave you no choice but
to come to Yangjinri.

564
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,720
Just as I lost everything...

565
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,310
I'll be sure you lose everything, too.

566
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:02,610
Something will happen all because of you.

567
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:07,160
Watch clearly.

568
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,780
No... No...

569
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,130
No!

570
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,339
What's going on, huh?

571
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,340
Mr. Lee!

572
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:48,790
There was an explosion in Yangjinri.

573
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:52,520
A bomb exploded.

574
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,270
March 14, 19:50.

575
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,469
- There are three trucks left.
- What?

576
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,869
Some crazy bastard came to Yangjinri
with four trucks with bombs.

577
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,979
Evacuating the civilians is our priority.

578
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,879
We dispatched the bomb squad. They're
searching and disarming the bombs.

579
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,919
That's outside the search
area. You can relax.

580
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,089
Is this your briefcase?

581
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:56,449
I placed the bomb inside the truck.

582
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:57,789
Are you looking for the bomb?

583
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:59,889
The second bomb will detonate.

584
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,789
There's a gas pipe underneath here.

585
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:04,280
If the bomb blows up here,
Yangjinri will go up in flames.
