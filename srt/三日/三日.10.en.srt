00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,010
Get out of here, quickly!

<i>Episode 10</i>

6
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,160
Agent Han Tae Kyeong, what are you doing here at this time?

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,100
Why are you...

8
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,030
You?

9
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,490
Why the hell are you here?

10
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,000
Do you have something to do with my guest?

11
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,500
Move!

12
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,910
Agent Lee Cha Yeong came here to tell me something.

13
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,540
If you also wish to hear it with me, you can.

14
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,750
I think...

15
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,190
it is better if I come back next time.

16
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,020
No, it isn't.

17
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,250
I have to hear it at all cost, today.

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,910
I certainly want to hear it, too.

19
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,250
The reason why Agent Lee came to meet Chairman Kim.

20
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,100

26
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,750
Please, sit comfortably.

27
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,120
Agent Lee and Agent Han.

28
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,000
You must be quite close since you are both in the same PSS.

29
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,200
I heard that PSS agents have to trust each other with their lives.

30
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,040
Is that really true?

31
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,690
We shouldn't trust each other blindly, either,

32
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,360
because PSS Agents can become the best assassins.

33
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,060
So,

34
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,750
shall we get to the point?

35
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,330
Agent Lee, why did you come to see me?

36
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,250
Why on earth did you come here?

37
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,870
Did you bring a wireless AP with you?

38
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,450
Answer me.

39
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,120
Han Tae Kyeong

40
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Look at what happened to the PSS Agency and the President because of it.

41
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,790
You shouldn't only scold Agent Lee.

42
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,910
They way PSS team has been operating lately has been a real mess.

43
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,660
The leader of the PSS attempted to shoot the President

44
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,700
and ended up dying to no avail. That's not all.

45
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,160
Played by the President's scheme, an agent even committed a murder.

46
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:45,700
Doesn't this mean it's about time for the PSS to be disbanded?

47
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,100
If I treated you like a guest, you should at least show some manners.

48
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,450
I'm not your guest.

49
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,910
Please have some manners the next time we meet.

50
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,330
Ah, I'm sorry.

51
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,620
We probably won't have another opportunity to meet

52
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,120
because you'll be locked away as a murderer.

53
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,420
Shall we start now?

54
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,870
Let's go.

55
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,120
I brought this from the press conference site.

56
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:34,320
Chief Secretary Shin Kyu Jin said that he must protect the Blue House until the impeachment vote,

57
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,120
so I brought it over instead.

58
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,620
Then.

59
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,900
I said I wanted to see you.

60
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,370
I told the Chief Secretary

61
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,310
that I wanted very much to meet you, PSS Agent Lee Cha Young.

62
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,340
You see, I have something I want to ask you.

63
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,580
I heard you're very close with PSS Agent Han Tae Kyeong.

64
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,780
During the sniping incident, you made a significant contribution

65
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,290
in revealing that Chief Ham Bong Soo was the sniper.

66
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,930
So then why are you jumping into our work all of a sudden?

67
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,590
No matter how he tries to appear innocent,

68
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,330
The president is a murderer.

69
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,220
Instead of protecting such a person,

70
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,920
I told myself to find my way to survive.

71
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,660
That's what I thought.

72
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,100
Is that...

73
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,090
all?

74
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,710
Yes.

75
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,310
Watch over PSS Agent Lee Cha Young closely.

76
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,150
I am positive that she is after the copy that Shin Gyu Joon has.

77
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,980
How did it go?

78
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,290
On the date of the South-North Economic Collaboration Conference,

79
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,120
I found out that they had deposited money somewhere.

80
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,980
100 million dollars were transferred to the account.

81
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,770
It was a bank in China.
<i>[Deposit Date: 1/28; China Woonnam Bank; $1M transferred]</i>

82
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,900
<i>[Deposit Date: 1/28; China Woonnam Bank; $100M transferred]</i>

83
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,940
<i>China Woonnam Bank $10 million transferred to NIS secret account</i>

84
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,470
When my father received 10 million dollars 16 years ago,

85
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,420
the account was with this bank as well.

86
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,140
There's no doubt they are plotting something here.

87
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,240
The deposit was 10 million dollars 16 years ago,

88
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,190
but it's 100 million dollars this time.

89
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,730
They're plotting something even more horrendous than the Yangjinri incident.

90
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,820
While Han Tae Kyeong was causing a ruckus, she slipped out.

91
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,770
We have to let the President know quickly.

92
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:12,160
The President already knows that CEO Kim Do Jin is preparing something.

93
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,830
Then, we need to do something about it.

94
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,320
Either ordering the Prosecutors to issue a search warrant to search Jaesin,

95
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,360
or summon CEO Kim Do Jin for interrogation.

96
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,530
Are you like this because you don't know 
 what kind of situation the President is in?

97
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,930
Right now,

98
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,100
there is nobody around the President.

99
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,060
Have you heard from the Chief Secre-

100
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,570
<i> What's important is timing</i>

101
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,300
Shall I summon the Chief Secretary?

102
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,650
No.

103
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,290
If not,

104
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,340
Shall I contact another chief?

105
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,100
No.

106
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,530
<i>If we don't emphasize the difference and do it like that,</i>

107
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,820
<i>then that is like just leaving it up to the conglomerates.</i>

108
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,650
<i>There has been a lot of criticism regarding organizations of conglomerates, especially this year.</i>

109
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,190
<i>That's right.</i>

110
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,700
<i>Welcome.</i>

111
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,960
<i>Hello.</i>

112
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,910
<i>Welcome.</i>

113
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,460
Are you okay?

114
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,000
<i>I heard that you've refrained from 
 going on personal outings recently.</i>

115
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,120
<i>I'm not sure what happened but,</i>

116
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,780
<i>if it's not an official outing,</i>

117
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,100
<i>staying outside for a long time is not safe.</i>

118
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,340
<i>Keeping the Escort Team Agents 
 far away is dangerous, too.</i>

119
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,020
<i>In order to respond to unexpected situations,</i>

120
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,920
<i>we should at least be allowed to be in your vicinity.</i>

121
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,890
<i>Also, please use the safety bell.</i>

122
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,460
<i>Even for my sake,</i>

123
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,980
<i>please reconsider it.</i>

124
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,610
<i>I did not become the President for you.</i>

125
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,060
Please summon the Chief Secretary.

126
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,350
I can't stay still like this.

127
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,440
People's lives could be in danger.

128
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,770
Lee Chul Gyu knew about it.

129
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,080
Are you okay?

130
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,610
<i>Do you never talk, or do you just hate talking to me?</i>

131
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,190
<i>Why are you cooperating with us?</i>

132
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,290
<i>Is it because of my father?</i>

133
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,490
<i>Because I have to stop it.</i>

134
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,320
<i>What do you mean?</i>

135
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,680
<i>I will tell the President directly when I see him personally.</i>

136
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,400
He said he had to stop it?

137
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,520
He definitely brought everything related 
 to the case when he escaped North Korea.

138
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,270
Whom Lee Cheol Gyu has contacted,

139
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,920
we need to trail his steps after he smuggled himself into this country.

140
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,120
Can you do that for me?

141
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,170
And you want to find out about Agent Lee Cha Yeong, right?

142
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,660
I saw her going there earlier.

143
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,490
Why on earth did Agent Lee Cha Yeong

144
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,640
go all the way there?

145
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,320
I'm going to find out.

146
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,470
What Cha Yeong is up to.

147
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,330
Why she betrayed the PSS.

148
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,360
I'm going to find out about all that.

149
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,520
As for you, please go find out about Lee Chul Gyu.

150

♫ <i>A ray of sunshine entered. </i>♫

151
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,480
♫<i> Because I shield my eyes from the bright sunshine, </i>♫

152

<i>♫ You slowly came to me, and held out your hand ♫ </i>

<i>♫ I'll stay by your side, I'll be with you ♫</i>

161
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,310
Why did you ask to meet at this time?

162
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,700
By any chance, did you change your mind?

163
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,950
This is the informal talks which were held last January.

164
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,160
It is the same as in 1998.

165
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,250
Back then, that meeting was also the starting point.

166
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,120
I don't know what you are saying.

167
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,540
What is CEO Kim Do Jin

168
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,450
currently up to?

169
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,040
Do you think it will be any different?

170
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,080
"I'm going to give up a little for the sake of a better life."

171
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:45,290
"I'm just going to close my eyes on such a thing like conscience. I will compromise just a little."

172
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,370
The result of all this was the Yangjinri case.

173
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,830
Don't go on the same path as I.

174
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,830
This is something too hard and painful to handle.

175
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,540
Please just stop right here.

176
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,950
We have to stop CEO Kim's plans.

177
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,290
I...

178
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,820
don't know what you are saying.

179
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,700
But, if...

180
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,120
there is really such a thing, the past is only the past.

181
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,830
Also you and I are different.

182
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,910
The problems you're worried about won't happen.

183
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,870
I guarantee it.

184
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:44,620
You're in the center of the plan and you think you can control anything, right?

185
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,660
You're wrong.

186
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,700
To Chairman Kim Do Jin, aside from himself, everyone is just

187
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,660
one of the pawns on the chess board.

188
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,040
<i> Confidential Document '98 </i>

189
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,660
Chief Economist Han wrote this?

190
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,080
That's right.

191
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,290
However, with only this document we lack adequate evidence to start a reinvestigation .

192
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,040
You're right. In this document,
 there is only circumstantial evidences.

193
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,330
The money flow materials are limited and the Department of Defense's material isn't here.

194
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,040
And on top of that, Chief Economist Han Ki Joon was a person involved in the Yangjinri incident.

195
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,050
The possibility that he created a false document is great.

196
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,540
With this amount of evidences, we won't even get a warrant.

197
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,000
Besides, the rival is Jaesin.

198
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Jaeshin Group Chairman Kim Do Jin, Byun Tae Young, head of the NIS, Representative Min Hyun Ki...

199
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,700
is it because you're afraid of the culprits indicated in that document?

200
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,180
Sunbaenim... it's nothing like that... 
-We were

201
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,580
going to have even the President of the Republic of Korea stand trial.

202
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,050
It's the same this time.

203
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,660
First, investigate thoroughly on the transaction details of the Department of Defense's borrowed-name bank accounts

204
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,570
described in here, and report back to me again!

<i>Forwarded Borrowed-Name Account 
614-08-00646</i>

207
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,610
This case...

208
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,200
I am going to reinvestigate it.

209
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,040
This is not for Chief Economist Han's document nor for you.

210
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,370
Simply, I didn't want to make people feel wronged under a false accusation because of my investigation.

211
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,640
You must be careful.

212
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,790
<i>"Jaesin Foundation Regular Meeting"</i>

Place: Jaesin Hotel Grand Hall</i>

00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,870
Special Prosecutor Choi Ji Hoon is going to start reinvestigating

215
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,120
with Han Ki Joon's document.

216
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,850
The Special Prosecutor is starting a reinvestigation,

217
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,080
and they will be doing a focused investigation on the Department of Defense's borrowed-name account.

<i> Chief Secretary Shin Kyu Jin </i>

219
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,830
This is Shin Kyu Jin.

220
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,330
I want to meet you for a moment.

221
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,870
Lee Cha Yeong? What about her?

222
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,950
Is Cha Yeong there or not?

223
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,830
She must be home. I didn't see her here.

224
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:46,540
The President has suspected something.

225
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,080
I know.

226
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,580
PSS Agent Han Tae Kyeong and that female Sergent

227
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,880
have found out that we sent 100 million dollars to the North.

228
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,700
Don't worry too much.

229
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,080
They didn't bring out strong evidence.

230
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,700
They only suspected that money was sent to the North.

231
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,620
They have no idea about

232
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,000
precisely when and what we are up to do.

233
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,540
Please, relax.

234
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,200
Our plans are carried out as planned, right?

235
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,360
There must not be another mistake like the Yangjinri case.

236
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,550
Of course. There won't be any civilian casualties.

237
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,170
And...

238
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,260
no one...

239
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,010
can stop us.

241
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,030
Cha Yeong! Lee Cha Yeong!

243
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,870
What?

244
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,120
You must tell the President...

245
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,130
<i>What do you have to tell me?</i>

246
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,600
<i>You were looking for the mail Chairman Kwon sent you, weren't you?</i>

247
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,910
<i>When mail is sent from the post office, the amount of the charge depends on the weight.</i>

248
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:51,260
<i>The charge for the mail Chairman Kwon sent you was 1930 won.</i>

249
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,200
<i>Full Rate: (immediate payment) $1.93</i>

250
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,510
<i>Looking at the receipts for the mail I sent before,</i>

251
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,500
<i>1,930 won</i>

252
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,110
<i>is the price which is charged when a document of more than 10 pages is sent.</i>

253
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:15,220
<i>However, inside Chairman Kwon's envelope</i>

254
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,690
<i>there was only one sheet of paper consisting of his will.</i>

255
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,740
<i>If he sent you a document with only his one page will,</i>

256
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,820
<i>the price wouldn't be 1,930 won</i>

257
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,880
<i>but around 620 won.</i>

258
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,400
<i>Chairman Kwon definitely sent you a document with more than 10 sheets of paper.</i>

259
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,410
<i>The exchange is impossible inside the post office.</i>

260
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:53,090
<i>So someone in the Blue House</i>

261
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,450
<i>snatched the mail that was sent to you.</i>

262
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,170
<i>Please organize the Special Investigation again.</i>

263
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,220
<i>If Chairman Kwon's mail was switched,</i>

264
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,280
<i>then Chairman Kwon's will is false.</i>

265
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,320
<i>We have to start the investigation from the beginning.</i>

266
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,120
<i>I know.</i>

267
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,150
<i>I also know who took the document.</i>

268
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:29,530
<i>Chief Secretary Shin Kyu Jin has it.</i>

269
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,840
<i>But why...</i>

270
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,030
<i>Why up until now...</i>

271
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,470
<i>Get the search warrant right away...</i>

272
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,100
<i>The minute we get the search warrant Chief Secretary Shin Kyu Jin</i>

273
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,770
<i>will make that document disappear.</i>

274
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,820
<i>It's not just the warrant.</i>

275
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,030
<i>The moment he suspects that I'm looking for the document,</i>

276
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,360
<i>it will be gone.</i>

277
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,150
<i>That document is, just as you said,</i>

278
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,970
<i>as light as 1,930 wons.</i>

279
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:10,200
<i>Whether it gets burned or torn up, it's too easy to make it disappear.</i>

280
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,430
<i>So, we cannot get a warrant.</i>

281
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,240
<i>We have to manage it so that Secretary Shin</i>

282
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,830
<i>relinquishes it himself.</i>

283
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,530
Lee Cha Yeong! What do you mean?

284
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,260
Lee Cha Yeong!

285
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,910
Cha Yeong

286
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,980
Come back to your senses, Cha Yeong... Lee Cha Yeong!

287
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,940
Cha Yeong!

288
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,670
Come back to your senses... Lee Cha Yeong!

289
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,380
<i>I will do it.</i>

290
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,250
<i>I am the one who found Chairman Kwon's mail receipt.</i>

291
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,540
<i>But I missed it.</i>

292
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,550
<i>I will find it by any means necessary.</i>

293
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,050
<i>No.</i>

294
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,850
<i>This is my responsibility.</i>

295
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,020
<i>I also am a PSS Agent.</i>

296
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,970
<i>I... </i>

297
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,910
<i>It's my duty to protect you as well.</i>

298
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,210
<i>Please give me a chance </i>

299
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,880
<i>to make up for my mistake. </i>

00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,420
Yes, sir.

303
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,700
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

304
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,650
<i>The mail that Chairman Kwon Jae Yun sent to the President,</i>

305
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,570
<i>was swapped inside the Blue House.</i>

00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,660
<i>The result I got after investigating the 
people who can touch the mail,</i>

307
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,340
<i>the culprit,</i>

308
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,870
<i>was a female employee who was sorting the mail.</i>

309
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,930
<i>It was an order from,</i>

310
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,290
<i>Chief Secretary Shin Kyu Jin, right?</i>

311
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,790
<i>I believe you.</i>

312
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,250
<i>I don't think you are someone who would do such a thing</i>

313
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,600
<i>without a reason.</i>

314
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,510
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

315
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,100
<i>Agent Lee.</i>

316
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,960
<i>You know it as well.</i>

317
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,730
<i>The document Chairman Kwon sent to President Lee</i>

318
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,940
<i>is a fabricated document that can cover up the crimes the President commited</i>

319
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:03,540
<i>in the Yangjinri case.</i>

320
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:10,280
<i>I've been President Lee Dong Hwi's political partner.</i>

321
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,470
<i>But . . . that's not right, is it?</i>

322
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,420
<i>I thought someone had to stop this.</i>

323
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,130
<i>Can you go along with me,</i>

324
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,010
<i>Agent Lee Cha Yeong?</i>

325
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,740
<i>It was the same with today's press conference.</i>

326
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,910
<i>At the press conference, President Lee Dong Hwi,</i>

327
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,020
<i>is trying to deny his crimes.</i>

<i>What</i>

329
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,250
<i>is it that I have to do?</i>

330
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,160
Perform CPR.

331
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,890
Yes.

332
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,670
<i>Is Agent Lee Cha Yeong a person we can trust?</i>

333
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,070
200 joules charged and ready.

334
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,430
Okay.

335
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,860
One, two, three.

336
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,090
One, two, three.

337
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,950
One, two, three.

338
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,800
<i>I have to tell the President</i>

339
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,030
<i>Lee Cha Yeong, what do you mean?</i>

340
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,850
<i>It wasn't a copy.</i>

341
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,610
<i>The Chief Secretary</i>

00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,220
<i>You have to find</i>

<i>Chief Secretary Shin Kyu Jin.</i>

344
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,950
<i>You have to find him.</i>

345
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:29,200
Like you said, the woman PSS agent

346
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,140
discovered this in Secretary Shin Kyu Jin's car.

347
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,630
I looked into it, and it wasn't a copy.

348
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,380
What are you doing, right now?

349
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,160
Stop it!

350
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,080
Stop.

351
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,660
Agent Han Tae Kyeong...

352
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,490
Han Tae Kyeong, what are you doing now?

353
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,990
I'm doing

354
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,100
what the President isn't able to do.

355
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,630
Han Tae Kyeong!

356
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,170
Will you leave us alone for a moment?

357
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,290
But...

358
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,470
Just for a moment.

359
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,370
Is this

360
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,630
the way you do things, Han Tae Kyeong?

361
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,890
Yes.

362
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,220
This is the fastest way to find what I'm looking for.

363
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:57,060
There aren't any manners that I need to maintain.

364
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,340
Why didn't you tell me that Secretary Shin

365
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:07,320
had a back-copy of the Confidential Document 98?

366
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,040
Now Agent Lee Cha Yeong

367
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,080
is in a coma.

368
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,160
They can't guarantee that she'll live.

369
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,530
Why did you allow her to do something like that

370
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,570
knowing how dangerous it was?

371
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,120
What on earth did you tell her?

372
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,500
<i>I will do it. </i>

373
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,240
<i>Just tell me what to do.</i>

374
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,390
<i>Chief Secretary Shin Kyu Jin</i>

375
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,850
<i>doesn't have a very trusting personality.</i>

376
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,770
<i>This is a secret only between us.</i>

377
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,830
<i>If you don't do</i>

378
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:08,320
<i>everything in your power, he's not going to trust you.</i>

379
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:17,070
<i>Undoubtedly, he's keeping it where he can always see it.</i>

380
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,350
<i>Since he's such a viscous workaholic, he hardly ever goes home,</i>

381
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:24,560
<i>it's a great possibility that it's in his office.</i>

382
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,910
<i>Perhaps, Confidential Document '98...</i>

383
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,980
<i>Chief Secretary Shin Kyu Jin's car key.</i>

384
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,320
<i>Jaesin Hotel...</i>

385
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:01,230
<i>Before Chief Secretary Shin Kyu Jin hands over the 
Confidential Document '98 to Chairman Kim Do Jin, I must find it.</i>

386
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:35,050
<i>However, the danger will follow you.</i>

387
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,450
I needed that document.

388
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:49,460
Because I have to stop Chairman Kim Do Jin.

389
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,780
You're still,

390
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,920
the President of the Republic of Korea.

391
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,200
But, why can't you do anything?

392
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,890
They are killing several tens of people,

393
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,550
and they even tried to kill the President.

394
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:09,460
But, why can't you do anything?

395
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,220
By doing this, what is going to change?

396
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,610
By doing this,

397
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,550
will the document that your father risked his life to create

398
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,650
come back?

399
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,250
Do people who died come back?

400
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,240
Even if the opponent cheats,

401
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,580
I can't do that.

402
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:15,390
Even if the opponent holds a knife and randomly shoots a machine gun,

403
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:18,900
I have to die while fighting barehanded.

404
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:26,270
Because I'm the President of this country who swore 
to protect the law and uphold justice.

405
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,030
100 million dollars have been deposited.

406
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:47,910
100 million dollars have been deposited,

407
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:50,180
to that bank account from 16 years ago.

408
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,190
Something even more heinous will happen, than back then.

409
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,640
The back up copy that the Chief Secretary has,

410
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,810
may not be in the form of a paper document.

411
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:41,600
<i>3. Document... Date: 3/8... 18 pages... Stored in: USB</i>

412
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,940
It's on a USB.

413
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,970
He stored

414
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,450
the back-up copy on a USB.

415
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,450
<i>Lee Chul Gyu...</i>

416
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,650
<i>the place he came to, Daeseungri.</i>

417
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:51,290
<i>Lee Chul Gyu? Why do you keep coming and asking 
about someone who's dead?</i>

418
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,480
<i>Exactly, where was he going?</i>

419
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:29,790
<i>The place he's looking far ahead... what's over there?</i>

420
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,100
<i>Could it be...</i>

421
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,550
<i>is he plotting something?</i>

422
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,460
What are you talking about?

423
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:10,660
After Lee Chul Gyu defected to Korea, he came to a village called Daeseungri which is located in the East Coast.

424
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,120
The location is similar to Yangjinri.

425
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,370
Perhaps, could this be related to the 100 million dollars 
that was given to North Korea?

426
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,320
Did you say Daeseungri on the East Coast?

427
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:26,610
We have to stop Chairman Kim Do Joon.

428
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:30,740
We need to find Chief Secretary Shin Kyu Jin's USB.

429
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:57,810
One of my belongings is with you, Chief Secretary.

430
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

431
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:32,440
You kept it in a place where you can always watch it.

432
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,270
Inside the wallet that you always carry around.

433
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,990
I am sincerely thankful

434
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,220
that you have worked for me.

435
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,120
And... from this moment on,

436
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,960
you are relieved from the office of the Chief Secretary.

437
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,150
Yes, this is Choi...

438
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:17,450
Are you serious?

439
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:25,410
Are you talking about the back up copy that the 
Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon sent to the President?

440
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:30,860
It's stored in an USB but because it's locked with a 
security program, I can't email it to you.

441
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,900
I'll personally bring it to your office.

442
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,760
Yes.

443
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,020
I understand.

444
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,820
I'll be waiting for you.

445
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,440
I'll take it to him.

446
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,310
The original has been burnt, 
and Lee Chul Gyu is dead.

447
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:09,610
That is the last piece of evidence that could stop 
Chairman Kim Do Joon.

448
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,760
I am going to go personally. Please go back.

449
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,120
Then, I will escort you together.

450
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,280
Agent Han Tae Kyeong is no longer

451
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,240
an employee of the PSS.

452
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,540
Did her condition take a turn for the better?

453
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,350
We are monitoring her.

454
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,000
The morning has come in on March 12th.

455
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,320
At the National Assembly Floor at 9 a.m.

456
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:04,970
the voting will begin regarding the impeachment of President Lee Dong Hui.

457
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,870
Ask Representative Min Young Ki to see if the preparation for voting for the impeachment is going well.

458
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:19,840
More than that, I received a call from the Special Prosecutor.

459
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,510
President Lee Dong Hui is coming to the Special Prosecutor's office with

460
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:26,250
the back up copy of Confidential Document '98.

461
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,050
What are you talking about?

462
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,010
The back up copy of the Confidential Document is 
still out there?

463
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:39,550
I will stop it by using any means,

464
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,990
just focus on the voting for the impeachment.

465
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,240
There are 7 minutes left till the destination.

466
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,490
Turn the car around.

467
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:35,610
What?

468
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:40,020
The car... turn it around!

469
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,170
He hasn't come to the Special Prosecutor's office yet.

470
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,630
Performance Team 2. Han Tae Kyeong.

471
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:33,080
Yes, what?
-Exactly, where are you going right now? The Special Prosecutor's office is the opposite direction.

472
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,450
The Director just called to say,

473
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:38,020
that the VIP has changed the destination.

474
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,890
What are you talking about?
 Where are you going to?

475
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:42,470
Jaesin Group's headquarters.

476
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,340
The head vehicle... get the car on the right.

477
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,700
You have a guest.

478
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,150
Hold on.
Why are you doing this?

479
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,740
Why on earth are you doing this?
Why?

480
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:17,650
Move!
-Han Tae Kyeong, stop it.

481
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,950
MOVE!

482
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:23,140
Stop it and go back!

483
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,380
Have a seat.

484
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,700
What are you doing... here?

485
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,820
I've found the Confidential Document that the Chief Economist Han Ki Joon left behind.

486
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,650
It's in my hands.

487
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:03,850
You said that the deal can only be made when
 I have something to give?

488
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,920
What is it that you want?

489
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,980
Please stop the impeachment.

490
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,760
I've lost,

491
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,260
and you won.

492
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,160
Yangjinri incident... I'll cover up,

493
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:24,190
all of it.

494
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:34,390
March 10th, 8:15 AM
35 hours and 15 minutes after the impeachment was presented

495
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:54,140
<i>Why are you so late? Where is the back up copy?
Where is the evidence?</i>

496
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,560
<i>Postpone the impeachment.</i>

497
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,710
<i>I can't trust the President.</i>

498
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,700
<i> Jaesin has stolen the dynamite. </i>

499
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,090
<i>Where they went with that after is more important.</i>

500
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:05,260
We need to find out where they went and where the target is.

501
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:10,980
If I stop the impeachment...
-Then I will return to being your loyal dog.
