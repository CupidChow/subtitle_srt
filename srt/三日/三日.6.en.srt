00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,080
<i> March 7, 5:30 am, 33 hours and 30 minutes after the sniping. </i>

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,960
<i>Episode 6</i>

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>I heard that the tennis court gates were 
shut during the sniping incident. Is that right?</i>

5
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,820
<i>When a woman sprints, 7 minutes.
But if it was the Chief, 5 minutes.</i>

6
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,220
<i>But being out of breath this much after sprinting,</i>

7
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,620
It is impossible to shoot.

8
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,360
<i>The power outage and the shooting were almost concurrent. 
Then that means...</i>

9
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,680
<i>The one who sniped was the Chief,
 but the opening of the tennis court gate</i>

10
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,840
<i>was done by another person.</i>

11
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,130
Inside the PSS...

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,960
There is an accomplice.

13
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,780
You said that they are currently investigating who is behind the sniping incident, right?

14
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,660
Yes.

15
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,920
Exclude all of the NIS and Police Intelligence Teams (from the investigation team).

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,410
Out of the Prosecutors, 
create a new list of trustworthy personnel,

17
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,460
and as much as possible, comprise the list 
out of the ones who were left out earlier.

18
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,800
I understand.

19
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,610
Like you said, I hope you will 
completely reveal the instigator.

20
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,650
Yes.

21
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,520
<i> The phone that you are trying to reach is not available </i>

22
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,860
<i>This phone could not be connected...</i>

23
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,270
Cell phones don't get reception around the VIP.

24
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,800
Ah, I forgot about it again.

25
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,060
<i> The phone that you're trying to reach...</i>

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,500
Quickly pick up the phone.

27
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,130
<i>Are the North Korean spies here, then?</i>

28
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,950
<i>All we have to do is what we were trained to do. Alright?</i>

29
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,120
<i>Yes.</i>

30
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,670
3001 Elevator malfunctioning. 
The elevator will stop on the third floor.

31
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,930
The third floor! Hurry!

32
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,800
Escort the VIP!

33
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Go!

34
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,910
Don't go! Let go of me!

35
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,650
Don't leave!

36
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,070
Let go please.

37
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,260
Let go of me please! Let go!

38
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,820
Let me go!!! I said let me go!!!

39
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,420
I'm going to to kill them all!!!

40
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,600
Agent Hwang Yoon Jae was arrested at the scene.

41
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,990
The President went back to the Blue House.

42
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,150
Hwang Yoon Jae won't easily open his mouth.

43
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,440
Of course he won't easily open his mouth.

44
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,330
But, if he finds out that he id 
being used... The story will be different.

45
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,270
<i>Hwang Yoon Jae Sunbae</i>

46
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,570
<i>has been arrested.</i>

47
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,050
<i>Good work.</i>

<i>The 1998 Yangjinri Case has turned Korea's morning upside down.</i>

50
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,860
<i>This morning, after hearing the announcement of the Special Prosecutor, who was investing Mobi Asset Management,</i>

51
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,120
<i>the citizens of this nation cannot hide their bewilderment.</i>

52
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,570
<i>An internet site for impeachment of President Lee Dong Hwi has already been created.</i>

53
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,890
<i>The public is infuriated.</i>

54
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,500
<i>Is it only me who wishes that it was not true?</i>

55
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,150
<i>In order to stop further chaos,</i>

56
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,700
<i>we need President Lee Dong Hwi to state his position publicly.</i>

57
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,060
<i>True punishment!</i>

58
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,650
Investigate the truth!

59
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,280
Punish the person who's responsible!

60
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,830
Investigate the truth!

61
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,870
Punish the person who's responsible! 
Investigate the truth!

62
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,870
Punish the person who's responsible! 
Investigate the truth!

63
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,280
To the family whose members have died,

64
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,850
Apologize!

65
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,240
Apologize! Apologize!

66
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,660
You people!

67
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,310
I have the right to know why my son died, right?

68
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,370
Apologize to the citizens of the nation!

69
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,700
Apologize! Apologize!

70
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,230
President Lee Dong Hwi needs to apologize!

71
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,510
Apologize! Apologize!

72
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,260
Ask the President to come out!!

73
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,060
Come out! Come out!

74
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,350
Found an obstacle at 30m ahead. 
Make a right at 20m ahead.

75
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,280
That's the President!!

76
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,630
The President!

77
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,690
Security! Control the crowd and keep our formation!

78
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,470
I said let me go!

79
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,710
Get out of the car!

80
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,630
You've arrived.

81
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,980
What's the current situation?

82
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,000
The sentiment in our party isn't good.

83
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,210
People are thinking about expulsion.

84
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,370
We don't even need to talk about how bad the opposition side is.

85
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,490
The President must make a public statement quickly. We need to control the public sentiment before it gets even worse.

86
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,750
No, you mustn't.

87
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,460
Through the NIS and other intelligence services, 
we're trying to gather material to counter this but...

88
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,420
We don't have enough information yet.

89
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,320
If you announce an official statement 
right now, it might do more harm to us than good.

90
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,810
Prepare for a press conference.

91
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,140
But...without any preparations...

92
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,870
I don't need any preparation to counter attack. 
Just set up a press conference...

93
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,970
As soon as possible.

94
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,770
The Blue House is having an emergency press conference.

95
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,950
<i>There is a breaking news.</i>

96
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,350
<i>In a short while, the Blue House will hold an emergency press conference.</i>

97
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,850
Everyone is wondering if the information they will present will be big enough to overturn the Special Prosecution's report.

98
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,730
<i>The whole public's attention is focused on the Blue House.</i>

99
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,600
<i>The Blue House's emergency press conference,</i>

100
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,130
will start now.

101
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,410
Is the relationship between Falcon and President Lee Dong Hwi true?

102
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,770
What is the truth behind Yangjinri case?

103
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,850
Because of the announcement last night of the Special Prosecutor's Investigation Results,

104
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,800
we apologize that we caused concern to the citizens.

105
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,810
What did the President say?

106
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,330
Did he admit to all of it?

107
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:04,940
The President asked the Prosecutors to do a thorough investigation

108
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:10,950
and said that he will actively cooperate with any investigation.

109
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,350
And also,

110
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,350
for last night's crucial incident,

111
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,230
the law and justice must be preserved.

112
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,400
Last night, on March 5,

113
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,790
at the President's private residence in Choongsoodae,

114
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:36,150
against the supreme sovereignty of 
the Republic of Korea and its military,

115
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,650
there was an attempted assassination

116
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,810
of the President of the Republic of Korea.

117
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:48,310
On March 5th, at 20.00 hours, installed by the assassins,

118
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,600
a material suspected of as being an EMP bomb exploded.

119
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,950
As a result, within 15 kilometers around Cheongsoodae,

120
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,040
there was a large scale blackout and every electronic device stopped functioning completely.

121
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,350
<i>Immediately after, during the ensuing chaos, 
there were three shots fired.</i>

122
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,350
<i>And because of this, two bodyguards got killed at the scene.</i>

123
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,770
<i>A Cheongsoodae staff who was with them also died.</i>

124
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,400
<i>Up to now, 3 people are confirmed dead,</i>

125
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,910
<i>and about 30 were wounded.</i>

126
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,230
<i>They used something that even a terrorist group like Al Qaeda would have difficult time obtaining.</i>

127
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,840
<i>They used a cutting edge EMP bomb</i>

128
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,310
<i>and they thoroughly organized and planned the sniping.</i>

129
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:42,650
<i>This is the first assassination through terror within the history of the Republic of Korea.</i>

130
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:51,040
<i>It is a significant incident that has greatly 
threatened the security and respected image of ROK.</i>

131
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,410
Due to this,

132
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,650
the Blue House, the Prosecution, the police,

133
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,250
and other professional services
 will form a special investigation team.

134
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:07,230
We promise that we will find out who is behind this. 
And we promise this to the citizens of Korea.

135
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,050
What about the President? Is the President safe?

136
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,520
Although he suffered severe injuries, he is safe.

137
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,560
Has the suspect been found?

138
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,900
Of the snipers, one got killed and the other one got arrested at the scene.

139
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:26,150
Shocking news that there was an assassination attempt last night on President Lee Dong Hwi at Cheongsoodae

140
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,350
was revealed at an emergency press conference.

141
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,150
Last night there was an assassination attempt that...

142
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,190
We just heard that last night happened...

<i> I will say it once more, </i>

150

<i>Last night in Cheongsoodae there was a sniping attempt aimed at President Lee Dong Hwi.</i>

151
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,150
<i> This was revealed at a press conference by the Chief Secretary Shin Kyu Jin. </i>

152
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:11,310
<i>This incident was the first assassination and terror 
attempt within the constitutional history of ROK.</i>

<i>They said that the submarine broke down, 
leaving them with no choice but to land.</i>

158
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:25,540
<i> They were surprised on their own and got scared and created this unexpected accident.</i>

159
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,620
<i>It was a misunderstanding! They got scared and shot each other on their own. Do I need to be responsible for that?! </i>

00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,550
<i>I am going directly to the police station.</i>

<i> Don't you want to stop these kind of things? </i>

165
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:18,060
<i>Because we have no power, having to follow the orders of the big and strong countries and giving them what they want...</i>

166
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,600
<i>Then if that's not enough, taking things from 
the poor people and treating them unfairly!</i>

167
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,940
<i>Because you don't like those things!</i>

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,230
<i>Please believe me.</i>

171
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,100
<i>It was really an accident.</i>

172
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,520
<i>It was beyond my calculations.</i>

173
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,590
<i>Are you going to dwell on those things... 
and be deprived of your future?</i>

174
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,400
<i>I will help.</i>

175
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,980
<i>Become the owner of the Blue House.</i>

176
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,520
<i>And change the future.</i>

177
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,600
Like you said, I will make corrections.

178
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,020
With whatever means it takes.

179
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,950
I will correct the wrong choice I made back then.

180
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,020
We have finished staffing of the Special Investigation Unit.

181
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,300
The main members of the Special Investigation Unit will be Seoul Central District Prosecution Office's

182
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,240
Prosecutor Goo Ja Gwang as the leader

183
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,730
the Special Investigation Team.

184
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,450
Send people down to Cheongsoodae to secure the place 
and send the criminal investigator.

185
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,400
<i>From the police department, 
Seoul Department's Chief of Security</i>

186
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,590
<i>and his officers; from the Blue House, the Chief of Civilian Rule,</i>

187
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,120
<i>PSS, Security, and Legal Affairs.</i>

188
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,310
Finding out the source of the EMP is top priority.

189
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,440
Currently, the Security Team of the Blue House
 has gathered information

190
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,270
of all the military bases and companies that own EMP bombs.

191
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,980
The Analysis Team consists of Seojin University's Professor Kim Soo Byeong and other opposition personnel.

192
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,560
The police investigation team which 
has been in charge of the case, and

193
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,050
the National Intelligence Service have been eliminated
 from the Special Investigation Team.

194
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,310
There is no one from our side on the Special Investigation Team.

195
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,170
What are you going to do about that?!

196
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:19,830
Anyway, Han Bong Soo will be the one who will bear all the blame on the assassination case.

197
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,100
You intended to use him as the scapegoat from the beginning, didn't you?

198
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:30,560
Han Bong Soo and Hwang Yun Jae will be revealed as the only culprits in the results of the investigation.

199
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,310
There is one other witness.

200
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,520
A witness who personally saw the EMP bomb go off.

201
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,350
Who is it?

202
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,060
It's Police Sergeant Constable Yoon Bo Won
 of Seojo Department.

203
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:48,980
However, the source of the EMP bomb should never be revealed.

204
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,310
Where were you out and about all night that you've come now?

205
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,400
I couldn't sleep last night,

206
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,560
fixing the phone lines, 
and replacing light bulbs throughout the town,

207
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,070
don't you feel sorry for this Sergeant Constable Yoon?

208
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,740
Aigoo. Your body is suffering 
because the cellphone doesn't work.

209
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,680
-Police Sergeant Constable Yoon. Go to the precinct.
-Why?

210
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,390
You know that car accident earlier that you've been after?

211
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,060
An eyewitness called.

212
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,640
Hold on.
Take this call.

213
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,620
Yes. This is Yoon Bo Won from the Suhsuhbon Precinct.

214
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,800
<i>I am an eyewitness of the car accident that 
occurred on March 2nd on Highway 17.</i>

215
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,300
<i>The scene of the car accident was
 recorded in my car's black box.</i>

216
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,130
In the black box image?

217
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,870
Where are you?
I'll go there myself.

218
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,840
Yes.

219
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,950
Are you talking about the suspect,
 Hwang Yoon Jae?

220
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,930
Yes. 
The transfer order has been issued.

221
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,890
You are the Special Prosecutor, Choi Ji Woon, right?

222
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,670
-Are you one of the Special Investigation staff?
-Why are you here?

223
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,990
I came because of the accomplice, arrested for President's sniping incident,

224
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,290
the PSS Agent Hwang Yoon Jae.

225
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,300
The special investigation comes first.
You should come back another time.

226
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,860
What did he say the motive was?

227
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,300
The Chief of the PSS Han Bong Soo and the PSS Agent Hwang Yoon Jae,

228
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,470
were both survivors of the Special Forces Brigade
 of the Yangjinri incident.

229
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,790
Why and for what reason, would those people

230
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,150
try to snipe the President?

231
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,760
The Republic of South Korea's President
 was sniped at.

232
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,720
For me, rather than the reason,

233
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,310
it's more important to clarify 
the full account of the incident.

234
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,340
I'll call you once the special investigation is complete.
At that time...

235
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,630
Hold on.

236
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,850
Han Tae Kyeong!

237
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,630
Han Tae Kyeong!

238
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,080
<i>Han Tae Kyeong!</i>

239
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,510
<i>Han Tae Kyeong!
(Confidential Document '98)</i>

240
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,730
Who is it?
Who is the person who gave this to the Chief?

241
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,330
-Who is it?
-It's not important who the person is.

242
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,570
What's important is the
 truth that's written in here.

243
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,590
Tae Kyeong. Open the door.

244
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,240
Of all the times, why is it now?

245
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,700
It's a secret, that was wrapped up so well, 
that no one knew about it for 16 years.

246
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,670
But why of all times, now?

247
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,340
Was it given to the Chief?

248
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,240
What did they tell him when they gave it to him?

249
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,200
Did they say the President should be killed?

250
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,550
Did that person, to kill the President,

251
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,310
possibly use

252
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,940
the Chief and you?

253
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,090
You. 
 Are you protecting this because your father was involved?

254
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,320
Stop it, Han Tae Kyeong.
Han Tae Kyeong!

255
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,810
I killed the Chief.

256
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:26,340
With my hand, 
I pulled the trigger,

257
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,830
and with my hand, killed the Chief.

258
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,930
But, if the Chief was used by someone,

259
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,880
and if the Chief's death was a sacrifice,

260
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,260
what did I do?

261
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,030
What on earth did I do?

262
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,210
So, so... please answer me.

263
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,950
Who gave it to him?

264
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,310
Hold on.
Please hold on.

265
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,690
Lee Cha Yeong!
Lee Cha Yeong, I'm not done yet!

266
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,300
Lee Cha Yeong!

267
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,500
<i>The forces that undermine our country,
Punish them immediately</i>

268
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,090
<i>Punish the assassin!
Give him death sentence!</i>

269
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,680
In front of the provincial precinct office where the suspect of 
the President's shooting is being investigated,

270
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,980
the Korean Alliance continues to gather,

271
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,650
asking to punish severely the culprit of this incident.

272
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,560
In the Internet portal sites, 
people are asking to reveal the sniper's profile

273
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:01,010
and the true nature of the incident.

274
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,280
He's coming out.
Let's go!

275
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,510
<i>-Are you a suspect in the President's sniping?
-What is the reason?</i>

276
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,380
Were you instigated by someone 
or was it your personal grudge?

277
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,510
Let's continue moving.

278
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,960
<i>Are there other accomplices in this incident?</i>

279
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,740
<i>-Please say something.</i>
-<i>Please move.</i>

280
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,760
Block him. Block!

281
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,220
<i>Do you acknowledge that you're the culprit?</i>

282
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,270
<i>In a place where a lot of people gather,</i>

283
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,230
<i>the most important part you need to watch is a hand.</i>

284
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,610
<i>Whether you throw a bomb,</i>

285
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,630
<i>whether you take out a knife,
whether you load the gun,</i>

286
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,880
<i>the start of every movement is your hand.</i>

287
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,060
<i>Watch the hands carefully.</i>

288
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,800
-Lee Cha Yeong! Block him! 
-What?

289
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,110
It's a knife!
Someone has a knife!

290
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,830
Hurry! 
Block him!

291
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,600
-Block him!
-Move.

292
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,510
Move!

293
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,290
Move!

294
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,490
No.

295
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,610
No, no, no, no!

296
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,810
119!

297
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,060
Don't die.
Don't die!

298
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,220
No matter what, don't die!
You can't die! You can't die!

299
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,190
What are you doing?
Hurry and call 119!

300
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,850
Don't die. Don't die!
Hwang Yoon Jae. You can't!

301
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:38,120
No! You can't die!

302
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,460
I got rid of the target.
What about you?

303
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,810
It'll end soon here, too.

304
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,430
They're killing the witnesses.

305
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,390
Police Sergeant Constable Yoon Bo Won.

306
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,210
Did you summon Police Sergeant Constable
 Yoon Bo Won?

307
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,580
The staff at the Prosecutor's office went down.

308
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,940
Well, I know Police Sergeant Constable Yoon's cellphone number.

309
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,880
But it's been dead since yesterday!

310
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Yes. Police Sergeant Constable 
Yoon Bo Won can't be found.

311
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,140
Yes. She left after receiving a call 
about an hour and a half ago.

312
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,220
She got a call from an eyewitness of the Chief Economist 
Han Ki Joon's car accident, and went out to meet him.

313
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,790
This is a trap.

314
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,040
The eyewitness we've looked so hard for,

315
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,740
couldn't have suddenly appeared.

316
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,830
You're right. 
This is a trap.

317
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,340
<i>Please come to #207 in Hall C of Grand Mall</i>

318
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,800
Aigo!

319
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,220
Are you alright? I'm sorry.

320
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,580
I'm fine.

321
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,830
Where is the elevator here?

322
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,680
Just go straight in this direction.

323
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,980
Ah

324
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,190
This building is 10,000 pyeong 
(approximately 356,000 square feet)

325
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,230
Hall B has a movie theater which means there are 
too many people in motion for someone to be killed.

326
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,680
It'll be Hall A or Hall C.

327
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,710
Let's split up and keep in contact.

328
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,220
Please follow me.

329
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,580
Why did you kill my father?

330
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,890
Who is it? Who ordered you to kill my father?

331
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,910
Who is it?!

332
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,900
Han Tae Kyeong!

333
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,630
<i>Follow me</i>

334
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,940
Yoon Bo Won...

335
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,540
Snap out of it.

336
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,230
Yoon Bo Won. Come to your senses!

337
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,230
Stop! Stop right there!

338
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,640
Hey!

339
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,850
<i>Hurry and get him!</i>

340
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,320
Everything's been resolved.

341
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,660
Now . . .

342
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,940
Shall everyone go back to your position?

343
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
The preparation for the CEOs' meeting is finished.

344
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,250
Everyone's waiting for you.

345
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,320
<i>CEO of Jaeshin Force One
Kwon Yong Han</i>

346
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,810
Let's get started.

347
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,210
You lost the culprit right in front of your eyes.

348
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,040
Yes.

349
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,360
Is it okay that the protection provided for such
 an important witness is lacking so much?

350
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:11,050
<i>This is Lee Cha Yeong from Legal Affairs. Have you met with Sergeant Constable Yoon Bo Won of Seojo Department?</i>

351
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,390
<i>You have a new voice message. To listen, press the call key.</i>

352
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,860
<i>She went to meet the witness of Chief Economist Han Ki Joon's accident.</i>

353
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,660
<i>It's a trap.</i>

354
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,540
<i>There's no way a witness we searched
 so much for would show up like that.</i>

355
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,580
<i>You're right. It's a trap.</i>

356
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,580
<i>A call came from a witness of your father's accident.</i>

357
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,600
<i>He said to meet at Grand Mall near Seoul.</i>

358
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,150
<i>I don't have a good feeling about this,</i>

359
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:57,060
<i>but I am going, since it's a chance to catch the criminal.</i>

360
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,060
<i>PSS Agent, please come when you hear this message.</i>

361
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,280
So, what happened to the witness?

362
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,840
<i>The direction that we will take</i>

363
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,320
<i>and the plans for the development process</i>

364
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,290
<i>will be discussed.</i>

365
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,880
The witness...

366
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,150
is fine.

367
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,160
<i>Yoon Bo Won, wake up!</i>

368
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,900
<i>119</i>

369
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,620
<i>Are you alright?</i>

370
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,430
<i>What happened?</i>

371
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,890
You said there were letters on the EMP bomb?

372
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,940
Yes. The name started with F and O.

373
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,850
Is this it?

374
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,820
That's right.

375
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,740
What kind of company is this?

376
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,830
It's Jaeshin Group's military weapons laboratory, Force One.

377
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,410
<i>Search and Seizure Warrant</i>

378
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,830
<i>Concentrate on searching the Development Team
 and the Weapon Storage Facility.</i>

379
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,330
<i>Question everyone involved who gives voluntary consent.</i>

380
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:21,340
Kim Ki Beom and Kim Woo Yeong who have been untraceable until recently

381
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:26,380
died at the same place in a fire on the same day Chief Han Ki Joon died.

382
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:31,360
General Yang Dae Ho was also killed in his home.

383
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,420
On top of that, PSS Agent Hwang Yoon Jae also died.

384
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,610
People related to the 98' incident are dying one by one.

385
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,810
Is this all really a coincidence?

386
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,370
Is someone . . . is the President . . .

387
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:55,280
trying to get rid of evidence related to the '98 incident?

388
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:01,520
<i> I'm Han Ki Joon's son, who came to see you.</i>

389
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,270
<i>My father died because of that confidential document.</i>

390
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,610
<i>Exactly what's the content in there?!</i>

391
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,980
After investigating the hard disk
 we've confiscated from Force One,

392
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,240
currently there are 15 EMP bombs 
that have successfully been manufactured,

393
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,150
but there were only 11 of them at their weapon storage center.

394
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,130
According to the results from the Analysis Team, 
if the four EMP bombs that disappeared

395
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,960
went off at the height that 
Sergeant Constable Yoon Bo Won estimated,

396
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,620
they said that the effect will be close
 to the terror attack at Cheongsoodae.

397
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,490
Has the relationship between Force One 
and Ham Bong Soo, who was shot, been revealed?

398
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:57,950
All of the employees are pleading the right to remain silent.

399
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,510
How Han Bong Soo managed to get the EMP bombs,

400
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,870
we have to find that out.

401
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,430
To find that out,

402
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,150
we have to summon the one in charge of Force One.

403
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,640
<i>The Special Investigation Team is planning on 
summoning the CEO of Force One, Kwon Yong Han.</i>

404
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,710
<i>How do you want me to proceed?</i>

405
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,500
Tell him to talk.

406
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,350
Just like how it all happened.

407
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,000
Tell him to testify to the Special Investigation Team.

408
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,690
It's related to the attempted assassination of the President.

409
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,570
We need to cooperate as much as we can.

410
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,070
<i>I understand.</i>

411
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,330
<i>Are we switching to plan B?</i>

412
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,940
While investigating the origin of the EMP bombs,

413
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,910
soon we will be able to find the leader
 or accomplices of Han Bong Soo.

414
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,950
That's not what I want.

415
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,460
Plan B.

416
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,110
What will a mouse do when it is cornered?

417
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,550
It will want to grasp even a straw to try to survive.

418
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,030
That's what I'm waiting for.

419
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,130
If we give them the hay,

420
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,690
I will be able to gain what I really want.

421
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,430
I heard that there was a 
seizure and search warrant for Force One.

422
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,030
You don't have to worry.

423
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:40,940
I'm going to go there right now.

424
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,200
<i>No.</i>

425
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,130
I don't think it'd be good for us to meet right now.

426
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,740
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

427
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,950
It's me who pulled in Ham Bong Soo and Hwang Yoon Jae.

428
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:57,780
If you open your mouth, I'm the one who's going to get hurt.

429
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,730
Don't you..

430
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:02,680
trust me?

431
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,620
I'll call you back,

432
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,150
so wait until then.

433
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,140
What are you talking about?

434
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,930
Gaining what you want?

435
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,880
<i>Confidential Document 98'</i>

436
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,220
How are you feeling?

437
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,360
Keep it. You lived because of that.

438
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,390
<i>Lee Cha Yeong, she's at Hall C.</i>

439
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,480
You fractured your ribs.

440
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,340
Be careful from now on.

441
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:02,750
But... why are you here?

442
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,860
I'm protecting the witness.

443
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,550
You're an important witness.

444
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,280
Do you want water?

445
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,840
Did you catch the culprit?

446
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,180
What about that company, Force One?

447
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,460
Did you find out where the EMP bombs came from?

448
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,030
The Special Investigation Team will catch the culprit.

449
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,220
I'm fine, so you can go rest.

450
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,910
You rest.

451
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,500
It's my job to protect people.

452
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,960
You're tired, too.

453
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,030
For you, in a matter of a few days, there were many big incidents.

454
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,090
From what I heard earlier,

455
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:46,820
they said that your other sunbae passed away, too.

456
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,100
So don't die.

457
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,820
Rest.

458
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,700
What is it that you want to ask me?

459
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:59,590
You said this on the train last time.

460
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:03,040
That your father passed away because of that document.

461
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,960
Could you tell me

462
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,060
the reason why you think that way?

463
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:14,780
Why are you suddenly interested in that?

464
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,970
I told you that your father came to me.

465
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,560
He said this when we met.

466
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,990
<i>You want me to postpone the announcement 
of the result of the investigation?</i>

467
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:30,650
<i>The documents about the incident at Yangjinri aren't true.</i>

468
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,380
<i>How did you know that I have those documents?</i>

469
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,550
<i>I will prove that those documents are false.</i>

470
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:42,110
<i>So until then, please postpone your announcement.</i>

471
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:45,910
<i>You're saying the documents I have aren't true.</i>

472
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:51,020
<i>Then you're saying the fact that you, the Chief Economist Han Ki Joon, handed over that money to North Korea is false?</i>

473
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,030
<i>That the President is not involved in that incident?</i>

474
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,350
<i> No, that... </i>

475
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:58,130
<i>Are you trying to put external pressure on this investigation?</i>

476
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,680
<i>After postponing the announcement of the result,</i>

477
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,000
<i>you're saying that you're planning on
 tampering with evidence or what?</i>

478
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,340
<i> No... </i>

479
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,330
<i> That's not what I meant. </i>

480
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,430
<i> Then, </i>

481
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,660
<i> I hope we won't meet again like this. </i>

482
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:18,420
He said that the confidential document isn't true?

483
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,930
When you went to meet Agent Hwang Yoon Jae, 
you left this at the interrogation room.

484
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,640
This is the document that you had.

485
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,440
And this is what I obtained.

486
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:41,170
When I compared them, nothing was different.

487
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,460
You checked what was in there, right?

488
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,830
The secret fund that President Lee Dong Hwi 
created with Falcon's funds

489
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,570
was taken care of by Fund Manager Kim Woo Yeong.

490
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,430
That money was transferred to a borrowed-name bank account belonging to the National Intelligence Service.

491
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:57,940
Chief Economist Han Ki Joon delivered the money to the North.

492
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,140
One of the leaders of military strategy, Kim Ki Beom,

493
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,810
and Yang Dae Ho, who was in charge of the initial investigation,

494
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,350
manipulated the testimony of a captured policy official

495
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:12,220
and erased the evidence that proved 
that the North intentionally invaded.

496
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,190
From what I have investigated,

497
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,790
there were definite people and evidence 
to prove the validity of this document.

498
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,060
Even insiders at Falcon confirmed it for me.

499
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,590
I only believe what I see and hear.

500
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,220
So I did not believe your father's words.

501
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:34,070
But now I want to know.

502
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:39,250
What do you mean that 
 your father passed away because of the document?

503
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,060
There was a police officer who witnessed my father's accident.

504
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:47,650
According to that officer, my father had an envelope with "Confidencial Document 98'" written on it.

505
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,940
He said somebody was going after that.

506
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,080
That document was in your father's car?

507
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:05,280
But right after the accident,
 I heard that some unidentified men took it away.

508
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,950
Is the witness, the police officer, someone you can trust?

509
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:13,510
Yes. You can trust her.

510
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,970
In all crimes, the most important factor is motive.

511
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:22,040
If what that police officer said was true,

512
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,460
the most important factor of your father's case is

513
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,400
that confidential document that has disappeared.

514
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,530
Who, why, for what did they go after that document?

515
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,470
If it's a copy of what the Prosecution has

516
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:37,940
then they don't have a reason to go to such lengths 
to kill my father to obtain that document.

517
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,770
There's another possibility.

518
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,870
Another classified document which
 your father insisted existed.

519
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,100
<i>Confidential Document 98'</i>

520
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:03,610
It might be the evidence that these aren't true.

521
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,550
<i>Thank you for your cooperation with this investigation.</i>

522
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:15,180
The security of the nation is being threatened,

523
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,520
so, of course, I should cooperate.

524
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,480
Without going around the subject, 
I will ask you a few questions.

525
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,020
Where are the EMP bombs that aren't accounted for?

526
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,760
They were stolen.

527
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,390
We've actually found out that they were stolen yesterday, too.

528
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,580
So we were going to start our investigation.

529
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,370
Force One is a place that handles military weapons.

530
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:37,880
A place with greater security systems than the Blue House.

531
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,440
From there, you're saying that 
 newly developed weapons have been stolen?

532
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,360
The theft did not occur inside of Force One.

533
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,740
Internally, we've tested the powers of an EMP bomb,

534
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,300
but in mountain warfare,

535
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,750
we haven't been able to test it yet, so

536
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:58,090
en route to the demilitarized zone, 
they had been stolen.

537
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:00,080
Which base was it?

538
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,300
There's someone in charge, right?

539
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,160
The EMP is extremely new technology,

540
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,180
so it was an action taken

541
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,070
with the permission from the ROK Joint Chief of Staff.

542
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:15,950
The ultimate authority Chief of Staff Kwon Jae Yeon gave permission.

543
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,860
What are you going to do?

544
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:27,120
Are you going to reinvestigate my father's case?

545
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,220
Don't expect too much.

546
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,530
From what I've investigated up to now,

547
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:35,340
the document given by Chief Kwon Jae Yeon was accurate.

548
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:38,450
Chief... Kwon Jae Yeon?

549
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:40,990
The person who gave this file to the Special Prosecution

550
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,930
is Chief Kwon Jae Yeon?

551
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:53,000
<i> What's your reason for giving this to me? </i>

552
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,410
<i> The truth... should be revealed. </i>

553
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:02,970
Chief Kwon Jae Yeon was a leader of the 3rd Brigade of Special Forces that Han Bong Soo was a part of.

554
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:07,030
Finding something strange about 
the mission that led to his troop's death,

555
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,450
he continued to research on his own.

556
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,430
Did you research more about the theft of EMP bombs?

557
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:20,840
They're refusing to cooperate.

558
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,980
However, I found something else.

559
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,120
<i>Ham Bong Soo</i>

560
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,380
<i>Leader of the 3rd Brigade of Special Forces</i>

561
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,590
<i>Kwon Jae Yeon</i>

562
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,520
<i>Commander of the 3rd Brigade of Special Forces</i>

563
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,570
Chief Kwon Jae Yeon

564
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,950
was the commander of the 3rd Brigade of Special Forces
 that Ham Bong Soo was a part of?

565
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,640
Kwon Jae Yeon, Ham Bong Soo, and Hwang Yoon Jae
 who were all part of the same team

566
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,130
found out about the President's wrongful deeds

567
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,600
and planned together to steal the EMP bomb, is that it?

568
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,900
That... we should directly ask Chief Kwon Jae Yeon.

569
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:09,040
<i>Chief Kwon Jae Yeon...
 He was from the same brigade as </i>

570
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,570
<i>Chief of the PSS, Ham Bong Soo.</i>

571
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:20,090
<i>What kind of president you've been protecting until now</i>

572
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,050
<i>is inside.</i>

573
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,000
<i>Confidential Document 98'</i>

574
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,680
<i>98' Yangjinri Incident Report</i>

575
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,100
<i>A superior with the same pain whom he can trust.</i>

576
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,450
<i>No matter what the information was, 
someone who can believe it without a doubt.</i>

577
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:19,520
<i>Someone who can explain</i>

578
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,400
<i>my father's death to me.</i>

579
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:34,950
<i>After eliminating the target, we have to find and
 get rid of the original copy of the confidential document.</i>

580
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,930
Are you from the Blue House?

581
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,020
Yes, we're almost here.

582
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,040
First, we will dispatch guards around the Chief's surroundings.

583
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,180
Kwon Jae Yeon.

584
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,090
Let's go this way first.

585
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,630
Raise your hands.

586
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:40,300
Turn around.

587
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,840
Now!

588
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:12,020
<i> March 8, 05:20, 57 hours and 20 minutes after the sniping</i>

589
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,640
<i>Preview</i>

590
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,430
<i>Chief Kwon Jae Yeon has died?</i>

591
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:29,030
<i>Right before we arrived, someone else had killed him.</i>

592
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:30,540
<i>Did you find the original of Classifie Document 98'?</i>

593
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,120
<i>Confidential Document 98'?</i>

594
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,170
<i>If the truth is revealed, what will happen to you, President?</i>

595
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,820
<i>Sergeant Constable Yoon Bo Won asked you
 to manipulate the document on a case, correct?</i>

596
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,500
<i>She said that Agent Han Tae Kyeong asked her for a favor.</i>

597
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,650
<i>Sunbaenim, why are you doing this!</i>

598
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,450
<i>Make a compromise. That's politics.</i>

599
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:47,380
<i>I shook the hand of Chairman Kim Do Jin.</i>

600
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,910
<i>It's you. It's you who killed my father.</i>
