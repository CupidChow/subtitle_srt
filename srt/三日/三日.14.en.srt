The fire wall! President, the fire wall

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,700
The fire wall! He's at the fire wall!

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,280
<i>I've located the VIP. I've located the VIP.</i>

00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,260
<i>From the emergency exit, he is in the direction towards the N3 exit.</i>

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,700
<i>I've located the VIP.</i>

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,800
<i>Everyone to N3 exit. VIP is in danger!</i>

9
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,260
Okay.

<i>Agent Han Tae Kyeong.</i>

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>I am resigning from the Presidency as of this moment.</i>

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,700
<i>Please understand my decision.</i>

13
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,300
<i>It's what I started, so it's only right that I end it</i>

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,200
<i>No, you can't. 
I will protect you until the end.</i>

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:30,800
Today... the President... will die.

16
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,350
Are you okay?

17
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,970
As for me...

18
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,050
it will be all right.

19
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,990
This is Kim Do Jin.

20
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,760
What are you talking about?

21
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,890
What the hell do you

22
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,390
think you're doing?

23
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,320
CEO Kim Do Jin...

24
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,430
you're under arrest as a suspect in the Presidential sniping case.

25
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,930
Are you hurt anywhere?

26
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,220
I'm fine.

27
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,640
For making you worry...

28
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,620
I'm sorry.

29
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,260
I'm really sorry.

30
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,700
<i>Episode 14</i>

31
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,600
VIP is doing fine so go back now.

32
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,790
I have something to say to you.

33
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,140
You heard the report I gave you, right?

34
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,890
Did you create such a reckless situation knowing 
there would be danger of sniping?

35
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,930
Go back already.

36
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,750
How can you do this with the life of the President as collateral, without one word to me or

37
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,650
any other PSS Agents?

38
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,760
<i>Go back in.</i>

39
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,680
<i>Should we go back to the Blue House?</i>

40
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,760
<i>No, there is one more person I need to meet.</i>

41
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,870
<i>Resigning?</i>

42
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,860
<i>Isn't that an obvious sequence?</i>

43
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,260
<i>Until they vote for the new President, 
you'll have to be an acting president.</i>

44
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,320
<i>Prime Minister, please start the procedure.</i>

45
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,530
<i>Are you finished with all the preparation for an outing?</i>

46
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,540
<i>Do you really have to go out</i>

47
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,760
<i>today?</i>

48
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,640
<i>Can I ask why you're going to the movie theater?</i>

49
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,430
<i>I heard that you spoke with Chairman Kim Do Jin.</i>

50
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,220
<i>Are you going there to meet him?</i>

51
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,110
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

52
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,780
<i>Please cancel today's outing.</i>

53
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,820
<i>No, I can't cancel it.</i>

54
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,330
<i>I'm pleading with you. Please cancel it.</i>

55
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,200
<i>Then, I'll be going on my own.</i>

56
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,280
<i>Is this why you asked the Prime Minister to be an acting president?</i>

57
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,970
<i>To resign and go die.</i>

58
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,780
<i>Then how should I stop it?</i>

59
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,150
<i>Even after killing dozens of people and attempting to set off the bomb in Seoul,</i>

60
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,160
<i>what will stop the person against whom there still won't be issued </i>

61
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,720
<i>a single arrest warrant?</i>

62
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,640
<i>I want to do that too.</i>

63
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,640
<i>When I think of the things he did to Chief Ham Bong Soo 
and the PSS,</i>

64
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,460
<i>I want to stick that man in prison.</i>

65
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,990
<i>However, this isn't it.</i>

66
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,830
<i>If you die,</i>

67
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,760
<i>there will be a crisis in a war just as the 
Chairman Kim Do Jin wanted.</i>

68
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,080
<i>No. The evidence that </i>

69
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,250
<i>the one who killed me isn't North Korea, 
but a crazy man in Republic of Korea</i>

70
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,530
<i>is in here.</i>

71
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,760
<i>It's the phone conversation between Chairman Kim Do Jin and me.</i>

72
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,900
<i>Director, you're a person who's supposed to protect me.</i>

73
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,970
<i>Won't you be able to protect my wish as well?</i>

74
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,070
<i>Please.</i>

75
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,350
<i>I will protect your wish.</i>

76
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,350
<i>And I'll protect you as well.</i>

77
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,520
<i>I will prepare the SWAT team in absolute secrecy.</i>

78
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,140
<i>Sniper detected.</i>

79
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,640
<i>Kim Do Jin detected.</i>

80
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,180
<i>Okay.</i>

81
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:52,140
Please say something.

82
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,580
Who were you working with?

83
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,050
The evidence that you were trying to assassinate the President is clear.

84
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,930
The entire phone conversation you had with the President has been recorded,

85
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,350
and the body of the sniper and his gun have been confiscated.

86
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,390
It's best to just confess without a fight.

87
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,140
Other than this case, you are associated with multiple incidents, Chairman.

88
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,390
There is only one word I need to say.

89
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,430
Lawyer. Call him.

90
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,800
There are quite a number of those who want to meet with you.

91
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,010
You probably know well.

92
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,390
I'm finally able to meet you here.

93
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,760
There has been an addition to your charges.

94
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,300
Kidnapping and imprisonment of Agent Lee Cha Yeong.

95
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,360
Fortunately, Agent Lee Cha Yeong is fine.

96
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,390
Plus, she provided important testimony

97
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,140
regarding your assassination attempt.

98
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,500
<i>When I was trapped inside of Chairman Kim Do Jin's penthouse,</i>

99
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,970
<i>I heard him on the phone.</i>

100
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,970
<i>Ordering someone to watch President Lee Dong Hwi carefully.</i>

101
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,760
<i>Do you remember when he made that phone call?</i>

102
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,300
<i>I was imprisoned,</i>

103
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,600
<i>so I couldn't see the time.</i>

104
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,650
There is still someone left that's on your side at the Blue House, isn't there?

105
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,650
I am the chairman of Jaeshin Group.

106
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,720
That means there are many people who make their living through me.

107
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,850
Is it that strange that those people help me?

108
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,000
Are you asking to play word games with me?

109
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,300
Of course not.

110
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,360
These are the suspect's phone records.

111
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,450
I got a call saying that Agent Lee Cha Yeong has safely returned.

112
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:27,260
She has returned to the hospital, been treated, and is now resting.

113
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,260
Are you mad at me?

114
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,780
I am not.

115
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,930
If only you had told me about it earlier...

116
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,510
It was because I trust you.

117
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,130
If it was up to you, Agent Han Tae Kyeong, you would have never used such methods.

118
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,010
You would have jumped up and down to stop me. Like you're doing now.

119
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,550
If the bullet from the Counterterrorism Team missed even by a slight fraction, then Mr. President,

120
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,600
you could have died.

121
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,750
The bullet did not miss, and I am alive.

122
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,220
Also, Chairman Kim Do Jin has been arrested.

123
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,850
Agent Lee Cha Yeong is back, too.

124
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:15,030
Now, everything is over.

125
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,700
It's time for me to put everything down.

126
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,030
The prosecution team who was investigating the attempted assassination by Chairman Kim Do Jin

127
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:35,300
is requesting cooperation from the Blue House.

128
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,720
Agent Lee Cha Yeong testified after recovering her consciousness,

129
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,600
and she said that there was someone at the Blue House working for Chairman Kim Do Jin.

130
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,270
What happened?

131
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,970
This is the phone record of Chairman Kim Do Jin.

132
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,050
Not only today, but from before,

133
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,190
it looks like they were working together for a while. 
<i>Personal Secretary Office</i>

134
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,050
The phone that was used...

135
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,760
It's...

136
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,800
This one.

137
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,600
<i>02-741-8526</i>

138
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,600
Prosecutor, here you go.

139
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,600
Excuse me.

<i>Jaeshin Foundation Regular Meeting</i>

141
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,040
There might be others on Jaeshin's side.

142
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,100
I'll start a careful investigation to identify our staff.

143
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,850
No, it's fine.

144
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,760
The Director's words are right.

145
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,760
Tomorrow will be the end.

146
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,780
Schedule a media conference for the day after tomorrow.

147
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,550
I'm going to officially announce my resignation at 9AM.

148
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,220
Chairman Kim Do Jin has been arrested,

149
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,260
so the trial will be in your favor, Mr. President.

150
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,750
After seeing the result, you should--

151
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,260
But that's not going to erase what I've done.

152
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,150
Rather, because I'm only quitting now,

153
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,640
I've caused trouble to many people.

154
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,110
There's one last favor.

155
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,390
I should have gone a long time ago,

156
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,100
but there's a place I haven't been.

157
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,780
I've never been to that place before,

158
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,850
but it's a place that continually appeared in my dreams.

159
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,900
No one will welcome me, but I want to go at least once

160
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,890
and ask for forgiveness.

161
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,760
Do you mean Yangjinri?

162
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,990
Can you go with me?

163
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,440
Of course. We will escort you.

164
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:12,620
This will be the last outing I'll have with the PSS.

165
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,640
She just fell asleep.

166
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,360
What did the doctor say?

167
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,760
If she rests, she'll be fine.

177
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,430
<i>But... I am a person who's alive</i>

178
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,670
<i>with a heart and feelings.</i>

179
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:09,520
<i>So, I need to leave here.</i>

180
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,670
I'll get going first.

181
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,240
Now that Chairman Kim Do Jin has been arrested,

182
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,200
I should be going back down to Seojori now.

183
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,320
Even for the disciplinary committee, Special Prosecutor 
Choi Ji Hoon said he'll come forth as a witness.

184
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,180
I think I should be able to avoid suspension.

185
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,930
Thank you

186
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,720
for everything you've done for me.

191
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,940
<i> Agent Han, I'm really thankful for all you've done,</i>

192
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,480
<i>you've been so good to me yet I felt like
 I haven't said a proper greeting...</i>

193
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,600
<i>Sergeant Yoon!</i>

194
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,110
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

195
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,190
Have you eaten yet?

196
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,710
What?

197
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,410
Excuse me!

198
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,450
I'd like a pizza and a paella, please.
-Yes.

199
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,270
We have a lot now, why order more...

200
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,400
It's a principle that I should eat while I can.

201
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,310
Eat.

202
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,260
But how were you planning to go this late?

203
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,200
Your car exploded and also, buses have stopped running...

204
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,160
were you going to take a cab all the way there?

205
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:44,280
Well, you know... if there's a will, there's a way...

206
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,830
Just sleep at my house tonight.

207
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,420
I have to go back to the PSS office anyway.

208
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,750
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable again?

209
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,360
No...

210
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,510
then...

211
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,080
When are you coming back?

212
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,530
Are you trying to dig up VIP's schedule? 
 The closely guarded secret?

213
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,270
No... when did I?

214
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:28,420
And... Agents don't usually say that they'll be back.

215
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,250
Because it's possible not to be back.

216
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,040
♬ <i>Even if you say you'll forget me ♬</i>

217
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,740
But... I do want to see you again.

218
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,880
If there is an opportunity in the near future.

219
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:53,260
♬ <i> Don't forget about me, don't leave me.</i> ♬

220
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,220
♬ <i> You are like this rain, like these tears, </i> ♬

221
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,450
You're right.

222
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,790
In the near future...

223
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,820
♬ <i>'Cause you're the only person,</i> ♬

224
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,540
♬ <i>I long for you.</i> ♬

225
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,590
<i>Background Reference</i>

226
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,730
<i>Here...</i>

227
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,080
<i>I thought you might need it.</i>

228
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,200
A personal phone usage is prohibited within the jail.

229
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,790
Do you not know what kind of person he is?

230
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,710
It's me.

231
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,050
Go ahead.

232
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:38,550
It's time to prepare for our final plan.

233
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,050
<i>I'll announce VIP's schedule for March 14th.</i>

234
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:49,250
Today's event place is the Yangjinri incident's memorial 
located in Yangjinri, Gwangwonddo.

235
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,420
<i>The estimatd arrival time is 17:30.</i>

236
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:58,690
<i>After paying his respects for 15 minutes,
the estimated time of return to the Blue House is 21:45.</i>

237
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,870
<i>The advance team is actively checking currently,</i>

238
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,760
<i>it's been confirmed that there isn't anything particularly harmful.</i>

239
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,000
Yangjinri is the place of origin where the VIP's incident of his indictment occurred.

240
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,100
The residents could inflict harm on the VIP.

241
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,080
For those reasons, VIP's visiting schedule is

242
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,300
a closely guarded secret to media and anywhere else.

243
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,650
Residents cannot become aware of this.

244
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,330
This event will be communicated without 
using the radio to the local police,

245
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,040
and also, we're planning to move in vehicles consisting of 
3 ordinary cars,

246
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,310
and a decoy bus, which will be used as Command Post.

247
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:52,240
The President is planning to leave the Blue House

248
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,460
by having a press conference to announce his resignation

249
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,060
tomorrow at 9 AM.

250
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,950
This will be the last event we'll be accompanying the VIP.

251
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,960
I ask that we can bring this to a successful conclusion 
by doing our best

252
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,120
right up to the end.

253
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,460
Yes.
-Yes.

254
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,800
Yes, Mr. Special Prosecutor.

255
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,110
Yes.

256
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:37,040
I got a call from a prosecutor who's investigating the sniping incident, and
<i>[Call Records]</i>

257
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,260
he's investigating whether there's another accomplice besides the Secretary of the Performance Team.

258
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,780
The phone call Chairman Kim Do Jin received right before the sniping,

259
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,550
isn't the Secretary of the pe number but a different number,

260
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,150
so he asked us whether it's a number we knew.

261
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,370
A different number? What number is it?

262
00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:00,750
<i>It's 02-741-8531.</i>

263
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,140
Why? Is it a number you know?

264
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,620
It's the phone number of the performance team's office.

265
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,890
What are you talking about?

266
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:49,110
Someone called Chairman Kim Do Jin with 
the performance team office's phone number.

267
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:54,770
Is there a possibility that the Secretary of the Performance Team who's been arrested,

268
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,430
used the performance team office's number to call
 Chairman Kim Do Jin?

269
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:03,810
Since there aren't any CCTV installed inside the Blue House, there isn't a way to check.

270
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,270
But,

271
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,550
why would be use the PSS office number when he has a phone in his office?

272
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,120
While taking a risk to be exposed.

273
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,250
So, what is it that you want to say?

274
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,380
If, there is a person who's been secretly communicating with Chairman Kim Do Jin besides

275
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,300
the Secretary of the Performance Team who's been arrested,

276
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,900
especially if it's someone inside the PSS,

277
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,000
we need to cancel this event.

278
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,950
You want to cancel the President's last event?

279
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,730
As soon as he resigns, the President will be called to court.

280
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,540
Then this might be his last outing.

281
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,180
So I can't tell him that we have to cancel this.

282
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,270
Chairman Kim Do Jin has been arrested and everything's over.

283
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:54,380
In addition, the only evidence is a phone number at the Performance Team Office.

284
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,320
But...

285
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,080
I'll tell the Legal Affairs Team to investigate the alibis

286
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,510
of the staff members who were at the office last night.

287
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,450
Satisfied?

288
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:08,030
Then I'll stay behind and take charge of the investigation.

289
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,810
All right.

290
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:17,950
I will guard the President myself from a close distance.

291
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,120
Don't worry.

292
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,660
So you are not coming along, Agent Han Tae Kyeong?

293
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,480
Yes.

294
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,100
The Director assigned me to a task so I can't assist you for this event.

295
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,750
That's too bad.

296
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,960
I will soon come back to join.

297
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,040
<i> You seem to look too young to die on behalf of me. </i>

298
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,990
<i> No, I can! </i>

299
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,290
<i> You are the first President I will assist. </i>

300
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,470
<i> No matter what happens, I will definitely protect you. </i>

301
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,840
<i> There is something I must do at all cost. </i>

302
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,590
<i> Until then... </i>

303
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,310
<i> can you protect me? </i>

304
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,940
<i> I... </i>

305
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,750
<i> I really don't know. </i>

306
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,370
<i> You have told me to protect you, haven't you? </i>

307
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,160
<i> I will do so. </i>

308
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,130
<i> I will help you. </i>

309
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,420
<i> I will do whatever I can to help you </i>

310
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,590
<i> so please, lift your head. </i>

311
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,270
<i> Since you are the President of South Korea. </i>

312
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,230
Thank you for all this time.

313
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,060
Please, don't mention it.

314
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,680
I really won't be long to come back.

315
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,890
I will join back soon.

316
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,620
Simply,

317
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,490
I just wanted to tell you "thank you".

318
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,700
Shall we go now?

319
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,230
Yes.

320
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,320
The VIP is leaving.

321
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,110
<i> The VIP has departed the Blue House. </i>

322
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,780
<i> Destination: Yanginri, Gangwando.</i>

323
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,240
This is the CCTV footage of the entrance to the PSS and Secretary Office building from last night.

324
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,190
As you may know, there aren't any CCTV installed inside the building, so there isn't any footage from inside of the building.

325
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,160
Understood.

326
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,920
I'm giving it to you because the Director asked for it.

327
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,290
It's not because something else is happening, right?

328
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,600
I need to find out now.

329
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,610
What exactly is the time the call was made at the PSS

330
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:24,390
to CEO Kim Do Jin?

331
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,890
Yesterday night, at 8:05 PM.

332
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,200
The secretary left the building at 7:25 PM.

333
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,280
Then, when did he come back?

334
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,750
I've checked the CCTV from the situation room,

335
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,850
but the Secretary wasn't in this building at 8:05PM.

336
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,420
Maybe not the other calls,

337
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,460
but the last one that was made to the Chairman wasn't the Secretary but someone else.

338
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,440
From the confiscated computers from Chairman Kim Do Jin's penthouse,

339
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,980
can you search if there is any information related to the PSS?

340
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,960
If there really is someone from Kim Do Jin's side inside the PSS,

341
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,110
then the President is in danger.

342
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,430
I will take a look,

343
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,150
but don't look forward to anything.

344
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:37,360
He has wiped the data so well that there isn't anything left to use as evidence.

345
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,070
Okay.

346

<i>Last night, at 8:05PM.</i>
Conference Room

347
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,010
<i>What happened here?</i>

348
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,110
<i>Advance Guards</i>

349
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,750
<i>Last night at 8:05PM, the Office of the Performance Team</i>

350
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,000
<i>was empty because of their duty at the theatre.</i>

351
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,580
<i>Legal Affairs</i>

352
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,870
<i>Schedule for the Legal Affairs Team</i>

353
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,300
Han Tae Kyeong, what are you up to?

354
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,920
What time did your meeting end last night?

355
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,270
Around 7 PM?

356
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,460
What about after the meeting?

357
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,600
What did we do after?

358
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,910
We went out together and ate.

359
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,190
<i>Whether they had left the office for the night, or were in training,</i>

360
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,170
<i>all of the offices were empty.</i>

361
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,440
<i>Then why did it have to be at the Performance Team Office?</i>

362
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,680
<i>Performance Team</i>

363
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,340
<i>He had to tell someone something quickly.</i>

364
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:30,060
<i>If that's why he went into the closest room which was the Performance Team...</i>

365
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,750
<i>Conference Room</i>

366
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,200
<i>Staff Meeting
Team Leaders' Meeting</i>

367
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,350
<i>20:00-22:30 Staff Meeting</i>

368
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,920
A staff meeting at 8PM? What about it?

369
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,830
Can I find out who was at that meeting?

370
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,100
If you're talking about the staff meeting at 8PM, I was there.

371
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,130
What's wrong?

372
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,590
<i>Why aren't the Director and the Chief of Counterterrorism here yet?</i>

373
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:22,180
<i>I think the Director and the Counterterrorism Team are on duty.</i>

374
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,360
<i>On duty?</i>

375
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,830
<i>At this hour?</i>

376
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,690
<i>There wasn't any announcements for such schedule.</i>

377
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:31,050
<i>Well, the VIP must be on a personal outing.</i>

378
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,880
<i>Was there an occasion before where the Counterterrorism Team went out on duty during a person outing?</i>

379
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,030
<i>Even the Counterterrorism Team</i>

380
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,890
<i>went out?</i>

381
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,510
<i>Where are you going? The meeting's going to start.</i>

382
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,620
<i>Oh... I have to take care of something urgent for a minute.</i>

383
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,630
You're sure that the Communications Team Leader went out during the meeting?

384
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,810
Yes.

385
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:02,150
Where is the Communications Team Leader?

386
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,500
He's at the Blue House.

387
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,930
How did it go?

388
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,760
He took off 30 minutes ago.

389
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,980
He didn't say his destination.

390
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:38,380
When I reviewed the CCTV, he left by car.

391
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,860
He couldn't have gone too far.

392
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,660
Post an all points bulletin immediately.

393
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,610
Let's go.

394
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,590
How about Chairman Kim Do Jin?

395
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,580
He's still using his right of silence.

396
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,660
However, since we have solid evidence, he won't escape this time.

397
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,080
You can relax this time.

398
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,040
Let me see him one more time.

399
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,200
You have made enough efforts to make it this far.

400
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,450
If anything happens, you need to let me know instantly.

401
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,550
Communication team leader has disappeared, 
He's being sought by the police.

402
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,260
Ok. Good job.

403
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,790
What happened, sir?

404
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,480
Oh, it's nothing.

405
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,240
How far before we reach Yangjinri?

406
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,540
2 hours to go.

407
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,530
<i>Yangjinri 
2km (1.25 miles)</i>

408
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,610
Now, are you willing to confess?

409
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:33,150
How about yourself?

410
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,290
Are you ready, yourself?

411
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,730
What do you need?

412
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,670
This is from the Special Prosecutor who just entered.
(Transfer Order Warrant)

413
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:56,320
I have a transfer order.

414
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,210
Yes, sir.

415
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,800
Ready for your death.

416
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,520
That's what I mean.

417
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:34,470
Where's the Special Prosecutor?

418
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:38,280
He said he's coming out after taking care of loose ends.

419
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:38,350
Is the helicopter ready?

420
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,890
Yes.

421
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,870
Then.

422
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:48,790
Could we go to see Lee Dong Hwi?

423
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,770
Why he's not coming out?

424
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,950
Sir.

425
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,560
Special Prosecutor!

426
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,950
Special Prosecutor?

427
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:31,270
2002, 10 minutes before VIP arrival.

428
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,780
Sorry, the open hours for today are over.

429
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,210
What, why?

430
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,220
Sorry. They have an event today.

431
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,390
Why don't you return using the same way you came.

432
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,510
Sorry. Today's open hours are over.

433
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,520
Sorry.

434
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,900
Pardon me. Today's open hours are over.
 Visit us tomorrow, please.

435
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,570
We're sorry.

436
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,820
Mr. Lee Dong Sun.

437
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,850
We're arresting you for assassination of president.

438
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,860
Assassination?

439
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,680
What the hell are you talking about?

440
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,650
Did you cordon off the area?

441
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,320
Yes.

442
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,070
Are you feeling ok sir?

443
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,210
Should we just return?

444
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,750
No.

445
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:50,270
What are you talking about? Kim Do Jin has disappeared?

446
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:54,650
Yes, and Prosecutor Choi Ji Hoon has been attacked.

447
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:03,270
- You know Chairman Kim Do Jin, right? 
- Yes, I do.

448
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,420
Where is Chairman Kim Do Jin right now?

449
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:10,620
What do you mean? How am I supposed to know that?

450
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:15,010
Since when did you start planning this with Chairman Kim Do Jin?

451
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:18,290
- What are you talking about? 
- Yesterday at 8:05PM,

452
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:21,560
there is a record of a phone call with Chairman Kim Do Jin.

453
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,580
From the Office of the Performance Team.

454
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:46,100
For a moment, may I be alone?

455
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:29,800
<i>1998 Yangjinri armed communist attack which sacrificed 24 lives</i>

458
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,750
<i>It's basic economics.</i>

459
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,980
<i>Falcon will sell weapons,</i>

460
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,230
<i>and the ROK will buy those weapons.</i>

461
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,170
<i>With $10,000,000, you should be able to convince the Ministry of the People's Armed Forced.</i>

462
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:18,990
<i>- What about the safety of the civilians?
- I will guarantee their safety.</i>

463
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:24,090
<i>You're just as I've heard. Without pity for tears or blood.</i>

464
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:27,900
<i>- The rumor that you're Falcon's dog.</i>

465
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,410
<i>Yes.</i>

466
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:36,120
<i>I am Falcon's dog.</i>

467
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:05,550
I'm not the one.

468
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:10,100
During the staff meeting, the one who left

469
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,780
was someone else.

470
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,700
There's something I want to check with you.

471
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,220
Were you also at the staff meeting last night?

472
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,890
Yes.

473
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:25,080
The one who left during the meeting, was it the Chief of Communications?

474
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,780
<i>Why aren't the Director and the Chief of Counterterrorism here yet?</i>

475
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,890
<i>I think the Director and the Counterterrorism Team is on duty.</i>

476
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,860
<i>There wasn't any announcements for such schedule.</i>

477
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:44,700
<i>Well, the VIP must be on a personal outing.</i>

478
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:49,370
<i>Even the Counterterrorism Team is out on duty?</i>

479
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,500
<i>Aren't we going to have a meeting?</i>

480
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,000
<i>Oh, let me take care of something really quick.</i>

481
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,530

482
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,520
<i>It's me. You must get out of there.</i>

<i>The Counterterrorism Team is out on duty.</i>

484
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,730
<i>The sniping will not succeed.</i>

485
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:27,700
No. The Chief of the Command Post left.

486
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,830
<i>Yangjinri</i>

487
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,760

- Pardon?

488
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,060
- Without using the radio. Quick!
- I understand.

489
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,030
We have to return to the Blue House as soon as possible.

490
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,860
What are you talking about?

491
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,880
EMP.

492
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,560
An EMP bomb has went off. We have to evacuate right now.
