2
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,210
March 9, 09:18, 13 hours and 18 minutes
 after initiating impeachment.

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,420
On March 6th,

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,410
the special prosecution 
team made an announcement.

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,250
The announcement is false.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,480
It will be hard to prove 
with your testimony alone.

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,450
The information you brought...

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,970
Hand it over.

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,340
What you say is correct.

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,790
So...

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,360
I became the bait.

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,630
The most important thing is 
distracting Chairman Kim Do Jin.

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,130
09000 + 3595 = Rain shower.

14
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,610
We can use someone inside the Blue House.

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,410
09000.

16
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,680
3595.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,640
Rain shower.

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,310
09000 tells the time.

19
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,560
9 am.

20
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,910
35 means reporters.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,370
95 means making connection.

22
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,720
It means press conference.

23
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,000
And?

24
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,650
What does "Rain shower" mean?

25
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,620
A guest.

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,660
Today's press conference...

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,630
There's a guest present.

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,300
Chairman Kim will corner us 
somewhere without agents.

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,540
The technical room and control room.

30
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,960
Most likely the place furthest 
from the conference room...

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,730
There won't be any agents at 
the employee cafeteria kitchen.

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,870
I have proof.

33
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,020
To put it exactly,

34
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,410
it's not evidence.

35
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,710
It's a witness.

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,030
This is Han Tae Kyung.

37
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,330
At today's press conference,

38
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,280
there will be a real culprit to the incident.

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,520
On top of Lee Chul Kyu's testimony,

40
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,030
there has to be additional 
undeniable evidence.

41
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,460
We need a live witness.

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,610
Episode 9

43
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,600
The Yangjinri incident of 1998,

44
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,990
innocent civilian lives were lost

45
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,360
because of a few people's greed.

46
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,850
It was a tragedy never to be repeated.

47
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,530
In order to close such a 
tragic chapter of our past,

48
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,210
I wholeheartedly agree on 
a special investigation.

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,830
I will cooperate fully as 
a citizen of this nation.

50
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,430
However...

51
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,450
I repeat.

52
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,530
The announcement made 
by the special investigation...

53
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,290
...is false.

54
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,620
In 1998,

55
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,190
the commander who was in charge 
of the Yangjinri incident...

56
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,560
A Lt. Commander of North Korea,

57
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,300
Lee Chul Kyu will

58
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,020
directly...

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,840
tell you the truth of the incident.

60
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,260
Chairman Kim Do Jin of Jaesin Group.

61
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,660
What did I just hear?

62
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,200
You offered $5 million to 
Lt. Commander Lee Chul Kyu.

63
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,500
What do you want in return?

64
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,600
Are you really connected to the incident?

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,140
Please tell us your name and title.

66
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,580
What is your relationship with the President?

67
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,230
I am...

68
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,290
a member of Korean
 People's Army, Lee Chul Kyu.

69
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,090
In 1998, I was in the Korean 
People's Army Reconnaissance.

70
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,270
I was in charge of Army 
Reconnaissance 69 sent to the South.

71
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,300
Ten of our men were sent to Yangjinri.

72
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,310
With lethal force,

73
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,940
we were ordered to make sure

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,410
there were civilian casualties.

75
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,720
In return,

76
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,830
I received $100 million.

77
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,710
Those who paid this large amount

78
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,170
were the same people who made the request...

79
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,900
They are...

80
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,720
What's going on?

81
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,020
I thought they would air it.

82
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,240
Oh no...

83
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,750
Blackout!

84
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,460
Blackout!

85
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,560
Blackout!

86
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,640
Blackout!

87
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,200
Go!

88
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,270
Go!

89
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,210
The witness.

90
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,180
We must protect Lt. Commander Lee Chul Kyu.

91
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,580
Back up power! Advance units!

92
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,190
Please stay seated.

93
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,060
Please stay still.

94
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,560
Please standby.

95
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,300
Please sit down.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,440
The connection to the 
conference was interrupted.

97
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,830
We'll reconnect as soon 
as things are in order.

98
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,200
Where is the witness?

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,430
The witness!

100
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,000
What happened to him?

101
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,910
Find him!

102
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,370
The witness disappeared.

103
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,600
Find the witness.

104
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,070
The press conference is over.

105
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,410
Our conversation starts now.

106
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,920
Agent Han Tae Kyung gave me this.

107
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,940
Classified Document 98.

108
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,560
Secretary Han Gi Joon...

109
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,390
...produced it.

110
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,320
It's quite interesting.

111
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,620
This document states the 
Falcon's consultant, Lee Dong Kwi

112
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,290
is the real culprit of 
Yangjinri. Along with...

113
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,900
Senior Political Affairs, Min Hyun Ki.

114
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,790
National Intelligence 
Director, Byun Tae Hoon.

115
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,650
And...

116
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,690
Chairman Kim Do Jin of Jaesin Group.

117
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,360
Really?

118
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,150
Do you have evidence supporting 
such an accusation?

119
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,340
This document is, of course, circumstantial.

120
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,080
But hearing what you said 
directly from your mouth,

121
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,710
I have a degree of certainty.

122
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,100
The $5 million deal you were about to 
make with Lt. Commander Lee Chul Kyu.

123
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,050
So, I will comb through...

124
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
...this document

125
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,740
...one page at a time.

126
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,070
Alright.

127
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,890
Comb through every page as you say.

128
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,090
I'm curious what your results will be.

129
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,550
Find Han Tae Kyung.

130
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,990
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

131
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,110
You're lucky today.

132
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,500
No...

133
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,600
No...

134
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,010
Today is the worst day of your life.

135
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,860
I promise myself...

136
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,780
...not to leave you alone.

137
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:27,980
Stand him up.

138
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,600
I said the same thing to the President.

139
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,270
I told him not to do anything.

140
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,600
If he does, people will die.

141
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,310
Same to you, too.

142
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,440
Today...

143
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,140
Lee Chul Kyu died...

144
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,380
...because of you.

145
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,780
It will be the same from now on.

146
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,120
If you do anything, people will die.

147
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,790
One, two...

148
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,990
When people around you die,

149
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,370
remember what I said.

150
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,790
They're dying because of you.

151
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,150
I promise you one thing.

152
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,340
I won't kill you off so easily.

153
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,880
You may wish you were dead.

154
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,300
I'll do that for you.

155
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,270
I promise you, too.

156
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,650
I'll be sure...

157
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,090
...how crazy you are.

158
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,570
People will find out.

159
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:45,960
Okay.

160
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,930
I wonder who will keep their 
promise first. Let's wait and see.

161
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,380
Lt. Commander Lee.

162
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,600
Lt. Commander Lee.

163
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,200
Lt. Commander Lee.

164
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,040
Are you okay?

165
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,790
Wait just a minute.

166
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,040
To the President...

167
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,340
Please...

168
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,280
Give this to him.

169
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
President Lee Dong Hwi's...

170
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,740
The President Lee Dong Hwi vehemently denied 
the special investigation's allegations.

171
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,230
North Korea's Lee 
Chul Kyu is drawing attention.

172
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,940
What caused the blackout?

173
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,010
We're looking into it.

174
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,720
We're still unable to locate 
the witness, Lee Chul Kyu.

175
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,960
People are questioning whether 
the culprits to the Yangjinri

176
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,890
caused the blackout and 
kidnapped the witness.

177
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,430
The plot thickens as people are

178
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,940
curious about the cause behind the blackout.

179
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,660
Find where Lee Chul Kyu is.

180
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,130
Yes.

181
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,770
The blackout abruptly interrupted 
the press conference.

182
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,820
The President and members of 
the press have been evacuated.

183
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,670
Have you seen Agent Han Tae Kyung?

184
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,770
Outsiders aren't allowed in here.

185
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,610
Please leave.

186
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,590
Lee Chul Kyu...

187
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,220
Have you found him yet?

188
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,490
We're looking all over but not yet.

189
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,660
I didn't believe you.

190
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,250
After I received the document 
from Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon,

191
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,300
I was doubtful in the beginning.

192
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,370
But the more I investigated,

193
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,810
doubt became certainty.

194
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,450
That's why I didn't meet at your request.

195
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,920
The fact that I was meeting the President

196
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,150
seemed to compromise fairness.

197
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,680
That's why I trusted your integrity and put 
you in charge of the special investigation.

198
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,230
Please uncover the truth behind Yangjinri.

199
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,470
The fact that Chairman Kim Do Jin 
is relevant to this incident...

200
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,500
Are you sure?

201
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,370
Yes.

202
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,780
I'll tell you why...

203
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,100
I worked so hard with...

204
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,130
Secretary Han...

205
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,330
...to gather certain evidence.

206
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,270
In a capitalist society...

207
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,440
money is made with power.

208
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,290
Chairman Kim Do Jin knows that very well.

209
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,310
So...

210
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,350
He orchestrated Yangjinri

211
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,120
in order to work with Falcon.

212
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,570
Since 1998,

213
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,120
Falcon's connections to the 
US Department of Defense

214
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,160
made Jaesin astronomical profits.

215
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,410
But...

216
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,860
that's not the end of it.

217
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,120
In this dirty circle,

218
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,880
some businessmen and

219
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,750
politicians started joining in.

220
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,250
That's how...

221
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,630
the connection between Jaesin and Falcon

222
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,040
...strengthened.

223
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,020
The flow of dirty money 
started sixteen years ago.

224
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,200
Chairman Kim Do Jin placed 
Kim Woo Hyung as Fund Manager.

225
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,460
It was Jaesin Group's slush fund.

226
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,360
The one who placed the fund.

227
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,110
The one investing that fund.

228
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,420
There were only two copies 
of the original contract.

229
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,690
How Yangjinri started with what money...

230
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,370
The only proof

231
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,450
was included in Classified Document 98 
assembled by me and Secretary Han.

232
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,200
We must find that contract.

233
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,450
That's the only way we'll find 
the real suspects to Yangjinri.

234
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,740
With Jaesin and Falcon working together,

235
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,840
you can't imagine

236
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,040
who benefited from the deal.

237
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,130
So many powerful people 
who were in it together,

238
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,750
they don't want the truth behind 
Yangjinri to be revealed.

239
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,630
They don't even care about

240
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,460
this nation's President.

241
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,210
22 hours after impeachment was initiated.

242
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,210
Outside hacking...

243
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,110
was the cause of the blackout?

244
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,550
We inspected the power system.

245
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,960
An unidentified IP address logged 
in and initiated a blackout command.

246
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,840
The press conference building 
has a dedicated network.

247
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,630
How could someone hack from outside?

248
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,130
They must've used wireless.

249
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,230
MDF - Main distribution frame.

250
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,870
If you connect the wireless AP at the 
switching equipment inside the MDF,

251
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,540
you can communicate with the outside.

252
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,880
We must find the wireless AP 
used during the hack.

253
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,050
If we check the login records, we will find
 who and why the blackout was caused.

254
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,230
Who's responsible here?

255
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,430
What is this about?

256
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,890
I'm Prosecutor Lee Hak Ki from 
the Seoul Prosecution Office.

257
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:17,760
Please give me the list of agents who were 
in the technical room and control room.

258
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,170
Are you investigating agents? Why?

259
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,480
The fact that someone 
hacked the Secret Service

260
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,580
from the outside...

261
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,080
and cause a blackout...

262
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,750
How is that possible?

263
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,990
Maybe the Secret Service 
turned it off themselves.

264
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,240
Are you...

265
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,630
...suspicious of the Secret Service?

266
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,060
I confirmed it myself.

267
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,160
The blackout was caused by a hacker.

268
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,030
If you check the MDF,

269
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,200
you'll find the wireless AP for sure.

270
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,140
How about the President?

271
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,010
He's at his residence.

272
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,160
Step aside.

273
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,110
I'll meet the President

274
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,330
and verify the information.

275
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,750
Do you...

276
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,870
...still believe him?

277
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,820
The President...

278
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,710
Do you still believe him?

279
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,270
We should inspect the switching equipment.

280
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,050
The press conference.

281
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,410
What do you mean the President made it up?

282
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,580
He was in charge of the event.

283
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,210
All the cables and wiring.

284
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,670
Every outlet.

285
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,950
Once and twice...

286
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,350
They inspect everything up 
to the starting of the event.

287
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,190
I'm saying it wasn't an accident.

288
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:27,460
Inside the technical room and 
control room on top of that...

289
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,730
Secret Service agents are present.

290
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,380
At a place like that...

291
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,170
how can a blackout be possible?

292
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,810
That doesn't make sense.

293
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,970
Why would the President do that?

294
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,780
What happened after the press conference?

295
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,450
Everyone used to...

296
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,960
call the President a murderer.

297
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,590
Now, everyone's talking about 
other suspects to Yangjinri.

298
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,220
All this...

299
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,430
It's an act put together by the President 
to vote down the impeachment.

300
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,680
Believe what I'm telling you.

301
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,460
Today's blackout wasn't an accident.

302
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,930
It wasn't an outsider's act either.

303
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,050
The Secret Service...

304
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,110
...cut off the power supply.

305
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,180
The President ordered it.

306
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,230
It's not there.

307
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,950
This doesn't make sense. I'm sure...

308
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,750
...the hacking caused the blackout.

309
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,560
Or...

310
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,280
I'm sure someone got to 
it already before we did.

311
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,700
From the start of the event until now,

312
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,980
the only people to come and go were agents.

313
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,940
Then...

314
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,230
are you saying an agent hid the device?

315
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,810
Identify all known agents in the 
technical and control rooms.

316
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,140
Give me the list please.

317
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,840
Or...

318
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,240
Should I get a search warrant

319
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,680
and go through every corner 
of the Secret Service?

320
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,270
I'm looking for a patient.

321
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:16,600
Yes.

322
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Han Tae Kyung.

323
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,990
Go over there.

324
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,060
Are you okay?

325
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,410
Who did this?

326
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,250
No, you need to get a thorough check up.

327
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:31,820
No.

328
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,650
I must go.

329
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,650
No, you can't.

330
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,890
They killed Lee Chul Kyu, too.

331
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,160
There's no time for this.

332
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
I must meet the President.

333
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:52,670
This morning's blackout at the press conference
 was not caused by the agent on the inside.

334
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,870
It was caused from outside hacking.

335
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,130
I can go by myself.

336
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,380
Please go home.

337
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,880
What are you saying?
 How can you go like that?

338
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,320
See. Listen to me.

339
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,020
I'm okay. Go home.

340
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:21,790
The investigation team tentatively concluded 
the blackout was caused by an insider.

341
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:27,500
The Secret Service refutes the statement and 
insists it was caused by an outside hacker.

342
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,340
They have requested building 
safety login records.

343
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,980
Do you know how to break 
into a dedicated network?

344
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,050
I remember learning about it in 
my cyber investigation training.

345
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,050
Implant a bad code using 
a USB or use a wireless AP.

346
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:46,960
Right?

347
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,220
Right.

348
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,090
I saw a wireless AP at 
the conference building.

349
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,210
Agent.

350
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,920
What brings you here?

351
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,220
Have you seen Agent Han Tae Kyung?

352
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,590
Why are you looking for...

353
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,790
Was Tae Kyung here?

354
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,360
You didn't see him?

355
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,870
No.

356
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,600
I didn't see him.

357
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,820
Alright then.

358
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,750
I saw it for sure.

359
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,550
Agent Lee Cha Young had a wireless AP.

360
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,040
Are you saying...

361
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,890
...Cha Young caused the blackout?

362
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,430
I'm not saying that exactly but...

363
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,790
That can't be.

364
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,150
There's no way Cha Young would do that.

365
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,260
Did you bring it?

366
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,400
Here you go.

367
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,620
Agent.

368
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,020
But...

369
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,900
You saw wrong.

370
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,620
Go home now.

371
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,260
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

372
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,150
We're from the prosecutor's office.

373
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,000
Please come with us.

374
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,370
Is this about the blackout 
at the press conference?

375
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,400
I wasn't even working.

376
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,310
I don't know anything about the blackout.

377
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,710
The blackout isn't the reason 
for bringing you with us.

378
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,430
Let's go.

379
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,320
Please sit over there.

380
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,270
Are you the one...

381
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,770
who brought Lee Chul Kyu

382
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,710
...to the press conference?

383
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,140
Yes.

384
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,800
The place where Lee Chul Kyu died.

385
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,020
Why were you there?

386
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,960
I chased him and his kidnappers.

387
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,390
But...

388
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,810
When I arrived...

389
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,500
the kidnappers had already

390
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,430
pushed him over the railing.

391
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,540
Are you sure...

392
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,370
...he was kidnapped?

393
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,640
You didn't take him with you?

394
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,340
What are you saying?

395
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,050
According to our investigation,

396
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,810
you were the only one at the scene.

397
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,790
So...

398
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,390
the only person who could 
push him over the railing is

399
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,390
...you, Agent Han.

400
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,260
Why would I...

401
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,790
...push him over the railing?

402
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,930
Why would I?

403
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,950
Lee Chul Kyu was...

404
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,630
going to reveal...

405
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,270
the true culprit behind Yangjinri 
wasn't the President...

406
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,570
...but others.

407
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,610
But...

408
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,340
...can that be true?

409
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,980
Wasn't he told by the President to lie?

410
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,180
What are you talking about?

411
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,190
You brought Lee Chul Kyu 
on the President's orders.

412
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,120
The Secret Service caused the 
blackout on the President's orders.

413
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,790
And...

414
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,110
you took the witness away and shut his mouth.

415
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,600
Is this...

416
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,270
...what was planned for the 
press conference today?

417
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,290
Isn't your father...

418
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,050
...the recently deceased 
Secretary Han Gi Joon?

419
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,350
The accomplice to Yangjinri.

420
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,790
You want to cover up your father's crime.

421
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,130
Is that why you killed Lee Chul Kyu?

422
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,100
Yes.

423
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,570
Secretary Han Gi Joon.

424
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,810
He's my father.

425
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,590
I'm his son.

426
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,010
But...

427
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,140
besides that...

428
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,280
do you have any proof?

429
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,270
Do you have proof that 
I kidnapped Lee Chul Kyu?

430
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,220
Did someone...

431
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,760
...witness me pushing him over the railing?

432
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:17,860
If not...

433
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,790
Is that the story you came up with?

434
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,440
You're right.

435
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,690
We don't have proof yet.

436
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,440
But...

437
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,310
we'll find it soon.

438
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,410
We'll find it.

439
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,680
That's our job.

440
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,930
It won't take long.

441
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,350
We'll meet again.

442
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:51,760
Everything aside...

443
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,120
for murdering a man...

444
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,390
you will receive a prison sentence.

445
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,490
Wait!

446
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,670
Wait, are you Han Tae Kyung?

447
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,720
Are you Agent Han Tae Kyung 
of the Secret Service?

448
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,690
Are you the son of the late 
Secretary Han Gi Joon?

449
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,960
Do other agents know about this?

450
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,330
You're a suspect for murdering Lee Chul Kyu.

451
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,430
Is that right?

452
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,290
One word please.

453
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,300
Did the President Lee Dong Hwi order this?

454
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,400
Or is it because of your father?

455
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,570
Please answer us.

456
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:54,130
- One word please. 
- Please tell us.

457
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,330
Give us a minute.

458
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,230
Over here.

459
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,830
One word.

460
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,140
No pictures please.

461
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,830
Agent.

462
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,200
Please tell us.

463
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,760
One word please.

464
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,270
Go away.

465
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,470
Are you alright?

466
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,280
Agent.

467
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:03,150
Voting results on President Lee's 
impeachment at 9 am tomorrow.

468
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,790
The Blue House Secret Service 
Agent Han, a murder suspect.

469
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,930
Will you reconvene the 
interrupted press conference?

470
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,440
People are asking.

471
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,440
Should I schedule it with Public Relations?

472
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,000
We should decide after hearing the 
impeachment results tomorrow morning.

473
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,220
That'd be best.

474
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,590
A press conference may not be necessary.

475
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,740
Why in the world...

476
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,970
...does it have to be this way?

477
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:20,650
The Presidential Secret Service has 
become the President's fraudulent thugs.

478
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,630
Agent Han Tae Kyung...

479
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,450
...became a murderer.

480
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,540
You know that's not true.

481
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,460
You know that better than anyone else.

482
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,660
Among the people who made that happen...

483
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,900
Aren't you...

484
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,630
...one of them?

485
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,200
It was sixteen years ago.

486
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:43,100
People have moved on just fine 
not knowing what happened.

487
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,140
Revealing the truth won't collapse 
our diplomatic relations or economy.

488
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,680
Our people won't live any better.

489
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,250
But why?

490
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,580
Why must you?

491
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,280
What you say is right.

492
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,540
Just because the truth is revealed,

493
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,300
the economy won't improve.

494
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,390
Our people won't live any better either.

495
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,260
But...

496
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,900
I should.

497
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,330
That is the...

498
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,170
...right thing to do.

499
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,370
No.

500
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,280
Even after committing higher 
profile crimes than that...

501
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,680
...people move on.

502
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,450
Killing numerous people, causing wars...

503
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,170
making money as a result...

504
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,590
everyone lives in peace.

505
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,350
But...

506
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,520
why must we do this?

507
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,090
Why must we give up what we worked so far?

508
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,070
When I see you...

509
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,350
I feel like I'm seeing my old self.

510
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:56,410
Even though you know what's right...

511
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,040
because of reality...

512
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,880
you give up and look for an easy way out.

513
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:02,820
So...

514
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,100
when I started this work with Secretary Han,

515
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,490
we excluded you.

516
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,720
That's right.

517
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,660
Had I known, I would've opposed you.

518
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,440
That's...

519
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,830
...my job as Chief of Staff.

520
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,400
I'll do my job even now.

521
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,520
When the impeachment voting is passed,

522
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,910
I'll prepare to assist the Prime Minister.

523
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,880
After 9 am tomorrow,

524
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,650
you'll have to empty your office.

525
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,990
Are you okay?

526
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,440
I'm okay.

527
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,530
You don't need to worry about me.

528
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,130
Secretary Han was right.

529
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,320
His son...

530
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,840
He didn't want you involved in this.

531
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,630
It's too dangerous.

532
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,840
I shouldn't have...

533
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,780
...gotten you involved in this.

534
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,380
It's my mistake.

535
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,180
No.

536
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,050
This is my choice.

537
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,990
Before Lt. Commander Lee Chul Kyu died,

538
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,990
there's something he wanted me to give you.

539
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,360
What...

540
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:02,330
...is that?

541
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,520
Sixteen years ago...

542
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,770
the start of Yangjinri was

543
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,970
in January 1998.

544
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,940
North and South Korean Economics Summit.

545
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:14,500
Chairman Kim Do Jin met 
North Korean officials there.

546
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,380
They plotted the incident.

547
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,760
But...

548
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,050
That's not the end.

549
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,560
North and South Korean 
Economics Summit, 2014.

550
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,220
I looked into it.

551
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,270
This unofficial summit took 
place in January this year.

552
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,440
Chairman Kim Do Jin.

553
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,060
He's plotting something else.

554
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,710
Second Yangjinri.

555
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,380
What is he plotting?

556
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,250
Nothing has been confirmed but...

557
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,190
The reason why Lee Chul Kyu 
asked me to give this to you is

558
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,330
because he knows something.

559
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:41,990
We must find out what it is.

560
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,400
Why don't you stop here?

561
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,790
I will take care of this.

562
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,720
This is my decision.

563
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:58,540
I'll stop Chairman Kim Do Jin.

564
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,100
I'll clear my name, too.

565
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,880
I'll also clear my father's name.

566
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,340
Jaesin headquarter.

567
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:13,620
I'll sneak into Chairman Kim's penthouse 
and steal files from his computer.

568
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,630
Sixteen years ago...

569
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,810
The money delivered to the 
North was from his slush fund.

570
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,700
If I look into the financial files,

571
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,730
I'll find something.

572
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,300
You can't do that.

573
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,400
It's too risky.

574
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,420
I'll do it.

575
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,370
Kim Do Jin speaking.

576
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,480
This is Lee Dong Hwi.

577
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,210
I'd like to meet you briefly.

578
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,420
It's a bit late but...

579
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,950
we can if you'd like.

580
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,140
Team Leader.

581
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,530
Mens restroom.

582
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,030
Check first floor mens restroom.

583
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:06,930
Check the vent.

584
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,400
It was a device error.

585
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:43,850
Okay.

586
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,650
What did you say?

587
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,380
The investigation on the blackout 
at the press conference.

588
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,890
Please stop them.

589
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:04,520
You can say it was a malfunction.

590
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,220
And...

591
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:10,620
the investigation on Agent Han Tae Kyung...

592
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,700
Please stop.

593
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,470
Lee Chul Kyu's killer...

594
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,750
You know...

595
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,270
...and I know.

596
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,540
Hey.

597
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,260
Hey.

598
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:44,860
Hey!

599
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,270
What is it?

600
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,190
Can you hear me?

601
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,160
Yes.

602
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,790
West entrance.

603
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,100
Hurry, we don't have time.

604
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,370
The elevator to the penthouse 
is in the basement.

605
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,040
Turn left.

606
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:10,610
Stop.

607
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,880
Security down the right hallway.

608
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,570
Where should I go?

609
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,000
There are emergency stairs behind you.

610
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,870
Go straight to the fire door.

611
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,750
Fire door.

612
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,220
Over there! Run!

613
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,860
Run!

614
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,180
Hey!

615
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,070
Turn right. There's the elevator.

616
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,430
Stop investigating Agent Han.

617
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:47,050
And stop investigating the Secret Service.

618
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:53,710
If I do what you ask me to do, 
what will you give me in return?

619
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,610
You have nothing to give.

620
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:09,110
A deal happens when you 
have something to give.

621
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,760
You know this well.

622
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:18,500
Please contact me when you have 
something to make a deal with.

623
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,670
Probably...

624
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:22,340
...not.

625
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:33,680
I have a request.

626
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,480
There are security guards 
at Jaesin headquarter.

627
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,150
But what's worse...

628
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,990
Chairman Kim Do Jin's 
personal bodyguards have guns.

629
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,190
Please earn some time for me.

630
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,950
There's no CCTV inside the penthouse.

631
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,120
You have to talk me through 
from now on, Officer Yoon.

632
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,030
I turned on the computer.

633
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:27,870
If he's using Windows,

634
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,670
a CMOS password or

635
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,340
Windows background password.

636
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,770
One or the other. He may be using both.

637
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,110
I know.

638
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:38,690
Our police station computers use 
double passwords for security.

639
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,220
It's as expected. He has a CMOS password.

640
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,090
If you detach the battery 
on the motherboard and

641
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,890
wait five minutes after detaching all cables,

642
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:52,420
the CMOS password will reset.

643
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:53,930
I detached all the cables.

644
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:19,450
I got it.

645
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:20,990
We just have to figure out
 the Windows password.

646
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,820
Simply, boot up with the password reset CD.

647
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,970
Did you put the CD in?

648
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,030
Chairman Kim Do Jin is back. Hurry.

649
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,420
I got it. I'm in.

650
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,700
Copy all the financial related files.

651
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,030
We must retrieve the source 
of the slush fund as evidence.

652
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,410
Financial statements.

653
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,250
You cannot write on this disk.

654
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,130
What did you say?

655
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,700
The files must be locked.

656
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,600
I can't copy them.

657
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,370
It's called a DRM solution. 
How do I unlock them?

658
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:50,540
Agent.

659
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,610
If it's a DRM solution,

660
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,440
copy, print, drag and drop...

661
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,210
everything is locked. 
It's impossible to break in.

662
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,710
Give up and leave. Fast.

663
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:02,850
I'll do what I can. I came this far.

664
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,300
Get out of there now.

665
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:07,910
Officer Yoon.

666
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,290
Officer Yoon.

667
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:11,740
Get out of there!

668
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,710
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

669
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,440
What brings you here at this hour?

670
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:07,750
Why are you here...

671
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,570
Why...

672
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,160
...are you here?

673
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,550
March 9, 23:45, 27 hours and 45 minutes 
after initiating impeachment.

674
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,230
I found details on the deposit of funds.

675
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,000
$10 million my father received 
sixteen years ago...

676
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,770
it was the same bank.

677
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:09,710
Are things moving along as planned?

678
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:10,770
No one...

679
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:12,200
...can stop us.

680
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,880
Is this your way, Agent Han Tae Kyung?

681
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,710
I don't need to mind my manners anymore.

682
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,010
Something worse than Yangjinri will happen.

683
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:20,940
Trust me.

684
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,450
Stop right here.

685
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,290
The President and I are different.

686
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,380
Who did Lee Chul Kyu meet?

687
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:27,960
We must trace his whereabouts 
after he sneaked into the country.

688
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,530
I guess we won't meet again.

689
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,860
You'll be in prison for murder.
