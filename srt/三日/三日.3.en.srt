2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,990
It's that truck!

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,990
That's the one that killed your father.

4
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,430
Watch out!

5
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,660
You all right?

6
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,120
Hang on tight.

7
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,800
Get down!

8
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,900
He's dead.

9
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,830
- What are you doing?
- Bring him back alive.

10
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,270
- I told you! He's dead!
- And I will bring him back!

11
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,070
I need to ask him why he killed my father.

12
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,940
We need to get out, now!

13
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,250
You're going to get us killed!

14
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,230
Agent Han!

15
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,130
<i>[Episode 3]</i>

16
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,950
[March Fifth, 21:55
1 hour and 55 minutes after sniping.]

17
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,740
I have the results. We have identified the
body we found instead of the President.

18
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,900
He was well known by the
soldiers in the nearby camp.

19
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:52,890
He came to this vacation home
regularly for gardening. He's a gardener.

20
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,120
How is this possible?

21
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,980
The Entourage Captain must have
switched the President.

22
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,760
There is no way he couldn't have
recognized that he wasn't the President.

23
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,170
Wasn't there a vehicle that entered without
a tag before the President got here?

24
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,840
The gardener must have
come in that vehicle.

25
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,510
And the President was switched
with the gardener.

26
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,340
And he got out of the mansion
in Vehicle 8911.

27
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,450
There is only one possibility.

28
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,230
The President must have ordered
his Entourage team himself.

29
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,580
The President got out on his own.

30
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Even if the President went out personally
with only his Entourage knowing...

31
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,020
He should have let the Chief of Secret Service
or the Chief of Staff know at least!

32
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,180
He must have known about the sniping
attempt because of Colonel Yang's message.

33
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,460
That is why he got out.

34
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,150
Are you saying that the President
of the Republic of Korea

35
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,660
willfully endangered a civilian
just to save his ass?

36
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,890
That can't be true.

37
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,650
If he had known about the sniping attempt,
that's the Secret Service's business.

38
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,940
The Entourage Team Captain wouldn't
have dealt with it on his own.

39
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,430
I don't know where the President is.

40
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,010
What's important right now is
to find him ASAP.

41
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,300
Call for back up from the nearby camp
and police department.

42
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,780
And find the vehicle with
license plate number 8911.

43
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,940
No! We cannot let the outside know.

44
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,070
Not until we find out who and why.

45
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,920
We cannot let anyone know.

46
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,920
The safety of the President
is the safety of this nation.

47
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,180
We cannot decide on that on our own.

48
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,130
It's for the President's safety.

49
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,890
The people who attempted the assassination
does not know that the President is still alive.

50
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,790
Even we were fooled.

51
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,880
But if they know that the
President is alive...

52
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,550
and that no one knows about his
whereabouts, including the Secret Service...

53
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,780
That could be more dangerous
for the President.

54
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,790
Even if we don't tell anyone,
they will find out anyway.

55
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,910
There was gunfire and a blackout
of a large scale happened.

56
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,920
The Blue House, the NIS, and the
American CIA must know already.

57
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,880
We can just say that it was
a false alarm during a blackout.

58
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,430
The President came to Cheongsuho
on a four-day vacation.

59
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,580
If we seal it, then no one would know.

60
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,610
As long as we keep quiet.

61
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,360
The President is alive.
We must find him first.

62
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,070
If anything happens...

63
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,900
I will be fully accountable.

64
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,280
Alert the police and the army
to search for Vehicle 8911.

65
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,990
But the reason will be classified.

66
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,620
No one will know that
the President is missing.

67
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,280
Vehicle license plate 07NAB8911.

68
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,310
It's classified.

69
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,060
<i>Search for it as top priority.</i>

70
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,690
Go to 3197.

71
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,680
The Blue House control center
knows about 8911.

72
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,310
<i>8890 20:20 7000 28
(8890 going at 7 o'clock direction)</i>

73
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,830
<i>8801 11 1000 28.
(8801 going at 11 o'clock direction)</i>

74
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,760
They will want the envelope.

75
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,160
It's important.

76
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:28,590
The President will die on March Fifth.

77
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,120
The President is not worth our protection.

78
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,130
Did you order for my father's death too?

79
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,740
'Confidential 98.'

80
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,730
Did you kill my father for that too?

81
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,240
Where are you going?

82
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,960
One died. We need to find his accomplice.

83
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,810
- Where?
- I will find him.

84
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,600
I can understand how you feel.

85
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,450
But hear me out.

86
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,740
The blackout tonight...

87
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,210
It was done by them.

88
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,720
Are you sure?

89
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,150
I saw the bomb explode.

90
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,640
It wasn't just a blackout. Cars,
cellphones, walkie talkies...

91
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,040
All the electronics were fried.

92
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,110
I have heard of such a bomb.

93
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,770
EMP shock wave. Right?

94
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,880
What were they trying to do
with such a weapon?

95
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,290
What happened?

96
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,400
What's important to me right now is
who killed my father and why.

97
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,590
When I find that out, everything
else will resolve on its own.

98
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,630
I heard there was a gunshot
in Cheongsu Mansion.

99
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,360
Does it have to do with that?

100
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,970
Let's go to the police station. We need
to tell people and ask for help.

101
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,440
Do you have solid proof?

102
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,390
I saw them starting off a bomb myself!

103
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,530
Unless the dead person can confess...

104
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,860
do not make a move without
solid evidence.

105
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,910
You could just be framed.

106
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,950
What do you want?

107
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,870
It's the same case. One in the heart.

108
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,930
All three shots hit right on target.

109
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,730
He's quite a sniper.

110
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,520
I said what do you want?

111
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,000
I heard that the Chief of Secret Service
was an excellent shooter when he served.

112
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,510
I heard that he didn't even need the
scope for anything in 300 meters.

113
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,280
What are you trying to say?

114
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,930
He retired from the field after
becoming the Chief.

115
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,590
But his shooting training records are
far better than the young agents.

116
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,660
Enough.

117
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,270
I investigated Agent Han myself.

118
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,790
I do not think that Agent Han
shot the Chief.

119
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,310
Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

120
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,550
If the Chief had lied...

121
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,570
it means that the Chief of Secret Service
in charge of the President's safety...

122
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,560
was involved in an assassination attempt.

123
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,400
What if it's true?

124
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,980
The President is in danger from the inside.

125
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,020
We must let the Blue House know!

126
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,420
You're the one who
treated the Chief's wound.

127
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,840
I want to hear your opinion.

128
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,770
Sir!

129
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,660
The wound had a burn.

130
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,220
It's the kind of burn you'd get from the
hot gun barrel when a shot is fired.

131
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,530
You mean...

132
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,930
The gun was in contact with
the skin when it was fired?

133
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,600
Yes.

134
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,830
It's usually seen on people after they commit
suicide with the gun up against their forehead.

135
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:54,100
The Chief could have shot
himself on his shoulder.

136
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,460
But it could have been fired in close
proximity due to physical brawling.

137
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,780
We should keep open all possibilities.

138
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,170
<i>I found him! I got him!</i>

139
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,140
He's not the President.

140
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,840
Who is he?

141
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:42,950
Then... where is the President?

142
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,640
It's me.

143
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,130
The witness to the EMP shot is alive.

144
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,230
- I will take care of her.
- Forget the witness.

145
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,310
The Target is alive.

146
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,740
We need to find Vehicle 8911 before the
Secret Service and finish the Target.

147
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,020
I still want to believe in the Chief.

148
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,910
He wouldn't...

149
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,110
Like you said.

150
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,760
We should keep open all possibilities.

151
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,600
They are not going to believe
us without solid evidence.

152
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,220
Yes.

153
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,170
That's exactly what I'm going to find.

154
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,560
- Bye.
- Bye.

155
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,420
Drink up.

156
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,630
You said that you wanted to know
about your father's death.

157
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,390
All right.

158
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,610
Here, have a bite.

159
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,270
Officer Yoon Bo Won reporting.

160
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,390
I heard the car accident
made a big mess.

161
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,040
The entire department is
in an emergency state.

162
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,230
I arrested a drunk driver
on the way to the scene.

163
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,940
I need to hand him over and
get back to the scene.

164
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,830
Okay go ahead.

165
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,270
- Bye.
- Bye.

166
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,160
Occupational habit?

167
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,620
It's the basics to note
all the emergency exits.

168
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,060
Right away! Hang in tight.

169
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,770
Hey, hey! Sober up.
You're at the station.

170
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,230
Sit here.

171
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,080
- What a night.
- Tell me about it.

172
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,870
More than 20 accidents in one night.

173
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,140
What's he doing here?

174
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,630
A drunk driver arrested near Seojori.

175
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,110
- Like I wasn't busy enough.
- Hey! Hey!

176
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,180
He's completely wasted.

177
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,050
Yo man! Wake up!

178
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,710
Let's go get a cup of coffee.
It's on me.

179
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,330
- I already have one.
- Your coffee is bad. I'll get you a nice one.

180
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,350
- I'm too busy to drink coffee!
- We have the officers at the field.

181
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,200
Let's drink a cup of
coffee and take it easy.

182
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,310
<i>I really can't!</i>

183
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,620
I'm dying.

184
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,970
He keeps his password on his ledger.

185
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,360
He forgets easily.

186
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,170
So how is it going for you?

187
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,520
Can't you tell? Thanks for the coffee.

188
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,090
I need your advice on something.

189
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,050
Is it about that case again?

190
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,380
Will you stop? Can't you
see that I'm busy?

191
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,380
You need to go to the scene too!

192
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,400
But finish your coffee first, Sarge.

193
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,800
What's with you today?

194
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,800
I said I'm busy.
Let's do this later, okay?

195
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,140
Sir!

196
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,450
You know the DUI you arrested earlier.

197
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,260
Did you check his ID?

198
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,460
Why?

199
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,780
He looks like he's a wanted fugitive.

Everyone is out.
We don't have officers here.

206

- Well get anyone you can!
- Yes sir.

207
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,860

208
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,670

Someone from the Secret Service
helped the guys with the bomb.

00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,760
- How is that...?
- It's true.

225
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,010
If that's true, then tell me who did it.

226
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,820
Not until I find proof.

227
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,000
No one will believe me until then.

228
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,020
But...

229
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,500

- Seize the security footage.
- Yes ma'am.

232
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,120
Geez... I know he was an agent,
but with just one hit?

233
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,660
You call yourself a cop?

234
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,590
How many times do I have to tell you?
I let my guard down.

235
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,660
This is Officer Yoon.
She arrested the agent.

236
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,080
Blue House Secret Service,
Agent Lee Cha Young.

237
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,510
May I have a word with
Officer Yoon privately?

238
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,600
Agent Han was drinking and driving?

239
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,450
Yes.

240
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,580
Where did you find him?

241
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,780
Highway 17 at Seojori.

242
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,050
Can we stop lying?

243
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,160
I'm not lying.

244
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,280
I know Agent Han well.

245
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,310
He would never drink and drive.

246
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,470
You must be mistaken because
I know him well too.

247
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,860
Because he can drink.

248
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,950
Did you know each other?

249
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,830
Is there something wrong with that?

250
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,210
Let's cut the crap.

251
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,360
Agent Han.
Why did he come here?

252
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,090
Why is he a fugitive?

253
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,770
You're really impossible.

254
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,560
You look like you're old enough
and educated yourself.

255
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,520
Do you not know how to
have a conversation?

256
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,570
If you want to know something,
then you have to give me something too.

257
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,270
Cheongsu Mansion misfire.

258
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,650

259
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,590

260
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,150
Okay thank you.

261
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,540
When you want to talk,
you can call me.

262
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,330
He said that he was framed by someone
who helped snipe the President.

263
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,180
Snipe the President?

264
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,770
I have no idea what you're saying.

265
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,780
I guess they don't teach you
how to be a good liar.

266
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,370
You look busy.
You should go.

267
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,000
I need to go too.

273

Did you miss your pregnant wife,
who's due next month?

274
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,390
Yeah, I was going to change
and see her...

275
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,750
Is there something wrong with that?

276
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,050
No, but there is something wrong.

277
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,930
Minister Han Ki Joon's traffic accident.

278
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:52,470
How many times do I have to tell you?
It was an accident.

279
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:57,560
Your baby is coming and you will
need to make a living.

280
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,780
If I were to tell people that a cop
covered up a case...

281
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,870
It'd be quite serious right?

282
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,340
Are you blackmailing me?

283
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,640
Yep.

284
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,780
What's wrong with you?

285
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,660
I found out that it wasn't an accident.
It's something really serious.

286
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,520
What should I do?

287
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,110
Will you keep your word?

288
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,910
I promise you.

289
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,610
While I was investigating
Han Ki Joon's accident...

290
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,870
I was ordered to close the
case as an accident.

291
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:46,890
I just know that it's above our pay-grade.
They don't even know where it's from.

292
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,360
What about the victim's articles?
What happened to the white envelope?

293
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,190
Some people came from the National Police.

294
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,320
National Police? Who?

295
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,300
I don't know.
They didn't tell me their division.

296
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,250
I'm not even sure that they
were really the National Police.

297
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,860
But it's not just this case.

298
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,270
How do you mean?

299
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:38,190
The people from the National Police
didn't just take Han's articles.

300
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,770
What?

301
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:44,840
On the night Han died, there was
a fire in my jurisdiction.

302
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:50,820

308
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:31,930

00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,620
That's a direct line to the Blue House.

349
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,520
Cheongsu Mansion CP.

350
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,100
I found out where the President is.

351
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:59,650
<i>According to this cheat sheet, 1250...</i>

352
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:05,360
<i>The event place is not the mansion.
It's the place back then, Cheongju Station.</i>

353
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,140
So where should I go?

354
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,220
Cheongju Station sir.
<i>[Colonel Yang Dae Ho]</i>

355
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,660
You need to catch the
last Busan to Seoul train.

356
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:21,910
I will let you know about the
seat number through Minister Han.

357
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,130
Do you still have the note
of the call signs?

358
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,240
Will the documents be ready by then?

359
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,340
We just need the data from overseas.
<i>[Former 18th Infantry Div. Commander Kim Ki Beom]</i>

360
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,160
I will send it to Minister Han immediately upon
its completion. [Kim Woo Hyung]

361
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,350
Then I will see you on March Fifth.

362
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,850
You stay safe until then.

363
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,170
What are you talking about?

364
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,050
Cheongju Station?

365
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:13,750
The dead Entourage Captain ordered
Team 3, which is off-duty, at 6 PM today.

366
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,620
The President will be making a personal
trip out with the Entourage Captain.

367
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,920
He ordered the team to stand-by at the
station's Gate 4 at the time of the last train.

368
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,170
Tell the units to go to Cheongju.

369
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,270
Yes sir.

370
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,100
38 all units to Cheongju.
Cheongju.

371
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,880
Well that's a relief.

372
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,020
I don't know why he went to Cheongju.

373
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,870
But he could avoid the assassination.

374
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:45,560
Yes. It's really a relief.

375
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:59,480
<i>[Cheongju Station]</i>

376
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,890
Check the in-ear sets!

377
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,260
Sir! We will search in groups of two.

378
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,810
<i>[To Seoul]</i>

379
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,760
Geez.

380
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,690
<i>Han Tae Kyung!</i>

381
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,910
What are you doing?
Weren't you at the funeral?

382
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:35,090
You don't know what happened
in Cheongsu Mansion?

383
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,690
You were there?

384
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:41,440
Hey, what happened there?
How did you lose the VIP?

385
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,860
<i>He doesn't know about me.</i>

386
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,590
But what are you doing here?
I thought Team 3 was off-duty.

387
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:56,430
Yeah, but we were called out.

388
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,220
We are to stand-by to wait for the VIP
at Gate 4 to catch the last train.

389
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,940
- You'll rendezvous with the VIP here?
- Yeah.

390
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:06,030
I heard that agents from Cheongsu
Mansion are on their way here.

391
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,390
Didn't you come with Agent Hwang?

392
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,270
Yeah, I came here with him.

393
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,160
He's over there. One sec.

394
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,400
Sang Gyu!

395
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,310
338 Team Cheongsu Mansion 82
<i>(Team Cheongsu Mansion arrived at Point 338)</i>

396
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,970
Come here!

397
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,810
- Sir! Where's the VIP?
- He's not here yet.

398
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,250
What happened at Cheongsu Mansion?

399
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,460
Someone tried to harm the VIP.

400
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:33,790
What?

401
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:36,390
I will tell you the details later.

402
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,500
We believe Han Tae Kyung is an accomplice.

403
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,480
Sir, we cannot locate the VIP.

404
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,520
Our only lead is that he
is supposed to be here.

405
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,510
How were you going to meet up with him?

406
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:52,010
All we got was 'the last train at Gate 4.'

407
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:57,840
<i>The Busan to Seoul train.
The last train of the day is coming.</i>

408
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,050
<i>Please step behind the yellow line.</i>

409
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,760
<i>The vehicle that left the mansion
without a tag.</i>

410
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,900
<i>An Entourage team secretly
called to report.</i>

411
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,600
<i>And Cheongsu Mansion agents
are here at the station.</i>

412
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,840
<i>The President is alive.</i>

413
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,830
Two bodies were found at the fire site.

414
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,300
These are their IDs.

415
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:09,930
<i>[Kim Ki Beom
Kim Woo Hyung]</i>

416
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:13,530
What do you think?
Big right?

417
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,550
What is this?
Division Commander is a Two-Star.

418
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,270
Former Secretary of the Treasury.
They are both former high officials.

419
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,150
How could they be...

420
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,300
They have been staying in that
place for two months.

421
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,110
There were no outside visits.

422
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,660
They only went out to get groceries
at a convenience store at night.

423
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,570
And? How far did the investigation go?

424
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:37,830
Was it arson?

425
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,120
The same thing happened.

426
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,560
Case closed as an accidental fire.

427
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:25,200
First try to smuggle the papers in.
You have to be careful.

428
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,740
I'm worried about their movements.

429
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,890
<i>The officials of these ranks couldn't
have just gotten together for fun.</i>

430
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,000
<i>Something highly confidential was going on.</i>

431
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,530
- Be careful.
- Yes.

432
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,070
<i>[Confidential 98]</i>

433
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:52,710
Confidential 98.

434
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,490
And? You lost Agent Han?

435
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,890
Yes sir.

436
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,910
I checked the CCTV and saw
that he disguised himself

437
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,820
as a police officer and got out.

438
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,760
And the police?

439
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,000
I ordered them to enhance
the security in the area.

440
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,680
Okay, you can go back and stand-by.

441
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,140
321 01 2 1 check.

442
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,900
Check the position.

443
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,810
<i>He said that he was
framed by someone on the inside</i>

444
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,020
<i>who helped the assassination
of the President.</i>

445
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:39,270
- There?
- Nothing.

446
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,530
- VIP yet?
- Not yet.

447
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,730
Lobby upstairs. No visual.

448
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,190
We're dividing up. Team 3 and
Agent Hwang get on the train.

449
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,910
- The rest wait at the station.
- Yes sir.

450
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,120
<i>1252 and 2005 during
the Cheongju event. </i>

451

<i>Event place planned.
(1252 2005)</i>

452
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:36,610
<i>But there is no 1007.</i>

453
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:40,330
Then?

454
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:55,360
<i>1007.</i>

455
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,080
<i>Car 10, Seat 7.</i>

456
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,610
<i>Colonel Yang's message to
the President was the seat number.</i>

457
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:12,420
If he didn't come to the train station,
where did he go then?

458
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,800
The agents divided into
two teams to find him.

459
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,390
Let's give it a minute.

460
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:20,770
Something is off.

461
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:27,860
If the President went out on his own will,
he would have called already.

462
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,160
We can't even contact the
Entourage Captain that was with him.

463
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,460
We can't rule out the possibility of him
getting attacked or abducted.

464
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:47,520
By the way...
where is the Chief Officer?

465
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:41,020
- Did you find the target?
- Negative.

466
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,670
But I found someone else.

467
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:45,610
Who?

468
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,280
The agent you spoke of
is on the train.

469
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,690
He seems to be looking for someone.

470
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,930
I think it's the President.

471
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:55,060
<i>There are Secret Service
agents on the train.</i>

472
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:03,220
You must find the President before
they do or Han Tae Kyung does.

473
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,350
And this time...

474
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:11,020
make sure to kill him.

475
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,010
Let's divide the team here.

476
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,810
Yoon Jae's team go this way.
The rest follow me.

477
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,390
You and you, follow me.

478
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:22,860

<i>The President will be in danger if
you let the Secret Service know.</i>

<i>Agent Han will protect the President.</i>
