00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,410
<i>[Episode 4]</i>

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,360
- Hey menaces!
- Hi Officer.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,670
- Bye.
- Bye.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,390
This is how you shoot.

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,290
- Hi Officer.
- Hello.

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,570
- That looks yummy!
- Hi Officer.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,620
- Come join us!
- I'm on duty!

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,660
- Are you out for a walk?
- Hi Officer.

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,780
- He's working hard.
- Oh yes.

12
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,790
- What was that?
- Did you hear that?

13
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,030
You have to find
the President before he does.

14
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,690
And this time...

15
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,460
make sure to kill him.

16
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,870
Did you really snipe the President?

17
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,430
Why?

18
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,320
Why did you?

19
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,460
Are you going to kill me and
say that I was a traitor again?

20
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,740
You think people will believe that?

21
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,570
Stop.

22
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,080
Your plan has failed.

23
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,150
The President is alive.

24
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,540
No.

25
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,570
- The President is going to die.
- I don't know who you just called.

26
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,260
But Agent Han will protect the President.

27
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,460
They will suspect something if
there is another gunshot.

28
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,860
<i>[March Fifth 23:40,
3 hours 40 minutes after sniping]</i>

29
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,170
What?

30
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,700
- I'm sorry sir.
- Jerk!

31
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,840
Sorry.

32
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,420
Yoon Jae, what's going on?

33
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,470
I thought I saw Han Tae Kyung.

34
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,510
Didn't you come here with him?

35
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,190
- I saw him at the station.
- What did you just say?

36
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,450
- Are you sure?
- Yes sir.

37
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,950
Sang Gyu! Jung Rye!
Listen carefully.

38
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,500
Tae Kyung tried to harm the President
and failed. He's on the run now.

39
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,610
As of now, Han Tae Kyung
is a threat. Do you understand?

40
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,450
- Tae Kyung?
- Were you not listening?

41
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,140
Han Tae Kyung cannot find
the VIP before us. Understood?

42
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,050
<i>Agent Han found in Car Three.</i>

43
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,190
It's an emergency. Suppress
him as soon as you see him.

44
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,440
Repeat, he is wearing a black
hat and a khaki jacket.

45
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,790
Han Tae Kyung!

46
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,720
We have a visual on Han.
He's moving to Car Six.

47
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,700
We got him! Go back! Go back!

48
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,280
Han Tae Kyung!

49
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,890
Let's go.

50
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,140
Sorry.

51
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,920
What are you doing?

52
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,320
How did you know about this place?

53
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,260
Do you know where the President is?

54
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,410
Answer the question! Now!

55
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,870
Do you know where the President is?

56
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,270
- Han Tae Kyung.
- Yes.

57
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,490
I do.

58
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,820
How?
I mean... where is he?

59
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,090
If the Secret Service knows,
the President will be in danger.

60
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,350
Stop messing around
and answer the question.

61
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,120
Sir!

62
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,570
I think we were fooled.

63
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,840
Watch Han Tae Kyung.
He fooled us.

64
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,330
Go after him!

65
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,830
- Do we have anyone there?
- No sir.

66
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,720
I think Tae Kyung lured us.
Everyone step back.

67
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,680
We have civilians.
No shooting.

68
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,790
Then what? Han Tae Kyung
is trapped on the train anyway.

69
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,060
We can get him later.

70
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,200
<i>1007.</i>

71
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,160
<i>Car Ten, Seat Seven.</i>

72
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,700
<i>Attention passengers. The train will stop
shortly for a brief stand-by.</i>

73
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,150
I told them that
we're waiting for the signal.

74
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,970
But we can't stay longer than ten minutes.

75
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,630
Yes, thank you for cooperating.

76
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,080
- Did you call the police for backup?
- Yes sir.

77
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,200
Who are you?

78
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,180
How do you mean?

79
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,520
Was this your seat?

80
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,150
Was there someone else? Which
station did you get on?

81
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,420
Was it always this seat?

82
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,380
Who exactly are you?

83
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,630
I'm a Secret Service Agent of the
Blue House. Please answer the question.

84
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,790
The Secret Service.

85
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,240
Did President Lee send you?

86
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,510
I thought I made it clear.

87
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,930
I'm going to stick to the
rules and investigate.

88
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,460
You can give him my message.

89
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,760
What do you mean?

90
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,270
Who exactly are...

91
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,590
- Special Prosecutor Choi...
- That's right.

92
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,380
I'm Special Prosecutor
Choi Ji Hoon

93
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,740
who is currently investigating
Mobi Asset Management.

94
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,490
Divide into two teams. One team
search the inside of the car.

95
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,750
- The other will stay outside of the train.
- Yes sir.

96
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,090
Then what was that about?

97
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,710
You are here to tell me the same thing.

98
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,440
What are you talking about?

99
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,000
The President sent the Minister of Finance
several times to stop my announcement.

100
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,880
It wasn't even once.

101
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,300
I will not tolerate any more
interference with the investigation.

102
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,300
Minister of Finance?
You mean Han Ki Joon?

103
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,350
You can go back.
I have nothing to tell you.

104
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,260
Announcement?

105
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,260
So it's true that President Lee was
involved in stock price manipulation?

106
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,660
I said go back!

107
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:41,010
Is 'Confidential 98' connected...
to Mobi Asset Management?

108
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,220
Who told you about Confidential 98?

109
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,500
What exactly is Confidential 98?

110
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,140
What's it about?

111
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,030
I cannot talk about it.

112
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,580
I'm the son of Minister Han,
who had come to see you.

113
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:15,110
My father died because of that document!
What exactly was it about?

114
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:23,080
The President and your late father
tried to cover up their dirty pasts.

115
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,690
Is that enough for you?

116
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,420
Double check again.

117
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,660
Sir! We checked up to Car Nine.
The President wasn't there.

118
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,530
- Go up.
- Ten? Go in! Go!

119
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,020
Dirty past?

120
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,260
What is it exactly?

121
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,680
What is it exactly?

122
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,100
- Hey!
- Get out Han! Get out!

123
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,550
- What is it?
- Get out!

124
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,300
What is it?

125
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,940
He's not here sir.

126
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,710
Do you know Agent Han?

127
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,430
I do not know him.

128
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,320
- Were you two planning to meet here?
- No.

129
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,530
Have you seen anyone else here?

130
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,790
No, no one got in this car after I got on.

131
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,140
Is that enough?

132
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,880
What did you and Agent Han talk about?

133
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,790
What did he ask you?

134
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,480
Are you from the Secret Service?

135
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,560
As far as I understand, you don't
have the authority to interrogate.

136
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,490
What gives you the right
to interrogate me?

137
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,960
If you want to know that badly,
you can ask Agent Han yourself.

138
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,270
I have nothing more to tell you.

139
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,650
- Where is the President?
- I don't know.

140
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,210
I don't know what you have done.

141
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,560
But you're also a Secret Service agent.

142
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,850
And we are the people who must
protect the President.

143
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:26,010
- Where is the President?
- That's exactly what I want to know.

144
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:35,000
I also want to know where the President is.

145
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,420
- We cannot stop the train any longer.
- Okay, understood.

146
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,220
Sir, what should we do?

147
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,880
The team on the train stay
and keep on searching.

148
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,650
- The rest is going back to Cheongju.
- Yes sir.

149
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,900
Bring him.

150
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,140
<i>Hello. Get in the car.</i>

151
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,250
I got this right here.
You can go in that car.

152
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,550
<i>What are you doing? Huh?</i>

153
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,560
Freeze!

154
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,560
Stop the car.
Stop the car!

155
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,470
<i>The Secret Service
asked for backup.</i>

156
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,680
<i>Go to the train tracks
if you're near Yongsuri.</i>

157
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,670
Dispatch, I'm on my way.

158
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,080
Officers.

159
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,130
I'm going to go back from there.
You should go back.

160
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,270
Just say that I threatened you.

161
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,650
You're going to freeze
to death. Put this on.

162
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,160
Also you're going to drive.

163
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,090
You're better than me.

164
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,790
I don't like partnering up with you.

165
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,600
But since we're in this together
let's work together.

166
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,990
Go back. You're going to be
framed as my accomplice.

167
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,910
Complicit in what?

168
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,500
For killing the President?

169
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,620
Do you know what
you're getting yourself into?

170
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,060
Do you know how many people
died under my jurisdiction?

171
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,730
It's not just your father who died.

172
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,880
What did you just say?

173
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,060
On the day Minister Han died
in the traffic accident...

174
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,530
these people died in a fire.

175
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,070
An army general and a former minister.

176
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,660
Three high ranking officials died on
the same day in the same area.

177
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,350
But there wasn't even news about it.

178
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:30,400
If I'm right, the people who killed your
father must have killed these people too.

179
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,220
And now they are after the President.

180
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,750
What exactly is the reason?

181
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:47,760
The President and your late father tried
to cover up their dirty pasts.

182
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,150
There's one person who can
tell us why this happened.

183
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,740
We need to find the President.

184
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,260
Mr. Secretary of Civil Affairs.

185
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,560
- Is the Chief of Staff here?
- He's at Cheongsu Mansion.

186
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,390
<i>Then connect me with him.
[Secretary of Civil Affairs Hong Jin Soo]</i>

187
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,600
- He told me not to call him.
- Connect me now!

188
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,470
And have all the cabinet members
come to the Blue House.

189
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,270
- Which ones?
- Every one of them!

190
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,140
You couldn't find the President.

191
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,960
And then you ended up losing Agent Han.

192
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,060
Nice going.

193
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,430
The officer who drove the police
car seemed to be working with him.

194
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,110
Agent Han was hit from a blind spot.

195
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,140
I'm sorry sir.

196
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,570
Who is that police officer?

197
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,390
Officer Yoon Bo Won from Seojori.

198
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,550
We let the police know and she's
now a fugitive with Agent Han.

199
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,010
Did you get anything from the
Entourage team in Cheongju?

200
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,520
They are still searching, but they
didn't find anything yet.

201
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,670
- Chief!
- Yes, I heard.

202
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,880
Something must have happened
to the President.

203
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,160
I'm going to go back to the
Blue House and ask for help.

204
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,080
What about Vehicle 8911?

205
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,450
- What are you talking about?
- If the President went to Cheongju...

206
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,940
then the car should have been found
at the station parking lot.

207
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:37,140
But Vehicle 8911 was not seen
anywhere in the parking lot.

208
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,190
If the dead Entourage captain dispatched
agents at the station...

209
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,460
then the President must have had
intentions of going to Cheongju Station.

210
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,240
But he didn't show up at the station.

211
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,180
Then that means something
happened on the way.

212
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,450
We need to find Vehicle 8911.

213
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,080
No.

214
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,100
I cannot leave this in the hands
of the Secret Service any longer.

215
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,790
If the outside knows,
it will become more chaotic.

216
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,120
Give me thirty minutes.

217
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,910
I will find the President
in thirty minutes.

218
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,050
<i>[Blue House Cabinet Office]</i>

219
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,040
Thirty minutes.

220
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,840
This is Shin Gyu Jin.

221
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,600
This is the Secretary of Civil Affairs.
I need to speak to the President.

222
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,450
He's not available.

223
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,350
I just saw the Special Prosecutor.

224
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,780
The announcement has
been brought forward.

225
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,890
You said that the stock manipulation
allegation will be acquitted.

226
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,360
Yes.

227
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:06,160
But... while investigating he
found something else on the President.

228
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,210
What are you talking about?
Something else?

229
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,090
What is it?

230
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:15,100
I will try to stop it before
he makes an announcement.

231
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:20,910
But we need the President to
confirm the facts.

232
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,830
I need to know what it is. Tell me.

233
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,890
Secretary?

234
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,790
If this is true.

235
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,080
It will threaten the foundation
of the administration.

236
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,610
The foundation?

237
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,900
Impeachment.

238
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,920
Tell me the details.

239
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,860
Understood.

240
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,780
I will call you back.

241
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,010
Mr. Chief of Staff.
What's going on?

242
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,860
Does the Blue House know about this?

243
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:26,440
Did you say thirty minutes?

244
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,270
Can you find the President
within thirty minutes?

245
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,320
- Yes.
- It's thirty minutes.

246
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:41,080
You must bring back the
President within that time.

247
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,500
Can you promise me that?

248
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,030
I promise.

249
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,640
I will bring him back myself.

250
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,380
The routes from Cheongsu Mansion
to Cheongju Station?

251
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,820
<i>You can take the expressway
via Cheongsu IC.</i>

252
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,930
<i>Or you can take Highway 35 and
drive through the city.</i>

253
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:15,740
There's an embankment road and
a shortcut through the mountain.

254
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,500
Divide into four teams
and go all four ways.

255
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,180
- Search thoroughly and report back!
- Yes sir.

256
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,600
The President's destination
was Cheongju Station.

257
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,960
If he wasn't at the station, that
means something has happened to him.

258
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,730
Then we need to search the routes
to Cheongju Station.

259
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,280
Yes. He either took
the expressway or...

260
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,970
Or took the shortcut via Highway 27.

261
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,590
Or Highway 35 through the
embankment road.

262
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,630
The Secret Service is also
looking for Vehicle 8911.

263
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,190
We need to find it first.

264
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,940
What time did the President
leave the mansion?

265
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,120
Last night at 7:20.

266
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,300
Last night at 7:20...

267
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,900
If he took the embankment road...

268
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,620
- What?
- Go to the embankment.

269
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,740
What are you talking about?

270
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,920
If he took the embankment
road after seven...

271
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,830
then he had to have taken a detour.

272
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,330
What's that mean?

273
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,800
Because I was there.

274
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:05,070
- Is it this way?
- Yes, it connects to Highway 27.

275
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:12,260
<i>Vehicle 8911 drove this way.</i>

276
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,240
I just don't understand.

277
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,690
He didn't notify the Secret Service
or the Staff.

278
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,240
Why did he go to Cheongju Station?

279
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,100
You said that Special Prosecutor Choi
was on the train?

280
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,030
Yes.

281
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,290
The President was trying to stop him.

282
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,020
He wanted to stop the Prosecutor.

283
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,390
<i>Move out of the way.</i>

284
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:50,560
We heard that you found evidence
on stock price manipulation.

285
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,190
<i>Do you have it? Tell us.</i>

286
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,310
<i>Give us updates!</i>

287
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,660
Where did it leak?

288
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,170
I don't know yet.

289
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,730
The Blue House, the prosecutor service,
and the Justice Department...

290
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,730
they are all looking for you sir.

291
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,410
<i>Prosecutor's Office.</i>

292
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,220
One minute.

293
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,690
Sir.

294
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,960
It's the Minister of Justice.

295
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,390
How is the preparation
for the announcement?

296
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,780
We're all ready.

297
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,610
What should I tell him?

298
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,110
Should I postpone the announcement?

299
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,630
Sir?

300
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,860
Cancel the press
conference in the morning.

301
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,130
Are we backing out now?

302
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,670
I meant to cancel the one this morning.

303
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:05,140
We have so many guests here already.
We don't want to keep them waiting.

304
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,570
Are there any fallen rocks on this road?

305
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,830
No.

306
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:25,000
Landslide? Or wild animals?
Any road hazards?

307
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,650
No, it's a curvy mountain road.

308
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,530
But it's not really dangerous
when driving with caution.

309
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,040
- It's a mountain road?
- Yes.

310
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,850
Let me see the map.

311
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,060
- Is this the road we've been driving?
- Correct.

312
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,520
It goes around the lake
with the mansion.

313
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,990
That's why less cars take this road.

314
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,260
How long did it take for us to get
here from the embankment road?

315
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,960
About 20 minutes?

316
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,090
Five minutes from Cheongsu Mansion
to the embankment.

317
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,110
It was too foggy for them to speed.

318
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,140
Thirty minutes to here...

319
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,340
If they had driven along the road...

320
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,550
Wait...

321
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:45,140
<i>Found it! We found Vehicle 8911.</i>

322
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,930
<i>Do you copy?</i>

323
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,420
Where is it?

324
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,750
- Where is the VIP?
- No one was in the car, sir.

325
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,210
If the car with the President
was nearby at that time...

326
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,630
It was within the EMP range.

327
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,560
Hello? Can you hear me?

328
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,480
Was this vehicle attacked
by the EMP too?

329
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,450
Yes, sir.

330
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,720
Hit by the EMP?

331
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,930
Yes, an EMP would fry cellphones,
vehicles, and walkie talkies...

332
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,510
The EMP attack was at eight last night.

333
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,770
It's past one in the morning right now.

334
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,960
Where has the President gone to
since then?

335
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,790
- Are you all right sir?
- I'm okay.

336
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,680
- Are you not hurt anywhere?
- More importantly... what's going on?

337
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,290
We have searched the entire area.

338
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,810
But nothing was found
within a 15 km radius.

339
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:16,110
The car stopped while you are
alone with the President.

340
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,920
Something is wrong with the vehicle.

341
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,020
The entire area seems to be blacked out.

342
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,890
<i>[Entourage Captain Lim Gun Young]</i>

343
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,250
I think it's best that we go back
to the mansion. I will call them.

344
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,380
When you're alone with the President
while the cellphone and car don't work...

345
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,660
Can't reach Cheongsu Mansion...

346
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,630
The captain would have suggested the
President to return to the mansion.

347
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:20,190
But the President wouldn't have.

348
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,100
I have a bad feeling about this.
Perhaps we should go back.

349
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,690
People will only be nagging me.
No thanks.

350
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,260
But sir...

351
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,920
- It's the first time in two years.
- Sir?

352
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,470
It's never been this quiet
since I became President.

353
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,430
There is only one way to go to
Cheongju Station from here without a car.

354
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,210
<i>[Seojori -> Cheongju]</i>

355
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,470
Bus.

356
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,310
- Do you know the bus line?
- Of course I do.

357
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,640
But do you think the President
would have ridden the bus?

358
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,290
He would have if there was no other way.

359
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,690
He couldn't have walked there
with the President.

360
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,530
You said that you knew
the bus line right?

361
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:54,000
The Special Prosecutor's
announcement has been canceled.

362
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,440
I also heard that there was a
major blackout at Cheongsu Mansion today.

363
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,470
Is the President okay?

364
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,140
The Chief of Staff is down there.

365
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,330
He will accompany him back soon.

366
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,030
The announcement has been canceled.

367
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,860
But we need to find out what it was.

368
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,590
- What's going on?
- We're in trouble sir.

369
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,250
What happened?

370
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,110
Turn on the TV.

371
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,060
You said that the announcement
had been canceled.

372
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,220
The Special Prosecutor is
hitting us from behind.

373
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,400
Are you watching this?

374
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,640
<i>[Announcement Soon]</i>

375
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,300
<i>We do not know the reason the
announcement has been brought forward.</i>

376
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,460
<i>We believe that
the prosecutor's position is</i>

377
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:09,620
<i>to firmly hold his ground
against the President.</i>

378
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,990
But are you sure about this?

379
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,610
This Special Prosecution was originally
about Mobi Asset Management.

380
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,140
They could get back at us for
breaking Special Prosecution laws.

381
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,420
Not only was it to investigate
Mobi Asset Management...

382
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,050
it was to generally investigate
the overall corruption involved.

383
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,380
But...

384
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,420
This is unprecedented.

385
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,100
No one else had fought against
the current President in office.

386
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,450
We are the first.

387
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:52,390
We have to finish this.

388
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,540
<i>Make way please.</i>

389
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,440
<i>[Special Prosecution Report]</i>

390
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:37,680
I will now give the progress report on the
Mobi Asset Management investigation.

391
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,840
I called the bus company.

392
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,260
And?

393
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,140
Did they confirm if Bus 7 came back?

394
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,140
No, it did not come back.

395
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:06,530
That bus passes Seojori to Cheongju.

396
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:10,580
But they could have gotten off
midway and taken a taxi.

397
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,370
Back up before they notice.

398
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,200
- Why?
- One sec.

399
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,860
I heard that there was a big
accident with a bus and cars.

400
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,980
That bus.

401
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,410
It's that bus! The one the President was in.

402
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:21,040
The bus that passed this point at
8:10 was in a big traffic accident.

403
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,690
It was a huge accident with
more than 20 seriously wounded.

404
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:29,960
The passengers were sent to
two hospitals nearby.

405
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,260
Find the hospitals.
We will move in two teams.

406
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,400
Yes, sir.

407
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:42,780
When you find the VIP,
report to me immediately.

408
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,760
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

409
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,480
- Do you have a Metro card?
- Yes, sir.

410
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,240
I don't even have a Metro card.

411
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,460
But are you sure about this?

412
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,730
If the people recognize you...

413
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,900
Recognize me?

414
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,320
Who recognizes me?

415
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:40,930
I'd need a nice suit and have
the Secret Service and Staff accompany me...

416
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,210
And then come out with flare
for people to recognize me.

417
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,890
I'm just another average Joe
in normal clothes on a county bus.

418
00:45:56,030 --> 00:46:04,330
But are you not going to tell me
why you're going to Cheongju Station?

419
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,890
<i>I will see you on March Fifth.</i>

420
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:23,690
<i>Be careful until then.</i>

421
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:30,680
What's going on?
The street lights are out too.

00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,960
<i>While investigating
Mobi Asset Management</i>

423
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,580
<i>which was run by
President Lee in 1998...</i>

424
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:42,190
We found something so serious a crime
that it could be charged for treason.

425
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:50,790
This investigation may bring
a huge impact on Korea.

426
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:57,920
But because our priority is
to reveal the truth...

427
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,220
We'd like to be transparent
about everything.

428
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,570
Yes...

429
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,100
Okay thank you.

430
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:24,310
This is the list of the hospitals.
Go straight first.

431
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:52,650
Fire extinguisher!
I got her.

432
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,930
Hey! What happened?

433
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:59,970
Lee Cha Young! What happened?
What are you doing here?

434
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,570
We have to stop him.
We have to stop him!

435
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:14,380

441
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,650
Just do as you were trained.
Understand?

442
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,910
Yes sir.

443
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,420
Go to the combat area.

444
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,790
To the combat area!
Company 13.

445
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,600
<i>- What happened so far?
- I came here after receiving a call.</i>

446
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,520
It's a mess! A cop and
civilians are hurt.

447
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,120
We can't go in because
they are armed.

448
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,450
Evacuate the civilians
as soon as the ambulance is here.

449
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,930
My mother is still in there.
Please save her!

450
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:03,850
There are people inside!

451
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,020
<i>My kid is there! Save him.</i>

452
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,950
How long is it going to take the
snipers to get in position?

453
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:25,100
About 20 minutes sir.

454
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,900
No sir. We need to size them
and locate them first.

455
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,820
Civilians' lives depend on this.

456
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,850
The damage can increase if we wait.

457
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:40,390
We're at combat!
They can attack us back.

458
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:45,270
Our goal is to save as many
civilians as possible.

459
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:51,350
I will make the call. Everyone
go inside the village, now.

460
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:59,770
<i>In 1998, the press concluded that
Yangjinri incident was a one-sided attack.</i>

461
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:07,780
But our investigation shows that
this was carefully planned by someone.

462
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:14,560
The culprit for this incident was the consultant
of the American company, Telcom, at the time.

President Lee Dong Hee.

Are you not afraid sir?

467
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:48,470
The people who made the Yangjinri incident happen
still have unimaginable power.

468
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:54,450
Also... they've masked it up so that
no one would even have the slightest idea.

469
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:56,980
They are even respected.

470
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:01,310
That's exactly what frightens me.

471
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:09,250
That I may never be able to reveal
how ruthless and cruel they are.

472
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:15,990
That I may never reveal what they
have done for their profits.

473
