3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,220
To boost the demand they tried to build up
tensions between North and South Korea.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,430
And they hired President Lee Dong Hee
at the time.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,550
President Lee schemed with the military
officials he had connections with.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,990
<i>He then made contact with
North Korean military officials.</i>

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:35,560
He paid them 100 million U.S. Dollars
and demanded them to attack us at Yangjinri.

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,260
<i>Colonel Yang Dae Ho and
General Kim Ki Beom...</i>

9
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,150
<i>Kim Woo Hyung, and
late Minister Han Ki Joon...</i>

10
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,050
<i>They accompanied President Lee
and were involved in this conspiracy.</i>

11
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,830
<i>Falcon Co. ended up selling
3 trillion won worth of choppers.</i>

12
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:34,030
<i>President Lee received 5 billion won
worth of U.S. Dollars and political funds.</i>

13
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,560
<i>He then founded
Mobi Asset Management in 1998.</i>

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,150
<i>And made a tremendous amount of profits.</i>

15
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,650
- Seojo Hospital.
- Speak.

16
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,210
Yes, we finished searching Seojo Hospital.

17
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,820
<i>He's not here.</i>

18
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,390
It's certain that the VIP is
at the hospital you're at.

19
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,760
Covering fire!

20
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,340
Nothing inside sir.

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,220
- Return!
- Night vision!

22
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,920
Get out now!

23
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,680
Multiple tangos at 9 o'clock.
(Tangos = targets)

24
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,400
Fire!

25
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,520
<i>In order to fill their wallets...</i>

26
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,410
they had intentionally set up their
fellow Koreans to die or be injured.

27
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,900
As a result some are living wealthy lives

28
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,660
while the one has become the President.

29
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,690
This can never be forgiven.

30
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:52,190
<i>According to Article 84 and
Article 88 of Criminal Laws...</i>

31
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,800
<i>of national rebellion
and rebellion and murder</i>

32
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,140
<i>I hereby indict the following group.</i>

33
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,400
Agent Han.

34
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,470
Wake up!

35
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,630
<i>[16 years ago,
February, 1998]</i>

36
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:50,380
Politics, principles, ideology...
Let's cut the crap and talk about money.

37
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,610
It's the basic economic principle.

38
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,430
Falcon sells the weapons.

39
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,160
And Republic of Korea buys them.

40
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,160
<i>[Secretary of State Min Hyun Ki]</i>

41
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,690
Mr. Lee, I heard that you were a
consultant for Falcon.

42
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,030
We have no interest in buying
weapons for a while.

43
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,030
I know.

44
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,400
The country's economy is shit and
the defense budget has been cut.

45
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,310
What?

46
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,570
Does anyone not know that the
Korean economy has gone to shit?

47
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,260
What!

48
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,130
Will 10 million dollars suffice?

49
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,990
<i>Are you trying to buy us?
[Army General Kwon Jae Yeon]</i>

50
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,010
Not you. That's what
I'm paying North Korea.

51
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,530
Director of North Korean Policy at NIS.

52
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,450
I heard that you have connections
with the hardliners on North. How is it?

53
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,340
Will 10 million dollars be enough
to move the People's Army?

54
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,710
<i>You want to start a war?
[Director of N. Korea Policy Byun Tae Hoon]</i>

55
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,790
War?

56
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,860
I'm just asking for a special force to come
to the South to start up a fuss, then leave.

57
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:17,960
That will kick some sense into the people
who say we don't need Falcon's weapons.

58
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,400
- The civilians' safety?
- I can guarantee that.

59
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,140
A submarine will emerge
for a second and then leave.

60
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,270
What about America? You think
they won't know about this?

61
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,870
Don't worry about that.

62
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,940
Falcon will take care of America.

63
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,230
The Korean Army will benefit
from getting the budget back.

64
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:50,830
The government will be able to unite
the disheartened Koreans from the IMF.

65
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:58,170
The super powers won't have to worry about
the North and the South's reconciliation.

66
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,010
Win-win for everyone.

67
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,750
And we will be buying the leftover crap
from Falcon with the people's tax money.

68
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,930
There's something else.

69
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,540
Behind Falcon, there is the IMF
and the U.S. Congress.

70
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,040
I can promise you an influx of
large scale foreign capital.

71
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:32,830
What Korea needs the most right
now are dollars. Am I wrong?

72
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,790
Just keep it simple.

73
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,200
We need to sell and you need to buy.

74
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,520
Mr. Lee.

75
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,110
Are you not a citizen of Republic of Korea?

76
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,060
Is that important?

77
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:07,120
The rumor is true, that you're a
ruthless and cruel dog for Falcon.

78
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,390
Yes!

79
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,240
I'm Falcon's dog.

80
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,050
<i>[March 6th 01:15
5 hours and 15 minutes after sniping]</i>

81
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,340
- Agent Han.
- It can't be true.

82
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,810
My father...

83
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,780
Do we have someone to send
to send money to North Korea?

84
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,150
We have an NIS secret agent, who
is also a professor of economics.

85
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,490
He has a business trip to
northern China next week.

86
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,130
Perfect place to see
a North Korean official.

87
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,110
Business trip again?

88
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,600
Yeah.

89
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,470
It's going to take about three days.

90
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,530
- Eat well.
- Okay.

91
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,810
Where are you going this time?

92
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,560
Northern China.

93
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,560
My father wouldn't...

94
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,010
Something is wrong.

95
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,540
The President knows what happened then.

96
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,410
That's why we have to find the President.

97
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,530
The Secret Service is here!

98
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,700
You told me that the
President will be in danger

99
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,780
if the Secret Service
finds him first.

100
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,660
We must find him first.

101
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,730
What are you doing?

102
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,770
Are these all the people
from the bus accident?

103
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,380
No, we didn't have enough beds in the ER.

104
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,610
Some of them were sent upstairs.

105
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,810
Jae Suk's team will guard the elevator.

106
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,360
Sung Jae's team will go to level two.
Dong Hyung will go to level three.

107
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,560
ER, bathroom, and lounge.
Search them all.

108
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,770
Yes sir!
Go!

109
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,120
Have you seen someone that looks like
President Lee Dong Hee?

110
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,540
Have you seen someone that looks like
President Lee Dong Hee?

111
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,110
Not here sir.

112
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,150
You!

113
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Level one, elevator number three.

114
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,170
<i>Agent Han Tae Kyung has
taken the VIP.</i>

115
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,490
<i>Level one, elevator number three.</i>

116
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,560
Get him!

117
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,790
The VIP is with him.

118
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,490
Level one, elevator number three.

119
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,100
Agent Han Tae Kyung has
taken the VIP.

120
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,630
<i>He's taken an ambulance.
License plate 9337.</i>

121
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,410
- Get it!
- Yes sir!

122
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,840
<i>What did I do?</i>

123
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,850
Is that true?

124
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,220
The sniper was someone inside
the Secret Service?

125
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,550
Yes.

126
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,860
It's true.

127
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,510
- Yes!
- Answer me in yes or no.

128
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,670
- Is Chief Ham Bong Soo with you?
- No.

129
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,450
Arrest Chief Ham right now.

130
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,960
The culprit is not Agent Han Tae Kyung.
It's the chief!

131
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,150
<i>Chief Ham isn't just the chief.
He's a legend.</i>

132

<i>[Blood Storage Box]</i>

133
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,730
Hold on tight!

134
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:14,370
Where am I?

135
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,540
Are you okay?

136
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,240
Who are you?

137
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,920
What am I doing here?

138
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,150
I'm Officer Yoon Bo Won
from Seojo PD.

139
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,690
Will you stop?

140
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,370
You heard it too.

141
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,350
What the President has done.

142
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,640
The President cannot live.

143
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,220
I was only trained
to protect the President.

144
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,740
And you were the one who trained me.

145
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,170
Freeze!

146
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,160
Guess where the gunshot was from.

147
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Evacuate the VIP in the opposite direction.

148
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,340
You must risk your lives
and become living shields.

149
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,130
It was not 3 o'clock. It was 12.

150
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,000
Will try again sir!

151
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,680
- Shot!
- Shot!

152
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,890
Agent Han, are you happy to have died?

153
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,350
Yes sir! I'm happy sir!

154
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,350
Good.

155
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,040
Good attitude.

156
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,050
Save the VIP and die.

157
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,750
Save the VIP and die.

158
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,560
You said that was the attitude.

159
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:24,290
You cannot kill the President
unless you kill me.

160
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,200
Then, I will kill you first.

161
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,660
Then kill the President.

162
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,100
Who's outside?

163
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,010
Where am I?

164
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,120
- Move.
- You told me not to.

165
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,520
Our mission is to protect the
President at all costs.

166
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,290
You do not compromise
even if you have to die.

167
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,860
Han Tae Kyung!

168
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,250
You said that it was not
important who the President was.

169
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,140
It does not matter who the President is.

170
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,690
He was chosen by the people.

171
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,230
Just remember that.

172
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,540
Our mission is to protect the President.

173
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,150
You told me that. So...

174
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,600
So please stop!

175
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,140
Who's outside?

176
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,060
Move.

177
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,760
No sir.

178
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,710
- Move.
- It's dangerous! No!

179
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,960
He is no longer my President.

180
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,270
I trust my Secret Service.

181
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,180
Move!

182
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,200
<i>The 0.01 second when you hesitate</i>

183
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,310
may result in a shot.

184
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,050
Never hesitate.

185
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,900
There is something...

186
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,540
I need to ask you.

187
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:52,750
The Special Prosecutor report.

188
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,820
Is it true?

189
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,160
No right?

190
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:10,150
My father and you...

191
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:16,020
didn't do it, did you?

192
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:23,470
People are mistaken right?

193
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,060
Please.

194
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,560
Answer the question.

195
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,900
No right?

196
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,940
It's the truth.

197
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:56,420
The Special Prosecutor's report is true.

198
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,880
Are you okay, sir?

199
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,210
Bring the cast, now.

200
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,150
We will escort you from here.

201
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,070
Call the chopper.
Coordinates 103, 104.

202
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,230
- This way sir.
- Sir.

203
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,980
Wait.

204
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,970
Wait! Let go!

205
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,850
Mr. President! Answer the question.

206
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,580
It's not the truth, is it?
Say that it's not true.

207
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,530
Mr. President! Wait!

208
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,530
Mr. President.

209
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,440
- Stop!
- Answer the question.

210
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,740
<i>[March 7th 02:35
30 hours and 35 minutes after sniping]</i>

211
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,460
- The VIP?
- He's fine.

212
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,340
The doctors are checking
his health one more time.

213
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,080
How far is the investigation
on Agent Han and that officer?

214
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,590
The police is on it.

215
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,840
The agents at Cheongsu Mansion.

216
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,370
Are you making sure that
they stay quiet?

217
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,070
The Chief of Secret Service in charge
of the President's safety...

218
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:58,060
tried to kill the President and died
at the hands of another agent.

219
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,350
Nice going, Secret Service.

220
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,230
Hello.

221
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,150
I'm a patient. Go easy on me.

222
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,700
How is it?

223
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,310
Other than minor bruises and abrasions...

224
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,630
MRI, CT, and blood pressure
came back normal.

225
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,150
He needs to rest for a week
in case of any possible after effects.

226
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,190
And we will have to see.

227
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,350
I must speak with the President.

228
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,680
- Leave us.
- I cannot do that.

229
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,260
It's a crisis and
this is an outside facility.

230
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,060
He needs to be accompanied at all times.

231
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,760
It will only be a sec.

232
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,730
Director?

233
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,020
Yes sir.

234
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,690
Since the Chief Officer's seat is vacant
you're in charge of the Secret Service.

235
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,750
Dismiss the agents for a minute.

236
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:45,690
- But...
- He is one of the few who doesn't want me dead.

237
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:51,240
After I'm dead, the Chief of Staff
will be left all alone.

238
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,810
He won't kill me.

239
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,980
It's okay. Please go outside.

240
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:29,460
Why did you keep it a secret that
you went to see the prosecutor?

241
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:36,730
Did you not trust me, your staff?

242
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,190
Do you know what the situation is like?

243
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,700
Someone tried to snipe the President.

244
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,310
And the Special Prosecutor
has made him into a mass murderer.

245
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,950
First, I let the police investigate
the sniping attempt.

246
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,640
Han Tae Kyung, Agent Lee Cha Young,
and that female officer.

247
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,760
And the rest of the Secret Service
will be investigated.

248
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,910
Also... we will form a committee
formed of NIS and experts.

249
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,400
And find out who is behind all this.

250
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,420
It was you, who shot the
dead Chief Ham Bong Soo, correct?

251
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,030
Yes.

252
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,730
Are you sure that Chief Ham
was involved in sniping?

253
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,070
Yes.

254
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,270
<i>It was hanging on the telephone pole.</i>

255
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,400
<i>It was dark grey, and this big.</i>

256
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,460
It also had a timer.

257
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,980
There was a brand mark at the bottom.

258
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,180
It started with FO.

259
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,290
F, O?

260
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,960
Yes, I think it was the
manufacturer.

261
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,590
You should search...

262
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:56,230
Are you sure that it was an EMP?

263
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,270
Have you seen an EMP before that?

264
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:03,290
No, but the area had a blackout.
Even cell phones and cars...

265
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,010
You said that you followed a truck
and saw that EMP?

266
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:11,320
Did you see the driver of the
truck install the EMP?

267
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,630
No, I did not.

268
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,020
Agent Han mentioned about a
possibility of someone inside sniping.

269
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,440
Possibility of someone inside sniping?

270
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,020
That someone had opened the
tennis court gate?

271
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,840
If someone had opened the gate
to the tennis court

272
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:37,350
then there would have been
a direct line of sight.

273
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,870
We also saw the trace of the gate opening.

274
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:44,300
I heard that the tennis court
gate was closed at the time.

275
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,270
- Is that true?
- What?

276
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,830
The agents that were guarding
the court testified so.

277
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,950
Did Chief Ham Bong Soo plan this alone?

278
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,360
I don't know.

279
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,710
What about Colonel Yang's death?
Did you really see the murderer?

280
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,620
I already testified to the detective.

281
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,130
That truck was not
just involved in the sniping.

282
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,900
Minister Han Ki Joon's accident.

283
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,110
Also arson in my area are also related.

284
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,060
But someone is hiding the
evidence. We have to investigate.

285
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,860
Are you sure?

286
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,230
Do you have proof?

287
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,600
I don't have proof, but...

288
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,210
I see.

289
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,200
Let's call it the day.

290
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,340
Your passport will be suspended
for a while.

291
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,530
We will have a committee hearing soon.

292
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,110
Please cooperate again.

293
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,450
By the way...

294
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:47,130
Aren't you going to ask
for the license plate number?

295
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,720
The truck's license plate number.

296
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,490
If... what you say is true

297
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,820
it's likely to be a stolen vehicle.

298
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,520
We will look further into it.

299
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,190
You can go back.

300
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:20,150
The Blue House is verifying all of the
Special Prosecutor's sources.

301
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,270
We will prepare opposing evidence soon.

302
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,790
Why don't you ask me the question?

303
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:33,010
Why don't you ask me
if the report is true?

304
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:38,110
To me, it's not important
if it's true or not.

305
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:43,730
What's important to me is
maintaining this administration.

306
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,140
But sir...

307
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,180
One thing bothers me.

308
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:55,710
There was a large scale
blackout and a gun fight.

309
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,030
But NIS, military police, or the police...

310
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,940
None of the intelligence
agencies reported or called.

311
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:13,110
Even America must have seen that something
was going on from the satellite pictures.

312
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,470
But no movement at all.

313
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,780
I believe there are two possibilities.

314
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,390
Whether it was too late
for there to be any report.

315
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,770
Or someone is intentionally
blocking the intelligence.

316
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,670
Then let's ask directly.

317
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,350
NIS Director, MP General, and
the head of my party.

318
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,240
- Call them.
- Right now, sir?

319
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,820
Like you said, no one did anything.

320
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,730
Shouldn't I say something as the President?

321
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,720
But...

322
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,530
You need to relax for a while.

323
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:13,330
- Call them, right now.
- Yes sir.

324
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,880
Wait, there's one more.

325
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,800
We will re-investigate Colonel Yang's death.

326
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,980
We found some major flaws
in the investigation logs.

327
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,990
We will need your cooperation again.

328
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,300
You're still one of the suspects.

329
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,730
You said that it was not important
who the President was!

330
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,850
<i>He is not my President.</i>

331
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:36,170
Special Prosecutor report is true.

332
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,740
There is a place you need to go with me.

333
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,250
- Han Tae  Kyung.
- The Secret Service?

334
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:08,790
I don't think...
I can do it any longer.

335
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,650
- Come in.
- What are you doing?

336
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,720
What do you think? You've
never been to a place like this?

337
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,730
- Soju please.
- Okay.

338
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,020
You know that you have the same face.

339
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:57,200
When I first saw you.

340
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,630
You had the same face at
your father's funeral.

341
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:08,670
A face not knowing what to do
when it's just too hard to bear.

342
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,770
Don't torture yourself and
at least scream or something.

343
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:21,060
If it's hard to do it while sober,
then try to drink or something.

344
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,550
That will clear it up.

345
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:52,450
You want to be alone? I'm going
to leave. Try to let it out before you go.

346
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,530
There is one day when agents
can let their guard down.

347
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,830
- Drop!
- Drop!

348
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,060
On off-duty days like today!

349
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,320
<i>Drop it, drop it.</i>

350
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,680
It's the first day off
for the recruits right?

351
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,590
- Yes, sir.
- Drink up.

352
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,670
Han Tae Kyung!
Drink up!

353
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,290
Drink up! That's an order.

354
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:12,770
Yes sir!

355
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,990
Did you check the next event location?

356
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,210
- Done sir!
- It's karaoke upstairs!

357
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,630
Drink all you want but do not
lose your dignity!

358
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,070
Yes sir!

359
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,420
- Live or die!
- Secret Service!

360
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,420
Die! Die tonight.

361
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,740
Good work sir.

362
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,260
Does the Chief live alone?

363
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,980
- What about his wife?
- Wife? What wife?

364
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,580
You need to get married to have a wife.

365
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,880
He gave up on a normal life
a long time ago.

366
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,730
- Let's see...
- You want a cup of water?

367
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:11,070
No.

368
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:22,670
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

369
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,140
What are you doing?

370
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,550
Is this his old picture?
When is this?

371
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:32,930
- Pretend that you've never seen it.
- Huh?

372
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,790
Pretend that you've never seen it.

373
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,090
It's the most painful memory
he has. Don't ask him.

374
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,910
Understand?

375
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,380
Yes sir.

376
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,340
Are you okay sir?

377
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,270
- If anything bothers you...
- Is everyone here?

378
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,160
Yes.

379
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,730
I didn't think all of them would
come this late at hour.

380
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,760
Maybe there is a reason that
they have to attend.

381
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:44,640
Is there a problem?

382
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,890
I need to ask you another favor.

383
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,560
I want all of you to wait here.

384
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,680
It won't take long.

385
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,880
Yes sir.

386
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,740
The Secret Service told me
that they did the screening.

387
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,210
There's no bomb or audio bugs.

388
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,590
No hidden cameras.

389
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:37,020
Although I'm sure that you came
to confirm beforehand.

390
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,840
Long time no see.

391
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,710
Yes.

392
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:05,060
I'm Falcon's dog.

393
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:11,420
- Then whose dogs are you?
- Watch your language.

394
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,340
The country's economy
is at stake

395
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,750
and people are selling their gold
birth rings to help the country.

396
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:23,510
But the rich and powerful
of this country...

397
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:29,490
are trying to fill their wallets
by selling this country.

398
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:35,490
I've never seen any of them
selling their gold watches.

399
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,960
But we still have no one to blame.

400
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,240
Capitalism.

401
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,640
There is no conscience or name on money.

402
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:52,290
It's just money.

403
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,850
So if you're dogs, then act like one.

404
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,960
You're not here to save this country.

405
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,450
Won't you ask for your cut
when this is over?

406
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:18,650
Whether that'd be money or power.

407
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:30,210
Mr. Lee Dong Hee,
we stand by corrected.

408
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:33,400
If this operation goes smoothly...

409
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,650
I guarantee that every
one of you will be satisfied.

410
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,460
You're working so hard for this country.

411
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:44,060
Don't you deserve such rewards?

412
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:49,670
Now...

413
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,740
Is everything settled?

414
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:15,390
Good work.

415
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:19,390
Falcon always appreciates your service.

416
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:32,150
Are you startled to see the person
here, who should be dead already?

417
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:37,370
I have no idea what you're talking about.

418
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,970
I told you.

419
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,600
Stop what you're about to do.

420
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,460
You think we wanted to do this?

421
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:56,650
Everything went smoothly since then.
We supported you, we embraced you...

422
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:02,500
It was you, who gave
these people their jobs.

423
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:11,790
It was you, who betrayed us first.

424
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,670
If you wanted to drown, you
should have drowned alone.

425
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:18,500
Why, why drag us along?

426
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,440
You betrayed me first.

427
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:51,000
Now tell me.

428
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:54,710
You wanted two things?

429
00:52:55,370 --> 00:53:00,110
Our plan...
make sure that it goes impeccably.

430
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,060
Just a submarine making a quiet trip.

431
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:09,300
No casualties.

432
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,500
That's a given.

433
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,030
A show is just a show.

434
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,150
What's the other one?

435
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:26,460
Help me so that I don't live
as Falcon's dog any longer.

436
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,530
I kept my word.

437
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:49,450
You're no longer Falcon's dog.

438
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,040
You're the President of Republic of Korea.
Are you not?

439
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,390
Yes.

440
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:03,170
As you say,
I'm the President of this country.

441
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,850
Attempt of murder on the President
falls under national treason.

442
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:14,830
Even you people, who were
born on a pile of gold...

443
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,750
will be punished by death.

444
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,530
I have no idea what you're saying.

445
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,330
Oh!

446
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:27,720
I heard that someone tried to harm you.

447
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,860
But...

448
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:35,670
Wasn't that solely done by
the Chief Officer, Ham Bong Soo?

449
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:43,870
No matter what happens...
I will uncover your conspiracy.

450
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:49,470
What you have done.

451
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:54,220
I will make sure you pay more
than just with your deaths.

452
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,870
I have nothing more to lose.

453
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:09,410
See how imposing a person can be
when he has nothing more to lose.

454
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:23,140
Stop.

455
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:26,330
You said so yourself.

456
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:29,070
If you're a dog, then act like one.

457
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,180
I also told you.

458
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:39,050
I will no longer be someone's dog.

459
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,770
Here! Here!

460
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:14,120
The pass code is 99112 star.

461
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:56,230
What is this?

462
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,870
He had a point.

463
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:06,410
Lee Dong Hee is still the President.

464
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:10,040
<i>If people find out that we
tried to kill him</i>

465
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,110
<i>we're on the losing side.</i>

466
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,660
One of us has to die.

467
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,720
There is only one way for us to live.

468
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:23,820
Chief was not alone.

469
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:28,600
The President needs to die for us to live.

470
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,550
There is one more.

471
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,020
<i>[March 7th 05:40
30 hours and 40 minutes after sniping]</i>

<i>We're switching to Plan B.</i>

478
