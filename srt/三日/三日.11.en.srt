1
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,570
Chief of Staff Shin Kyu Jin...

2
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,500
You have to find it, Tae Kyung.

3
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,890
Why didn't you say Chief of Staff Shin Kyu
Jin had a copy of the classified document?

4
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,100
The copy the Chief of Staff has...

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,020
It doesn't have to be paper document.

6
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,960
As of now, I'm letting you go from
the position of Chief of Staff.

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,980
It's in a USB.

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,580
I'll deliver it to your office myself.

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,449
I will take it.

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,950
I'm going myself.

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,350
Leave.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,040
President Lee is on his way to the special
prosecution's office with the document.

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,960
Turn the car around.

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,700
Turn...

15
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,300
the car around.

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,490
Episode 11

17
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,850
Just a moment.

18
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:20,110
Why are you doing this?

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,529
Why are you doing this?

20
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,290
Why?

21
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,290
Tell me why?

22
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,420
Move.

23
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,140
That's enough, Han Tae Kyung.

24
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,210
Move!

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
That's enough. Leave.

26
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,200
You'll cover up the Yangjinri incident.

27
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,460
What is the reason?

28
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,170
I know nothing will change
even if I fight it.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
Why now?

30
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,090
There is no point in further sacrifice.

31
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,450
Postpone the impeachment.

32
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,210
Then...

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,510
I will return to being your faithful dog.

34
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,990
The VIP is coming down. Get ready to leave.

35
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,310
I just need a moment.

36
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,520
Just a moment.

37
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,130
I want to know why you are doing this.

38
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,700
Can't you just trust me?

39
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,710
I...

40
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,330
can't trust you.

41
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,710
Do you know how we got that evidence?
How we got it in your hands?

42
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,700
Protect Agent Lee Cha Young.

43
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,290
She got hurt because of me.

44
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,290
It's Kim Do Jin.

45
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,970
Postpone...

46
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,560
the impeachment.

47
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,040
Why are you so late?

48
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,350
Where is the copy?

49
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
The evidence?

50
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,940
He handed over the evidence to Chairman
Kim Do Jin to postpone the impeachment?

51
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,480
The President put the truth above
impeachment when I met him.

52
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,660
Nevertheless, it's true.

53
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,860
Going to Jaesin Headquarters
to meet the Chairman...

54
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,180
was the President's doing.

55
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,090
You said $100 million was deposited
in a secret account in China.

56
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,920
Our investigation confirmed that as well.

57
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,746
Yunnan Bank of China account
managed by Han Gi Joon.

58
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:42,040
There may be something bigger going on
than the Yangjinri sixteen years ago.

59
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,521
The President might have made
the deal in order to prevent it.

60
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,750
I don't understand.

61
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,289
If the classified document was made public,

62
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,570
it would have ended this by sending
Chairman Kim and his accomplices to jail.

63
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
But why...

64
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,460
How long will making the document public
and sending the Chairman to jail take?

65
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,759
He will hire the best legal defense.

66
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,689
He would look for another scapegoat while
denying the contents of the document.

67
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,699
A first trial, a second trial...

68
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,969
It would drag on and on.

69
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,940
During that time, who
knows what might happen?

70
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,410
If we find out why that
$100 million was sent,

71
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,680
we will know why the
President made his decision.

72
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,950
Do you trust the President?

73
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,970
The special prosecution
indicted the President.

74
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,400
But... Why do you trust him?

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,930
You must have been with
the President until now.

76
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,840
Why don't you trust him, Agent Han?

77
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,020
How is she?

78
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,330
She'll be okay as long as
she regains consciousness.

79
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,590
We have to wait and see.

80
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,460
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,690
It's all my fault.

82
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,469
No.

83
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,530
It's mine.

84
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,440
I thought I knew Cha Young
better than anyone.

85
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,710
I should have trusted her.

86
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,390
I cornered her.

87
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,110
I know how she is.

88
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,800
Of course, she wouldn't do that.

89
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,290
Because of my suspicion...

90
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,610
I made you...

91
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,390
waver.

92
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,070
Agent...

93
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,520
Jaesin's people are here.

94
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,299
Yes.

95
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,239
He said he was a work colleague.

96
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,419
And asked how patient
Lee Cha Young was doing.

97
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,180
Exactly what did he ask?

98
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,850
He asked about her probability
of regaining consciousness.

99
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
Why are they targeting...

100
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,150
Agent Lee Cha Young?

101
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,120
The copy has already been
turned over to Chairman Kim.

102
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,920
It wasn't a copy.

103
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,810
The document Cha Young found
in the Chief of Staff's car

104
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,040
revealed something she
wasn't supposed to see.

105
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,189
I'll ask Special Prosecutor Choi
Ji Hoon for witness protection.

106
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,120
Watch over Cha Young
until the police arrive.

107
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,349
Is there anyone left from
the economic counsel?

108
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:38,910
Yes.

109
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,670
Ask them to gather the most recent economic
report by the deceased Han Gi Joon.

110
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,500
Which economic division?

111
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:54,110
Bring over the reports that include
recent foreign transactions.

112
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,690
The President is reviewing
the economic reports.

113
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,190
This is why we should have
pushed for impeachment.

114
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,610
The impeachment has not been
rejected, just postponed.

115
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,330
We just need to manage the
vote before 8am tomorrow.

116
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,569
So before then,

117
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,050
we need to get that document
out of Lee Dong Hwi's hands.

118
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,210
If we postpone the impeachment,

119
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,430
you will return to being a faithful dog?

120
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,109
And...

121
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,580
The investigation of Agent Han Tae Kyung,

122
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,190
along with the investigation of
the Secret Service, stop them all.

123
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,040
If I refuse?

124
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,990
Then...

125
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,530
The contents saved here will
be on the news tonight.

126
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,773
You may be able to sway
the nation's media. But

127
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,870
you won't be able to
control the foreign media.

128
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,680
There are only ten minutes
left until voting.

129
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,720
Since you're intelligent and skillful,

130
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,400
take care of it.

131
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,890
What?

132
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,290
Do you want to use brute force?

133
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,480
Do you want to see who
is stronger between...

134
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,381
the Blue House Secret Service
and Jaesin's security team?

135
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,610
In here,

136
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,800
there is a contract with
your signature on it.

137
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,290
Remember that.

138
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,540
Are you planning to use personnel
inside the Blue House?

139
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,430
There is one perfect person.

140
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,880
Someone who wants to kill Lee
Dong Hwi even more than me.

141
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,970
Chief of Staff Shin Kyu Jin.

142
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,870
We need to use him wisely.

143
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,520
The President is not in
the right state of mind.

144
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,990
He's trying to stop the
impeachment process.

145
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,600
I advised him to resign from his position.

146
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,830
But in the end, I was fired.

147
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,150
Why...

148
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,939
was the impeachment postponed so suddenly?

149
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:46,040
The President met with the party
members and threatened them directly.

150
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
However...

151
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,910
the impeachment will go through.

152
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,650
The nation has already turned
against the President.

153
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,320
It's time for you to step in, Minister.

154
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
I will...

155
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,560
support you.

156
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,619
What happened to the impeachment vote?

157
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,150
Will it resume?

158
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,590
It must.

159
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,070
You should have taken
better care of the copy.

160
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,730
That's why this happened.

161
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,130
Don't worry. I will get it back.

162
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,800
Don't forget our promise.

163
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,900
Was that Chairman Kim Do Jin?

164
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,530
So the President still has the copy.

165
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,529
I have nothing to say to you.

166
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,529
The $100 million sent to the North...

167
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,530
What is it?

168
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,230
What are you planning with Chairman Kim?

169
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,870
Chief of Staff...

170
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,979
You were in charge of the Blue House
administration with the President.

171
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,490
Why would such a person...

172
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,810
make such a dirty deal?

173
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,730
A dirty deal?

174
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,050
The President was the one
who made a dirty deal.

175
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,300
This nation is in turmoil
because of the President.

176
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,220
If you want to blame, go to the Blue House.

177
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,430
The document inside your car...

178
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,860
what was in it?

179
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,329
I don't know what you're talking about.

180
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,030
Cha Young saw the document.

181
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,000
Now, someone is trying to kill her.

182
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,240
What are you saying?

183
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,690
Cha Young isn't the only
one who knows the contents.

184
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,980
You are in danger, too.

185
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,930
Cha Young saw the document.

186
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,440
Now, someone is trying to kill her.

187
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,270
Can I speak to Prosecutor Choi Ji Hoon?

188
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,290
He's in a meeting.

189
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,779
Can you verify something?

190
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,849
Agent Han Tae Kyung
requested witness protection.

191
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,000
We got the request earlier.
The police are on the way.

192
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,470
They will arrive soon.

193
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Yes.

194
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,040
We got an order for witness
protection from Prosecutor Choi.

195
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,900
The order was to move
her to a safer hospital.

196
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,510
Shin Jin Police Department has
an officer named Jung Sang Hoon.

197
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,990
But he was killed in the
line of duty last year.

198
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,780
Jung Sang Hoon

199
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Don't move.

200
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,390
What are you doing?

201
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,250
Push the first floor button.

202
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,830
Push it.

203
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,620
Get out.

204
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Get out.

205
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,370
Don't come near.

206
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,830
Stop.

207
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,440
Incident Report

208
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,620
The stolen gelatin dynamite is

209
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,910
Quantity 16, 1 box. Total 35 lbs.

210
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,710
A bomb.

211
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,610
Cha Young.

212
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,760
Are you awake?

213
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,200
Hold on. I'll get a doctor.

214
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,570
Dynamite.

215
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,030
The bombs were stolen, Tae Kyung.

216
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,130
People...

217
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,130
could get hurt.

218
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,900
Hurry.

219
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,429
I never got word of witness protection.

220
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,610
You were in a meeting,
so I told an employee.

221
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,060
Me, too.

222
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,340
It was a young man.

223
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,110
Chairman Kim has a mole inside
the special prosecution.

224
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,650
The man who attacked Agent Lee Cha Young...

225
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,920
What happened to him?

226
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,410
He is receiving treatment
for a gunshot wound.

227
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,090
He'll be interrogated by division
when regaining consciousness.

228
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,030
But there is...

229
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,830
a more urgent reason I contacted you.

230
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,270
You came to say your final good-bye?

231
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Yes.

232
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,310
When I first met Chairman Kim Do Jin,

233
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,049
I was a consultant for Falcon.

234
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,889
Chairman Kim...

235
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:10,940
was a giddy child playing
with Jaesin Group.

236
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,319
I heard about you from my deceased father.

237
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,230
You were a top consultant in the US.

238
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,980
There is a saying that
opportunity comes with crisis.

239
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,839
If IMF rescue fund were to start now,

240
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,919
the excited ones...

241
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,320
will be people with money.

242
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,399
What do you think?

243
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,630
In this situation,

244
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,500
how can Jaesin profit?

245
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,600
It depends on how much profit you want.

246
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,970
An amount unimaginable to most people.

247
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,140
An enormous amount.

248
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:12,110
Then in a few years,
create another IMF situation.

249
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,270
Are you joking?

250
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,360
Even if I wanted to,
how can IMF be recreated?

251
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,290
It's possible in a divided
country like ours.

252
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,830
Work with the North and
create conditions for war.

253
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,800
Conspire with the North and plot an
assassination attempt on the President...

254
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,670
or blow up key industries...

255
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,480
or a terrorist attack in
the middle of Seoul...

256
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,920
If the US declares the worst case
scenario between the North and South,

257
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,960
the foreign investment funds
will disappear immediately.

258
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,980
That is the start of IMF.

259
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,530
Dynamite?

260
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,230
Are you sure?

261
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,650
Yes.

262
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,670
I'm sure.

263
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,999
Incident Report

264
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,540
Quantity 16, 1 box. Total 35 lbs.

265
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,940
It was a record showing...

266
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,140
industrial dynamite disappearing
from various locations.

267
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,800
The locations...

268
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,750
were spread across the nation.

269
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,089
If they were lost that way, there would
be no way to know how much went missing

270
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,230
unless a wide investigation
wasn't launched.

271
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,500
What amount?

272
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,250
I simply glimpsed at it, but...

273
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,430
It was over 90 pounds.

274
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,069
We need to know more.

275
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,310
There might be more thefts
we don't know about.

276
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,550
Then the explosive capacity may increase.

277
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,220
With that amount...

278
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,520
there will be massive causalities.

279
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,090
The $100 million to the
North, the dynamite...

280
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,110
What is Chairman Kim up to?

281
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,360
Work with the North...

282
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,670
and create a second IMF situation.

283
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,570
That's an interesting thought.

284
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,640
I told you earlier.

285
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,990
There is opportunity in crisis.

286
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,140
If you can predict the timing of IMF...

287
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:32,012
you can earn an enormous
amount of money

288
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:36,120
through futures and stock
option deals. But...

289
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,850
there is one condition.

290
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:47,720
You'd have to be a crazy bastard who
won't care about the nation's ruin.

291
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,670
To earn money like that.

292
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,540
Of course, this crazy bastard
can't do it on his own.

293
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,049
Politicians, police,
prosecution and military...

294
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,640
similar crazies would all
need to work together.

295
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,990
If not...

296
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,920
you'll go to jail for
selling out the nation.

297
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:15,620
Do you want to earn money
bad enough to go crazy?

298
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:27,620
You're not saying Chairman Kim is planning
a second IMF using North Korea, are you?

299
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,340
What did he tell you?

300
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,249
Use North to make money...

301
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,299
If the government cooperates...

302
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,729
you will be put in charge
of the Blue House...

303
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,800
No citizens will be harmed.
Is that what he told you?

304
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,750
I'm sure you pretended to believe him,

305
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,320
but you were wary.

306
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:54,430
Isn't that why you investigated
this nations bomb inventory?

307
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,570
I never did that.

308
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,330
I...

309
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,130
am wary.

310
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,270
The joke I made at the dinner...

311
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,010
is being carried out by Chairman Kim.

312
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,040
My consulting created
the Yangjinri incident

313
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,750
and created the
monster Kim Do Jin.

314
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,870
I started it.

315
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,160
So I must end it.

316
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,269
As President, I will
stop it no matter what.

317
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:35,679
Please cooperate with me.

318
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Don't...

319
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,100
be used by them anymore.

320
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,680
Why are you lying?

321
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,349
Do you need me again?

322
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,350
So...

323
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,950
do you want me to be satisfied
being second to you?

324
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,620
Is that it?

325
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,290
No.

326
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,310
You're already...

327
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
done.

328
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,820
I will start over.

329
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
I...

330
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,310
am different from you.

331
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,740
I will create...

332
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,850
a much better nation.

333
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,300
Did Chairman Kim...

334
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,230
ask you to bring the copy?

335
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,390
Take it.

336
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,459
Let's see if you're different.

337
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,490
If you can create a better nation...

338
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,580
I'm curious, too.

339
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,120
You were never second.

340
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,840
You were my best assistant.

341
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,130
If you want to come back...

342
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,760
please come anytime.

343
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,790
Agent Han Tae Kyung is here.

344
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,560
Why did you come?

345
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,510
Agent Lee Cha Young...

346
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,470
How is she?

347
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,770
She's recuperating.

348
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,470
But we have to wait and see.

349
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,560
I see.

350
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
I have a favor to ask you.

351
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,990
Can you come to tomorrow's
State Department meeting?

352
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,140
What do you mean?

353
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,890
I don't understand.

354
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,559
Come to the State Department meeting...

355
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,570
and give testimony on the explosive
document found by Agent Lee Cha Young.

356
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,770
So you knew...

357
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,640
about the dynamite?

358
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,080
If you knew...

359
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,610
shouldn't you have protected Cha Young?

360
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,990
You hid the contents of the copy...

361
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,160
I don't understand.

362
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,060
Even excuses are okay.

363
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,990
Say something.

364
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,360
Please.

365
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,470
I hope you participate tomorrow.

366
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
Tae Kyung.

367
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,970
Thank goodness.

368
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,090
I always worry.

369
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,150
Are you okay?

370
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,770
I'm okay.

371
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,460
I just...

372
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,490
did what I had to do.

373
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,680
So...

374
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,460
You...

375
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,580
do what you have to do.

376
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,650
March 11, 13 hours before automatic
cancellation of impeachment

377
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,200
Are preparations complete?

378
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,150
Yes.

379
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,810
You've come.

380
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,580
Good.

381
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,439
Will the Prime Minister and
Secretaries believe us?

382
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,310
The President is calling
the state meeting himself.

383
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,369
Along with the missing dynamite...

384
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,579
if they ask about the $100
million given to the North,

385
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,080
there should be a way to stop Chairman Kim.

386
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,970
Has the meeting started?

387
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,940
No one has come?

388
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,870
You said...

389
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,280
even excuses are okay?

390
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,640
As a result...

391
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,570
of covering up the Yangjinri incident...

392
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,590
I bought one day.

393
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,380
I knew what would happen.

394
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,820
I couldn't let it go.

395
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,120
Chairman Kim...

396
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,530
If I don't have direct
evidence against him...

397
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,060
and if I wasn't the President,

398
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,380
there was no way to stop him.

399
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,740
You're right, Agent Han.

400
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,780
As the President,

401
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,010
I should have protected the people.

402
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,450
Agent Lee Cha Young...

403
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,120
It's true that I put her
in a deadly situation.

404
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,320
If by doing so,

405
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,790
I could maintain the position of President,

406
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,100
I felt like I could do anything.

407
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,430
But alone...

408
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,970
I can't do anything.

409
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,470
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

410
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,610
Prosecutor Choi Ji Hoon.

411
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,250
Agent Lee Cha Young at the hospital...

412
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,820
To all who worked so hard,

413
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,290
I'm sorry.

414
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,970
The President I know,

415
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,050
was always righteous.

416
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,240
Even back then,

417
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,210
you didn't waver.

418
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,580
Even if people died,

419
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,900
you said you wouldn't give up.

420
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,120
You asked me to protect you.

421
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,949
I will.

422
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,280
I will help you.

423
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,100
I will do whatever I can.

424
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,150
Raise your head.

425
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,710
Because you are the President
of the Republic of Korea.

426
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,860
Did you find out?

427
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,719
Our hunch was correct.

428
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,579
When I asked Prosecutor Choi,
there were several similar cases.

429
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,519
The total amount of missing dynamite...

430
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,540
is over 220 pounds.

431
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,890
Let's go in.

432
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Here it is.

433
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,250
Agent.

434
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,170
The cell phone.

435
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,810
It'll be awhile.

436
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,140
Hold on.

437
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,790
There it is.

438
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,210
The GPS records for the cell phone.

439
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,559
Do you know how to read the
time and location of the GPS?

440
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,609
Yes.

441
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,710
Thank you.

442
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,210
If you compare the missing dynamite
locations with the cell phone GPS,

443
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,690
we can find out where
they took the dynamite.

444
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,430
The first is a construction site
in Gyeonggi's Pyeongtaek Jagang.

445
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,690
The dynamite went missing between
2am and 3am on March 9th.

446
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,980
March 9th, 02:08.

447
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,680
Latitude and longitude are exact.

448
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,180
The owner of the cell
phone was at the location.

449
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,710
Jaesin stole the dynamite.

450
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,660
The second...

451
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,130
Chungnam Boryung's
waterway construction site.

452
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,470
The missing dynamite matches
the GPS records in all eight location.

453
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,470
Jaesin Group stole the dynamite.

454
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,340
Where they took it is more important.

455
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,830
Where they moved it and their
targets. We must find out.

456
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,379
You didn't come when
I called, so I came myself.

457
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,110
Have a seat.

458
00:41:06,111 --> 00:41:07,370
I'm sorry.

459
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,440
I had an important breakfast meeting.

460
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,230
I have no time so I'll speak quickly.

461
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,630
Have you received the report
showing recent foreign fund transfers?

462
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:25,070
Transactions have increased dramatically
for our Won and KOSPI's commodities.

463
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,540
In addition, the exchange
rate is increasing, too.

464
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,339
Why suddenly?

465
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,110
It means that foreign
investments are moving.

466
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,810
Someone is spreading rumors
the Korean economy is unstable.

467
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,789
Once bank runs begin...

468
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,990
foreign funds will rapidly disappear.

469
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:44,270
I don't know what you mean.

470
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,490
Korea's economic instability?

471
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,990
What can become unstable
at a time like this?

472
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,980
In the case of...

473
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,910
the possibility of a war crisis.

474
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,570
What...

475
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,650
Recently, $100 million went to North Korea.

476
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,440
Using the same account used
in the Yangjinri incident.

477
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,140
The Yangjinri incident?

478
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,909
Is someone using North Korea
to make the nation unstable?

479
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,980
Yes.

480
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,580
By creating the false military crisis,

481
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:17,739
they are trying to profit by selling
off their commodities in advance.

482
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,740
In that situation,

483
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,760
Korea's economy will become bankrupt.

484
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Then what?

485
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,730
A second IMF.

486
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,939
In order to prevent this crime,

487
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,697
I will ask for the immediate
economic authority to

488
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:37,640
control foreign funds to
increase economic stability.

489
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:42,310
I need the help of ministry officials
along with you, Minister.

490
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,020
Do you need another issue in
order to prevent impeachment?

491
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,980
Minister.

492
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,100
I...

493
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,520
cannot follow you.

494
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,000
Lee Dong Hwi met with the Prime Minister.

495
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,507
Talking about economic
instability, he asked for

496
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:05,630
urgent economic authority
to control foreign funds.

497
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,700
So... Did the Minister sign?

498
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:12,150
He refused, but the President
is continuing his efforts.

499
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,910
We must restart the impeachment process.

500
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,210
Representative Min Hyun Kyu is on
standby at the National Assembly.

501
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,489
A guest has arrived.

502
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:27,640
I'll call you back.

503
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,510
I waited a long time.

504
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,030
Have a seat.

505
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,080
Did you bring it?

506
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,430
I heard something interesting
at the Blue House.

507
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,600
What are you talking about?

508
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,170
You're planning something much bigger...

509
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,140
than what I know.

510
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:25,740
In order to make such immense profits,
you're planning something huge.

511
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,480
Who said that gibberish?

512
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,480
The President?

513
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,010
You will...

514
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,090
get something bigger...

515
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,930
than an immense profit.

516
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,750
Where do you think we'll spend that money?

517
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,570
Just like Lee Dong Hwi,

518
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,310
you will be heading for the Blue House.

519
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,240
Not as Chief of Staff,

520
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,160
but as the new President.

521
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:03,660
So...

522
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,100
Give me...

523
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,180
that item...

524
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,940
I will handle the rest.

525
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,030
Shin Kyu Jin is coming this way.

526
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Then kill him.

527
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,940
Proceed with the impeachment process.

528
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,689
With one hour remaining before the
impeachment is automatically canceled,

529
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,859
both parties have agreed
to restart the impeachment.

530
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,889
They are headed into the meeting room.

531
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:07,029
Eighty percent of the nation supports
the President's impeachment proceedings.

532
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,570
There is great anticipation for
the impeachment voting results.

533
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,109
The nation is focused on whether
the impeachment will go through.

534
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:14,690
The impeachment must go through.

535
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,040
Our party is in agreement.

536
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,550
220 pounds of dynamite?

537
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,950
What will they do with it?

538
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,650
Key industrial explosion is most likely.

539
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:29,910
I...

540
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,590
don't believe you.

541
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,410
Yes.

542
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:44,840
Have you found out?

543
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:47,910
We found the location of the
dynamite stolen by Jaesin Group.

544
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,939
But after they stole the explosives,

545
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,460
they headed to Daeseungri
where Lee Chul Kyu was.

546
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:57,880
Daeseungri Power Plant

547
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:02,540
Chairman Kim Do Jin is targeting a
power plant located in Daeseungri.

548
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,360
Notify...

549
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,290
the Chief of Police immediately.

550
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,480
The Chief of Police?

551
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,490
Endorse it.

552
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,170
It hasn't even been confirmed.

553
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:26,380
I told you $100 million was
transferred to North Korea.

554
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,710
Someone is trying to profit
by creating a military crisis.

555
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:34,580
Who are you saying is behind this?

556
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,920
Jaesin Group's...

557
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,890
Chairman Kim Do Jin.

558
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,840
Prosecutor Choi Jin Hoon.

559
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,859
The impeachment decision is upon us...

560
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,650
How do you feel?

561
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:09,149
What will today's press conference address?

562
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,270
Make a statement.

563
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,240
What happened?

564
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,970
- Call 911.
- Yes.

565
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,400
Chief!

566
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,310
It's the classified document.

567
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,550
Classified Document 98

568
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:26,410
I...

569
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,480
told you...

570
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,880
I'm different.

571
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:48,900
Anonymous voting in the impeachment
of President Lee Dong Hwi will begin.

572
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,210
Truth behind the Yangjinri incident

573
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,660
Chief of Staff Shin delivered Classified
Document 98 to Prosecutor Choi.

574
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:03,490
Urgent Presidential
Economic Authority Request

575
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,860
Minister.

576
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,730
There is no time.

577
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,750
I will sign it.

578
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,990
What is it?

579
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,360
Former Chief of Staff Shin Kyu Jin...

580
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,930
died after giving Prosecutor Choi
Ji Hoon Classified Document 98.

581
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,979
Classified document.

582
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,260
The contents of that document...

583
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,490
have been published on the Internet
by the Special Prosecution.

584
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:11,970
Special Report.

585
00:52:11,971 --> 00:52:18,029
The shocking truth behind the Yangjinri
incident of 1998 has been revealed.

586
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,262
The contents revealed
by Joint Chiefs of

587
00:52:19,274 --> 00:52:20,640
Staff Chairman Kwon who
committed suicide...

588
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,869
are in opposition with the
evidence found in this document.

589
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,090
The culprit behind the
Yangjinri incident...

590
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
Yes.

591
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,980
What?

592
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,110
No explosives were found?

593
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,909
What do you mean?

594
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,489
We got word from the team
dispatched to the power plant.

595
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,180
And?

596
00:52:40,181 --> 00:52:43,060
Dynamite was not discovered
at the power plant.

597
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,220
A guest is waiting for you.

598
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:17,760
The Prime Minister and the Parliament
endorsed the economic order.

599
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,640
Congratulations.

600
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,800
You have an ace up your sleeve.

601
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,100
What have you come to say?

602
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,000
Well-played.

603
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,510
If you hadn't come to me then

604
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,910
and just revealed the classified document,

605
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:40,239
you would have lost the presidency...

606
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,960
and you wouldn't have been able to stop me.

607
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,050
The validity of the Classified Document...

608
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,090
would have dragged on in court.

609
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,279
I lost this time.

610
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,769
I acknowledge it.

611
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:56,830
Thanks to you...

612
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,510
my plans...

613
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,050
have been ruined.

614
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,800
But...

615
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:08,360
when I think about it...

616
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,860
I have one card...

617
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:14,790
left to play.

618
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,329
Did you get my request?

619
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:23,220
I researched the cell phone GPS.

620
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:27,370
After staying in Daeseungri
for an hour, they left for Seoul.

621
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,290
They...

622
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,329
didn't find explosives at the power plant?

623
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:37,409
Then what about other
records on the cell phone?

624
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,809
Have you looked into it?

625
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,009
It was mostly calls.

626
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,639
There were no saved numbers.

627
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,240
But the strange thing was,
they took a train out of Daeseungri.

628
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,900
Then they transferred to a car.

629
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,020
Why would they go through the trouble?

630
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
At the time...

631
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:57,100
There was a military deserter.

632
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:59,090
What do you mean?

633
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,339
When I went to Daeseungri,

634
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,890
there were inspections
related to a military desertion.

635
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,590
Inspections are a result of a desertion...

636
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,099
The original plan...

637
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,680
was to install the explosives
at the power plant.

638
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,529
But due to the desertion,

639
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,980
the inspections became more strict.

640
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,399
In that situation,

641
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:40,190
It's impossible to approach in a car
filled with dynamite or pass the toll gate.

642
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,289
So they left the car.

643
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:44,430
And divided the dynamite.

644
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,530
They don't inspect small bags.

645
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,490
With the dynamite in small bags,

646
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,170
they left the area by train.

647
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,170
Then...

648
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,040
where are...

649
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,160
the explosives?

650
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,000
There were 24 causalities
and 19 injured in Yangjinri.

651
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:27,670
How many this time?

652
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,710
Long ago then, you told me.

653
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:39,270
An assassination attempt on the
President or blow up key industries,

654
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,990
or a terrorist attack
in the middle of Seoul.

655
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,030
When, where, how?

656
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,360
Aren't you curious...

657
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,130
how people will die?

658
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:21,710
When...

659
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,250
will people die...

660
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,100
Aren't you curious?

661
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Where?

662
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,460
How?

663
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,909
Chairman Kim Do Jin.

664
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:03,900
Make him give up.

665
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:07,470
I will kill anyone who stands in my way.

666
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:08,769
Try it if you can.

667
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:12,609
Let's play this out and
see who the winner is.

668
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,397
A strange piece of paper
was discovered from

669
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:16,049
one of the captured
Jaesin Group member.

670
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,479
Something strange is written.

671
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,079
It's a bus. A bus number.

672
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,720
They're all city buses.

673
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,150
The buses are leaving at the busiest time.

674
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:24,390
We have to stop the bus.

675
00:58:24,391 --> 00:58:26,920
Hundreds of lives are at stake.

676
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:28,940
Should I detonate?

677
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,090
Detonate.
