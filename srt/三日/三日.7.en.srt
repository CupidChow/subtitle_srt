1
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,670
March 8, 05:20, 57 hours and
20 minutes after the shooting.

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,440
Han Tae Kyung.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,020
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,180
What about you?

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,430
I had something to ask
Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon.

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,270
Leaving the front door open was strange.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,390
But no one was here.

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,110
Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman, Kwon Jae Yeon...

9
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,010
just passed away.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
What?

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,250
Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon died?

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,170
Suicide or murder?

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,340
We're confirming as we speak.

14
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:46,950
I'll call back as soon as I find out.

15
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,570
Are you sure?

16
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:51,759
I'm sure.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,460
Someone left Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon's
house right before I arrived.

18
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,400
Who monitors the CCTV in this building?

19
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,070
Episode 7

20
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,430
The Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff died.

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,730
I think someone got to
him before we arrived.

22
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,299
How about the original Classified Document?

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,300
Did you find it?

24
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,721
With so many police in
the vicinity, it will

25
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,780
be impossible to sneak
in to the scene.

26
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,350
We have to find out who killed
Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon.

27
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,259
I'm from special investigations.

28
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,940
Please show me the CCTV recording
from the ninth floor, elevator 8.

29
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,189
What's wrong?

30
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,729
The security company came
out for an inspection.

31
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,160
It looks like it malfunctioned.

32
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,820
It just started happening.
It looks like it has a virus.

33
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,669
How about previous recordings?

34
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,800
Is it possible to restore?

35
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,100
I'm not sure.

36
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,590
I can't guarantee.

37
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
Jaeshin.

38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,220
How about the recording?

39
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,680
You know the EMP source...

40
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,540
Jaeshin Group.

41
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,640
Did you say it was the weapons
research division, Force One?

42
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,080
The place where Hwang
Yoon Jae was arrested.

43
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,950
Also the place where the
President met someone.

44
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,780
The Jaeshin Hotel... Right?

45
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,980
Why?

46
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,059
Where are you going?

47
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,060
To confirm something.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,619
You can't behave rash like this.
You'll be targeted as a suspect.

49
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,499
For now, cooperate with the investigation.
Then you'll avoid suspicion.

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,659
It's okay.

51
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,739
I don't care whether I
become a suspect or not.

52
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,710
Tae Kyung.

53
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,951
I can't think straight ever
since my father passed away.

54
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,190
Nothing is ever clear.

55
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,909
I need confirmation.

56
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,100
Even if it's a small clue.

57
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,320
Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon...

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,170
died?

59
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,620
Yes.

60
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:01,190
We're determining if it
was a suicide or murder.

61
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,660
There's something you should look for.

62
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,460
Excuse me?

63
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,450
There's a document Chairman Kwon
Jae Yeon had in his possession.

64
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,770
Lee Cha Young speaking.

65
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,390
The document Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon had?

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,530
Someone...

67
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,600
risked his life to put it together.

68
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,200
We must find it.

69
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,999
Classified Document 98?

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,920
Yes.

71
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:36,240
That's what he said.

72
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,770
What did you find out?

73
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,980
Who was it?

74
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,360
Shin Kyu Jin.

75
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,210
Presidential Chief of Staff.

76
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,780
We have to find him.

77
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,770
I have something to report.

78
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,479
Report later if it's not urgent.

79
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,610
It's regarding Secretary Han Gi Joon.

80
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,740
Secretary... Han Gi Joon?

81
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,910
When you wanted to place him in office...

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,200
I opposed you.

83
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,729
He was a theoretically
strong economics professor.

84
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,720
But he lacked real life experience.

85
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,070
That's what you had said.

86
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,190
That was one of the reasons.

87
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,790
But the bigger reason was...

88
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,080
the way you two first met.

89
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,330
It bothered me.

90
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,690
The family members of the Secret
Service agents who performed today.

91
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,130
Thank you.

92
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,830
Thank you for your work.

93
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,240
I'm Agent Han's father, Han Gi Joon.

94
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,790
I was in Yeonbyun in 1998.

95
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,880
There's something I must tell you.

96
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,530
After that meeting...
you met him alone.

97
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,010
And soon after that...

98
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,340
you placed him as Presidential Secretary.

99
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,039
What conversation took
place between you two?

100
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,270
You've never spoke of it to anyone.

101
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,670
Even now...

102
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,080
will you tell me what was said?

103
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,349
Secretary Han Gi Joon
has already passed on.

104
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,970
Let's not talk about that anymore.

105
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,640
What did you do with Secretary Han Gi Joon?

106
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,429
Dead Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon...

107
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,730
Blue House Senior
Political Affairs, Min Hyun Ki.

108
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,799
National Intelligence
Director, Byun Tae Hoon.

109
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,510
Chairman Kim Do Jin of Jaeshin Group.

110
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,430
That day...

111
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,800
The people you met at
the Jaeshin Hotel suite.

112
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,470
Are you fighting them?

113
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,549
Remember the day Hwang
Yoon Jae was arrested?

114
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,849
The President met some people in the suite.

115
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,489
Was Chairman Kim Do Jin
of Jaeshin Group there?

116
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,490
Yes.

117
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,490
He was there.

118
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,090
Anything suspicious?

119
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,699
Chairman Kim Do Jin or any others?

120
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,399
Nothing suspicious about the people,
but there was something else strange.

121
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,629
What are you talking about?

122
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,600
The security was much tighter
than about a year ago.

123
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,670
Especially the hallway near the suite...

124
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,950
It was extremely tight.

125
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,580
There are one of two
reasons for high security.

126
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,730
Something to protect or...

127
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,100
a secret to hide.

128
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,600
Politics...

129
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,660
It's advantageous for
those in power to oppress.

130
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,580
I don't know when this fight began.

131
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,030
I'm sure you had the power to begin with.

132
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,440
But those people...

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,369
turned over information regarding
the Yangjinri incident

134
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,110
to the special prosecutions team.

135
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,210
However...

136
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,260
you did not give up.

137
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,480
Despite the risks,

138
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,420
they attempted to assassinate you.

139
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,190
What kind of threat do you pose

140
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,660
for them to attempt to
assassinate the President?

141
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,590
The document the special investigation
has was fabricated, right?

142
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,730
There is another story to Yangjinri.

143
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,630
Did you try reveal it with Secretary Han?

144
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,710
What's going on?

145
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,300
Did you hear about the
special investigation?

146
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,680
They're are searching for the
document in Chairman Kwon's home.

147
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,180
Classified Document 98.

148
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,040
They're looking for
Secretary Han's document.

149
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,229
We searched other rooms as well.

150
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,860
But there's no such document anywhere.

151
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,640
Officer Lee, let's search the parking lot.

152
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,200
What happened? Did you find it?

153
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,330
We found a receipt.

154
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,029
What are you talking about?

155
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,530
We found a special investigation
team's receipt.

156
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,139
Chairman Kwon mailed it via registered
mail yesterday afternoon.

157
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,370
To where?

158
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,560
1 Sejong.

159
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,360
The Blue House.

160
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,530
It was addressed to President Lee Dong Hwi.

161
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,250
What you wanted from the Chairman
Kwon after lending him a lifeline...

162
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,070
That document...

163
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,850
Wasn't it?

164
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
You're right.

165
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,310
The document the Secretary Han had

166
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,890
contains the truth about Yangjinri.

167
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,269
It will bring the real culprits to light.

168
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,030
It's convincing evidence.

169
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,550
From: Kwon Jae Yeon. To: The Blue
House, Attn: President Lee Dong Hwi.

170
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,970
Lee Dong Hwi speaking.

171
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,660
Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon sent
mail to the Blue House.

172
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,059
He wants it delivered to you directly.

173
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,160
It was sent priority yesterday.
You should have it by now.

174
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,650
Alright.

175
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,640
When the truth is revealed,

176
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,270
what will happen to you?

177
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,640
If the special investigation
results aren't true,

178
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,180
why don't you explain yourself?

179
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,279
At the least...

180
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,400
you must be connected to the
incident somehow, right?

181
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,650
Am I wrong?

182
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,790
Why don't you ignore it all?

183
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,300
I'll take care of everything.

184
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,720
I told you then.

185
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,240
Whatever connection you have
to the Yangjinri incident,

186
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,970
I don't care.

187
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,410
This fight stops when one of us stops it.

188
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,430
I'm sure they don't want you
to make an issue of it either.

189
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,320
President, you stop.

190
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,850
The assassination attempt.

191
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,980
Kwon Jae Yeon, Ham Bong Soo, and
Hwang Yoon Jae were in it together.

192
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,940
Those are the same people who
caused the Yangjinri incident.

193
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,690
They conspired against you
to cover their tracks.

194
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,230
Let's say that's why
they tried to kill you.

195
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,860
Then...

196
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,330
everything will get back to normal.

197
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,470
You'll finish your term in office.

198
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,450
Compromise.

199
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,010
That's politics.

200
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,090
Long ago...

201
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,910
in the name of Falcon...

202
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,629
in Africa, Southeast Asia...

203
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,950
South America...

204
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,600
you have no idea the dirty
dealings I was involved in.

205
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,710
I did not...

206
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,130
want to do it anymore.

207
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,549
That's why I held hands
with Chairman Kim Do Jin.

208
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,849
I made a wrong choice.

209
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,900
And now...

210
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,460
are you asking me to do
the dirty work again?

211
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,629
Several people have died.

212
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,279
I caused all that with my own hands.

213
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
And all of that...

214
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,630
I can't let others take the blame.

215
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Then...

216
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,810
Will you give up your regime?

217
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,560
Do you know how much it took
for us to get this far?

218
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,579
From: Kwon Jae Yeon.

219
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,060
To: President Lee Dong Hwi.

220
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
We're from the special investigation team.

221
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,839
In the midst of the document
sent to the President,

222
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,400
there's an important piece of evidence.

223
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,660
Do you have a warrant?

224
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,170
I gave it... all to you.

225
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,130
All for this administration.

226
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,850
I sacrificed everything.

227
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,640
For my sake...

228
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,859
please reconsider.

229
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
I...

230
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,300
didn't become the President for your sake.

231
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Was I...

232
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,010
dreaming a different dream?

233
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,440
Are you from the Blue House?

234
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,200
The President said...

235
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,310
he had something to obtain from you.

236
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,630
What is that?

237
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,590
Is it information refuting
the Yangjinri incident?

238
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,470
If it is... please hand it over.

239
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,790
Please, I ask you.

240
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,820
That's the only thing that
can save the President.

241
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,950
You don't know, do you?

242
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,329
Hand it over... Since you ask...

243
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,590
I'll hand it over.

244
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,920
Classified Document 98.

245
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,660
Report on Yanginri Incident of 1998.

246
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:10,300
Report on Yanginri Incident of 1998.

247
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,320
Lee Dong Hwi...

248
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,410
He had blood on his hands from the start.

249
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,580
Tell him to stop acting
innocent. We're all the same.

250
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,170
I already sent a copy to the Blue House.

251
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,540
Whether it's the President...

252
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,210
or Chairman Kim Do Jin...

253
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,960
Tell them to die!

254
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,430
Instead...

255
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,940
I should get amnesty.

256
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,710
It's important evidence regarding
the assassination attempt.

257
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,640
Step aside.

258
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,809
I told you.

259
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,250
You can't do this without a warrant.

260
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,300
Do I also need a warrant?

261
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,289
The mail Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon sent me.

262
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,290
Give it to me.

263
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,030
Any mail sent to you should
be inspected first.

264
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,350
To see if it was poisoned...
Give it to me.

265
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,780
From: Kwon Jae Yeon. Special Delivery.

266
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,660
Kim Do Jin speaking.

267
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,230
Is it the document you were looking for?

268
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,110
This...

269
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,680
This isn't the Classified Document.

270
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,600
This is Chairman Kwon's...

271
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,620
suicide note.

272
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,907
I, Kwon Jae Yeon, conspired
against the President

273
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,379
along with Ham Bong Soo
and Hwang Yoon Jae.

274
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,100
It's all my fault. I can't bare to
live when my men lost their lives.

275
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,429
I have what you want.

276
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,789
In twenty minutes,

277
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,780
I'll see you at the Jaeshin Hotel suite.

278
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,440
Do you want to reveal this?

279
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,950
This spells out the President's crime.

280
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,080
The accomplices are the only changes.

281
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,450
Yes.

282
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,089
The President wants to bury
himself with the rest.

283
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,090
No way.

284
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,140
This can't go public.

285
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,699
I'll convince the President.

286
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,180
Convince him?

287
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,800
Don't you think we tried?

288
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,820
And...

289
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,590
I won't stand by and take it any longer.

290
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,659
All he did was use me.

291
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,010
And now...

292
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,139
they want to make me out to be the shooter.

293
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
So...

294
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,810
just as it's written here...

295
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,620
will you confess everything
to special investigations?

296
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,580
Go back!

297
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,760
I'll also convince them.

298
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,200
I'll convince the President as well.

299
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,050
Who do you think you are?

300
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,880
He won't even listen to us.

301
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,339
Do you think he'll listen to you?

302
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,340
I've...

303
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,410
been with the President from the
beginning of his political career.

304
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,339
We're beyond a working relationship.

305
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,110
We're political comrades.

306
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,220
He'll listen to me.

307
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,270
Comrades.

308
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,529
Presidential Chief of
Staff, Shin Kyu Jin...

309
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,660
Are you that big of a deal?

310
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:44,729
Weren't you just... Lee
Dong Hwi's shadow?

311
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,670
Be careful now.

312
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:46,940
Why don't you wake up?

313
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,020
Tell the President exactly what I said.

314
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,139
That's the kind of job that suits you.

315
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,760
There's something else that suits me.

316
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,000
It's also about my regime.

317
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,880
I can't give up.

318
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,290
Your regime?

319
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,829
Following Lee Dong Hwi around...

320
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,830
Carrying his bag...

321
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,099
Just because you wrote
some of his speeches,

322
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,840
you think you made him President?

323
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,820
We're the ones who placed him...

324
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,160
in the Blue House.

325
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,040
Our money.

326
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Our power.

327
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,100
Our network.

328
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,350
How dare you speak so carelessly?

329
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,160
I sacrificed my all.

330
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,950
Whatever... you did...

331
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,000
it has nothing to do with me.

332
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,300
You're just...

333
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,510
like this.

334
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,699
When he doesn't need you,
he'll toss you aside.

335
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,510
You can be bought.

336
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,420
When you're told to bark, you bark.

337
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,340
When you're told to wag your
tail, you wag your tail.

338
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,810
You're merely Lee Dong Hwi's dog.

339
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,190
Would you like to see...

340
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,860
what kind of person I am?

341
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,260
The President...

342
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,400
I'll make him give up.

343
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,580
I told you earlier.

344
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,440
Everything is pointless.

345
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,420
Without proof...

346
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,750
or witnesses.

347
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,720
I'm sure he'll give up.

348
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,190
The special investigation team
will verify its authenticity.

349
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,389
The document you spoke of...

350
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,820
We'll look into it further.

351
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,090
No.

352
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,510
I'm sure...

353
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,100
someone has it already.

354
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,290
Where to?

355
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
To the hotel.

356
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:19,990
This is the Jaeshin Hotel where the Chinese
President and the first lady will stay.

357
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,280
The President and the first lady will
stay in the royal suite on the top floor.

358
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,879
The advance unit made up of
inspectors were dispatched and

359
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,420
we've guarded against
any elements of danger.

360
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,489
Transportation route,
emergency exit route...

361
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,490
everything is secured?

362
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,529
Yes.

363
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,299
We worked with the hotel security team.

364
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,799
When the foreign dignitaries visit,
consider the safety of the VIP, of course.

365
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,890
Our mistakes can cause diplomatic friction.

366
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,870
Are you familiar with the blueprints?

367
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,220
Yes.

368
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,009
During an event,

369
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,280
the building blueprints
serve as the basic road map.

370
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,100
Vents, elevator, bathrooms,
emergency exit routes...

371
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,680
All passages are indicated
on the blueprint.

372
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,490
Remember that.

373
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,410
You must store all the
blueprints in your head.

374
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,010
Don't ever forget.

375
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,920
There are three passage
ways to the top floor.

376
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,160
First, the suite elevator
where you use a card key.

377
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,970
Another is...

378
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,200
the room service elevator that's connected
to the underground parking lot.

379
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,580
Lastly...

380
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,940
employee elevator.

381
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,390
Excuse me.

382
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,250
Please sit down.

383
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,970
Did you say you have what I want?

384
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,720
Are you headed to the suite?

385
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,740
That area isn't open to public.

386
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Perhaps you don't know.

387
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,230
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

388
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,170
Classified Document 98.

389
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,790
So...

390
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,640
What is it you want from me?

391
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,260
This regime...

392
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,380
was built by Lee Dong Hwi and myself.

393
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
But...

394
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,099
Lee Dong Hwi's ego...

395
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,490
has ruined everything.

396
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,290
Now...

397
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,820
I want an untouchable...

398
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,810
regime of my own.

399
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,790
Here is the laptop I typed Chairman
Kwon Jae Yeon's suicide note.

400
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,850
Take it to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

401
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,830
Please take care of the record log.

402
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,740
Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon's death
should be concluded as a suicide.

403
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,520
That's good for both of us, right?

404
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,150
I don't see a gun.

405
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,070
The document...

406
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,190
They'll go after...

407
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,409
the document.

408
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,110
Classified Document 98.

409
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
Is it you?

410
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,350
Did you...

411
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
kill my father?

412
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
Answer me.

413
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,180
Shoot if you want.

414
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,230
If you're going to shoot...

415
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,350
you'll have to shoot me right here.

416
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,220
I never forget a losing deal.

417
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
What?

418
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,630
Can't you shoot?

419
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,790
Right...

420
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,020
A Secret Service agent protects, not kills.

421
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,540
If you're going to aim the barrel,

422
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,350
aim well.

423
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,380
Do you think your father
died because of me? No...

424
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,880
It's all because of Lee Dong Hwi.

425
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,920
Stop.

426
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:19,860
He used your father to do all the
dirty work, but Lee Dong Hwi...

427
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,589
What did Lee Dong Hwi do?

428
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,659
He sat back in the Blue House
and watched your father die.

429
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,629
He knew how dangerous it was. Lee Dong
Hwi's the one who sent him out there.

430
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,630
You...

431
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,639
You've been protecting
someone like that all this time.

432
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,900
Stop!

433
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,380
If you want to use a device like this...

434
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,590
you should have that kind of power.

435
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,390
Same goes with Secretary Han Gi Joon.

436
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,060
If he possessed an item he can't handle,

437
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,760
he put himself in danger, of course.

438
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,750
No!

439
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,620
What should we do?

440
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,040
One with the power can be generous.

441
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,360
I'm in a good mood today. Go home.

442
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,569
Now...

443
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,560
can I show you what my
real power looks like?

444
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,060
Is everything you told me true?

445
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,220
About Secretary Han Gi Joon's accident...

446
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,119
Also the fire incident nearby.

447
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,690
They were concluded as mere
accidents with outside any pressure?

448
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,740
Yes, that's right.

449
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,359
Everyone who died that night...

450
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,980
were found as accomplices
in the Yangjinri incident.

451
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,240
Isn't it more than sheer coincidence?

452
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,410
Are you Officer Yoon Bo Won?

453
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,320
Inspector from the National Police Agency.

454
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,250
You need to come with us.

455
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
What's this about?

456
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,090
I don't know who you are.
Please step aside.

457
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,730
Officer Yoon misused her
power as a police officer.

458
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,400
She broke the law.

459
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,210
Do you know Agent Han Tae Kyung?

460
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,540
Yes.

461
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:33,040
What is your relationship with him?

462
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,040
I'm not sure what you're asking.

463
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,109
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

464
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,550
He's been wanted since
March 5th, 2200 hours.

465
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,389
You were transporting
Agent Han in your police car.

466
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,219
Did you aid in his escape?

467
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,370
- That's...
- Also...

468
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,729
Agent Han stole evidence from the precinct.

469
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,679
Did you assist him?

470
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
That was...

471
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,030
to aid an investigation.

472
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:04,209
Are you saying it is allowable to act
illegally during an investigation?

473
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,010
Of course, that was wrong.

474
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,879
There's someone who knows
why I did what I had to do.

475
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,979
If you talk to him...

476
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,459
Are you talking about Lieutenant
Ko Young Hoon from Accident Investigations?

477
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,670
Yes, that's right.

478
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,690
Young Hoon.

479
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,260
Please sit down.

480
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,779
On March 2nd,

481
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,920
you said Officer Yoon asked you to
fabricate an accident report, right?

482
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Yes.

483
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,890
Young Hoon.

484
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,050
Which accident was it?

485
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,820
It was regarding Secretary
Han Gi Joon's accident.

486
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,150
It was concluded as an accidental death.

487
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,359
She asked me to change it to hit-and-run.

488
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,410
Young Hoon.

489
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,659
Did she tell you the reason?

490
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,400
She said Agent Han Tae Kyung asked her to.

491
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,950
Agent Han was aware of his father's
involvement in the Yangjinri incident.

492
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,539
He wanted to protect his
father's reputation.

493
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,939
She asked me to include a document that
was not at the scene in the report.

494
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,039
Young Hoon, why are you doing this?

495
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,449
You should stop this!

496
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,450
Officer Yoon Bo Won!

497
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,549
Please sit down.

498
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,470
I didn't. Young Hoon's
the one who is lying.

499
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:33,219
Agent Han Tae Kyung and I never
even met before this incident.

500
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,360
How can I ask for such a favor?

501
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,699
You never knew each other before.

502
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,030
Why did you attend Secretary
Han Gi Joon's funeral?

503
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,099
You even took time off of work.

504
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,740
It was for the investigation.

505
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,440
Then...

506
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,740
you're saying you never met or
knew him before the incident?

507
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,880
Is that it?

508
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,250
I'll report this to the government
officers disciplinary committee.

509
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,340
Officer Yoon, you're suspended
until further notice.

510
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:11,930
Let's go.

511
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,780
What will you do?

512
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,460
Yeah, what's up?

513
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,550
Who leaked it?

514
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:55,670
Sir.

515
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,719
Chairman Kwon's document...

516
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,080
was leaked to the media.

517
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,030
Which one?

518
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,010
Jaeshin Newspapers.

519
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,151
The evidence submitted to
the special investigation

520
00:44:08,163 --> 00:44:09,950
has been leaked and
is creating waves.

521
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,155
Conscience of Suicidal
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

522
00:44:13,156 --> 00:44:16,059
The document has information proving
President Lee's involvement.

523
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,989
It's shocking the nation.

524
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:21,000
The President's public opinion
rating is plummeting.

525
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,700
What does the analysis of
Chairman Kwon's suicide reveal?

526
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,300
We found records on his laptop.

527
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,920
Log and print records. It's all there.

528
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,249
That confirms he wrote
his note in his office.

529
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,950
The investigation points to Chairman Kwon.

530
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:43,880
But...

531
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,389
Chairman Kwon Jae Yeon committed suicide.

532
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,390
Ultimately...

533
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,020
Kwon Jae Yeon, Hwang Yoon Jae,

534
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,790
Ham Bong Soo...

535
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,310
Does it come down to the...

536
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,800
these three?

537
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,070
Agent Hwnag Yoon Jae's murder.

538
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,550
Officer Yoon Bo Won's shooting incident.

539
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,140
We didn't tie anyone to those incidents.

540
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,599
Public opinion isn't good.

541
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,209
Since the information was leaked,

542
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,680
they're wondering if we're postponing
the announcement on purpose.

543
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,410
For now...

544
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,930
we should announce an interim
report and transfer the records.

545
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,769
I'm sorry, Officer Yoon.

546
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,159
We can't deal with people like that.

547
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,309
How can a weak link like me do anything?

548
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,310
And...

549
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,820
you know my situation.

550
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,359
Yes.

551
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,509
I know your situation, Young Hoon.

552
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,240
So, you... live that way.

553
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,940
But I...

554
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,730
I won't live like that.

555
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,550
You really don't know?

556
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,639
You'd better stop here.

557
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,280
If you don't, it won't end at suspension.

558
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:59,359
A country police officer.
It doesn't seem special.

559
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,959
But it was something special to me.

560
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,190
I... can't end it this way.

561
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Personal Information

562
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,049
Are you daughter of Kim Ki Bum?

563
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,049
Did you know about the incident?

564
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,389
Did you know over twenty died?

565
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,720
One word please.

566
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,589
One word please.

567
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,390
Did you know about it?

568
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,300
Please speak.

569
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,560
You look tired.

570
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,970
It won't be an easy choice.

571
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:28,860
Whatever you decide...

572
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,250
don't falter.

573
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,580
Like that time.

574
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
Agent Han Tae Kyung.

575
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,100
If it was you...

576
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:56,270
You can do it.

577
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:50,690
The special investigation team on the
Presidential assassination attempt

578
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,910
will make an announcement soon.

579
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,960
Doesn't everyone know the results?

580
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,230
We want to know your stance.

581
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,360
Let's hold a Parliamentary Assembly.

582
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,340
Are you speaking of impeachment?

583
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,430
That can't be.

584
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:18,750
We don't know the guilt of
the President on Yangjinri.

585
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,680
Even if he is guilty,

586
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,990
it happened sixteen years ago.

587
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:29,889
Impeachment only applies to crimes
committed while in office.

588
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,300
Didn't you hear special
prosecutor Choi Ji Hoon?

589
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:38,240
The President asked to postpone
the announcement several times.

590
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,539
This is clearly interfering
with the investigation.

591
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,569
But we should consider it more carefully.

592
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,899
Consider it carefully?

593
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,979
Whether from the ruling party or not,

594
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:54,370
will anyone oppose impeachment proceedings?

595
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,740
The Republic of Korea has...

596
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,010
abandoned its President.

597
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:01,590
We should also...

598
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,130
abandon the President.

599
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,460
To save our party.

600
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:16,209
Breaking news. The ruling and
opposing party representatives

601
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,539
submitted the impeachment
initiative to Congress.

602
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,579
The Congress received the
impeachment initiative.

603
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,910
They'll gather soon to officially
initiate the impeachment process.

604
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,580
Hey.

605
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:31,650
What's wrong with your face?

606
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:32,540
How about the VIP?

607
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:34,459
Do you think he's well right now?

608
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,790
Everyone's tense because
of impeachment talks.

609
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,290
Where is he now?

610
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,470
What are you doing?

611
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,230
I'd like to meet with the VIP.

612
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:01,980
What is it?

613
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,920
I have something to tell the VIP.

614
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:05,590
Go back.

615
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:06,420
Didn't you hear the news?

616
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:07,649
I must meet with him.

617
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:10,519
He's not someone you can meet at your whim.

618
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,520
What's wrong with you?

619
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,990
Yes.

620
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,460
I do know.

621
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:18,099
That's why I held myself back until now.

622
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,129
I want to ask him.

623
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:22,400
I knew I had to hold myself back, but...

624
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,910
I must meet him today for sure.

625
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,310
Take him outside.

626
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,530
Yes, sir.

627
00:51:29,531 --> 00:51:30,729
Just for a moment please.

628
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,090
I need to ask him one thing.

629
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,600
I want to hear something about my father.

630
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:36,730
Just for a moment.

631
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,570
Just a moment.

632
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,969
Will you be okay?

633
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:05,230
I can stay... No, I'll be fine.

634
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,050
I want to speak with Agent Han alone.

635
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,330
Jaeshin...

636
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,850
I met with Chairman Kim Do Jin.

637
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,700
You knew...

638
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,310
he was the one, right?

639
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,200
He had the document my
father tried to protect.

640
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,480
But...

641
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,340
he burned it...

642
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,260
right in front of me.

643
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,480
I couldn't verify what my
father was trying to do.

644
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:03,400
Everything disappeared.

645
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,340
My father...

646
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,080
What kind of man was he?

647
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,280
Ever since my childhood...

648
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,350
it was just the two of us.

649
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,550
We fought at times.

650
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,309
When we were apart for more than a month,

651
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:30,590
we were family.

652
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,129
More than anyone in this world,

653
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:38,020
I thought we knew each
other very well, but...

654
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,820
He was my father.

655
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,730
I didn't know anything about my father.

656
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:54,219
What he worried about...

657
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,930
What he struggled over...

658
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,820
I didn't know any of it
until the moment he died.

659
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,390
When he was in the accident,

660
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,180
he worried about that document.

661
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,750
He didn't even leave a letter to his son.

662
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,240
What was it that worried
him up to his last breath?

663
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,430
Was it really worth it?

664
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,840
Please answer me.

665
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:40,480
In Yangjinri...

666
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,680
twenty-four people died.

667
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,660
But...

668
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,729
"It wasn't my fault."

669
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,850
"That right."

670
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,979
I was that brazen.

671
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,740
And now I'm a President.

672
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,760
Before Secretary Han
Gi Joon told me the truth,

673
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,300
I lived like an idiot.

674
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:09,670
I couldn't live like that anymore.

675
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:12,710
I tried to reveal the truth.

676
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,460
However...

677
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:17,980
one, two...

678
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,650
people kept dying off.

679
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,090
Secretary Han Gi Joon.

680
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,910
Two people who died in the fire.

681
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,830
Colonel Yang Dae Ho.

682
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,680
The bodyguards who protected me.

683
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:38,070
An innocent...
Chungsoodae employee.

684
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,800
Nameless victims from the EMP bomb.

685
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:45,660
Agent Hwang Yoon Jae who was used by them.

686
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:47,090
And...

687
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,430
Chief Ham Bong Soo.

688
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,670
People tell me to ignore it.

689
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:58,490
If not, more will die.

690
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,700
So...

691
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,790
they tell me to become an idiot again.

692
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,300
Is that really the right thing to do?

693
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,620
March 7th.

694
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,940
We'll begin an urgent plenary session.

695
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,310
If I don't back down now,

696
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,709
there will be more victims.

697
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:36,839
Then, I'll ask myself
every time it happens.

698
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,890
Even then...

699
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,460
will I make the same choice?

700
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:48,370
The answer...

701
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,640
is the same.

702
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,790
I...

703
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:55,510
will not give up.

704
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,520
The President Lee Dong Hwi...

705
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:02,110
failed to uphold the
nation's law as its leader.

706
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,470
Although I may not be the right
person for this position,

707
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,269
He tried to interfere with
the special prosecution.

708
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:14,240
He clearly engaged in criminal activity
and interfered with the order of law.

709
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,850
Even if I'm a criminal
with blood on my hands...

710
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,800
The President is no longer qualified
to oversee the government...

711
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:25,640
I pledged to keep the constitution
and justice of this nation.

712
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,770
I am the President.

713
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,010
I officially submit the Presidential
impeachment initiative.

714
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,030
I can't back down.

715
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:41,320
Until I can do what I set out to do,

716
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,440
I must remain the President of this nation.

717
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:47,840
Until then...

718
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:49,710
will you

719
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,330
protect me?

720
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:05,409
March 8, 20:00, 72 hours
after the shooting.

721
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:08,760
March 8, 20:00, Impeachment Assumed.

722
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:30,749
Thirty-five Blue House employees
have submitted resignations.

723
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,489
Where is your resignation?

724
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,489
Everything started with
your father's accident.

725
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,219
You'll find proof if you
investigate this further.

726
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,890
Lt. Commander Lee Chul Kyu
of the North Korean military.

727
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:41,859
Are you sure he was executed?

728
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,060
Someone sent me this photo.

729
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,450
The Secret Service and the
President are up to something.

730
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,450
Press Conference (The Secret
Service Security Plan)

731
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,930
