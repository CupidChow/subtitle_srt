7
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,980
Hey! Who are you?

8
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,300
We're a couple.

9
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,900
Get out of here!

10
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,460
No.

11
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,940
I'll stay with Mark.

12
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,300
It's better if you leave.

13
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,020
What, Mark?

14
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,580
I'm begging you.

15
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,540
Leave us for now.

16
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,260
Goodbye, sir.

17
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,060
We were doing some business around here,
so we came to check on you.

18
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,610
Well, we didn't know that...

19
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,890
It's okay, Mom.

20
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,660
I was gonna tell everybody anyway.

21
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,220
What to tell?

22
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,460
Tell us how easy you are?

23
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,260
Dad.

24
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,260
You can call me anything,

25
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,380
but don't use that word on Vee.

26
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,380
Why?

27
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,220
Is he too honorable to touch?

28
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,460
He's my senior at the faculty.

29
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,060
How did you two meet?

30
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,940
Why don't you say something?

31
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,620
Or that day you were so drunk
that you couldn't remember anything?

32
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,860
I don't care
if you want to be with anybody,

33
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,860
but at least find someone well-born.

34
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,580
But he takes better care of me than you.

35
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,820
Mark.

36
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,900
Pack your bag now.

37
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,780
I'll register you in a new place.

Relax, dude.

50
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,980
They were just worried about their kid.

51
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,260
What does Mark say, Vee?

52
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,260
I can't reach him.

53
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,420
I don't know what's going on.

54
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,540
See? If he dates Nuea,
there won't be this problem.

55
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,540
Shut up.

56
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,220
I'm just messing with you.

57
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,220
Guys!

58
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,300
Mark's calling me.

59
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,240
I gotta go.

60
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,300
- Eh?
- Okay.

61
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,100
Hello.

62
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Vee.

63
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,780
How are you?

64
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,460
I... driving to... house...

65
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,180
Eh? Hello, Mark?

66
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,380
What was that?

67
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,580
What's going on?

68
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,940
Mark called me.

69
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,540
He told me something about driving
to a house and then it disconnected.

70
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,740
Which house?

71
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,740
House?

72
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,060
There's only one house.

73
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,380
If I were his dad,
I would drag him back to Bangkok,

74
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,380
and talk to him later.

75
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,020
Dang! What should I do?

76
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,540
You need to stop that.

77
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,220
Go see them at the dorm first.

78
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,100
If they're not there,
look for them on the highway.

79
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,380
You'll find them somehow
if you're meant to be together.

80
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,940
This time I won't let Mark
slip through my fingers again.

81
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,460
Hurry up, man.

82
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,540
- Dang!
- Eh?

83
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,260
Who's there?

84
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,690
Hello, sir.

85
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,060
Hello.

86
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,540
Sorry, my phone died.

87
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,940
My parents want to see your house.

88
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,700
My dad was going
to drag me back to Bangkok.

89
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,860
But Mom talked him into this.

90
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,420
She told him to see
your house before making a decision.

91
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,700
Here, some snacks.

92
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,780
I didn't prepare something
for you because I didn't know.

93
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,780
We suddenly come without telling you,
I apologize for that.

94
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,180
It's fine, we're no strangers.

95
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,580
Dad is at the cockfight's pit,
he'll be back anytime soon.

96
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,380
Please wait.

97
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,780
Those are Vee's?

98
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,540
Yes, they are.

99
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,420
He loved playing soccer
when he was a kid.

100
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,300
Coach praised him so much.

101
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,220
He would be on the national team
if he didn't chase all the girls.

102
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,220
Mom.

103
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,220
Enough.

104
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,340
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,500
Do you know that they two are dating?

106
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,500
Yes, I do.

107
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,020
I'd still know even if
I was watching from Mars.

108
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,420
Good.

109
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,140
So I can be honest.

110
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,420
I'm not comfortable with the fact
that Mark is with your boy.

111
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,020
I think they're not compatible.

112
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,980
What do you consider compatible?

113
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,380
Right, what is it?

114
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,300
I see them being happy together.

115
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,140
Right now, they are.

116
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,580
But I'm not sure when they graduate,
have a job or build a family,

117
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,020
they'll still be happy that day.

118
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,740
Don't worry, sir.

119
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,260
I'll take the best care of him.

120
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,740
You think that will be enough?

121
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
How do you know that won't be enough?

122
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,540
Not everybody is as capitalist
as you are.

123
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,460
Masa.

124
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,540
I love Vee.

125
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,900
He makes me happier

126
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,340
than you do for all my life.

127
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,580
Do you think only love
can make you happy?

128
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,460
Reconsider that.

129
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,660
It only can make you
tolerate this crappy condition.

130
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,240
Excuse me.

131
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,129
My house may be in a crappy condition

132
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:10,980
but I never teach my kids
to look down on other people.

133
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,980
I think we know each other well enough.

134
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,460
Mom.

135
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,500
Mark.

136
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,500
Let's go home.

137
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,460
No.

138
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,660
Until you apologize to him.

139
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,660
So you stay here for all your life!

140
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,660
Dad.

141
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,680
Well, I need to go now, goodbye.

142
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,100
Goodbye.

143
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,660
I apologize for his behavior.

144
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,940
It's okay.

145
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,690
Your dad said something like that
because he worries about you.

146
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,900
One thing my dad worries about

147
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,300
is his dignity.

148
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,380
Dad.

149
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Your son will crawl back
when he runs out of money.

150
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,820
Come on.

151
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,700
You should understand
something like this more than anyone.

152
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,220
Yes, I do.

153
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,420
That's why I know
what Mark will encounter.

154
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,060
Do you really think that he
can take care of our son?

155
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,580
Dad!

156
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,820
The tire must be flat.

157
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll look into it.

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,860
Yes.

159
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,180
Dang!

160
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,860
Eh?

161
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,060
- Hey!
- What?

162
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,700
Don't move.

163
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,540
Mom! Lock the door, don't come out!

164
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,540
Mom!

165
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,220
Open the door! Get out of there!

166
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,500
- Hurry up!
- What?

167
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,820
Come out now!

168
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,980
Or you'll die!

169
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,940
Don't you dare!

170
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,580
Go!

171
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,820
Don't hurt us, I'm begging you.

172
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,900
Who gave you the permission to talk?

173
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,900
Put your valuable things here.

174
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,100
Do it!

175
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,220
- Okay, okay.
- Hurry up!

176
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,460
Your ring, too.

177
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,980
Please. This is our wedding ring,
you won't get much from it.

178
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,220
Do you want me to
take it off from our fingers?

179
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,540
- Huh?
- No!

180
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,540
Hey!

181
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,260
What are you doing?

182
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,900
Don't be nosy.

183
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
Nosy?

184
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,900
- Dad!
- Hey!

185
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,740
Vee!

186
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,900
Dad, Dad...

187
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,740
Let's get out of here.

188
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
Let's go.

189
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,180
Here you are.

190
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,180
Thanks.

191
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,580
The police have arrested them.

192
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,620
Tomorrow we'll have to
give a statement at the police station.

193
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,460
Thank you.

194
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,940
- I'll help Mom in the kitchen.
- Yes, okay.

195
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,300
Let me help you.

196
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,100
Thank you, Vee.

197
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,220
It's okay.

198
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,820
Here it is.

199
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,140
Let's have dinner.

200
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,140
You must be hungry, come on.

201
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,060
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

202
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,260
But I am.

203
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,260
Come on.

204
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,260
Have a seat.

205
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,500
There are Somtom and spicy thick soup.

206
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,700
I made them myself.

207
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
Can you eat it?

208
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,940
Of course.

209
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,700
Looks delicious.

210
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,700
So let's eat.

211
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,740
Here, some sticky rice.

212
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,660
Oh, boy.

213
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,100
I didn't warn you
about the fermented fish.

214
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,900
I'll go make you a new bowl.

215
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,780
Oishi.

216
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,740
It was so good and flavorful.

217
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,380
Bangkok food can't compete with these.

218
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,220
Sure.

219
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,500
This is my homemade fermented fish,
you can't find it anywhere else.

220
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,500
Eat some more if you like it.

221
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,940
- Come on.
- Yes.

222
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,340
Do you want it too?

223
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,060
Mom.

224
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,700
I'll go see my car.

225
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,820
Here you go, come on.
Let's eat some more.

226
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,040
Let's eat together, here you go.

227
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,100
- Is it delicious?
- It is.

228
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,500
It's done.

229
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,980
But the tire is not of the same size.

230
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,980
You can drive and change it
tomorrow at the tire center.

231
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,900
If my dad says something
horrible, don't stop me.

232
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,340
I apologize for my way
of talking earlier.

233
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,900
It's okay.

234
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,020
I also need to apologize
for what I said.

235
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,740
I didn't come here
to look down at anybody.

236
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,020
I just want to be sure that
during the days I'm not around,

237
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,300
the person Mark chose will
take care of him and make him happy.

238
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,220
Because Mark is...

239
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,060
My only son.

240
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,700
I get it.

241
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:24,650
If you only care about your dignity,
you'd turn back once you saw my driveway.

242
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,420
Some people are compatible and in love,
but it still won't last long.

243
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,740
Those two are not just
different, they also are...

244
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,470
They're both boys.

245
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,820
Yes, they are.

246
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,300
Don't you worry?

247
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,700
You know

248
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:56,340
when my first son
introduced us to his male lover,

249
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,660
I was blazing mad and scolded them off.

250
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,660
But...

251
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,240
When I calmed down, I was worried.

252
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,700
I was worried if our cousin
would be okay with that.

253
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
I was worried about everything.

254
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,420
I can get you.

255
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,660
When Vee and Mark are together,

256
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,140
I saw them smiling with happiness.

257
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,900
Parents shouldn't be
worried after seeing that.

258
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:39,140
Vee can't offer a lot of things.

259
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,980
But Vee will give his love
to your son as much as he can.

260
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,660
Oh.

261
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,500
Sorry.

262
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,940
Your car's key.

263
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,340
How much is it?

264
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,940
It's okay. It's nothing.

265
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,540
No, I can't. I'll feel bad.

266
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,140
But if I accept your money,
I'll feel bad too.

267
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,260
Please let me thank you.

268
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,500
Okay.

269
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,660
But if you want to thank someone,

270
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,220
thank him.

271
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,340
Thank you very much for today.

272
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,180
It's okay.

273
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,900
Here, take it with you.

274
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,700
In case you get hungry on the road.

275
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,700
Grilled pork with sticky rice.

276
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,300
Mark told me that
his dad doesn't eat spicy food.

277
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,380
Thank you very much.

278
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,780
Yes, sir.

279
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,980
Are you sure
that you can take care of Mark?

280
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,740
I do.

281
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,500
Good.

282
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,500
I'll be watching you.

283
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,300
Right.

284
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:02,780
I'd better drive you to your hotel,
in case there's some problem on the road.

285
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,780
Okay.

286
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,700
Well, goodbye.

287
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,980
Please.

288
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,380
Go with me, Yoo.

289
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,180
Yes, Dad.

290
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,460
Hurry back, honey.

291
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,340
Why didn't I ride back with my parents?

292
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,500
What?

293
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,180
Too late.

294
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,220
You need to stay the night here.

295
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,360
Whoa! I can call my dad to pick me up.

296
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,720
What? Don't.

297
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,340
Please set a bed. Mom.

298
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,340
It's okay, I can call my dad.

299
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,500
Don't! Stay here.

300
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,460
Dad.

301
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,900
Come on. You haven't eaten anything.

302
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,930
I'll feed you. Come on.

303
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,900
How was it?

304
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,180
Can I have one more bite?

305
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,090
Here it is.

306
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,140
It reminds me of the days

307
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,740
when you drove the delivery truck.

308
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,220
You couldn't find time to eat,
so I needed to buy some grilled pork for you.

309
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,940
I could find time to eat,

310
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,300
I just didn't have money
for a good meal.

311
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,220
Even though I was so stingy, it took me
a lot of time to collect money for the dowry.

312
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,220
I kept you waiting for so long.

313
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,020
You know?

314
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,620
Even when we eat
at some five-star restaurants,

315
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,860
it isn't as good as
grilled pork I've eaten with you.

316
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,700
You're trying to say that
money can't buy happiness?

317
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,740
Grilled pork doesn't fall from the sky.

318
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,300
What I'm trying to say is,

319
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,920
happiness isn't as expensive
as we think.

320
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,780
Only if he doesn't give
our son a block of salt to eat.

321
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,900
Why did you give him a chance?

322
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,180
If I didn't,
our son won't obey us anyway.

323
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,520
Really?

324
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,860
Isn't that because when he promised you,
his eyes

325
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,460
looked like yours when you asked
for permission to marry me?

326
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,100
Reconsider that.

327
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,380
They aren't.

328
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,700
How do you know?
You never saw your eyes.

329
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,020
Here, have another bite.

330
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,180
Have some sticky rice too.

331
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,180
Here you go.

332
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,740
Good night.

333
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,740
Why are you up here?

334
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,980
What?

335
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,180
We're boyfriends, we need to cuddle.

336
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,180
Wait.

337
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,780
Who is your boyfriend?

338
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,140
You're still on probation.

339
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,980
Do you want to extend your probation?

340
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,180
I give up, it's enough.

341
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,340
Hmm?

342
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,180
Thank you for today.

343
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,220
Instead of thanking me,

344
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,500
tell me you love me again.

345
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,780
I already said it today.

346
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,180
Please.

347
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,180
I want to hear it again, loud and clear.

348
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,580
Love.

349
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,580
Oh, be serious.

350
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,260
I love you, Vee.

351
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,380
One is enough.

352
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,660
I love you too, Masa.

353
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,500
How do you know about this name?

354
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,180
I just knew from your mom.

355
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,580
That you're half Japanese.

356
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,020
And you have another name,

357
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,180
Masa-kun.

358
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,860
If you call me by that name,

359
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,980
I'll sleep up there.

360
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,820
Wait, I'm just messing with you.

361
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,420
Since we're in love,

362
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,220
now,

363
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,340
are we a couple?

364
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,180
I came down for you,

365
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,940
do you still need to ask that?

366
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,900
So you know, right?

367
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,500
That my boyfriend will get what?

368
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,700
No.

369
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,740
Yoo is just next door.

370
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,740
Hmm?

371
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,740
I mean cuddle.

372
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,180
It's complementary.

373
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,580
Hey!

374
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,020
What are you doing?

375
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,260
Don't be shy, we're boyfriends.

376
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,260
Whoa! Take that.

377
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,980
I hate love.

378
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,020
I'm off.

379
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,020
You're right on time.

380
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,860
It's finally done.

381
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,420
No, not yet.

382
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,420
There's a bag left.

383
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,300
What bag?

384
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,780
Hey, where does it come from?

385
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,220
I saw you throwing it away.

386
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,180
It came back by itself maybe.

387
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,020
How?

388
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,780
Unfortunately, the cup that you bought
for me. I broke it.

389
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,740
It's okay.

390
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,020
Do you hear that?

391
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,180
What?

392
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,420
Look.

393
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,940
I couldn't change the past
but I'm going to make present the best.

394
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,580
But if you do something wrong again,

395
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,380
there won't be another chance, okay?

396
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,700
I know.

397
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,540
Let me see if there's something else.

398
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,020
Whoa!

399
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,500
What?

400
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,180
They're necessary.

401
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,340
Or they aren't?

402
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,060
Huh?

403
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,260
- Let's use it now.
- Huh?

404
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,100
Hold on.

405
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,100
Hello.

406
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,820
Where are you, Vee, my friend?

407
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,220
I'm so close.
I'm looking at the library now.

408
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,620
I gotta go, bye.

409
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,140
I'm back.

410
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,300
Come out now, Vee.

411
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,580
I know you're in his room.

412
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,340
Open the door.

413
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,060
Hold this for me.

414
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,100
You change Y to I,

415
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,180
and add "Love You".

416
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,180
Ew!

417
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,100
Are you studying or flirting?

418
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,860
Calm down.

419
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,300
You don't have the right
to tell him that.

420
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,660
- Feeding him like a pet.
- Yes.

421
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,540
Annoying.

422
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,210
Agreed.

423
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,220
Vee. Can you teach me too?

424
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,840
I'd love to but...

425
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,600
Mark won't let me.

426
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,180
What?

427
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,820
He's our senior too.

428
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,740
Yes, he is.

429
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,860
But he's my boyfriend. Okay?

430
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,820
What about our relationship, Nuea?
When are you gonna tell them?

431
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,980
- Lee!
- What?

432
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,260
- Shut up!
- What?

433
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,380
I'm so annoyed
just listening to you arguing.

434
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,380
I'd rather be single.

435
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,180
Single? Want me to talk?

436
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,540
I don't want to say.

437
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,740
Let's study.
