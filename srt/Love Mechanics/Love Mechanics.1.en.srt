Bar.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,780
I love you.

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,580
You're wasting your time.

12
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,550
Where is it?

13
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,980
My room.

14
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,660
I felt pity for you that
you looked like a drunken dog.

15
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,720
Are you worried about me, Bar?

16
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,420
Oh, you...

17
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,420
You're still drunk, aren't you?

18
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,380
Bar.

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,660
May I ask you something?

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,700
Would you be mine?

21
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,700
I'll do my best to value you.

22
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,920
(One day ago)

23
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,660
(Faculty of Engineering)

24
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,700
What book are you looking for?

25
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,340
Oh.

26
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,380
Books about basic statistics.

27
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,260
My elective course.

28
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,260
Let me help you find some.

29
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,340
It's okay. Someone gave me a list.

30
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,020
That doctor?

31
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,540
Bar.

32
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,560
He might be better than
me at academic things.

33
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,140
But I'm talented at the other thing.

34
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,660
At being irritating?

35
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,730
Don't you see that my friend
doesn't want to talk to you?

36
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,660
I'm trying to pick him up.

37
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,660
It's not your darn business.

38
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,830
I am your senior.

39
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,780
And I supposed to be afraid?

40
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,380
Hey, Vee.

41
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,740
You're disturbing the others.

42
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,780
Let's go.

43
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,740
Leave my friend alone.

44
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,580
If Bar didn't stop me,
I would have knocked him down.

45
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,940
He just follows his heart, Vee.

46
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,020
But Bar made it clear
that he doesn't like him.

47
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,420
And there was somebody who
had been coming to see me every day.

48
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,020
Who was it?

49
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,580
No, it's not the same.

50
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,860
You weren't annoyed by me, were you?

51
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,140
You're right.

52
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,300
But I'll get annoyed,

53
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,980
if you're not treating
me to a great dinner, today.

54
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,500
This evening?

55
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,860
I made a plan with Nuea and friends.

56
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,440
But you told me you'd have time
for me after finishing your report.

57
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,620
How about this?

58
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,580
I'll be with you before 9 PM, Ploy.

59
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,580
I don't believe you.

60
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,660
Promise.

61
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,180
Scout promise.

62
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,580
I don't believe you.

63
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,380
So you're coming, tonight?

64
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,860
Oh, boy.

65
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,860
Can I tell you later?

66
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,460
I have practice for the sports event.

67
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,100
Come on. You'll be
a champion even without practice.

68
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,020
Plus, you don't hang out with us lately.

69
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,020
You use this trick.

70
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,740
Fine, I'll go.

71
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,140
That's what I'm talking about.

72
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,980
I'll change my clothes. See you there.

73
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,420
- Okay?
- I know.

74
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,240
What?

75
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,240
Don't you understand human language?

76
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,980
Vee.

77
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,910
He's here for practice.

78
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,030
Bar.

79
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,030
Huh?

80
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,860
Can I be honest with you?

81
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,860
What's up?

82
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,380
I love you.

83
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,690
Don't.

84
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,810
You're wasting your time.

85
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,860
Why?

86
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,820
Kan likes you,

87
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,820
and I like you too.

88
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,780
Is there any difference?

89
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,180
There is.

90
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,180
I like him,

91
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,140
not you.

92
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,700
Can you give me a chance?

93
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,340
I promise you,

94
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
I'll make you like me one day.

95
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,300
You can't do that.

96
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,700
Because the only person I like,

97
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,660
is Kan.

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,940
- Come on.
- Make a toast.

99
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,080
- Cheers.
- Bottoms up.

100
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,400
Tee's paying for today.

101
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,640
Of course, my man happens
to give me a large sum of money.

102
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,620
Why are you in a rush?

103
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,820
Indeed I am.

104
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,500
My girl is sulking right now.

105
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,430
Whoa, what is it?

106
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,690
You're drinking with
friends, not with some girls.

107
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,650
- Right.
- Right.

108
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,340
The thing is,

109
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,500
single people like you
won't understand my situation.

110
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,700
You're hurting me.

111
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,030
Hey, you're not the only one
who has someone.

112
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,230
- Yeah.
- I have my man.

113
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,870
Huh?

114
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,580
- When?
- Who?

115
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,630
Here he is.

116
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,630
- Oh!
- Ew!

117
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,430
Nasty.

118
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,430
- Oh, my god.
- Not you.

119
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,110
I can smell the squid.

120
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,070
Oh, what about Bar?

121
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,600
I texted him.

122
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,700
I also texted him.

123
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,560
You'd better call him.

124
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,310
You and I share this.

125
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,310
What?

126
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,860
Hello. Where are you?

127
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,070
Okay, get some rest.

128
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,070
Okay.

129
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,030
Okay, dude.

130
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,190
What's up?

131
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,580
Do you mind,

132
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,990
if he won't come?

133
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,730
- Humph.
- What's wrong?

134
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,870
- Typical him.
- Yes.

135
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,230
Come on, guys.

136
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,070
Let him get some rest,
it's nearly the championship.

137
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,900
- Yeah.
- Okay.

138
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,910
She's right.

139
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,550
I don't practice
and I'm the club president.

140
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,540
- That is your personality.
- Hey.

141
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,750
Come on, let's cheer to that.

142
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,630
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

143
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,430
- It's almost finished.
- To our friend, Bar

144
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,910
We should support him.

145
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,230
- Bar told us to come here?
- Mmm.

146
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,390
What are you looking at?

147
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,630
What the heck are you looking at?

148
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,150
- The heck you are!
- Hey! Vee!

149
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,230
- Vee!
- What's going on?

150
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,830
Calm down, Vee.

151
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,310
You were really looking at him.

152
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,620
Hey, you.

153
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,670
We're here for fun not for a fight.

154
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,670
He's also my fraternity little brother.

155
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,830
Okay, last drink.

156
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,830
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

157
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,190
Actually, you guys should stay.

158
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,830
- No.
- Mmm.

159
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,310
- We're done, aren't we?
- Yeah.

160
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,270
Let's leave together.
Next time when Bar can join us,

161
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,950
we'll party 'til the sun comes out.

162
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,590
- Yeah.
- Okay.

163
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,750
Okay.

164
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,550
So I'm done for today.

165
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,550
My girl's waiting.

166
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,630
- Whoa.
- See you.

167
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,690
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, see you.

168
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,870
I'm a heavyweight drinker.

169
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,220
So walk straight.

170
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,820
Hey, what the heck?

171
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,690
Look where you're going, fool!

172
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,690
Or I'll punch you in the face.

173
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,170
And why did you freaking block the way?

174
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,050
Oh, this guy.

175
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,610
- You're asking for this!
- Oh, hey.

176
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,670
- Try me!
- Wait.

177
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,690
My underclassman is drunk.

178
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,410
Take care of your underclassman.

179
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,410
We're leaving. I'm sorry.

180
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,670
What are you looking at?

181
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,330
That's enough, let's go.

182
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,770
You're helping me, Bar?

183
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,770
You're drunk, no doubt about it.

184
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,610
Go by yourself, my girl's waiting.

185
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,770
Where are you going?

186
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,770
Bar.

187
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,890
It's your home, Bar?

188
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,280
Hey! Ouch!

189
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,370
Won't you sleep with me?

190
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,450
Why?

191
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,410
Are you disgusted by me?

192
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,210
Huh, Bar?

193
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,530
Yes, I am.

194
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,170
(10 Missed Calls)

195
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,410
Shoot!

196
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,250
(Ploy, 10 Missed Calls)

197
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,090
Hello.

198
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,690
Uh,

199
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,690
where are you, Vee?

200
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,650
I'm at home.

201
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,930
Well, it's a long story.

202
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,380
Uh, by all accounts,
I won't come to the dorm.

203
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,370
I'm sorry, babe.

204
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,890
You're mad at me, right?

205
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,390
- No.
- Really?

206
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,170
I'm sleepy, I'll sleep now.

207
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,450
Ploy! Hello!

208
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,490
I shouldn't have!

209
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,890
Where is it?

210
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,730
Hey! My god.

211
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,730
My room.

212
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,010
I felt pity for you that
you looked like a drunken dog.

213
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,410
Are you worried about me, Bar?

214
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,130
You're still drunk, aren't you?

215
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,610
Bar.

216
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,030
May I ask you something?

217
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,330
No.

218
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,530
Please.

219
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,610
What?

220
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,610
If I were Bar,

221
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,130
what would you ask?

222
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,130
You.

223
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,090
I want you, Bar.

224
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,050
Would you be mine?

225
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,610
I'll do my best to value you.

226
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,450
Hey, I'm not...

227
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,690
Hey! Ouch!

228
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,490
Please.

229
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,570
I'm begging you.

230
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,570
Just tonight.

231
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,570
I won't trouble you anymore.

232
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,690
Bar.

233
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,940
You villain!

234
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,670
Hi.

235
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,470
Had fun last night?

236
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,550
Why are you being silent

237
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,110
when you were screaming last night?

238
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,430
What the heck did you do to me?

239
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,430
What?

240
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,390
You were begging me for it.

241
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,070
Don't you remember, wife?

242
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,570
Villain!

243
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,070
Darn you!

244
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,100
Feel familiar?

245
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,710
Or do you need me
to refresh your memory?

246
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,710
You villain!

247
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:44,830
Hey!

248
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,510
Wait!

249
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,150
Give me two bowls of porridge, Yoo.

250
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,530
Where are you going?

251
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,530
None of your business.

252
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,030
Hey, I'm talking to you nicely.

253
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,430
Why are you suddenly being nice?

254
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,070
Why?

255
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,510
Want to be a hero in drama?

256
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,010
Huh?

257
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,310
Who offers someone
breakfast after a night together?

258
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,030
No.

259
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,390
I just want to tell you this.

260
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,990
You'll die
if you tell someone about this.

261
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,270
Don't you worry.

262
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,750
The shameful story like this,

263
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,750
I'll tell no one.

264
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
What's up?

265
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,920
Where are you? Hurry up,
professor's going to check attendance.

266
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,520
I won't be in class today.

267
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,520
Can you sign the attendance sheet
for me?

268
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,400
Eh? What's going on?

269
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,560
Nothing.

270
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,000
I just want some rest.

271
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,000
Bye.

272
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,880
(Mom)

273
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,690
My Ploy.

274
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,440
I'm so sorry.

275
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,960
Please stop being mad.

276
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,120
I'll treat you to something delicious
when you're no longer mad.

277
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,320
Something sweet too.

278
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,040
- Sweet?
- Should we get rid of this?

279
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,240
- We should.
- Really?

280
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,680
Oh, boy. I'm sorry.

281
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,160
I didn't know you moved in already.

282
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,920
Oh, it's fine. He's my underclassman.

283
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,820
- Your underclassman?
- Yes, he is.

284
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,720
So we're no strangers.

285
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,200
My name is Ploy.

286
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,960
I'm Mark.

287
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,160
I didn't realize that...

288
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,830
Vee could get such a pretty girl.

289
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,760
You always do this,

290
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,960
go for someone who's already taken.

291
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,960
I wish you a long-lasting love.

292
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,320
I can do it.

293
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,560
Don't be so stubborn.
I want to do that for you.

294
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,960
I'm a grown-up man.

295
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Let's see. Give me your arm.

296
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,480
- Are you doing this?
- I am.

297
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,280
Hey!

298
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,160
Okay, fine.

299
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Are you cold?

300
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,940
A little bit.

301
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,040
- Are you?
- Mmm.

302
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,200
- Let's cover you up.
- Okay.

303
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,200
But you actually just find me a shirt.

304
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,630
Because the only person I like,

305
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,260
is Kan.

306
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,300
You're good.

307
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,900
You just build more
back muscle and you'll do fine.

308
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,140
Did someone invite
you to join the swimming club?

309
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,540
What? Don't hesitate.

310
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,500
I'm in the club. I can train you.

311
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,900
What are you doing here?

312
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,540
I just want to see you.
