7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,300
It's over! Wooh!

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,900
Nuea!

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,420
Why were you throwing my paper?
Pick them up!

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,580
Go!

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,580
- Pick them up!
- Yes, now!

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,020
You guys too!

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,820
- Why?
- You didn't stop him.

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,640
Go!

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,980
If I see even a single page left,
I'll cut you all.

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,140
And put them in order.

17
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,060
- By the way, the exam period is over.
- Yes.

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,420
So which bar for tonight?

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,660
I think about the same place where
Vee loves hugging their toilet bowl.

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,660
- OK.
- Vee.

21
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,320
Shall we?

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,700
I have to bail, need to be home tonight.

23
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,500
Vee.

24
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,500
What's going on?

25
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,620
Nothing. Just some errands to run.

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,340
See you later.

27
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,530
- Hey, wait.
- Hey!

28
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,900
- Too quick, man?
- Why are you in a hurry?

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,760
Nothing. Just some errands to run.

30
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,020
What errands?

31
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,260
Yeah.

32
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,260
You guys finished that report, right?

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,820
Yes.

34
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,540
Whatever, man.
I'll celebrate with you later.

35
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,780
See you.

36
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,020
Eh?

37
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,620
Mark.

38
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,940
- Suspicious.
- Suspicious.

39
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,180
- Boo!
- Fudge!

40
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,900
What are you playing?

41
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,980
What?

42
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,940
I saw you, having a guilty-looking,
look all around.

43
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,260
So I couldn't help it.

44
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,700
And I wanted to ask you about that.

45
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,300
Why do we have to meet here in secret?

46
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,940
We normally don't do that.

47
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,900
Well, I don't know.

48
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,180
Things change between you and me,
I guess.

49
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,940
What are the "things"
you're talking about?

50
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,180
Well, things.

51
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,440
What "things"?

52
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,260
Whatever! So let everyone
in this university know.

53
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,500
Let's see. Is there anybody?

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,660
Hey, it's Yeewah!

55
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,500
So where are you gonna take me today?

56
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,100
I'm gonna take you to the tastiest
Somtam restaurant in the world.

Is it your house?

68
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,380
Eh? I've never told you,

69
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,220
that my mom opened a Somtam restaurant.

70
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,940
And you want me to eat with your family?

71
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,780
Mmm, why not?

72
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,780
Do you mind?

73
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,660
I don't.

74
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,660
I'm just uncomfortable in crowds.

75
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,700
Especially, your parents.

76
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,620
Oh, hey! Is it him,
the junior you told me about?

77
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,300
Who wants to try my cooking, right?

78
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,300
Yes. Show him your grand stuff.

79
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,100
Bring it on.

80
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,860
Come on. Come wait inside.

81
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,540
Come on.

82
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,860
Come here.

83
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,060
Oh, uh-ohhh.

84
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,460
Hi.

85
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,600
If you want to say something,
say it now.

86
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,500
Nope. I don't have anything to say.

87
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,660
And how did you meet Vee?

88
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,460
Vee has never brought his junior home.

89
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,180
Come on, Mom. This is not just a junior.

90
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,460
But it's the special junior
with an extra topping.

91
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,020
He lives in the same dorm as mine,
so we're kinda close, Mom.

92
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,140
Oh, I see.

93
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,500
Here it is,

94
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,180
a mixed Somtam, guarantee with my butt.

95
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,710
Nice aroma.

96
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,380
- Eh?
- Is there something wrong?

97
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,140
No.

98
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,290
I just think it smells so...

99
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,470
Oh, it's from my homemade Pladeak.
You can't find it somewhere else.

100
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,660
- Pladeak?
- Yes. It's Pladeak.

101
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,220
It's Fermented Fish, do you know it?

102
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,420
- It's Fermented Fish?
- It is.

103
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,740
You don't eat Fermented Fish?

104
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,380
It's not that.

105
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,420
I've just never tried it before.

106
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,420
I see.

107
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,700
Perfect! It'll be your first time.

108
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,460
Don't ruin my mom's good intention.

109
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,700
- Go ahead.
- Eat it.

110
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,860
- Come on.
- The big chunk.

111
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,020
Eat it!

112
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,100
Come on.

113
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,100
- Take a big bite.
- Go ahead.

114
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,980
Oh, come on.

115
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,430
How is it?

116
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,200
Tasty.

117
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,660
Tasty. isn't it?

118
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,620
So, eat more.

119
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,620
- Come on.
- Let's eat.

120
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,540
Take the Sticky Rice.

121
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,900
Let's eat it with the Sticky Rice.

122
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,700
Oh, honey, the smell of Pladeak
goes all the way to the front door.

123
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,900
- Oh, hi, honey.
- Wow!

124
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,420
Dad, he's a junior in the same faculty.

125
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,140
Hello, sir.

126
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,940
Oh, hi, hello.

127
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,860
Honey, do you want to eat now?
Do you take Sticky Rice or noodles?

128
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,060
I think I'll clean myself up.
I'm so sweaty.

129
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,060
- Oh, OK.
- I'll eat later.

130
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,380
- Mom!
- Huh?

131
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,580
Are you roasting some chicken?

132
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,940
I smell something burning.

133
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
Oh, I am!

134
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,260
I forgot.

135
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,780
Go ahead.
I'll bring some chicken for you.

136
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,220
- Yes.
- Please, eat.

137
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,340
- Let's eat.
- Mmm.

138
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,220
Did you have a good meal?

139
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,980
- I had a great meal. It's so delicious.
- Well, good, good.

140
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,300
You'll beg for more.

141
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,100
Thank you for today.

142
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,820
Yes, it's okay.

143
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Come again next time.

144
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,380
Give him a good ride, okay?

145
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,580
Sure.

146
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,860
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

147
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,500
Let's go.

148
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,740
I'm sorry about my dad earlier.

149
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,260
He doesn't like it
when we bring a boy home.

150
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,660
Since Yoo introduced
the Homecoming King to our family.

151
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,810
Mmm.

152
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,580
Well, I get it.

153
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,060
So tell your dad
that we're not boyfriends.

154
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,420
Sure.

155
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,300
I won't let you go home,
if you're my boyfriend.

156
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,220
Let's go.

157
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,380
Hmph.

158
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,860
- Hey!
- Eh?

159
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,420
Darn you!

160
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,020
What?

161
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,820
Since when I get a flat tire?

162
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,980
I guess you have to stay for tonight.

163
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,220
Don't your family run
an auto repair shop?

164
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,780
Can't you fix a flat tire?

165
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,060
Why don't you open your eyes
and see that we're closed now?

166
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,390
I'll ask my dad tomorrow.

167
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,390
- Spend a night here.
- It's okay.

168
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,780
I can use a taxi app.

169
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,500
The edge of the suburb like here,

170
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,740
you can't find a taxi.

171
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,740
No matter what, tonight,

172
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,270
you have to stay with Vee, Mark.

173
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,140
Don't forget,

174
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
that Mark has legs.

175
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,260
I can walk to the nearest bus stop.
Bye-bye.

176
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,620
OK.

177
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
Hey!

178
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,100
Do you need a ride, kid?

179
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,100
Do you?

180
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,620
Hey!

181
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,300
It's me.

182
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,940
Let's go home.

183
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,700
My mom prepared a bed for you.

184
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,580
This place is isolated,

185
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,580
so you can get mugged if you're unlucky.

186
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,780
But if you're afraid,

187
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,780
you can hold my hand.

188
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,220
Everybody would want to hold
an ex-Homecoming King's hand.

189
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,060
But you keep your distance.

190
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,260
Do you think I'd fall for you because of
your Homecoming King history?

191
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,180
So what's your type?

192
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,020
Tell me yours.

193
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,660
My type?

194
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,540
I'd like someone younger,

195
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,300
small shape, fair skin,

196
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,940
who loves to argue.

197
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,660
I'll kiss him
until he can't open his mouth.

198
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,540
And my type is...

199
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,540
I can tell.

200
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,820
Someone rugged, cheeky and playful.

201
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,460
Sure!

202
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,780
No. Someone clean, kind and caring.

203
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,780
What?

204
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,060
It's me.

205
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,980
All of the things you said, it's me.

206
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,700
Eh?

207
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,940
More importantly,

208
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,660
not a narcissist.

209
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,580
Oh, it's definitely me now.

210
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,900
Here.

211
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,860
Know how to use it?

212
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,460
Of course.

213
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,780
Oh, my!

214
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,700
Wait.

215
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,300
Here, my clothes.

216
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,940
Do you mind?

217
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,580
Better than being naked.

218
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,740
But...

219
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,170
You're stressing because of Ploy?

220
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,300
You're not the only one
who spies on people's status.

221
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,740
With Bar,

222
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,420
how can you forget about him?

223
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,860
Who told you I forgot him?

224
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,020
I just no longer want him
to be my boyfriend.

225
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,660
For someone,

226
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,100
you can't forget them.

227
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,260
The best you can do,

228
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,380
is forgetting your feeling for them.

229
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,140
So,

230
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,500
can you help me to forget them?

231
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,500
How can I help?

232
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,780
Ahem! Ahem! Ahem!

233
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,020
Mom told me to bring you
a cuddle pillow.

234
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,220
Maybe you don't need one?

235
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,980
Give it to me.

236
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,540
Here.

237
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,100
You two have shagged, haven't you?

238
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,980
Hey! Go away!

239
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,420
What does shag mean?

240
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,420
Shag?

241
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,980
It means bathroom. Have you peed?

242
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,980
Mmm.

243
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,060
Already shagged.

244
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,500
What's with that kid?

245
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,900
Well, nothing special.

246
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,940
Let's be real.

247
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,180
You didn't break up with Ploy, right?

248
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,330
She asked me to take a break.

249
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,460
What if she suddenly miraculously
wants to get back together?

250
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,620
What would you do?

251
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,940
Vee.

252
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,660
Give me an honest answer.

253
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,260
Do you still love Ploy?

254
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,860
Ploy is my first girlfriend,

255
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,860
whom I have been with the longest.

256
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,140
You expect me to feel nothing,

257
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,260
is it impossible?

258
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,020
I know you two have been through a lot.

259
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,660
But it doesn't mean that you
can keep someone aside like this.

260
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,860
I know.

261
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,180
So why don't you clear things up before?

262
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,140
Do you like that kid?

263
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,940
Is it really hard to say that word?

264
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,900
Or you don't want to be
serious with him in the first place?

265
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,620
I...

266
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,220
I can't say the word "like" out loud.

267
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,980
Even I desperately want
to tell him that.

268
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,020
He's the first person
I want to be serious with.

269
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,140
So I want to clear everything with Ploy,

270
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,660
and I can firmly tell him that.

271
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,780
♪I'm standing here and watching you♪

272
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,420
♪Never ask to be an important role♪

273
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,100
♪Just want to be as close
as you let me be♪

274
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,860
♪My job is to love you♪

275
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,540
If you want more seasoning,
sauces are over there.

276
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,900
Vee. Are you awake?

277
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,900
You got up so late.

278
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,340
Hey. You can't have my cooking today.

279
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,860
Wow.

280
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,580
What's up with you?

281
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,980
Here.

282
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,140
I return the favor for your hospitality.

283
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,020
I've waited to eat this for so long.

284
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,440
I'm the one who's waited.

285
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,060
Whatever.

286
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,460
Try it.

287
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,900
I could eat that.

288
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,220
It means good or bad?

289
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,830
I'll sit outside.

290
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,500
So is it good?

291
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,030
Wanna try it yourself?

292
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,820
- Eh?
- It's good.

293
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,060
Man, it's fixed.

294
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,060
So you won't stay for another night.

295
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,220
Just hurry up.

296
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,220
Come on.

297
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,660
Eh?

298
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
Hold on.

299
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,820
Oh, boy!

300
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,460
They announced grades
for Electricity Class.

301
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,620
Let me check mine.

302
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,900
Wait a second.

303
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,140
Check it for me, will you?

304
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,460
What grade I get?

305
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,540
Eh?

306
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,340
You got an F.

307
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,540
What? Really?

308
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,380
Oh, no!

309
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,580
I'm kidding.

310
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,740
You got a C.

311
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,020
Oh, you! This one is the most fearful!

312
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,340
I've feared for this one only.

313
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,980
What about you?
You know all your grades?

314
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,940
Not yet.

315
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,780
But I already know all the tough ones.

316
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,820
I survived.

317
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,580
See?

318
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,380
The power of Sai Dam Hermit Shrine.

319
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,700
The one we worshiped.

320
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
We need to redeem our vows.

321
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,740
It's your turn to kid me?

322
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,140
Go or not, it's your choice.

323
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,820
But as far as I know,

324
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,300
whoever breaks their vow,
never graduates.
