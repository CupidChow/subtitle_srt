7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,480
Wake up!

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,840
Let me sleep.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,010
I don't have morning class.

10
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,050
Wake up.
Ploy might be worried about you.

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,070
Yeah, right!

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,920
I'm screwed!

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,140
When did she text me?

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,190
So hurry back to your room.
She might be so worried by now.

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,540
Yeah! I'm going now.

16
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,750
Vee?

17
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,030
Where are you, Ploy?

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,460
I'm in our room.

19
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,470
I'm at Wahn's room.

20
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,950
We've been doing the report
until morning.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,700
Well...

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,360
Want me to come to pick you up?

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,920
It's okay. I can be home by myself.

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,240
I see.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,360
Okay. Please take care of yourself.
I'm worried about you.

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,960
Thank you. You're the best.

27
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,960
Love you, Vee.

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,520
I love you too, Ploy.

29
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,180
Hop on.

30
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,260
What's wrong?

31
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,510
Do you want a ride, kiddo?

32
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,040
What about Ploy?

33
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,020
She's not with you?

34
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,800
She can manage.

35
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,380
Are you coming or not?

36
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,600
No, thanks.

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
I rather take a mini-bus.

38
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,980
Don't play hard to get. Hop on.

39
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,800
I said no.

40
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,120
Okay, if you won't come,
I won't go either.

41
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,600
Let's see.

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,060
Fine.

43
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,800
Hang on tight, kiddo.

44
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,680
(Faculty of Engineering)

45
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,850
I'm hungry, what about you?

46
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,060
A little bit.

47
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,380
Okay, so...

48
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,180
But I already made a plan
with my friends.

49
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,860
See you.

50
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,500
Eh? What?

51
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,470
Hey, Mark! Whoa!

52
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,220
What the heck?

53
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,700
I bought this for you.

54
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,820
To comfort you
who got stood up and ate alone.

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,690
You gave me a headache.

56
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,040
One minute, you're soft
and the next minute you're hard.

57
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,600
I don't know what to predict?

58
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,080
You don't need to predict anything.

59
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,080
Why can't I do that?

60
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,040
Since we are...

61
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,100
(Ploy)

62
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,540
My baby Ploy.

63
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,920
I'm at the university.

64
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,040
Eh? You're at our dorm already?

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,200
Okay, babe.

66
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,760
Make sure you have your meal.

67
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,200
If I don't care about you,

68
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,520
who else can I care about?

69
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,800
Yes, babe.

70
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,800
Get some rest.

71
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,880
I'm gonna hang up now.

72
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,060
See you, babe.

73
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,760
What are you doing?

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,400
Nope.

75
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,800
I was just playing around.

76
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,800
Hmm, really?

77
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,560
Is it because you know
I don't like garlic?

78
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
So you pick them out for me.

79
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,480
Oh, boy, you're so cute.

80
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,120
Stop doing this.

81
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,320
And stop hanging out
with me or talking to me.

82
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,720
Why are you doing this?

83
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,820
We're nothing.

84
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,760
But we've done thing.

85
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,000
It's just that.

86
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
If you feel so much responsible,

87
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,800
don't.

88
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,600
People are being together
because of love,

89
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,240
not responsibility.

90
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,340
Do I need to repeat it to you?

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That I'm the one
who pursues your friend.

92
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,120
And that you hate me.

93
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,480
Now,

94
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,320
I stop following your friend,

95
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,880
you should stop following me too.

96
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,400
Really?

97
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,760
Do you really see me as that guy?

98
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,560
Answer me when I asked.

99
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,600
For me,

100
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,440
you're just a senior.

101
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,840
Should we work on our report at a cafe?

102
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,740
Every time we go there,
we end up playing game.

103
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,280
Hello.

104
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,200
Hi.

105
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,200
Can I borrow your friend for today?

106
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,200
Huh?

107
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,760
But I have nothing to do with you.

108
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,200
Let's eat.

109
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,880
Mmm.

110
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,640
I'll give him back to you.

111
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,320
Eh?

112
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,820
- Hey, bro.
- Hey!

113
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,800
What are you gonna do?

114
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
You told me this morning

115
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
that you have no more feeling for Bar.

116
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I don't buy it.

117
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,440
When you have feelings for someone,

118
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,950
is that easy to give up?

119
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,510
You can make all
the assumptions as you want.

120
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,720
But I really gave up on him.

121
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,840
What made you give up this easily?

122
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,150
Or do you have feelings
for someone else?

123
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,120
Who is it?

124
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,620
That kid whom you've brought
to the rooftop?

125
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,850
Or Nuea?

126
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,220
Whoever

127
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,900
but you.

128
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,020
Come with me.

129
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,690
Where to?

130
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,780
To ensure me

131
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,570
that you really gave up on Bar.

132
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,530
When I'm sure,

133
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,840
I can interpret the way
you looked at me earlier.

134
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,110
Bar.

135
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,310
May I join you today?

136
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,430
Yeah, sure.

137
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,740
What are you looking at?

138
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,470
You can't stand to see a loving couple?

139
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,070
Aren't you afraid that
he will be uncomfortable?

140
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,870
Why do I have to be
when you no longer love him?

141
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,110
Wait for me here.

142
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,580
- Thanks.
- Are you tired?

143
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,580
A little bit.

144
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,960
Thanks for waiting.

145
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,520
What are you looking at?
I'm gonna swim today.

146
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,640
Hey, Vee.

147
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,200
Wanna do double swimming race?

148
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,440
So I can practice at the same time.

149
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,360
Of course, you team up with Kan.

150
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,760
- I'll be with Mark.
- Huh?

151
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,730
Ready.

152
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,520
Set.

153
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,160
Mark is not half bad.

154
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,480
And what makes you
join our swimming practice?

155
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,680
You never come when I ask.

156
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,360
Well, nothing.

157
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,080
Really?

158
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,440
You just wanted to take him
to a swimming pool?

159
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,460
Come on, Bar!

160
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,180
Faster! Faster!

161
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,540
Bar!

162
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,660
Go! Go! Go! Bar!

163
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,380
Come on!

164
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,380
How do you know

165
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,220
that I injured my foot?

166
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,740
You could have swum way smoother.

167
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,000
I can tell by the bloodstain
on the platform.

168
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,940
Are you that good?

169
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,900
It's like when you've noticed my shoes.

170
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,140
So...

171
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,620
Did you get your answer?

172
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,580
I know the answer

173
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,580
about you and Bar.

174
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,890
I believe you now when you told me
that you have no longer feeling for him.

175
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,730
How can you be so sure?

176
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,740
By the way you look at him.

177
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,700
Yes, Ploy.

178
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,940
Late again, babe?

179
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,580
Okay. Please take care of yourself.

180
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,800
Hey.

181
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,120
Yeah.

182
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,640
I think that kid has given up on you.

183
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,900
And I've thought you want something.

184
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,620
You just wanted to test him?

185
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,860
Indeed. Why are you so surprised?

186
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,780
I thought you have known that
he no longer has feelings for me.

187
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,240
I thought you took him
here for another reason.

188
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,380
What reason?

189
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,800
Never mind that.

190
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,250
But did you have your answer?

191
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,960
I kinda have it,

192
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,960
and don't have it at the same time.

193
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,920
In my opinion,

194
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,280
something has its due course of time.

195
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,040
What I want to know is

196
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,600
what you would do
when you have your answer.

197
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,960
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

198
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,520
- Bottoms up!
- Don't rush, man.

199
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,040
This place has its good vibe.

200
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,280
Yes.

201
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,080
(Did you have a safe trip?)

202
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,800
Hmm?

203
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,280
Who is it?

204
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,480
Your boy texted you?

205
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,960
What boy?

206
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,480
Whoa, I smell something fishy.

207
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,680
Why you're being so awkward?

208
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,080
See?

209
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,250
He just raised his glass
to change the subject.

210
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,320
It's obvious.

211
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,340
He never raised his glass,
we're the ones who always do that.

212
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,240
You're on point.

213
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,840
I'm just being bored.

214
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,760
Let that be the real reason.

215
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
You've never asked us out.

216
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,200
Well, hello.

217
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,480
I'm Tew and what's your name?

218
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,160
Mark.

219
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,440
I see. My friends just canceled on me.

220
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,830
May I join you?

221
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,040
Hey, scoot.

222
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,680
Please.

223
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,480
I don't think so.

224
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,600
We're not good
at holding a conversation.

225
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
I see.

226
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,640
At least, can I have your LINE contact.

227
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,040
Wow.

228
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,080
I don't have LINE application. Sorry.

229
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,280
What?

230
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,280
I see. Okay, thanks.

231
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,420
- Mark! What's going on?
- Oh, boy.

232
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,600
You just chat with someone via LINE.

233
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,240
He's also your type.

234
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,480
- Yeah.
- Darn!

235
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,280
- What's wrong.
- He's acting wired.

236
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,000
- Yes.
- Hey!

237
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,000
Or...

238
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,520
The rumor about his new crush is true.

239
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,320
Admit it.

240
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,040
You believe in such a fake news?

241
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
See?

242
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,400
Why are you acting wired?

243
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,840
He's right.

244
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,640
When am I acting wired?
Nothing has changed.

245
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
Look at yourself.

246
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,840
- Don't use a joke to hide.
- You avoid the question.

247
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,520
You just masked the truth with humor.

248
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,200
- I can read you.
- Something's fishy.

249
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,680
Hello.

250
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,880
Where are you?

251
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,040
Vee, I'm sorry.

252
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,640
I forgot to tell you that
I haven't done with the report.

253
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,280
I see.

254
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,280
Well,

255
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,640
when are you gonna finish?
Want me to pick you up?

256
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,520
I think I need to sleep here.

257
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,240
I don't want to leave
the report to Wahn.

258
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,680
Uh-huh, I see.

259
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,920
I got you.

260
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,600
So take care of yourself.

261
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,760
I'm so sorry. Are you mad?

262
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,440
I'm not. What are you talking about?

263
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,440
Okay, I'm not wasting your working time.

264
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,280
Don't overwork, babe.

265
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,480
Vee, you're always being nice to me.

266
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,680
I gotta go. Bye-bye.

267
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,680
Bye, babe.

268
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,620
I thought you could handle your drinks.

269
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,500
- Kampahn.
- Another bottle!

270
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,700
- I told you to take it slow.
- I told you.

271
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,830
And you said what? 1:1 ratio?

272
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,780
- Walk!
- Let's see for tomorrow.

273
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,020
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You're good.

274
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,580
Hey, handle him with care.

275
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,660
Eh? Where are you going?

276
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,020
I'm going to get a taxi.

277
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,620
- Eh? Why?
- We can't all sit in one car.

278
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,740
- Okay.
- Good luck.

279
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,070
See you, man.

280
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,780
- Be safe.
- Okay.

281
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,450
Oh, Mark.

282
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,750
Your friends bailed?

283
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,240
Oh, hi, Nuea.

284
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,220
Hi.

285
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,980
Hmm, you're doing a report?

286
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,340
Want my help?

287
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,280
It's okay.

288
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,480
Don't want to bother you.

289
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
Don't think like that.

290
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,640
I'm willing to help you
with everything, Mark.

291
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,640
Do you have some question?

292
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,000
Can I ask you one thing?

293
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,550
Mmm. Shoot.

294
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,660
Vee and Ploy are together for so long?

295
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,920
Eh?

296
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,640
I thought it's about your class.

297
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,680
No special reason. I'm just curious.

298
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,680
Vee seems to be a cheeky person.

299
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,080
Unlikely to get along with Ploy,
so I got curious.

300
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,880
Mmm.

301
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,320
You go to the right person.

302
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,560
I've seen them since
they were still not a couple.

303
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,560
Let me tell you the story.

304
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,400
We're so glad to become
Homecoming King and Queen.

305
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,120
I still don't believe it.

306
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,160
How do you feel about
your shipping on the internet?

307
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,640
I'm one of the shippers too.

308
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
The strong vibe,

309
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
the intimacy,

310
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,240
made a shipping become real.

311
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,880
Ahem.

312
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,080
Hmm.

313
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,120
Are you holding hands, Vee?

314
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,000
Why? We're a couple now.

315
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
- Wow.
- Take a seat.

316
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,520
We were worried about them at first.

317
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,240
That they wouldn't make it.

318
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
But we've been watching them loving,

319
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,940
and taking of each other.

320
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,680
Next thing we know,
it's been three years now.

321
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,680
Three years?

322
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,120
And what about

323
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,040
a fight between those two?

324
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,560
The only thing left to do is
to send the wedding invitations.

325
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,910
So it's impossible for someone to cheat.

326
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,480
Certainly.

327
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,340
Why do you ask?

328
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,220
Nothing.

329
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,530
Don't you go home?

330
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,780
Look. I'm stuck here
because of the rain like you.

331
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,130
And what about that thing in your hand?

332
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,340
So what?

333
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,010
Do you want me to ride with one hand
and hold an umbrella with another?

334
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,050
I'd rather wait till the rain stops.

335
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,890
I might have some company.

336
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,610
Tell me honestly,

337
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,450
were you this sassy
when you pursued Ploy?

338
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,330
What do you mean by that?

339
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,890
I think we need to open up for once.

340
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,530
I have no feeling for Bar,

341
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,930
so...

342
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,340
there's no reason for us
to keep seeing each other, right?

343
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,530
This is how you want
to end things between us?

344
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,210
Mmm.

345
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,690
Or don't you think so?

346
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,530
Yes, I do.

347
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,650
However, we will see each other often,

348
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,730
since we're...

349
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,830
In the same faculty.

350
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,330
You're right.

351
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,130
This is what we are.

352
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,850
♪Who'd have thought that your touch♪

353
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,730
♪Who'd have thought that your embrace♪

354
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,330
♪It would turn out to be just a dream♪

355
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,330
♪A blind like me♪

356
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,530
♪A long-time hurtful person like me♪

357
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:33,290
♪I hoped you could love me♪

358
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,930
It seems to rain for a long time.

359
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,010
Take it.

360
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,050
Keep it.

361
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,250
It's an order from your senior.
