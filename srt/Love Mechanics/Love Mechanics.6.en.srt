00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,220
Did you pack soap,
toothbrush and toothpaste?

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,660
Yes, I did.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,740
I'm not forgetful like you.

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,020
What? At least I don't forget
to remind you.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,020
I think I deserve a reward
for my good deed.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,100
So what do you want?

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,100
Mmm.

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,380
Spooning you all night long.
How about that?

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,500
I don't think you want only spooning.

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,180
Only spooning.

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,660
We're going to the orientation camp tomorrow.
We won't be spooning for many days.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,780
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,820
But If you're coming from your faraway
home, I might be asleep by then.

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,620
So if I teleport to you,
will you let me hug you?

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,180
If you come in three,

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,180
two, one...

22
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,220
The orientation is tomorrow.

23
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,740
What are you doing here today?

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,740
I'm not here for the orientation.

25
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,620
I'm here for my lover.

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,980
Hey!

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,700
Ouch!

28
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,580
Vee! We have to get up
early tomorrow, don't we?

Be more energetic, guys!

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,740
- Finally.
- What?

42
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,860
Whoa!

43
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,320
Are you done with the attendance check?

44
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,020
- There's almost everyone.
- Mmm.

45
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,260
See?

46
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,980
You got up late. They're all here.

47
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,380
Who makes me not get enough sleep?

48
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,660
- I still don't get enough.
- Hey.

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,340
Do you think there's
something between that two?

50
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,540
The lemon tart
that Vee posted on Facebook.

51
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,740
It was Mark's, I remember.

52
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,740
I don't know.

53
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,460
But if there's something
special, isn't that good?

54
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,860
How is it good?

55
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,180
Vee still hasn't cleared things
with Ploy.

56
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,620
And he's messing with my frat brother?

57
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,480
But I think...

58
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,300
They're just brothers.

59
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,180
Go do your thing.

60
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,620
I don't think so and don't change the subject.
Look how they're looking at each other.

61
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,780
- I don't know...
- Surprise!

62
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,340
Hey!

63
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,860
How did you come?

64
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,620
Ahem!

65
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,900
Who invites him here?

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,780
Me.

67
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,660
One more medic,

68
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,460
- it's not bad.
- It's better, right?

69
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,860
Good luck.

70
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,620
Big event like this, I think
I can't cover that by myself.

71
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,180
This is a senior of mine.

72
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,860
Dr. Ana,
he's a fifth-year medical student.

73
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

74
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,780
Hi.

75
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,740
He'll be at your service anytime.

76
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,460
And I will be his assistant.

77
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,900
Perfect. So let's talk about
our welfare service.

78
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,460
Let's go.

79
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,540
Hurry back, Kan.

80
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,860
Please sit here, Doctor.

81
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,140
Right here.

82
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,620
Hey, kids.

83
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,500
I arranged your bus
by your student ID code.

84
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,340
Bus number one is for ID 01 to 30.

85
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,380
Pond and Bar will be taking care of you.

86
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,780
Bus number two is for ID 31 to 60.

87
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,620
Nuea and Kla will be taking care of you.

88
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,020
Nuea will entertain you all day.

89
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,940
Okay. Keep going. Be careful, kids.

90
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,340
Come on, let's get in car.

91
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

92
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,180
- Please, come on in.
- Please.

93
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,140
Oh, Yeewah, I'll help Nuea.
I don't think he can manage that.

94
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,860
Mhmm.

95
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,460
Dude. I'm sorry.

96
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,580
I forgot to inform you that you need to
be on bus number three with Lee and Tee.

97
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,220
- Welcome to my world.
- Welcome to my world.

98
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,740
Number three, okay?

99
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,140
But bus number three is yours, isn't it?

100
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,340
Come on.
I have to cooperate with people.

101
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,700
And look after the juniors,
I can't do all that.

102
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,220
- Yeah.
- Please.

103
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,140
Hmmm.

104
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,220
Please.

105
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,340
Come on, my friend.

106
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,470
Or is there something on bus number two?

107
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,180
Well. there's Nuea.

108
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,500
Hmm.

109
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,700
Fine. I go with number three.

110
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,100
Excellent, my friend.

111
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,500
Kids whose ID is 61 to 90,

112
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,380
get on the bus number three with
our good man Vee, Lee and Tee.

113
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,020
Hello.

114
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,520
Bummer!

115
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,100
What are you so bummed about?
Last night wasn't enough for you?

116
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,500
It will never be enough.

117
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,740
Are you upset?

118
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,620
You're talking about Yeewah, right?

119
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,620
I reckon that she knows.

120
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,020
No.

121
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,060
I'm talking about me being
on the same bus as Nuea.

122
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,380
Eh? Are you crazy?

123
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,560
I am not that immature.

124
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,060
I'm not a child.

125
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,620
Who are you talking to?

126
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,300
Don't tell me that is...

127
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,740
- Your boyfriend?
- No.

128
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,180
My dad.

129
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,700
- Dad?
- Your dad?

130
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,670
Hello, Dad. I'm his big brother.

131
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,100
I'll take good care of Mark
until the end of my life.

132
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,060
I mean, the end of the trip.

133
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,580
I gotta go, Dad.

134
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,500
I'm going to look after front roll kids.

135
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,780
The kids in the front roll
are all yours to take care of.

136
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,660
Okay?

137
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,220
Hey!

138
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,780
Who were you talking to?

139
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,700
Well, my mom.

140
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,900
Mom?

141
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,060
- My mom.
- Really?

142
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,460
Why do you look so bummed?

143
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,290
Yeah, well, someone just
separated my mom and my dad.

144
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,820
I think people like them should be
cursed to be alone all of their life.

145
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,940
Too harsh.

146
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,780
Right!

147
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,590
- Right?
- I agree with that.

148
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,820
Yeah, I have sympathy for them.

149
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,660
Unlike our Mark and Nuea,

150
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,540
who can be on the same bus.

151
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,420
- It must be fate.
- I heard that they're so sweet.

152
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,180
Really?

153
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,060
Lovey-dovey. Lovey-dovey.

154
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I don't think so.

155
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,540
It looks like he's just
a bit flirty with him.

156
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,180
Don't you dare say that.

157
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,540
It's not just a flirt.
He told me openly,

158
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,300
that he likes this junior so much
that he wants to marry him.

159
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

160
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,220
What's with you two?

161
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,740
Why are you upset?

162
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,740
Nuea is handsome, comes from a rich family,
and is nice and generous.

163
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,860
Perfect in every way,
he will be lucky to have him.

164
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,900
Yes.

165
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,140
There's a possibility.

166
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,860
Maybe it's the orientation's charm.

167
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,740
They go in as frat brothers
but come back as a couple.

168
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,180
My lovely Nuea.

169
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,360
Yes?

170
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,660
Let's go.

171
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,780
Oh, hey, Fuse.

172
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,700
Wanna sit with me?

173
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Sure. Well...

174
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,940
Can I take the seat next to Mark?

175
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,250
Yes. Sure.

176
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,940
Thanks.

177
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,620
- Hey!
- What's up?

178
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,380
- Let's take a selfie.
- Okay.

179
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,580
(You can relax. I sit with Fuse.)

180
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,260
What are you smiling at?

181
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,700
- Are you insane?
- Huh?

182
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,380
You were upset and the next minute
you were happy.

183
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,260
I rather take a nap
than be with you guys.

184
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,940
- Why are you taking a nap? They want to play.
- Yeah, right.

185
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,180
- I don't want to nap.
- Yes.

186
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,380
Are you okay?

187
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,180
I'm not okay.

188
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,100
I feel dizzy and nauseous.

189
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,740
Are you alright?

190
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,020
Hey! Who has a herbal inhaler?

191
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,580
Fuse got car sick.

192
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,580
I told Kla to buy some meds.

193
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,420
Oh, right. They're in my bag. Take them.

194
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,860
Where is it? Too much stuff.

195
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,540
I'm looking for it.

196
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,950
Where?

197
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,580
Darn you, Kla.

198
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,580
I told you to buy meds for car sickness,

199
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,860
not the meds for hangover.

200
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,740
What? It's the medicines.
They work the same.

201
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,900
Oh, I have meds for car sickness.

202
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,340
Oh, can I have some?

203
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:30,940
Sure.

204
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,270
He can take the front seat,
so it won't be too wobbly.

205
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,100
Oh, Okay.

206
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,420
Okay.

207
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,590
Here.

208
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,820
Let me take you there.

209
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,040
Walk slowly.

210
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,220
Are you okay?

211
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,260
Here.

212
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,260
Thank you.

213
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,380
I think he'll be okay.

214
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,060
I can change seat with you.

215
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,380
Want some snacks? I bought plenty.

216
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,780
No, thanks. It's okay.

217
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,820
Mark.

218
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,540
I have been thinking about what you
told me. You have someone,

219
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,820
but he's not ready to tell people.

220
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,860
And?

221
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,020
It means I still have hope.

222
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,700
Until he's ready,

223
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,060
I'll change your mind and like me.

224
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,780

What were you watching?

235
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,500
Nothing.

236
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,380
But you seem upset.

237
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,020
And your "nothing" was in wrong key.

238
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,060
If you have something in your mind,
you can tell your friend.

239
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,740
There's no secret between friends.

240
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,780
Yeah, thanks.

241
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,780
I'll tell you when I have one.

242
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,780
(Rest Area)

243
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,580
Okay, kids! We have a 15-minute break.

244
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,040
You can use the bathroom or buy some snacks.
See you later. Let's go.

245
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,040
What do you have?

246
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,500
Wanna go get some snacks?

247
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,700
Go ahead, I'm not hungry.

248
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,820
Mmm.

249
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,220
What about bathroom?

250
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,780
You can go. I'm gonna take a nap.

251
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,660
Mmmm.

252
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,060
Tell me if you need something.

253
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,060
I'll get that for you.

254
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,620
Okay.

255
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,180
Mmm. See you.

256
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,500
Yes.

257
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,780
Hey! You told me you sit with Fuse.

258
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,940
Fuse had car sick,
so he had to switch seats with him.

259
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,340
I see.

260
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,060
You don't go and get some snack?

261
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,100
The way you danced with Nuea,
you must be worn out.

262
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,660
You told me you wouldn't
be immature for this trip.

263
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,780
And I'm not being immature.

264
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,540
I was just asking.

265
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,980
- Oh, you're not?
- Uh-huh.

266
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,980
Okay.

267
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,060
So I can get some snacks
with Nuea, right?

268
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,380
Mark.

269
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,700
Vee!

270
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,860
What are you doing here?

271
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,340
Wrong bus, dude. Get off now.

272
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,060
What? Is this not number three?

273
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,660
They all look the same.

274
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,540
You get on the wrong bus. Come here.

275
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,980
Okay, my friend.

276
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,500
Oh, man!

277
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,290
Let's go.

278
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,020
Are you asleep?

279
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,860
Yes.

280
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,380
You can lean on me.

281
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,380
So you will be comfortable.

282
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,220
No, thanks. I should not.

283
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,770
So you can go for someone else.

284
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,580
It's okay.

285
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,380
I don't want to go anyway.

286
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,060
Hey.

287
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,860
No one knows what the future holds.

288
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,740
Okay.

289
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,540
I give up then.

290
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,460
So...

291
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,540
I'm not bothering you anymore.

292
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,100
- Lee!
- What's wrong with you?

293
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,340
Did you see this, on Facebook?

294
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,540
I just see this now.

295
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,020
- These two again. They're so cute.
- Adorable.

296
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,180
We should abandon our paddles.

297
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,640
They're not just a shipped couple.

298
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,370
- They're cute together.
- Yes, they are.

299
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,460
- They're perfect for each other.
- Lovey-dovey.

300
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,980
- So adorable.
- The most.

301
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,460
Hit the like button now!

302
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,860
My screen will be cracked.

303
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,860
Everyone, put your belongings
in the lobby over there.

304
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,300
I'll send the room list in group chat.

305
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,020
Two people per room
as in the list I gave you.

306
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,020
Please don't mix it up yourself.

307
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,300
Yeewah!

308
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,180
Yes?

309
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,540
Why do I share a room with a girl?

310
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,540
Huh?

311
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,140
Mark, Mark shares a room with Jareon.

312
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,740
What's wrong?

313
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,660
I'm Jareon.

314
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,980
I thought it was a boy's name.

315
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,220
Well, you can share a room
with me, Jareon.

316
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,500
You can sleep alone, Mark?

317
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,020
No problem.

318
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,940
Okay.

319
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,710
Hey!

320
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,420
What are you doing?

321
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,820
I'm afraid you'll be lonely
so I'll share a room with you.

322
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,260
So you don't need
to lean on someone else.

323
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,420
No, thanks.

324
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,900
What about your roommate?
They won't suspect?

325
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,580
I told everybody that tonight I'm gonna
drink at the beach until sunrise.

326
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,900
We should not.

327
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,620
Nuea is just next door.
Aren't you afraid that he knows?

328
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,220
Please, let me sleep here.

329
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,220
I carried my bag already.

330
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,900
I can't get enough of your hug.

331
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,780
Mark.

332
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,580
Mark. It's me.

333
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,140
Oh, boy. It's Yeewah.

334
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,140
Mark.

335
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,500
- Take your bag.
- Mark.

336
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,420
Mark.

337
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,100
Yes, Yeewah?

338
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,740
Is your room okay? I check it for you.

339
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,500
It's okay.

340
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,500
Well, okay.

341
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,860
Let me see your room.

342
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,100
- All the snacks are here.
- All here.

343
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,860
Okay.

344
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,820
Trash can.

345
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,340
I think it's okay.

346
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,980
- Everything's okay.
- Yes.

347
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,260
What's that noise?

348
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,660
I heard nothing.

349
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,260
I heard something, Mark.

350
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,510
Yeewah?

351
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Huh?

352
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,620
There's no water running in my room,
Yeewah.

353
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,620
Eh? What's your room number?

354
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,380
I'm not sure. It's over there.

355
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,980
Okay, I'll check it out.

356
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,580
Mark. I'll be back.
Tell me if there's some problem.

357
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,340
Okay.

358
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,660
Okay. Let's go to your room.

359
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,020
It's on that side, Yeewah.

360
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,360
Take me there.

361
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,820
Almost get caught.

362
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,340
Hurry back to your room.

363
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,700
So.

364
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,580
I'll be back tonight.

365
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,740
Hurry back to your room.

366
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,660
I leave this here.

367
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,020
♪I might not be good at making myself
look cute but I'm good at loving♪

368
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,900
♪I'm looking at you at all time♪

369
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,140
♪I'm smirking because
of my flown-over love♪

370
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,380
Let's cheers.

371
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,900
- Okay.
- Wooh!

372
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,780
- Cheers.
- What is it?

373
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,580
What's that green thing?

374
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,570
Huh?

375
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,500
What's wrong with you, Vee?
Drinking something sweet?

376
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,940
In hibernation?

377
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,380
I'm not in a hurry.

378
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,700
If you're not in a hurry,
you're not drinking moss.

379
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,380
It's green tea.

380
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,220
- Green tea!
- Darn you.

381
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,900
Oh, it's green tea?

382
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,340
- You're teasing him.
- You just discredited matcha.

383
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,020
- I've never had that.
- Oh, my!

384
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,500
Come here.

385
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,380
My brother is with me.

386
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,780
Come on, kids. Find yourself a seat.

387
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,020
- Hello.
- Hello.

388
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,740
- Hi.
- Hello.

389
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,740
Wow.

390
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,500
I invite them here.
No one objects, right?

391
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,500
I do!

392
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,420
I do think that I can't
stop hanging out with him.

393
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,460
You're so annoying.

394
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,900
I have a game for you.

395
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,340
You have a lot of games, huh?

396
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,500
Of course, I'm the queen of games.

397
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,340
This game is called Never Have I Ever.

398
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,060
Have you ever played?

399
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,780
- Never.
- Nope.

400
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,220
- No.
- How to play?

401
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,340
The rule is simple.

402
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,140
Someone says something that
they never have done.

403
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,020
Anyone in this group
who has ever done that

404
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,140
must drink from your glass.

405
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,980
- Got it?
- I see.

406
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,780
Got it?

407
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,060
I'll start.

408
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,660
Ever have I never...

409
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,980
Have a feeling for a junior.

410
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,460
Drink. You have.

411
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Yes, it was Toh. I remember.

412
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,700
Darn! It burns my throat.

413
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,220
Ever have I never...

414
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,100
- I have no idea. Help me.
- Eh?

415
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,060
You have just one drink,
not even a drink actually.

416
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,060
Well.

417
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,380
Ever have I never...

418
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,030
Have a feeling
for someone in my faculty.

419
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,900
Nuea!

420
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,020
You're focusing on me?

421
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,020
No, I'm not.

422
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,380
- Mark?
- Hey!

423
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,780
He drinks too.

424
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,180
Listen!

425
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,940
I think it's late.

426
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,100
I take the last question.

427
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,020
- Okay? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

428
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,020
Okay, shoot.

429
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:09,020
Ever have I never...

430
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,780
known that Nuea is with Mark.

431
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,100
- Huh?
- What?

432
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,420
Are you crazy?

433
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,140
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Oh, really?

434
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,740
I didn't know.

435
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,300
But if you ask me that I want that,

436
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,180
I'd love that.

437
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,620
No, you can't.

438
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,620
It's too easy.

439
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,440
He's my frat little brother
so I'm gonna set a challenge for you.

440
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,700
Tell me you like Mark because of what?

441
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,500
- Oh, yes.
- What is it?

442
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,460
Cute.

443
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,380
Hey! I think it's enough.

444
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,380
Mark is uncomfortable.

445
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,660
Darn you!

446
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,460
He is not.

447
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,820
He also wants to know, right?

448
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,060
- Yes.
- I can tell.

449
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,740
I also want to know.

450
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,700
I noticed you
since you made a move on Bar.

451
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,940
I thought this kid is daring.

452
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,740
Even if you got rejected,
you'd never backed down.

453
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,260
But when you knew
that he was with someone,

454
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,580
you stepped down because you
didn't want him to be uncomfortable.

455
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,500
Even though your heart was...

456
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,020
hurting like hell.

457
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,180
Someone who values love this much,

458
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,060
I like that.

459
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,420
Oh! I'm sorry.

460
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,820
I'll go get a new glass.

461
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,970
Are you drunk already?

462
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:55,820
Stop drinking?

463
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,820
You guys clean up now.

464
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,220
This wooden table will get swollen.

465
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,340
Are you okay?

466
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,500
I'm okay.

467
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,860
Vee.

468
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,500
Don't treat me as if I'm immature!

469
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,340
Sorry.

470
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,020
That I can't outplay Nuea.

471
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,720
Hey.

472
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,220
You said there wouldn't be hazing.

473
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,220
So why are you yelling at a junior?

474
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,700
That kid is so clueless.

475
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,020
You wouldn't stand him.

476
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,620
And he can stand you?

477
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,060
That you still haven't told people.

478
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,900
Hey!

479
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,940
You knew,

480
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,940
about me and Mark?

481
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,020
I'm your best friend.

482
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,020
And me being like this,

483
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
does it mean that I don't
have a right to be jealous?

484
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,100
You can be jealous
even if you're not dating.

485
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,540
But you need to trust each other.

486
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,860
You took out your anger on him.

487
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,660
It was like you were pushing him away.

488
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,220
Even he was the one who came to you.

489
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,140
Darn me!

490
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,380
I was so immature.

491
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,880
Yes, you were.

492
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,820
Eh? Where are you going?

493
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,060
Win him back.

494
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,720
Kla! Open the door.

495
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,540
I can't even.

496
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,780
So sleepy.

497
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,300
Oh, Nuea.

498
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,900
Hey!

499
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,940
I can't...

500
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,020
Hey, wait!

501
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,420
Nuea, it's...

502
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,420
I think you got the wrong room.

503
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,140
Your room is next door.

504
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,660
I can't. I need to sleep now.
Let's talk tomorrow.

505
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,540
Hold on! Don't take off your shirt.

506
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,380
Hey! Oh, man!

507
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,700
What the heck?

508
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
What the heck are you doing?

509
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,860
It's not what you think.

510
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,940
- I was in the shower...
- Do you take me for a fool?

511
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,100
You can't get enough
by leaning on his shoulder?

512
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
Now you dragged him onto your room?

513
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,300
Hey...

514
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,020
Be civil.

515
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,980
Or am I wrong?

516
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,860
You're having a rich handsome man
pamper you.

517
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,860
You lay down for him at once.

518
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,860
How many times have you done it?

519
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,860
None has left for me, I guess.

520
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,100
You think I am that easy?

521
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,340
You think I easily sleep with everybody?

522
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,500
Yes! You were easy for me.

523
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,820
Darn you!
