00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,420
What the frick?

11
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,060
Leave us, I have something
to talk to him about.

12
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,020
No.

13
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,460
Why the heck
didn't you answer your phone?

14
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,070
Leave us!

15
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,100
Don't you realize
how many people are worried about you?

16
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,700
Worry about me?

17
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,140
It's not your darn business.

18
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,070
Should you be glad to see me like this?

19
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,180
In case you don't know,

20
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,660
at the White Bridge,

21
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,340
I didn't wish Bar to break your heart.

22
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,140
I wished...

23
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,140
that you'll be happy
with someone who loves you.

24
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,700
I even don't know why I wished that.

25
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,150
Oh, you're such a hero.

26
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,140
You want me to be happy?

27
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,140
I would be a fool to believe that.

28
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,140
Why do you think I don't know?

29
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,620
You just don't want me to jump
and make your friend feel guilty.

30
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,340
You didn't really worry about me!

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,740
You're just...

32
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
Why?

33
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,340
I have gone further with you.

34
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,340
♪Who'd have thought that your touch♪

35
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,340
♪Who'd have thought that your embrace♪

36
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,340
♪It would turn out to be just a dream♪

37
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,250
♪A blind like me♪

38
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,580
What's freaking wrong with you?

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,300
♪A long-time hurtful person like me♪

40
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,620
I hate you.

41
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,530
In case you don't know,

42
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,430
at the White Bridge,

43
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,530
I didn't wish Bar to break your heart.

44
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,530
I wished

45
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,520
that you'll be happy with someone
who loves you.

46
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,350
Wait, please.

47
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,350
Oh!

48
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,540
Mark.

49
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,970
Where have you been last night?

50
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,590
Your friends panicked.

51
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,160
Well, I was around here
but my phone was dead.

52
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,950
Oh, boy.

53
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,790
You have something on your shirt.

54
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,750
I thought I checked thoroughly.

55
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,770
Just a piece of thread, forget about it.

56
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,670
No, I can't.

57
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,130
People will think
I can't take care of you.

58
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,110
Mark.

59
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,580
Huh?

60
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,760
Is there something wrong?

61
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,180
No, nothing.

62
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,750
Last night I was with my friend
from another faculty.

63
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,470
- I'm okay now.
- A friend from another faculty?

64
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,830
You've never told us about him.

65
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,510
- It's good that you're okay.
- Now you guys should worry about me.

66
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,430
My wisdom teeth hurt
so bad that I can't move my face.

67
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,500
- Which side is it?
- This side.

68
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,070
Ow!

69
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,490
You villain, you just hit him
right where it hurts.

70
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,300
It hurts.

71
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,070
Here me out, Fuse.

72
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,190
I'll take you to a dental clinic
right across from the University.

73
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,220
Their dentists are so hot.

74
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,370
- Really?
- Really.

75
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,830
Dang! Even dentists?

76
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,350
You suddenly look so fresh.

77
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,870
- Of course, it's me.
- Yeah.

78
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,990
So you can't eat anything?

79
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,710
- Yeah.
- I just chew with my other side teeth.

80
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,030
- Oh, I see. Poor you.
- Mmm.

81
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,350
I can't eat anymore.

82
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,630
I'll wait in the classroom.

83
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,150
What? You've eaten a few.

84
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,550
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

85
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,220
What's wrong with him?

86
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,140
Forget about it.

87
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,420
- Ha! Got him!
- What?

88
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,510
I can eat leftovers.

89
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,060
Hey, I'll return these books.

90
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,410
Sure.

91
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,100
You...

92
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,420
Come for the wrong guy?

93
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,420
It's his birthday gift.

94
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,420
Can you give it to him?

95
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,120
Why do you give it to me?

96
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,210
Because you and he are boyfriends now.

97
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,590
I'm not gonna meddle
between you two anymore.

98
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,690
Really, Mark?

99
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,110
You moved on so easily.

100
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,770
Not yet.

101
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,090
But I'll try.

102
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,730
Here I come.

103
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,570
What's with the doll?

104
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,610
The last gift from...

105
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,610
Your number one fan.

106
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,300
What's with the doll?

107
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,050
My birthday gift.

108
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,010
Wow.

109
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,310
I just have a sudden urge to boo you.

110
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,210
Ready?

111
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,270
- Hit it.
- Booooo!

112
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,960
What's wrong with you?

113
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,200
Stop fooling around.

114
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
- I'm sorry.
- Served you right.

115
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,200
By the way, that such a cute gift
is from your junior doctor?

116
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,720
- Wow.
- Not from Kan.

117
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,880
- Eh?
- What?

118
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
- From who then?
- From who?

119
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,160
Well, you just got body and soul
of your junior doctor yesterday.

120
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
Is it enough for you. Bar?

121
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,760
Vee?

122
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,930
What's wrong with him?

123
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,320
What?

124
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,370
You lied to me.

125
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,240
What are you talking about?

126
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm hurt.

127
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,280
You said you stop bothering my friend.

128
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,000
So what the heck is that doll?

129
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,000
You're hurting me!

130
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,880
I give it to Kan to pass along to Bar.

131
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,880
I also told him that I'll stop meddling.

132
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
I just...

133
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Worried.

134
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,880
That you'll get hurt again.

135
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,440
Is this what people do when they worry?

136
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,270
You yelled at me once you were here.

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,100
Not even say word "sorry".

138
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,200
Sorry!

139
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,600
What are you saying?

140
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,560
You heard me.

141
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
Not so sure.

142
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,870
Sorry.

143
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,520
Sorry.

144
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,800
I don't hear you loud and clear.

145
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,240
Ouch!

146
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,400
I am sorry.

147
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,960
Are you happy?

148
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,560
You've got your answer.

149
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,680
Now I can have mine?

150
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,160
What is it?

151
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,320
About last night...

152
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,080
Never mind.

153
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,150
You're back?

154
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,150
Why are you home so early?

155
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,750
I'm hungry, let's find something to eat.

156
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,230
But I get bored going
to the restaurant nearby.

157
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,230
Where else can we go?

158
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,410
Vee.

159
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,470
Vee!

160
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,110
Are you listening?

161
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,110
Yes, I am.

162
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,870
No, you're not.

163
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,870
What's going on?

164
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,390
Nothing, babe.

165
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,930
I'm just tired.

166
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,030
You said you're hungry, Ploy?

167
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,390
Well, let's go find something to eat.

168
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,110
I just need to clear the desk.

169
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,430
Sure, babe.

170
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,780
Thank you. I got that for you.

171
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,470
Where do you want to sit, babe?

172
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,470
Where?

173
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,470
Where?

174
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,470
Oh, it's Mark.

175
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,500
Mark.

176
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,860
Are you with someone?

177
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,910
Nope.

178
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,150
We can sit somewhere else.

179
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,950
We'll make him uncomfortable.

180
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,350
It's okay.

181
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,670
You can sit with me.

182
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,790
See? He's so nice, unlike you.

183
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,790
- Thanks.
- Sure, babe.

184
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:03,790
Thanks.

185
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,030
Why are you eating alone?

186
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,270
What about your loved one?

187
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,100
I'm looking for one.

188
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,100
Really?

189
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,550
It mustn't be that hard
looking like you.

190
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,150
Let me find you someone.

191
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,310
You're a hot type in my faculty, Mark.

192
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,800
May I take a photo of you?

193
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,470
One, two, three.

194
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,190
Is that your new phone?

195
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,670
When did you buy it?

196
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,150
Oh, yeah.

197
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,350
My old one is not running well.

198
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,510
Haven't I told you about that, Vee?

199
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,790
Mmm.

200
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,510
I must forget.

201
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,150
Ah!

202
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,150
I just realize

203
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,870
that I expected Namwahn
to pick things up at my dorm.

204
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,390
- Uh-huh.
- She's in front of my dorm now.

205
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,950
Can I go back to my dorm
and leave you here?

206
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,430
Sure.

207
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,430
You don't want to eat?
I can bag that up for you.

208
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,710
No need. You can eat mine,
share it between you two.

209
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,010
I'm off.

210
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,030
Eh?

211
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,030
- Enjoy your food.
- Not hungry anymore?

212
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,710
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,470
What for?

214
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,430
Well...

215
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,630
I...

216
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,870
Hey!

217
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,070
Stop acting like I'm your secret lover.

218
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,950
We are nothing.

219
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,950
Right?

220
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,950
Right.

221
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,750
We are nothing.

222
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,950
We just did that thing.

223
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,750
We both were drunk that night.

224
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,710
I'm sober today.

225
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,810
And you should be sober too.

226
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,080
Are you listening to your friends?

227
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,330
What was that for?

228
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,420
We were saying that lately,
Mark stop coming to see Bar.

229
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:43,110
Don't you see him publicly announce his
relationship with his doctor boyfriend?

230
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,870
Who would want to flirt with him now?

231
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,350
Last time I saw Mark, you guys,

232
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,390
he looked so bummed,
bum bum da da da dum.

233
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,710
Thanks.

234
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,910
Poor him.

235
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,870
I should heal his broken heart.

236
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,960
I should buy him
some heart-shaped snacks.

237
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,950
I'm interested.

238
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,460
Are you for real?

239
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,430
Is he your type, Nuea?

240
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,830
Sugar daddy?

241
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,390
What's wrong? He's kinda cute.

242
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,390
No, you can't.

243
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,150
Nuea, you belong with me.

244
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,110
Nuea and Lee. Nuea and Lee.

245
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,830
- Nuea and Lee.
- Oh, you want that?

246
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,600
Here, I show you "Nuea and Lee".

247
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,720
Ow! Did you pluck my hair?

248
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,670
Guys!

249
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,670
Let's have some drink tonight.

250
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,540
I'll ask Pond and Kla.

251
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,550
What happened, Vee?

252
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,830
You said lately
that you need to be home early.

253
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,590
Tsk! Just go when I ask you.

254
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,470
When my lovely friend asked me,

255
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,470
So...

256
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,430
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

257
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,670
Let's drink.

258
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,870
We drink almost every day.

259
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,340
It's too strong.

260
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,190
Vee.

261
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,190
Is there something wrong with you?

262
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,110
Fight with Ploy?

263
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,910
No, there's nothing.

264
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,110
Your eyebrows are knotted.

265
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,540
I don't believe you.

266
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,750
Hey, is it Mark?

267
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,750
Huh?

268
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,350
Yeah, it's Mark with his friends.

269
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,710
Over there.

270
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,990
- Really?
- Yes.

271
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,510
Hey, Yeewah.

272
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,510
Ask your fraternity little brother
to join us.

273
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,510
- Yeah.
- Mark.

274
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:20,910
Oh.

275
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,590
- Come here.
- It's Yeewah.

276
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,670
Sit with us.

277
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,190
- Next table is empty.
- Sit there.

278
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,930
Mark, come here, you sit next to me.

279
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,930
Good evening.

280
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,230
No, thanks, we don't want to bother you.

281
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,910
It's rude to reject
upperclassmen's invitation.

282
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,470
- Come here, quickly.
- These seats are empty.

283
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,670
- Our treat.
- Sit here.

284
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,630
You can even sit on top of my head.

285
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,950
- Really?
- Guys.

286
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,510
- Let's cheer, guys.
- Come on.

287
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,870
Raise your glasses.

288
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,670
Cheers!

289
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,600
- And drink it.
- Yeah, right.

290
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,110
I'm so happy.

291
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,230
That everybody's here tonight.

292
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,630
- Want some more snacks?
- Yeah.

293
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,670
Hey.

294
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,190
I have a fun game for us.

295
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,190
- What is it?
- I've carried it with me.

296
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,810
Here.

297
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,950
Have you ever played King's Game?

298
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,710
- Yeah.
- I know.

299
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,590
Ring a bell.

300
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,350
Okay, so take one card each.

301
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,540
Who got the king card?

302
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,900
Me.

303
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,670
You can order whoever to do whatever.

304
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,530
Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

305
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,790
That's what I'm talking about.

306
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,510
- Great!
- He's cool!

307
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,030
- Can I quit? I don't want to play anymore.
- Here you go.

308
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,990
Wow! I got a good card.

309
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,070
One, two, three,

310
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,270
open!

311
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,630
I got to be king this round.

312
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,690
You always ask
for something creepy, Yeewah.

313
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,380
Yeah.

314
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,550
What? I've never done
something like that.

315
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,510
I will order the number ten.

316
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,300
Who got number ten?

317
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,300
- Not me.
- Let me check. Who is it?

318
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,900
Me.

319
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,940
- Whoa.
- My little brother.

320
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,180
Great!

321
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,660
Well,

322
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,820
- I will order...
- Bottoms up.

323
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,860
- Number ten,
- Bottoms up.

324
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,100
to look into the eyes of...

325
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,550
Number eight!

326
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,020
Wow!

327
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,590
Darn you!

328
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,580
- I am number three!
- I got it wrong?

329
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,020
Who is number eight?

330
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,050
- Who is it?
- Number eight?

331
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,620
Me.

332
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,030
Vee is number eight.

333
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,390
- See?
- Okay.

334
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,860
You carry the pride
of third-year Engineering student.

335
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,020
- Yeah.
- Right.

336
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,300
It's just staring contest.

337
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,380
The loser needs to finish one drink.

338
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,430
One, two, three.

339
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,940
I hate you.

340
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,680
We both were drunk that night.

341
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,880
I'm sober today.

342
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,880
And you should be sober too.

343
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,680
Vee just lost.

344
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,960
He lost to a kid.

345
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,320
My brother is awesome.

346
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
- Great!
- You're so lame.

347
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
Drink!

348
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,000
- Right.
- The loser needs to drink.

349
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,600
Come on, dude.

350
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,240
Wow!

351
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,200
- Great!
- My friend is the best.

352
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,000
Here's your medal.

353
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,160
- You're the best
- Awesome, dude.

354
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,960
So you, Kampahn, and...

355
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,640
- I'm Fuse.
- And Fuse.

356
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,480
- You carpool with me.
- Okay.

357
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,720
- Yes.
- And I'm gonna drop Lee off.

358
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,080
- Okay.
- See you.

359
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,840
- See you.
- Mark.

360
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,400
Don't forget our fraternity meeting.

361
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,960
- Sure.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

362
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
- See you.
- See you.

363
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,440
Be careful.

364
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,240
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

365
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,040
How are you getting home, Mark?

366
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,280
Want a ride?

367
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,960
He stays in the same dorm as mine,
I can give him a ride.

368
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,600
Whoa! You ride so fast.

369
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,880
Come with me, more comfortable.

370
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,800
Okay?

371
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,440
Well, I come with you, Nuea.

372
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,320
That's what I'm talking about.

373
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,740
- Let's go.
- Yes.

374
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,900
Ride carefully, dude.

375
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,540
Let's go over there.
