Good morning.

7
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,230
No.

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,140
It's ten already?

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,790
Isn't our ride going at eight?

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,160
Hey.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,520
Calm down. I already told Yeehaw
that you're sick. I'll take you back.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,110
Oh. That's a relief.

13
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,110
And how do you feel?

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,440
About that.

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,350
A little dizzy but getting better.

16
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,870
So I'm gonna take a shower first.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,320
I don't want to be
late for checking out.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,120
There is no rush.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,350
I already extended
time for one more night.

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,180
So we can have more
time for our honeymoon.

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,850
Honeymoon.

22
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,780
It's for people who are married,
isn't it?

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,120
It's a practice.

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,360
If you're married to me.

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,910
You get breakfast for free.

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,190
Do you think using food as a bait

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,590
will make me fall for you?

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,830
How about this?
You got one butler for free.

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,370
Here.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Say ah.

31
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,020
What is it?

32
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,790
(Hello, Vee.)

33
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,100
(How is my underclassman?)

34
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,840
Your student code underclassman?

35
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,470
He's not good. He's sick.

36
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,100
He may need to rest a little more.

37
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,130
Does that mean he's not doing so well?

38
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,850
Or you want to keep him for yourself?

39
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,400
Hey.

40
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,980
What kind of person do you think I am?

41
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,780
If you don't believe me.
Talk with him then.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,210
Here.

43
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,240
Yes. Hello Yeewha.

44
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,940
Hello Mark.

45
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,290
Are you really sick?

46
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,430
Yes, I am. I am sick.

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,160
(How do you feel?)

48
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,780
I feel

49
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,910
a little bit heavy...

50
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,460
(and)

51
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,060
I have a one-side headache.

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,010
And...

53
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,170
Mark.

54
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,000
Your headache is really that bad.

55
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,350
I won't disturb you anymore.
Take a long rest.

56
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,690
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,910
(But let me give you a warning.)

58
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,960
Vee is not that good of a person.
Don't trust him.

59
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,510
(And don't be soft-hearted with him.)

60
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,070
Right now he's thinking about
how to make you fall for him.

61
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,650
Okay.

62
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,300
I'll be careful.

63
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,310
Excellent.

64
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,340
This is my guess.

65
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,340
(Right now he's
preparing breakfast for you.)

66
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,290
(Don't eat that.)

67
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,720
(He probably put some
sleeping pills in there.)

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,950

69
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,100

Hate that I'm not
angry with you anymore.

Stop asking already.

168
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,820
I like it when you blush.

169
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,820
I like it when you look at me like this.

170
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,860
I like the expression in your eyes.

171
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,360
That tells me deep down you love me.

172
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,100
And. What do you dislike about me?

173
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,360
It's you that I'm not like.

174
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,580
But love.

175
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,710
What the heck are you saying?

176
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,370
I won't allow you to
say something like that again.

177
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,870
Or I'll get used to it.

178
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,900
When I return to the university.

179
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,550
You wouldn't be this lovely
toward me anymore, would you?

180
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,220
What are you doing?

181
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,010
Being lovely with you.

182
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,710
Enough.
Everyone in the university will know.

183
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,780
(Create post)

184
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,270
Doing something like this,
aren't you afraid others will know?

185
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,510
I'm more afraid of losing you.

186
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,410
I won't keep it a secret anymore.

187
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,500
(Chum Prae Srinagarind Hospital
Airport Khon Kaen University)

188
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,830
What should we eat?

189
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,930
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

190
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,710
I'm not sure but thinking
about two to three things.

191
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,200
Look like someone is lying.

192
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,210
Not just normal lies but...

193
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,260
Whatever.

194
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,240
Always killing moods, eh?

195
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,960
What are you all doing here?

196
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,750
At this time we gotta find
something to eat of course.

197
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,550
What about you? Are
you going to eat something?

198
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,250
- Maybe he's already full.
- Does it taste good?

199
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,600
Sitting together and hold
each other's hands like that.

200
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,180
Don't be so sure about that.

201
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,930
The picture that Vee posted might be

202
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,360
someone else's hand, not Mark's.

203
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,530
A small hand like that
could even be my hand.

204
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,860
It's definitely not yours.
Yours looks like a front leg of an animal.

205
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,680
- Don't bully me.
- If you don't believe me, look at Mark's hand.

206
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,440
Let me see your hand.

207
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,580
He avoids me.

208
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,600
He hides them.

209
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:25,610
What about it?

210
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,840
My hand and Mark's hand.

211
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,310
Is it strange that someone
who loves each other to hold hands?

212
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,190
It is.

213
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,870
Wait.

214
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,680
Why don't you tell me?

215
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,320
You bastard let me find out
at the same time as others.

216
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,490
You.

217
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,040
It's okay.

218
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,080
How dare you did that to Vee.

219
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,770
Well, It's a long story, friend.

220
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,720
I will tell you about it
when I have time, the others too.

221
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,370
All right.

222
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,800
But for today, I want to go
to my room and rest. I'm sleepy.

223
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,730
Acting 300.

224
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,440
That's smooth.

225
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,480
What's smooth?

226
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,430
Go back to sleep in your own home.

227
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,910
But I'm here and?

228
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,970
Mark!

229
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,570
Look at how cutely he ran away.

230
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,150
He tricked me to take him back here.

231
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,190
Where do you guys planning
to go have a meal again?

232
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,670
That's what you get.

233
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,680
Hey, you. Give me a minute.

234
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,140
What are you going to do with Ploy?

235
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,610
I

236
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,470
still haven't got a serious talk
with her.

237
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,000
When are you going to do it?

238
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,620
I let you have a
relationship with Mark.

239
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,080
But I won't let you have a
relationship with both of them.

240
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,940
Yeah, I already know.

241
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,770
Good.

242
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,520
Delivery!

243
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,110
What?

244
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,140
My clothes.

245
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,430
Because the honeymoon is over.

246
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,760
Time for me to
move in and live together.

247
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,040
Aren't you at the
wrong place? This is my room.

248
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,490
Your place may be right there.

249
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,370
That means when
I end things with Ploy.

250
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,760
You'll let me move in right?

251
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,550
Then you're correct.

252
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,680
Because today

253
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,840
I will end my relationship with her.

254
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,650
Really?

255
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,400
Do you think I'm lying?

256
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,560
Don't you see those bags in my hands?

257
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,620
This is fine.

258
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,470
I call dips on the left side.

259
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,660
Hey, who gave you permission?

260
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Don't sweat it.

261
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,460
Here, here. Right here.

262
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,010
I think we should put
our lovely photos there.

263
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,620
What do you think?

264
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,980
Do we have any photos like that?

265
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,260
I think this is too wide.

266
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,940
We should put some big pillows here.

267
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,740
When someday I'm bored on the bed.

268
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,740
We can move to do it on the sofa.

269
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:42,750
What do you think?

270
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,110
That's enough.

271
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,960
Go make things right with her first.
Then we can talk about this.

272
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,270
I know.

273
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,020
I'll meet her at one in the afternoon.

274
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:55,870
And...

275
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,060
Where did you plan to meet her?

276
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,170
In the room?

277
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,300
No.

278
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,720
She already moved out a while.

279
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,970
I planned to meet her at
coffee shop near the university.

280
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,460
Do you want to come with me?

281
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,300
No. That's all right. I'll wait here.

282
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,440
In case you change your mind.

283
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,000
I promise you

284
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,470
that this time I won't
make you wait too long.

285
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,700
Hmm.

286
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,570
I stay up late recently.

287
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,180
So my eyes are kinda darker.

288
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,570
Are you all right, Ploy?

289
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,400
I'm okay of course.

290
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,810
What do you want to talk about?

291
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,060
Is Tew also all right as well?

292
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,050
That's for sure.

293
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,950
I saw it on Facebook.

294
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:14,700
Is that your special someone?

295
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,320
Well,

296
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:19,920
not yet.

297
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,700
Not until we end things first.

298
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,490
About what we should do from now.

299
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,450
You should go, Vee.

300
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,030
Actually,
I should let go of you already.

301
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,540
Ploy.

302
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,440
I am sorry, Vee.

303
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,660
For everything.

304
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,620
I wish that you are very happy.

305
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,560
You must be happy yourself, Ploy.

306
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,210
Get a lot of sleep and
eat a lot of good food.

307
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,440
Actually when we are apart,

308
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,960
I meet with Ton for some time.

309
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,080
Really?

310
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,780
Why do you never post
about it on Facebook?

311
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,020
I'll definitely give you a like.

312
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:40,910
Hmm.

313
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,230
I'll try to do that.

314
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,680
I'll give you a lot of likes.

315
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,000
Well, I should go.
There is someone waiting for me.

316
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,390
OK.

317
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,920
Good luck.

318
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,050
Good luck to you, too, Ploy.

319
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,950
Yes, Ton.

320
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,840
(Where are you right now, Ploy?)

321
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm at a coffee shop with a friend.

322
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,220
(Is that friend of your name Vee?)

323
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,470
A friend is a friend.

324
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,380
Ton, can you calm down a little bit?

325
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,320
(A coffee shop
behind the university, right?)

326
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,410
(Tell him to wait there.
I'm coming for him.)

327
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,760
- (I really want to know.)
- Bye

328
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,950
What's happened, Ploy?

329
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,090
Vee, you should go back.

330
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,980
Ton will come to pick me up soon.

331
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,640
He did this, didn't he?

332
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,300
Vee, please go back.

333
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,260
He did, right?

334
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,370
He's just having a bad temper.

335
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,700
He can't control himself
when he's drunk.

336
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,200
Vee, I'm okay.

337
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,660
Please just go, Vee.

338
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,580
Please, Vee. I beg you.

339
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,170
Vee.

340
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,180
Where? Where is he?

341
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,500
Please, I beg you.

342
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,560
Please don't fight.

343
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,770
Here he is.

344
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,560
This friend of yours seems similar.

345
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,080
He looks like your ex-boyfriend.

346
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,550
Even you are her new boyfriend.

347
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,650
You don't have any
right to do this to her.

348
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,550
It's as it used to be.

349
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,050
How about this?

350
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,160
You and I share her.

351
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,660
Like before.

352
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,040
You asshole.

353
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,140
Vee.

354
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,240
Enough. That's enough.

355
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,680
You're killing him.

356
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,570
Hey, you guys, stop.

357
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,640
Vee.

358
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,450
Ton.

359
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,910
I'm sorry.

360
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,410
Stop doing something like this to Vee.

361
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,230
Then you come here.

362
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,090
Vee.

363
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,450
Stop caring for him.

364
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,690
Ow.

365
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,100
Get in.

366
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,350
What the heck are you
recording for? Stop it.

367
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,420
Vee.

368
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,400
What happened, Vee?
Are you all right?

369
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,660
Vee.

370
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Ow.

371
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,680
Oh no, Vee. Why don't
you tell me about this?

372
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,080
It's fine. There is no time anyway.

373
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,090
How are you?

374
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,780
I'm okay. I'm just waiting for
my meds and I'm good.

375
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,140
So, What the heck happened actually?

376
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,610
For real it's a
long story but waiting

377
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,570
for everyone and I will tell you.

378
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,990
Okay, that's fine.

379
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,640
We'll have to leave first.
We have an appointment with the teacher.

380
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,290
See you later. Get well soon.

381
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,000
Get well soon friend.

382
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,290
You.

383
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,130
You. You hit too hard, you asshole.

384
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,780
Where do you want to eat?

385
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,940
Did you do something to someone?

386
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,390
Is there a vengeful spirit
riding on your back right now?

387
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,840
I don't think so.

388
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,310
Hey Mark.

389
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,500
Mark. Where is Vee?

390
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,300
Vee went to meet
Ploy since afternoon.

391
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,080
He's not coming back yet.

392
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,710
I don't have the courage to call him.

393
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,910
That's okay. I'll give him a call.

394
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,770
Yeah. You do it.

395
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,570
(The number is not available.)

396
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,880
He's not answering.
Maybe his phone died.

397
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,790
I'll call other friends.

398
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,330
And ask if they see Vee?

399
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,580
Mark. There is nothing to worry about.

400
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,500
Vee gave us his word

401
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,220
that he will clear up
everything appropriately.

402
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,600
Right now maybe he is

403
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,240
looking for something tasty

404
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,670
to celebrate with you.

405
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,590
What!?

406
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,920
Understood.

407
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,060
OK.

408
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,270
What's happened?

409
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,210
The friend of Pond said

410
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,190
Vee got jumped by Ploy's boyfriend.

411
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,250
And he just separated from him just now.

412
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,400
That asshole Ton.
Let's go meet with Vee.

413
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,070
Let's go, Mark.

414
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,990
Guys, I just said I'm all right.

415
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,420
Whoa! Ploy. What
about that asshole Ton?

416
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,660
I've

417
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,080
broken up with him.

418
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,680
Actually, I am

419
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,210
thinking about this for a while.

420
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,770
But I trick myself to believe that

421
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,060
what he did was because of love.

422
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,100
But today Vee shows me that

423
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,370
someone who's in love
will never hurt each other.

424
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,150
Thank you, Vee.

425
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,640
Even on our last day together.

426
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,310
I still got you into trouble.

427
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,350
That's okay, Ploy.

428
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:46,460
