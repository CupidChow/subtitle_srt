00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,760
Hello.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,560
What's this about?

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,800
I'm busy right now.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,510
Ow.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,730
Congratulations.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,890
You got my love-winning promotions.

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,690
From now on, I'll continue to make
up with you until you love me.

13
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,220
The first promotion is

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,080
come to pick you up and get you
to the university every day.

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,820
You don't have to.

16
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,790
I can get there by myself.

17
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:38,850
Are you sure?

18
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,710
You carry a lot of stuff.

19
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,080
Can you carry them all?

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,150
On a promotion like this,

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,520
who would come to pick you up
on a motorcycle?

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,320
Welcome, young master.

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,680
In what age was this car made?

24
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:22,670
Hey.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,040
Just get in.

26
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,880
Even though it's old,

27
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,280
it still made you get in.

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,340
It's just that today is
the swimming tryout day.

29
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,470
I'm in a hurry. If not,
I wouldn't even get in.

30
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,810
Oh.

31
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,340
It's old but gold.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,540
Let's go, my baby.

33
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,680
Give young master a refreshing cool air.

34
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,000
It's so cold.

35
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,320
Come on.

36
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,420
I'm trying to turn on the air conditioner
and make up with him.

37
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,810
Come to think of it,
today's weather is pretty refreshing.

38
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,480
Which is nice for this.

39
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,260
I happened to prepare you breakfast.

40
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,690
A very delicious
Fried Pork with Sticky Rice.

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,590
Here.

42
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,310
It's missing a Fried Pork.

43
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,590
Maybe you opened it
from the wrong side?

44
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,880
It doesn't look good to me.

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,590
Hey.

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,450
It couldn't be.

47
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,750
There is no way.

48
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,870
Someone could lose his
face three times in a row.

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,460
Don't do this to me.

50
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,570
Is the battery empty?

51
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,710
Ton. Ton.

52
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,680
What's wrong with your car?

53
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,210
Hmm.

54
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,180
What "Ton"?

55
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,690
I'm stressing here.

56
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,980
You come at the right time.

57
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,530
Can you take me to the university?

58
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,310
Sure.

59
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,950
Hey, Mark. Hold on.

60
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,510
But...

61
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,300
Your promotion is not that good.

62
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,410
I'm changing company.

63
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,120
Hey.

64
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,090
Are you really doing this?

65
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,980
Please get in.

66
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,130
Mark.

67
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,710
Hey.

68
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,730

82
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,190
Let me keep that for you, young master.

83
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,240
Hah.

84
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,210
Let me apply sunblock for you.

85
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,570
What's it with you?

86
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,790
It's-

87
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,430
He keeps staring and I don't like that.

88
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,020
Wear it like this and
go in the pool, trust me.

89
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,290
Vee.

90
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,240
Isn't that a bit too much?

91
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,360
It's because this swimming suit is
too revealing.

92
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,170
Why does Kan let you dress like that?

93
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,560
It's normal.

94
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,520
Or it's because...

95
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,020
Kan never did anything bad.

96
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,950
And I have nothing to be
paranoid about, unlike you.

97
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,630
That's unrelated.

98
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,420
Bad or not, I won't allow

99
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,870
my boyfriend to dress like that,

100
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,480
and play around in the pool.

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,900
Luckily,

102
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,120
I am

103
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,580
not your boyfriend.

104
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,870
Yeah, you better wish you aren't.

105
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,250
If you are, I will tie you up
and keep you in the room.

106
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,820
And I'll let no one sees you.
I'm the only one who can see you.

107
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,420
Darn it. You're delusional.

108
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,550
Let's go, Mark.

109
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,510
We should get ready
at the starting block.

110
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,370
Come on.

111
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,930
When you are competing,

112
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,810
I will have some hot promotions for you.

113
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,500
Surprise?

114
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,580
Very much.

115
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,580
Give it your best shot.

116
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,160
Wear this.

117
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,840
Very surprised.

118
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,800
I thought

119
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,380
you would treat us to some alcohol.

120
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,500
Instead,

121
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,920
you drag me to help you impress him.

122
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,340
Just hurry up, Mark is about to compete.

123
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:35,950
Darn it.

124
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,650
Here you are.

125
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,670
Where have you been?
Mark is about to compete.

126
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,390
Really?

127
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,300
Yes.

128
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,840
I don't care about this anymore.

129
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,370
Hey.

130
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,410
Vee.

131
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,490
Hurry up.

132
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,920
Follow him.

133
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,510
Come on.

134
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,010
Hey. Mark, come on.

135
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,510
Mark.

136
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,620
Come on, Mark. Give it your all, Mark.

137
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,090
That's right, he's my boyfriend.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,740
Congratulations.

139
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,060
You got in to the final.

140
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,420
I thought you left.

141
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,570
About that, I...

142
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,700
brought friends and
stuff to cheer you on.

143
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,510
It's a surprise.

144
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,550
But I forgot the time.

145
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,930
While swimming,

146
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,230
nobody can hear a sound.

147
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,260
I'll take a bath.

148
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,340
Then I'll help scrub your back.

149
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:29,930
How about it?

150
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,800
No need.

151
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,480
How is it going, champ?

152
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,890
You're good.

153
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,330
You deserve it.

154
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,640
You are a real deal.

155
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,380
Hey, Joke.

156
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,440
Joke.

157
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,240
Can I borrow some shampoo?

158
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,870
Hey.

159
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,630
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,920
I thought you are my friend.

161
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,170
This bathroom

162
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,620
has a bad lock.

163
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,680
Why are you using this one?

164
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,170
Next time, use another one.

165
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,900
If you knew about this,

166
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,790
next time, knock first.

167
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,850
Thanks.

168
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,190
Can I get your LINE?

169
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,960
In case when

170
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,290
I'm done using shampoo,
I can return it to you.

171
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,440
You don't have to.

172
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,340
It's almost empty.

173
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,420
I'm about to throw it away.

174
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,030
Hoh.

175
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,290
What took you so long?

176
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,850
Nothing, just...

177
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,540
Someone came into the wrong bathroom.

178
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,700
But it's fine now.

179
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,580
Hey, is that guy a pervert?

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,640
Should I take a look?

181
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,710
You don't have to.

182
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,860
It's nothing, really.

183
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,890
I need to hurry and register my win.

184
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,330
In that case,

185
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,970
I've got a promotion
to go register with you.

186
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:12,760
Let's go.

187
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,380
Wow.

188
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,930
There are so many people here.

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,950
Vee.

190
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,740
My dear best friend.

191
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,290
A tone like that

192
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,630
means I am in trouble, right?

193
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,990
That's right.

194
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,460
The thing is, I am looking
for someone to join

195
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,420
in a sport,

196
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,240
but nobody came.

197
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,670
Join me just for a laugh.

198
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,460
OK, I'll do it.

199
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,850
Basketball, volleyball.

200
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,540
You name it.

201
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,120
Which one?

202
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,980
Boxing.

203
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,480
Are you mad? I'm not doing that.

204
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,290
I don't want myself
to get hurt for nothing.

205
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,330
Find someone else.

206
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,030
I already

207
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,540
spoke with an entire faculty,

208
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,560
and everyone

209
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,870
told me the same thing you said.

210
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,400
Please. Please. Please.

211
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,520
Please, join the boxing.

212
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,080
How about...

213
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,250
No.

214
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,510
It's nothing much, but you can't do it?

215
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,750
There are a lot of people.
Ask someone else.

216
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,450
Just keep looking.

217
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,060
It's really you,
fair-skinned underclassman.

218
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,760
You don't like what I called you?

219
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,260
Then tell me your name
so I can call you properly.

220
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,130
If you don't want to tell me your name,

221
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,580
you can tell me your IG.

222
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,390
What's the problem?

223
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,600
Who's this? Your boyfriend?

224
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,620
And who the heck are you?

225
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,830
What business do you have with Mark?

226
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,090
I just want to ask
where did he buy his shower cream.

227
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,420
So I can get one too,

228
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,920
and have fair skin like Mark's.

229
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,770
It's you.

230
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,210
The pervert who
entered Mark's bathroom.

231
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,200
Calm down.

232
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,810
I can get naked for him
so he can clearly see.

233
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,060
So it's fair.

234
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,910
You pervert,
what the heck are you talking about?

235
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,860
Darn you.

236
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,120
What are you gonna do?

237
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,820
Listen to me.

238
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,680
This guy

239
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,540
is Krating.

240
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,190
The world champion boxer last year.

241
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,350
And he is

242
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,550
the reason why no one joins in boxing.

243
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,040
What about it?

244
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,850
Do you think I am afraid of him?

245
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,010
You're not afraid, but I do.

246
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,350
I don't want any trouble
outside the ring.

247
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,600
Or I would lose my athlete scholarships.

248
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,600
Today

249
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,850
is your lucky day.

250
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,490
Nuea.

251
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,780
Bring me the registration paper.

252
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,410
I will knock him out on a ring.

253
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,240
Pen.

254
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,950
Darn it.

255
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,590
What have I done?

256
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,790
It's because you're always hot-headed.

257
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,290
Vee, I think you should withdraw.

258
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,270
Your opponent is a national athlete.

259
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,510
If you go on a ring with him,
you either die or end up crippled.

260
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,660
Yeah. That's right.

261
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,200
Even if you win in a match,

262
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,730
you'll only get satisfaction.

263
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,980
Mark still

264
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,720
won't become your boyfriend, Vee.

265
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,480
You all can shut up.

266
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,530
He intentionally looked at
our underclassman's naked body.

267
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,280
And he's still going after him.

268
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,420
Think about it.

269
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,710
If we got harassed,

270
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,080
and our lover ignored,

271
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,930
are you really okay with this?

272
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,920
No.

273
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,360
No.

274
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,290
- No.
- No.

275
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,450
No. No. No.

276
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,900
Think about it.

277
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,790
If there is someone risking their life

278
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,930
to protect their lover,

279
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,620
it's very romantic.

280
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,190
Very.

281
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,340
Guys who only think about reasoning
like you all

282
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,480
won't understand.

283
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,350
Think about it.

284
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,670
His opponent is Krating.
[*Krating means bull]

285
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,630
How can a dog like Vee fight him?

286
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,350
Yeah.

287
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,300
Stop that.

288
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,560
I think the harder it is,

289
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,500
- the better it gets.
- True.

290
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,960
Vee, listen to me.

291
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,460
Right now, you're
in a period of proving yourself.

292
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,460
What can be cooler than

293
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,810
a lover who protects,

294
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,860
looks after,

295
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,970
and takes care of his lover

296
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,860
in front of everyone?

297
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,440
Vee.

298
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,190
Why do you have to go this far for me?

299
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,010
Oh.

300
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,500
You saw that.

301
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,660
I just

302
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,340
don't want him to bother you anymore.

303
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,730
I forgive you.

304
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,950
Please let us be like what we were.

305
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,460
I've decided.

306
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,370
I'll win against that buffalo.

307
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,970
I'll do it.

308
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,400
My friend is the best.

309
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,820
That's great.

310
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,160
Are you really going to do it?

311
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,480
How about

312
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,940
two weeks from now,

313
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,770
we'll help you chase your dream?

314
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,330
Do you understand?

315
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,490
Hah.

316
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,240
It doesn't matter that he is Krating.

317
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,470
Hey, you gotta go faster.

318
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,320
This is the fastest I can go.

319
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,580
Faster than this.

320
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,400
How can you win like this?

321
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,330
You go on ahead, and I'll-

322
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,130
How could you win
being weak like this? You are weak.

323
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,210
Vee, don't be a pussy.

324
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,320
- One more set. We'll help, OK?
- Give it your all.

325
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,090
- One.
- Two reps.

326
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,860
Three reps.

327
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,780
Four reps.

328
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,820
Five reps.

329
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,230
- Three more.
- Hey.

330
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,580
It's almost touching me.

331
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,990
Don't do that.

332
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,130
I'm just trying to help a friend.

333
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,680
I think it's not going to work.

334
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,590
Vee, look at these.

335
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,000
These are secret items.

336
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,430
That will strengthen your resolution.

337
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,070
I just called an underclassman
to wait at the finish line.

338
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,220
What did you just say?

339
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,340
Vee, if you win,

340
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,890
I have some rewards for you.

341
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,000
That's it, come on.

342
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,120
Yeah. Yeah.

343
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,220
- Yay!
- Enough. Enough.

344
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,400
Hah.

345
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,500
I didn't say

346
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,730
that underclassman who'll wait for you

347
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,610
is Mark.

348
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,830
What's it with you?

349
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,330
Darn it.

350
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,000
(Faculty of Engineering)

351
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,750
In conclusion,

352
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,930
did you

353
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,350
make up with him yet?

354
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,020
So we can see you being lovey-dovey.

355
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,360
Not yet.

356
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,020
Guys like him

357
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,250
must be punished for a
long time so he remembers.

358
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,560
Who are you talking about?

359
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:35,890
It's about

360
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,110
those who don't realize their mistakes,

361
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,040
and always try to act
like nothing happened.

362
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,760
Well, it's good that it isn't me.

363
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,740
I just want to invite all of you

364
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,970
to watch my final match
with that buffalo.

365
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,140
Whoa.

366
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,000
Did you win your way up to the final?

367
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,960
About that,

368
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,880
other competitors are scared of Krating,

369
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,140
and purposely losing,
so Vee can be in the final.

370
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,040
My work is still not finished yet.

371
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,010
I can't go watch your match.

372
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,680
Then let me help.

373
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,520
I've done this one before.

374
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,830
No need, I can do it myself.

375
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,380
But I want to do it for you.

376
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,970
I'm envious.

377
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,990
I also want my love to come and help me.

378
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,980
Agree.

379
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,590
Just look at Bar.

380
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,970
Kan always helps with reports.

381
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,820
When will I get something like that too?

382
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,470
You can only dream.

383
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,520
You don't need a doctor.

384
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,740
Just one handsome engineer

385
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,610
who can take care of you.

386
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,450
Are you fine with this, Mark?

387
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,800
It's fine, isn't it?

388
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,950
Well, kinda.

389
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,800
Oh.

390
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,320
I'm gonna barf.

391
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,330
It's already come to this,
just go and root for him.

392
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,370
I can't take this anymore.

393
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,920
Let's find something good to eat.

394
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,400
Yeah.

395
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,230
- You're right.
- Let's move.

396
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,310
See you.

397
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,840
You let him help you,

398
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,050
Yeah.

399
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,810
Wait up.

400
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,080
Then let me bring the solder first.

401
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,020
No need to.

402
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,170
If you trip while you walk,

403
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,500
you can't come and root for me.

404
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,850
But where is the solder again?

405
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,750
Around there.

406
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,570
You are this good to me.

407
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,410
Maybe I should go back to your company.

408
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,590
You said it.

409
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:02,990
What are you doing?

410
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,890
It's just

411
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,020
you seem tired, so I think I should
give you some massage.

412
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,110
Then you can massage my foot.

413
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,890
As far as I know,

414
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,970
you are not Mark's boyfriend.

415
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,400
Why do you act like a dog in a rage?

416
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,860
Vee.

417
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,450
How about this, Mark?

418
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,320
I'll go easy on him.

419
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,260
I won't knock him out on the ring.

420
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,280
In exchange,
you come to hang out with me for a day.

421
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,830
You don't need to go easy on me.

422
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,170
Because I will

423
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,230
knock you out on the ring.

424
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,190
You keep your word.

425
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,240
If you can't do what you said,

426
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,890
you have to leave Mark alone.

427
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,950
Fine by me.

428
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,830
Tomorrow,

429
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,390
the one who got knocked out

430
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,900
will have to leave Mark alone.

431
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,960
Why?

432
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,690
Why did I say that?

433
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,150
Will I survive this?

434
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,790
You.

435
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,140
He's a bull, but you are a buffoon.

436
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,960
Actually,

437
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,610
you should stop adding insult
to his injury.

438
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,880
The match is tomorrow.

439
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Vee, you should eat
till you're full today.

440
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,590
As much as you can eat.

441
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,660
Oh.

442
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,470
The reason you told him to eat a lot

443
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,120
is because you want him to gain weight
to fight with Krating, right?

444
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,630
Hah.

445
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,700
That's not it.

446
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,980
Follow my thinking here.

447
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,430
Ah.

448
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,680
Tomorrow, he's going to lose a match.

449
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,470
And when he loses,
he can't meet with him anymore.

450
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,390
When he can't meet him,

451
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,340
he wouldn't be able to eat.

452
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,010
That's right.

453
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,680
With such encouragement,

454
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
how could I eat anything?

455
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,600
Oh, you poor thing.

456
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,680
Because of this, I called him
to feed you some food.

457
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:45,880
Not this again.

458
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,140
Who did you call this time?

459
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,390
Few, Kampahn,

460
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,270
James. Just put all of them together.

461
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,220
There's one more.

462
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,100
What if it's Mark?

463
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,820
Will it do?

464
00:21:59,370 --> 00:21:59,930
Well? How about it?

465
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,370
Do you like it?

466
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,050
What a big smile.

467
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,440
Then I'll leave him in your care.

468
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,510
Give it your all.

469
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,160
Give it your all, child.

470
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,020
Mmm.

471
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,220
You guys.

472
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,050
How can you eat
Moo Kra Ta without any drinks?

473
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,080
Yes, that's right.

474
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,200
- Let's quickly go grab some drinks.
- Yeah, let's go.

475
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,550
Let's grab some drinks, come on.

476
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,830
Hey, grab me a cup.

477
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,370
What are you doing?
Let's grab some drinks.

478
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,140
He's probably choking right now.

479
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,450
What are you smiling for?

480
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,600
I just did what Yeewha asked me to.

481
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,280
So I came.

482
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,040
I practice too much
and don't have any strength left.

483
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,440
Can you pick some food and feed me?

484
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,410
Pick it for me.

485
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,140
Hm.

486
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,400
More.

487
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,150
Today,

488
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,020
thank you very much for granting
me a chance to have a meal with you.

489
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,770
It's really full.

490
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,280
I mean my heart is full.

491
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,640
That's overreacting.

492
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,690
Just go to sleep or you
wouldn't have energy for the match.

493
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,060
Wait.

494
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,650
Before you go,

495
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,930
can you give me some encouragement?

496
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,660
OK.

497
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,980
Listen carefully.

498
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,150
Live on with long life and happiness,

499
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,850
and strength.

500
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,810
That's good, thanks everyone
for being here. Are you crazy?

501
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,640
Oh, you.

502
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,880
Are you going to
come root for me tomorrow?

503
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,390
Tomorrow?

504
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,260
I have a presentation tomorrow.

505
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,880
If It's done early,
I'll go root for you.

506
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,770
Okay.

507
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,080
Just knowing that you'll come

508
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,390
makes me happy.

509
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,660
But if I won

510
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,390
and got a reward,

511
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,140
I'd be even happier.

512
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,240
Win it first.

513
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,950
But if you lose,

514
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,430
you'll have to leave me alone.

515
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:17,800
Hey, Mark.

516
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,220
Answer me honestly.

517
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,110
Are you mad at me?

518
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,290
That I accepted a stupid dare like that.

519
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,560
Maybe I got used to it.

520
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,080
About you doing
something hotheaded like this

521
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,510
and regretting it later.

522
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,330
Never learn anything from it.

523
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,380
Okay, enough.

524
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,060
Enough.

525
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,480
But it makes me realize

526
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,730
how much you worry about me.

527
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,750
I can't bring myself to be mad at you.

528
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,170
Just not mad?

529
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,580
Go to sleep already.

530
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,680
I'm gonna hang up.

531
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,480
Wait. Hello?

532
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,620
Hey.

533
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,070
Hah.

534
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,500
Oh.

535
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:10,880
Ow.

536
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,170
It came faster than I thought.

537
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,330
(Faculty of Engineering)
He got diarrhea.

538
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,350
The match is about to start.

539
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,260
Darn it, the match is starting soon.

540
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,090
Where the heck is he?

541
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,140
That's Vee. There he is.

542
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,210
Why are you looking like this?

543
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,310
Vee got diarrhea.

544
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,390
He spent all night on the toilet.

545
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,540
Because Mark feeds me too much.

546
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,930
And I overreacted.

547
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,940
Darn it, Vee.

548
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,040
You can barely stand.

549
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,660
I think you should withdraw.

550
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,640
No.

551
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,380
If I withdraw,

552
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,050
it's like just giving Mark to that guy.

553
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,660
But your condition is like this.

554
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,080
If you go on a ring,

555
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,870
it's not just you'll lose Mark,

556
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,880
- you'll probably lose your life too.
- That's true.

557
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,090
I'm not gonna lose.

558
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,840
If I can just see Mark's face,

559
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,030
I will have enough strength
to knock down Krating.

560
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,680
Vee.

561
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,070
Mark is the last one who
has to do the presentation.

562
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,720
I think

563
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,380
he wouldn't come here on time.

564
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,600
What should we do, Vee?

565
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,860
There is still time to withdraw.

566
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,420
Hm.

567
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,980
Come here, quick.

568
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:24,960
Here.

569
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,240
Take it.

570
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,010
There she is, Tee is here.

571
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,530
Tee.

572
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,050
- Tee.
- You look amazing.

573
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,080
Tee, you are so beautiful.

574
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,960
Tee, you're the best.

575
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,280
Come on.

576
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,860
Let's do it.

577
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,770
Vee, knock him down on the ground!

578
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,160
Vee, do your best.

579
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,530
- Do not headbutt.
- Show him.

580
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,430
Do not punch below belt.

581
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,870
When I order to stop, you stop.
Have sportsmanship. Go.

582
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,570
Do your best, Vee.

583
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,560
Get him.

584
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,310
Here he comes.

585
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,710
Get him.

586
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,730
Get him.

587
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,550
Vee, punch him back.

588
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,740
Help him.

589
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,830
Bring water here.

590
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,290
What happened?

591
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,760
Vee.

592
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,460
Come here.

593
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,210
Pour some water on his head.

594
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:45,830
Water. Water.

595
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,950
Let him sit.

596
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,600
Are you all right?

597
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,980
Darn it, Vee.

598
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,640
I think

599
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,140
you should throw in a towel.

600
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,530
Where is Mark?

601
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,290
Vee, I think that's enough.

602
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,920
If this goes on, you might die.

603
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,050
Vee.

604
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,860
I'm sorry I'm late.

605
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,480
I heard you have diarrhea.

606
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:05,960
Hey.

607
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,380
It's just a rumor.

608
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,590
I'm completely fine.

609
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,500
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

610
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:23,900
Vee.

611
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,080
Come on.

612
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,870
Come on.

613
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,940
My friend.

614
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,620
Get him.

615
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,380
Get him.

616
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,250
Fight him, Vee.

617
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,000
Is he going to be all right?

618
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,060
His face seems like he's not okay.

619
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,390
Don't worry, Mark.

620
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,640
A guy like Vee

621
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,690
can do everything for you, Mark.

622
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,660
He can even fight with ten Kratings.

623
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,590
Go. Go. Go.

624
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,240
Go, go.

625
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,400
Second round. Go.

626
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,360
Go.

627
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,050
Go on. Get him.

628
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,310
Darn it.

629
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,810
I shouldn't have hyped him up too much.

630
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,620
Stop.

631
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,240
Vee, get up.

632
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,650
- Vee, wake up.
- One.

633
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,060
- Get up.
- Two.

634
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,510
Three.

635
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,090
Four.

636
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,260
Five.

637
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,880
Six.

638
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,450
Seven.

639
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,090
Eight.

640
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,090
Are you all right?

641
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,610
Come on.

642
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,330
Come.

643
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,480
Ready?

644
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,250
Go.

645
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:51,770
Come on.

646
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,680
Vee.

647
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,470
Vee.

648
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,090
Punch him.

649
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,750
Do your best, Vee.

650
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,720
Knock him out cold.

651
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Go on. Get him.

652
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,520
End of the round. Back to your corner.

653
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:14,700
Sit down, Vee.

654
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,330
Here. Here.

655
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:15,710
Hurry.

656
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,450
You can't handle this.

657
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,420
I think we should talk to him
to withdraw.

658
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,680
If I tell him,

659
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,670
he should listen to me.

660
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,140
I can handle this.

661
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,110
Come, Mark.

662
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,100
Get on there, Yeewha.

663
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:27,910
I know.

664
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,210
Vee.

665
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,140
Mark told me to tell you. If you win,

666
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,980
he will forgive you

667
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,280
and accept you as his boyfriend.

668
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,400
Really?

669
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,900
Yes, it is true.

670
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,880
Fight him for Mark.

671
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,440
Vee.

672
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,130
What?

673
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,130
I think I know Krating's weak point.

674
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,980
Where is his weak point?

675
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,450
I have been observing for a while.

676
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,930
That Krating.

677
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,790
He's concerned about his image.

678
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,590
He only guards his face.

679
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,550
And back then, I saw you
landed a hit on his belly.

680
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,060
Hit his body.

681
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,720
He really felt it.

682
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,640
Vee.

683
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,410
This round, only target his body.

684
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,590
I think you got a chance here.

685
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,760
Yeah.

686
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,290
Let's go.

687
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,210
Go.

688
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,520
Come on.

689
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,240
Come on.

690
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,610
Hey.

691
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,540
You are done, Krating.

692
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,300
I tried talking to him.

693
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,250
I tried my best, but he won't listen.

694
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,450
He won't listen.

695
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,180
No matter how we tried,
he just doesn't listen.

696
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,910
Third round. Final round.

697
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,000
Ready? Go.

698
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,470
Keep punching.

699
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,840
That's it.

700
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,350
One.

701
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,640
Two.

702
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,100
Three.

703
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,080
Vee.

704
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,420
Try to knock him out.

705
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,480
If I count the score, you'll lose.

706
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,870
Okay. Boxers in your position.

707
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,710
Ready?

708
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,350
Go.

709
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,320
Keep going.

710
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,640
Come on.

711
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:55,810
Good.

712
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,240
Good.

713
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,440
If you can't do what you said,

714
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,140
you have to leave Mark alone.

715
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,370
Fine by me.

716
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,050
Vee.

717
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,800
Five.

718
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,250
Six.

719
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,390
Back to your corner.

720
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,690
That's bad.

721
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,270
Time is up.

722
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
They'll count the score.

723
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,310
Darn it.

724
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,610
Augh.

725
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,800
Boxers, come here.

726
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,820
The winner

727
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:57,700
is red.

728
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,390
- Why?
- Judge, why?

729
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,890
My friend is better.

730
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,830
Why does it end like this?

731
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,910
I want to punch Krating.

732
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:37,250
