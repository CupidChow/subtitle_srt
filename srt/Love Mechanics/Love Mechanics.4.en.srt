Let me do that for you.

8
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,820
It's the same way as mine.

9
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,540
I'm not making a mess as you.

10
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,900
Hey, it smells good.

11
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,500
Why is it the deeper, the better?

12
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,260
You've been here many nights,

13
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,280
won't it be a problem?

14
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,750
Didn't you tell me

15
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,700
that when I'm with you,

16
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,380
don't think about her?

17
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,140
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,910
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,440
Never mind. Let's get some sleep.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,060
Don't you apply some lotion?

21
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,540
I'm doing it right now.

22
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,020
- I told you to get some sleep.
- Okay, I'm going.

23
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Hey.

24
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,980
Huh?

25
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,610
Don't you get back pain
sleeping on a sofa?

26
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,370
If I say I do,
will you let me sleep on the bed?

27
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,660
If you're just sleeping.

28
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,100
Why?

29
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,740
What are you afraid of?

30
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,060
I'm not afraid.

31
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,280
But a guy like you,

32
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,980
you can't do anything if I'm not drunk.

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,110
Right now,

34
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,250
you're not drunk though.

35
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,460
Time to sleep.

36
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,500
Where am I gonna sleep?

37
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,580
That small space.

38
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,890
- That small?
- Mhm.

39
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,860
Or you prefer a sofa?

40
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,780
Darn, even a sofa has more space.

41
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,820
Good night.

42
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,400
Tonight,

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,350
may I spoon you, Mark?

44
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,730
It's the only thing you can do.

45
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,620

for permission if I do more.

Will it be edible?

58
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,220
Hey!

59
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,220
I am an ex Somtam chef son.

60
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,060
Good, isn't it?

61
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,260
Well, it's okay.

62
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,940
Next time you cook for me.

63
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,940
Do you think I can cook?

64
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,060
Even a cup instant noodle?

65
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,220
Anyone in the whole world
can do a cup of instant noodle.

66
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,140
But whoever does it,

67
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,940
it won't be the same
as the one made by you.

68
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,820
Pick it up.

69
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,430
In case it's emergency.

70
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,580
Go ahead.

71
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,900
Yes, Ploy.

72
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,430
Where are you, babe?

73
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,740
Oh, I am at...

74
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,860
Nuea's dorm.

75
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,740
- Oh-oh.
- Wow.

76
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,690
You two are stick together lately.

77
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,500
Well, uh.

78
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,500
We live in the same dorm. Is it strange?

79
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,660
Yeah.

80
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,020
It won't be strange,

81
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,750
if Mark didn't post something like this.

82
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,540
- Right.
- Right?

83
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,660
Huh? What post?

84
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,900
Uh...

85
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,420
If you're upset or something,
you can tell me, Mark.

86
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,660
No, I just...

87
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,420
felt attached to a series
I watched last night.

88
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,140
Whoa, wait a minute, kid.

89
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,020
Attached to a series you watched
last night but you posted this morning.

90
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,700
- Hmm?
- Hey!

91
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,940
Did you accuse my brother
of being a liar?

92
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,260
Is it a series I recommended, Mark?

93
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,820
Yes.

94
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,420
See? It's dope.

95
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,450
I'm going to my class.

96
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,580
- Oh, hurry up.
- Go get them, kid!

97
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,220
(Is the punishment in hell
for adultery too painful?)

98
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,650
Ow!

99
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,060
Time passed too fast.

100
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,580
Next thing you know it's the exam.

101
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,040
I feel like I've studied nothing.

102
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,740
Of course, because
you're always taking a nap.

103
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,020
And why didn't you wake him up?

104
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,860
How? I was napping next to him.

105
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,700
You fools. I told you to find some books
not to make some jokes.

106
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,180
You won't make any jokes
when you don't have time to study.

107
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,580
Look for books on another shelf.

108
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,140
Ahem!

109
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,980
Do you have some study buddies?

110
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,700
I do.

111
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,460
And a lot.

112
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,660
What about more than buddy?

113
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,530
It's like Ploy to you, isn't it?

114
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,620
Hmm, well,

115
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,740
Ploy normally studies at her friends'
dorm during the exam period.

116
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,620
And I would study with Bar.

117
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,380
But I reckon Bar will study
at his boyfriend's dorm.

118
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,340
So I want to do like him.

119
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,900
And who's your boyfriend?

120
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,300
Please, Mark.

121
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,340
Let me study in your dorm.

122
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,220

Are you sure?

140
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm sure.

141
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,740
We've been playing games all day,
we can't start studying now.

142
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,540
Listen, whoever worships Sai Dam
Hermit Shrine will pass the exam.

143
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,700
Will it really work?

144
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,380
Of course, that's why
I survive until my third year.

145
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,900
Come on.

146
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,940
Vee!

147
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,100
Are you worshiping
Sai Dam Hermit Shrine?

148
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,780
Well, uh, I just accompany him here.

149
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,980
Just admit it, it's alright,
everybody worships here.

150
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,980
Yes.

151
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,100
- Just tell us next time you're here.
- Yes.

152
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,220
Here.

153
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,100
Did you count?

154
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,220
- Okay, that's enough.
- Okay, let's do it!

155
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,350
Let's make a wish, guys.

156
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,300
Okay!

157
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,620
- Ouch!
- Oh!

158
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,620
Why did you have to be in a hurry?

159
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,740
- You were in a hurry too!
- Let me finish putting my incense sticks.

160
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,180
The incense ash just burnt my hand!

161
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,260
Can't you guys be quiet?

162
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,980
I'm hurt!

163
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,180
- So just throw them there.
- Let me put the incense sticks for you.

164
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,700
Sādhu!

165
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,060
Mark! Do you want to do lottery poetry?
This one here is so accurate.

166
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,780
Come on, do it.
Just try it before the exam.

167
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,140
Oh, I want to do it as well.

168
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,740
I'll help you.

169
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,660
Are you excited?

170
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,740
- Oh.
- You got one.

171
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,140
What's your number, 16?

172
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,660
Let's see.

173
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,660
OK. This one is for you.

174
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,580
- Is it good?
- It is good.

175
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,060
- It's excellent; money, work...
- His love life is great.

176
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,260
It's true.

177
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,020
Hey!

178
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,020
Your eyeballs are nearly
out of the socket.

179
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,560
What are you talking about?

180
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,260
I'm just teasing you.

181
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,140
What about Ploy? How are things?

182
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,660
She's studying with
her friends at their dorms.

183
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,620
So I don't have any chance to see her.

184
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,900
I think the quicker you two talk,
the better.

185
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,780
If you leave things too long,
it will be good for no one.

186
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,980
Can't sleep?

187
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,300
Mmm.

188
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,580
Hey!

189
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,830
You'll be sleeping in your
regular room after the exam.

190
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,580
Since it's my last night,

191
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,300
can I not sleep?

192
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,620
I want to do the other thing.

193
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,220
In your dream.

194
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,700
I can wait until you fall asleep.

195
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,140
I won't fall asleep before you.

196
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,780
You always snore at me.

197
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,460
That's insane. I never snore.

198
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,960
So you're really not brave.

199
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,900
It's because you can't act.

200
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,660
I didn't do it,

201
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,540
because I wanted
to clear things out first.

202
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,300
What do you mean by that?

203
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,900
After the exam,

204
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,380
I'll break up with Ploy.

205
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,540
I know that I might say it too late.

206
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,740
But please wait for me.

207
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,220
Mmm.

208
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,100
I'll be waiting.

209
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,460
So be quick and hurry back.

210
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,580
- We've done with the exam!
- Woo!

211
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,740
Now I can watch My Hero. I wanted to
see it for so long. It's been a month.

212
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
A month, really?

213
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,220
- Yes, man.
- Slow down.

214
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,060
We still need to finish
Professor Mom's report.

215
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,770
Can I count on you?
Let me watch my anime, please.

216
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,980
- Hmmm.
- If you're gonna say that,

217
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,980
how about a celebration
before watching anime?

218
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,980
- What do you say? Huh?
- Good idea.

219
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,780
I'm not available for today.
I'm going now.

220
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,100
- Eh? Mark!
- Eh?

221
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,060
(I'm here. Where are you, Ploy?)

222
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,900
Oh, hello.

223
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,380
Where are you, Ploy?

224
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,740
Yes, hello, ma'am.

225
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,420
Yes, I'm at the hospital now.

226
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,660
Uh, she was with her friend,

227
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,660
and the accident happened.

228
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,780
Stop doing this, Ploy!

229
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,300
Can't you pamper for once?

230
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,140
If you want to be pampered, be with him!

231
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,420
- Why...? Oh!
- Hey!

232
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,460
Now she was out of immediate danger.

233
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,620
But she is still unconscious.

234
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,540
I'll call you once there's an update.

235
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,620
Yes, ma'am. Good bye.

236
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,420
There's...

237
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,700
The number you dialed cannot
be reached at the...

238
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,460
Oh, boy! I'm still hangover.

239
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,420
Who asked for a celebration?

240
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,540
Why didn't you stop him?

241
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,540
Oh, hey.

242
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,420
Don't you have a break after the exam?

243
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

244
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,850
Well, we still need to finish a report.

245
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,600
Oh, lucky that you're here.

246
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,700
Can you help us with this part?

247
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,220
This part?

248
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,020
Oh!

249
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,060
Vee is actually the expert on this subject.
It's a shame that he's not here with us.

250
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,420
Mmm.

251
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,700
And where is Vee?

252
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,980
Vee's girlfriend had a car accident
so he was sleeping at the hospital.

253
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,580
Ploy awoke this morning, though.

254
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,380
We just got back from the hospital.

255
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,380
She's okay now.

256
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,380
Mmm.

257
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,340
Let's continue.
Help these kids, will you?

258
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,340
You awake?

259
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,460
How are you feeling?

260
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,700
Here.

261
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,790
I just talked with your mom via phone.

262
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,380
She will be here at any minute.

263
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,780
What about...?

264
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,300
The man who...

265
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,420
Oh, the man who drove?

266
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,410
He's alright, I guess.
He'll be back home soon.

267
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,620
He's just next to your room.

268
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,940
Do you want to visit him, Ploy?

269
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,140
Vee.

270
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,060
Actually, I knew it for a while.

271
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,300
I'm sorry.

272
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,860
I'm sorry, Vee.

273
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,260
I made you miserable, didn't I?

274
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,660
Didn't I, Vee?

275
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,260
I'm sorry.

276
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,820
Don't cry.

277
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,340
I didn't say anything.

278
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,260
Here I am sorting the medicine for you.

279
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,260
And here is your dinner.

280
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,700
Don't forget to take your meds
after dinner or your scar won't heal.

281
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,020
Well,

282
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,940
call me if you have some emergency.

283
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,940
Are you leaving?

284
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,460
We weren't here for so long.

285
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
Room smells so musty, doesn't it?

286
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,420
His name is Ton.

287
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,220
He's a senior in my faculty.

288
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,100
He knew that I had a boyfriend,

289
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,700
but he was still pursuing me.

290
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,780
And you still talked to him?

291
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,180
He...

292
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,300
He knew how to take care of girls.

293
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,020
He took me to some new places,

294
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,780
places I never went to.

295
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,300
And that included
buying you a new thing?

296
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,820
The thing I can't afford to buy for you.

297
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,060
At first, I was gonna toy with him.

298
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,700
But...

299
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,340
Eventually, I...

300
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,740
Had a feeling for him?

301
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,060
Since when?

302
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,260
About...

303
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,180
Two months ago.

304
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,500
Well, it's a long story.

305
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,980
Uh, by all accounts,
I won't come to the dorm.

306
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,730
I'm sorry, babe.

307
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,260
You're mad at me, right?

308
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,260
No.

309
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,460
Really?

310
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,780
I'm sleepy. I'll sleep now.

311
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,300
(You up?)

312
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,260
What's up, Ton?

313
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,980
I'm going to bed.

314
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,820
Well, I can't sleep. I want
someone to sit with me and talk.

315
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,700
It's so late, and there won't
be any place still open.

316
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,420
You know that my room
is open 24 hours for you, Ploy.

317
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,540
What are you saying, Ton?

318
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,060
The cell phone signal is pretty weak.

319
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,260
I can't quite hear you.

320
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,940
How about this?

321
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,620
I'll pick you up.

322
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,380
And we'll talk about buying a new
cell phone. What do you think?

323
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,140
Okay.

324
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,940
Vee! But...

325
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,940
He wasn't serious with me.

326
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,980
He hangs out with so many girls.

327
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,180
How do you know?

328
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,820
You see, Vee?

329
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,620
He didn't care a bit
even I was in that condition.

330
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,020
If he cares for me,

331
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,340
he would ask how am I by now.

332
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,620
So you want him to contact you?

333
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,380
No.

334
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,020
Can you not take it this way?

335
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,460
What I mean

336
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,180
is that makes me realize

337
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,220
that the only one who stands by me

338
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,420
is you.

339
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,260
Vee.

340
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,660
I'm sorry.

341
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,660
I'm sorry, Vee. I'm sorry.

342
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,780
Please don't break up with me.

343
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,740
I'm sorry.
