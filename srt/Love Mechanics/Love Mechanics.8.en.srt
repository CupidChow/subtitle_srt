00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,900
Mark.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,780
You listen to my explanation
and feel free to make a judgment.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,180
But hear me out, will you?

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,980
Fine.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,180
Are you gonna go this way?

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,540
I'll wait in front of your room

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,820
until you come out, or I won't leave.

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,220
We'll see if you can be
in your room forever.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,620
We'll see.

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:04,940
Oh, my.

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,660
Uh.

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,980
The tenant isn't here?

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,180
I saw him carrying a bag out
earlier this morning.

19
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,180
He left the key for me
to clear out his room.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,540
I see.

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,340
Do you have any idea
when he'll come back?

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,820
I don't know.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
Maybe we won't come back at all.

Dad?

36
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,900
Why are you home so early today?

37
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,220
You told me you had a meeting.

38
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,260
I'm home, Mom.

39
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,260
Masa!

40
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,660
What a surprise, Son!

41
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,840
Why didn't you tell me you were coming home?
I'd cook Miso poached fish for you.

42
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,620
No need.
Everything you cook is delicious.

43
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,840
You miss my cooking because of
the food near your dorm, right?

44
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,180
Do you come home due to the long breaks?

45
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,420
Nope. I skip classes.

46
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,980
I miss your cooking.

47
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,940
Be serious, please.

48
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,660
Huh?

49
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
Eh? I guess Dad is home.

50
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,140
Honey. Look who's here.

51
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,140
Good evening, Dad.

52
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,060
Are you having dinner now?

53
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,740
Or you're gonna take a bath?

54
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,380
So I'll prepare the hot bath.

55
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,860
So are you going to tell me
why come home?

56
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,410
Don't say you just miss my cooking.

57
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,460
I was drained.

58
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,780
So I'm here to recharge myself
for a week.

59
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,180
If you'd chosen a university
in Bangkok as I told you,

60
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,340
you wouldn't have been so drained.

61
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,460
You're the one
who wanted me to be mature.

62
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,620
That's why I chose to be far from home,

63
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,620
so I can take care of myself.

64
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,820
You should be proud of me.

65
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,420
Mark.

66
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,460
It's good if you want
to be away to grow up.

67
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,700
But if you think you can
be free far from home,

68
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,620
doing anything you want
without us knowing,

69
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,380
it's another story.

70
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,900
Don't you say that!

71
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,940
If you want to say something,
say it directly to me, Dad.

72
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,660
Were you kicked out by some boy?

73
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,860
Is that why you're crawling back home?

74
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
I'm full.

75
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,020
Honey.

76
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,060
Can you sleep?

77
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,780
If you had told me,
I would have rewashed your blanket.

78
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,780
It's fine, Mom.

79
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,380
This is actually better than my dorm.

80
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,660
What you're looking at?

81
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,300
I haven't seen you for a long time,

82
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,020
so I'd love to know
if my son has changed.

83
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,300
Hmm?

84
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,060
Come here, Masa, lay down on my lap.

85
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,620
I'll clean your ears.

86
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,940
Whoa, Mom.

87
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,820
I'm a grown man,
don't treat me like a baby.

88
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,140
For me, you are always a kid, Masa.

89
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,860
Come here, quickly.

90
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,740
Come on.

91
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,780
Fine.

92
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,220
When you were a kid, you had been begging me
to clean your ears every night.

93
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,060
Hmm?

94
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,780
You have a lot of earwax.

95
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,360
But Mom, nobody can see their own ear.
It's not something to be easily cleaned.

96
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,100
There's something
you can't do on your own,

97
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,260
so you need to get back
to me more often, you know?

98
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,100
Hmm?

99
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,980
Do you want to know

100
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,060
why I'm home?

101
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,420
Are you ready to share, Masa?

102
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,300
I was seeing a senior,

103
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,500
but we didn't even start on a good term.

104
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,260
I happen to know

105
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,660
that he's still hung up on his ex.

106
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,940
And I know

107
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,020
that I need to move on.

108
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,660
But deep down, I still miss him.

109
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,820
I want us to be back together.

110
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,700
And why don't you?

111
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,100
Because I know

112
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,940
that he's gonna hurt me again.

113
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,260
What makes you unhappy,

114
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,700
you have to leave it behind, Mark.

115
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,380
But it is too hard.

116
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,020
Yes, it'll never be easy.

117
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,140
It hurts.

118
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,420
But it is the only way
to not get hurt again and again.

119
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,300
I do everything to make you happy, Masa.

120
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,780
And who is he?

121
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,140
He dares to ruin my son's smile.

122
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,020
He dares to hurt my son this much.

123
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,660
I'm sorry, Mom.

124
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,180
Forget him, Son.

125
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,780
If you can't do it yet,

126
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,500
don't go back there.

127
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,380
You can go back whenever you're ready.

128
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,000
I have a reward for you.

129
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,000
Ta-da.

130
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,100
Do you like it?

131
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,300
Flower?

132
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,060
I mean me.

133
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,060
Do you like me?

134
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,900
Mark.

135
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,540
Oh, Pack.

136
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,580
When were you back home?

137
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,020
Didn't you think of coming to see me?

138
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,780
Oh, I'm just back home.

139
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,870
I thought you were busy,
so I didn't want to bother you.

140
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,870
Oh, boy.

141
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,860
I'll never be too busy for you, Mark.

142
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,180
Do you have to be with someone
this evening?

143
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,140
This evening? My mom asked me
to watch a series with her.

144
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,180
What?

145
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,020
You're not here often.

146
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,380
Let me treat you to dinner this evening.

147
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,180
You don't have to.

148
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,340
It's fine. I'll pick you up at 4:00 PM
after I get off work.

149
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,660
- No, you don't have to.
- See you.

150
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,980
This place is peaceful.

151
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,500
Why wouldn't I know that
my ex doesn't like crowded places?

152
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,340
Thank you.

153
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,780
So how have you been lately?

154
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,620
Lately?

155
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,620
I just ended things with the last person
I had been seeing.

156
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,460
I don't know why, but lately

157
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,740
I can't maintain
a long-term relationship with someone.

158
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,900
Maybe...

159
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,420
My ex set the bar so high.

160
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,060
If I was that good,
we wouldn't have broken up.

161
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,500
Oh, boy.

162
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,500
You know me too well.

163
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,500
Well...

164
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,420
I also know you very well.

165
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,820
The reason you're back home

166
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,220
is because of your love issue, isn't it?

167
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,580
Well...

168
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,100
Before I came here,

169
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,730
I was dating someone.

170
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,900
I was even not sure if we were dating.

171
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,420
Because he didn't
really break up with his ex.

172
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,900
And the day
he was gonna break up with her,

173
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,220
I found those two kissing.

174
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,420
Wow.

175
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,220
So you ran away and want
to heal your wound here, Mark?

176
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,420
I didn't run away. I just fled from him.

177
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,400
He kept getting back at me,

178
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,100
no matter how many times
I drove him off.

179
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,460
He even once showed up
in the middle of my class.

180
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,460
He's a real man. I like that.

181
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,180
And do you want to know if I like that?

182
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,180
I was kidding.

183
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,740
Look.

184
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,700
In this case of yours,

185
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,740
let me help you.

186
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,830
Let me help you.

187
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,620
If you wanna help me,

188
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,860
do as I asked.

189
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,740
Nuea.

190
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,180
I know that you asked
me to stop bothering him.

191
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,100
But I can't do it.

192
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,420
I still want to win him back.

193
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,300
Yeah! I know.

194
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,460
Do you really think he'll forgive you?

195
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,460
If he really has no feelings for me,
he won't hide himself from me.

196
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,180
Nuea. I do care about him a lot.

197
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,380
If it has to end,

198
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,220
let me clear things up with him.

199
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,580
Okay, fine.

200
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,540
I'll step down this time.

201
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,780
But if he gets annoyed by you,

202
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,980
you have to step down too.

203
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,140
Okay.

204
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,700
Thanks, dude.

205
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,740
You're a good man.

206
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,700
And that's why I'm still single.

207
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,340
I'll get these photocopies.

208
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,340
Do the work for me, will you?

209
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,100
Photocopy one more for me.

210
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,860
Okay.

211
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,140
Ow!

212
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,020
Wow!

213
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,620
Nuea is a real man.

214
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,730
He must love you very much.

215
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,340
No, he loves that kid.

216
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,700
That's why he wants us
to leave nothing behind.

217
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,020
When are you gonna talk to him?

218
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,740
I don't know.

219
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,260
He disappeared.
He's not even in his dorm.

220
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,100
Did you call him?

221
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,180
If he doesn't pick up, you can DM him.

222
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,790
What are you waiting for?

223
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,980
Do you think he will answer my text?

224
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,900
Plus, the important thing is,

225
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,900
I want to talk to him face to face.

226
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,980
Yeah, I got you.

227
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,100
But you'd better give him time.

228
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,260
He'll be back when he's ready.

229
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,700
Vee.

230
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,140
Mark is back.

231
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,540
- Mark is back?
- Yes.

232
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,300
- For real?
- Yes.

233
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,700
Oh, man! Where is he? Take me to him.

234
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,060
Hey!

235
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,820
Here it is.

236
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,860
Caramel macchiato,
less sugar but forever sweet.

237
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,640
- Thank you.
- Sure.

238
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,820
Your acquaintance?

239
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,510
Yes, this is Nuea,

240
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,460
my frat bother.

241
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,620
- Hi.
- Hi.

242
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,730
And this is...

243
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,300
Nuea's friend.

244
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,340
And...

245
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,860
This is Pack. My next-door neighbor.

246
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,380
I'm his guide for his Khon Kaen trip.

247
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,260
Oh, boy, Mark.

248
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,300
Why didn't you give him all the info?

249
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,460
That we were also a couple.

250
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,140
But maybe it's good
that you didn't tell him.

251
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,820
Because we might get back
together after this trip, right?

252
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,980
Let's go.

253
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,660
Show me your university.

254
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,660
Yes.

255
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,030
So please excuse us.

256
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,700
Let's go.

257
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
Are you okay?

258
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,300
What were you doing?

259
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,860
Eh? You want me to keep him away,
don't you?

260
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,180
And what about us getting back together?

261
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,300
Oh, I just messed up with him.

262
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,580
You know, Mark?

263
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,840
If I didn't use this hard trick,
he won't back down.

264
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,460
Come on.

265
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,340
Just let me make him back down from you.

266
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,620
Don't you agree?

267
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,180
I do.

268
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,420
Good!

269
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,780
I want to see the swimming pool
where you have been training.

270
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,700
Wanna go there?

271
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:58,420
♪I don't want to see you crying
or being sad♪

272
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,380
♪When they don't care about you
this much♪

273
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,860
♪I don't want you to stress yourself♪

274
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,140
♪Because the sad one is the one
who cares♪

275
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,340
In my opinion,

276
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,780
if Mark gets back together with him,

277
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,620
we should stop.

278
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,740
He already moved on.

279
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,740
See?

280
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,380
This is the main hero.

281
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,740
I don't think so.

282
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,060
We can't let Mark and Vee
end things on a bad term.

283
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,820
And this is the villain.

284
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,340
Before we discuss that,

285
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,140
let's be sure
that they're back together.

286
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,020
And this is the second lead,

287
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,020
the nice man who guides us
to the righteous path.

288
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,540
- Bing-bing.
- If they are,

289
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,140
I agree with Nuea.

290
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,340
That man didn't do anything wrong.

291
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,420
If you still want to clear things up,

292
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,860
Mark will be the one who's in trouble.

293
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,860
- Yeah, right.
- Mmm.

294
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,700
I don't think they are.

295
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,900
I'm sure that Mark brought him here

296
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,180
to make me back down.

297
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,300
It's his plan.

298
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,060
You said you're sure, didn't you?

299
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,380
They're just acting. I don't buy it.

300
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,820
Hey, wait!

301
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,380
Mark!

302
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,070
Mark! Talk to me.
I have something to talk to you.

303
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,220
Is there any problem?

304
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,180
We were just saying that you're acting
as a guard dog so well.

305
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,180
I see. Sure.

306
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,810
As well as someone
who's acting as a greedy dog.

307
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,340
When are you gonna leave me alone?

308
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,380
When you say that you're
back together with him.

309
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,780
So?

310
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,540
It's none of your business.

311
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,820
Okay, fine.

312
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,780
Let's race.

313
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,860
If I win, you have to tell me the truth.

314
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,450
Okay.

315
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,620
But if you lose,

316
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,340
you leave me alone.

317
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,820
Come on, Vee!

318
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
Vee!

319
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,710
Do you want to know
what's between me and Pack?

320
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,740
We're back together now.

321
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,060
Are you done?
