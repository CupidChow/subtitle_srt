The Best Hit

00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,510
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,430
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,580
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,730
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,500
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,860
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,450
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,040
By they way, you can't ask me to pay those credit card bills later, okay?

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,160
Hey, what do you take me for?

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,340
Wait! What is that?

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,140
You don't know that. Sticker pictures.

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,390
Ah! So when you take a picture there, it just comes out as a sticker like this.

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,780
Yes, when you take a picture, it comes right out as a sticker.

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,510
Let's take some pictures.

20
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,230
I don't want to.

21
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,050
- Why not?
- Only kids do that.

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,490
If you want to take pictures, then just do it by yourself.

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,260
Hey, if I wanted a picture of myself, I'd have taken an identification picture.

24
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,180
- This is also part of your work—
- Don't even say it's an extension of my work.

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,040
- Ah, let's do it!
- I don't want to!

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,040
- Let's do it! Let's do it.
- Forget it!

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,690
Let's do it. Please let's do it.

28
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,520
Ah! Okay! Okay, then. Let's do it.

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,810
It's not like my face will wear out from taking pictures. Let's do it!

30
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,720
Let's go in.

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
♫ Fool, you have no choice but to love me ♫

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,140
That bad idiot.

33
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,920
♫  Only to you, I can give my all ♫

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,980
Hey, what is this?

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,160
Ah, move aside.

36
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,940
Oh! It's working. It's working. What should we do now?

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,800
♫  My love, my eyes, my story ♫

38
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,770
Hurry up put it on.

39
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,530
Ah, we got it wrong.

40
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,800
♫  I only love you ♫

41
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,350
- What about this one?
- Yes. Put it over there.

42
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,330
- Do you want to use this?
- Yes.

43
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,870
♫ I wrote down funny things that happened ♫

44
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,810
This is really thumbs up!

45
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,090
It's totally amazing.

46
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,540
Oh, I'm hungry. Come out quickly.

47
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,540
Yes, I got it.

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,140
♫  I’ll be your roof, don’t worry ♫

49
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,410
♫  I like it when you look at me from by my side ♫

50
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,340
♫  i like it when you lean on my shoulder ♫
Roar.
Moo.

51
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,710
♫ Remember my love, my eyes, my story ♫

52
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,660
Hey! Now you can carry your own bags.

53
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,120
What? This is really...

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,220
♫  I only love you ♫

55
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,930
It's 6 o'clock.

56
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,600
It's after work hours.

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,880
Already? What kind of people get off work so early?

58
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,520
Will you get your act together after you get beaten up by every working person in this country?

59
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,560
Let's just eat and then we can go.

60
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,360
Forget it. Let's go home and eat there.

61
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,590
I want to go somewhere with you.

62
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm sure you'd like it too.

63
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,170
What is it? How great is that place?

64
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,060
Follow me.

65
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,680
CEO.

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,970
What? You didn't get the car ready, and why did you run out of the building like this?

67
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,020
Well, the thing is that the general producer took the car.

68
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,730
- My car?
- Yes, your car.

69
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,730
He said he got your permission.

70
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,880
Ah, that jerk seriously!

71
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,130
Then, how am I supposed to get anywhere?

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,710
Chinese Restaurant "The Great Wall"

73
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,200
What is this?

74
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,600
Hey, why did we come this far to just eat a bowl of jjajangmyeon?

75
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,380
Let's just go in and eat. Ah, you're very talkative.

76
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,850
That idiot...

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,880
Hey! Sit over here.

78
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,520
- Ahjussi.
- Yes.

79
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,760
Two bowls of jjajangmyeon, please.

80
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,230
Wait a moment. I'll get them to you soon.

81
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,920
Okay.

82
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,220
Hey, This is uncanny? Why does this place look so familiar?

83
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,300
- It's uncanny, right?
- Yes.

84
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,170
I think I've been here before. But, I've never been here.

85
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,250
Maybe you've been here.

86
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,390
What?

87
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,930
Well, I happened to be passing by here and this place seemed similar to what you described to me.

88
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,330
So I was wondering if this was the place.

89
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,180
The place you came to eat with your dad when you were young.

90
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,310
Here. Your bowls of jjajangmyeon are here.

91
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,430
Hey! There's a fried egg on top of your jjajangmyeon.

92
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,880
Of course. Originally, you're supposed to put a fried egg on your jjajangmyeon.

93
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,380
Please eat.

94
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,690
Eat a lot.

95
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,690
I think this is the right place.

96
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,550
Is that so?

97
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,140
Let's eat. You said you were hungry.

98
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,960
Yes.

99
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,550
Here, drink some water.

100
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,090
It's delicious.

101
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,930
Thumbs Up!

102
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,720
What?

103
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,060
I enjoyed it. The jjajangmyeon was good.

104
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,640
It was worth it even if it was far, right?

105
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,660
Yes.

106
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:45,930
That was also the best jjajangmyeon I've ever eaten.

107
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,680
Here.

108
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,530
I'm Joeng Ji Taek, a team manager at Ssen Entertainment. You passed the audition.

109
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,350
I need you to fill out a simple registration form and you'll get a pass.

110
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,820
Let's talk about the details tomorrow.

111
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,260
Ji Hoon, from now on we are a family. Let's work hard together.

112
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,640
How on earth did you find it?

113
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,810
I really found it by accident.

114
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,970
That's ridiculous. You're saying the same thing by accident.

115
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,260
You've been hanging out with him lately?

116
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,660
What is that? What did you buy so much?

117
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,980
It happened somehow.

118
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,060
Where have you been?

119
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,730
- I've been doing so much for you..
- What?

120
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,070
You better be grateful to me.

121
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,890
- Can I go in?
- Yes, you can.

122
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,640
I want you to be the first one to know about this.

123
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,900
I made it into the Ssen debut team!

124
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,830
If it's Ssen,

125
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,230
Isn't it one of the biggest companies in our country?

126
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,250
Probably. Aren't you proud of me?

127
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,950
Of course. I'm proud of you! You little one!

128
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,880
One is taken care of.

129
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,670
Now, there is only one left. You.

130
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,720
I have no strength to hit you today. I'll hit you tomorrow. Keep that in mind.

131
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,350
Okay, I will. Rest!

132
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,500
Hey, Lee Ji Hoon.

133
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,520
You're the best!

134
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,580
World Entertainment

135
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,720
What's wrong with it?

136
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,760
Hope this lasts.

137
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,610
Bro. Please look who sent me a text message.

138
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,540
Hey, you're so annoying.

139
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,920
Reserved Forces Training Notice...

140
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,380
Ah, it's another spam message.

141
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,830
Ah. I need to change my phone number.

142
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,200
- Did you serve in the army?
- What? I haven't served in the army yet.

143
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,390
Do I look like an army reserve officer?

144
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,890
Everywhere I look, you seem like a reserve officer to me.

145
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,070
Hey, you seriously.

146
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,000
You're so silly.

147
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,310
What?

148
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,800
Reserved Forces Training will be held in Cheolwon.

149
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,340
It's really troublesome. This is killing me.

150
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,450
Cheolwon.

151
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,640
Don't you have to go to the company?

152
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,560
- What company?
- Star Punch.
- Oh, not yet.

153
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,590
I hope you don't feel uncomfortable because of me.

154
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,710
I never said anything like that.

155
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,860
I said it just in case.

156
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,370
You're acting like you wanted me to leave.

157
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,820
That's ridiculous.

158
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,290
Last time, you even acted like you would burn the place down or something, but you only talked to Young Jae.

159
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,770
I don't have the power to burn a place down.

160
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,350
It's hard enough taking care of myself.

161
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,930
Okay, I'll figure it out.

162
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,860
Okay. I'm going to go fishing.

163
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,030
Fishing? Alone?

164
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,350
Who would I go with?

165
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,390
Should I go with you?

166
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,090
It'll be boring if you go alone.

167
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,770
Being bored is part of fishing.

168
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,600
Don't worry about it, I'll be fine.

169
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,100
- Again.
- What?

170
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,150
Why do you keep telling me not to worry about it? I keep wanting to.

171
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,610
Oh, did I say that?

172
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,680
Anyway, I'll be back.

173
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,470
I feel sad for some reason.

174
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,100
Don't you usually let it dry?

175
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,100
Are you going somewhere? I don't think you're going to the company.

176
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,180
Oh, yeah, I have stuff going at my house.

177
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,310
It turns out my second cousin is getting married,

178
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,620
and I completely forgot about it.

179
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,190
I'll be spending the night there, so let Ji Hoon know.

180
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,680
Sure.

181
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,830
This house is small enough as it is, so rest to your heart's content over there.

182
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,040
You don't even have to come back.

183
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,070
Wow, dude.

184
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,350
What?

185
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,760
- Are you heading out now?
- Yes.

186
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,220
I have another audition in the afternoon.

187
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,420
- Are you going fishing?
- Yeah.

188
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,480
It's been a while since I've gone, and I missed it.

189
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,910
Put it here.

190
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,170
All done.

191
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,960
- Can I go with you?
- What about your audition?

192
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,980
Honestly, I don't have to go. I'll go bring my stuff.

193
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,480
Okay.

194
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,790
Are you going somewhere?

195
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,910
Fishing. It's been a while since I went somewhere with my dad.

196
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,840
Wow, sounds fun.

197
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,970
When will you come back?

198
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,680
I probably won't make it back tonight.

199
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Damn. For fishing?

200
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,620
Why, are you going to miss me?

201
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,470
Ugh. Do you need to be beaten up again?

202
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,010
Hold on.

203
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,390
Take this with you.

204
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,040
- What is it?
- Mouthwash. You said you're staying the night.

205
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,380
Why is this mouthwash so clear?

206
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,990
It's cleaner because there's no color.

207
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,520
You probably won't even brush your teeth.

208
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,270
Is there a reason for your sudden interest in my oral hygiene?

209
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,200
You really do need to get hit.

210
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,840
I'll get going now.

211
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,380
That was so stupid.

212
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,100
- Let's catch a movie when I get back.
- What?

213
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,370
What, we can't watch movies together anymore?

214
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,800
- Are you paying?
- Of course. Bye.

215
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,030
Hey, Part-timer.

216
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,920
I told you not to act like you know me here.

217
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,480
You're stressing me out enough.

218
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,760
You're stressing me out enough without all this.

219
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,980
Where are you going?

220
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,560
An intern's destiny. I'm getting coffee.

221
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,900
Oh, perfect.

222
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,210
I've been craving coffee.

223
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,810
Whoa, what's that line for?

224
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,120
That's a really famous gimbap place.

225
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,720
Yeah, right. Gimbap is already good, right? How delicious could a gimbap be?

226
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,810
- You want to know how delicious they are?
- Yes.

227
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,440
I don't know either. The line here is always so long that I have never eaten them.

228
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,920
Hey, what was that?

229
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,900
I'm also curious about how delicious their gimbap is.

230
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,880
Nothing bad happened, right?

231
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,180
No, there is nothing.

232
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,750
Father, you go fishing whenever you're feeling down somehow.

233
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,210
Do I do that? Me?

234
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:41,210
Sometimes I just don't want to think about anything else.

235
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:46,150
When I come here, I at least don't have idle thoughts.

236
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,420
I auditioned for Ssen and I passed there.

237
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,050
Is that so? That's great!

238
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,330
Hey! If it's for Ssen Entertainment, it must have been hard to get in.

239
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,730
Sorry, I didn't tell you this earlier, but you will do well.

240
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,420
I was also a manager once. I can tell when I see it. I know that for sure.

241
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,370
Whether they'll succeed, or just give up halfway.

242
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,790
But, you'll succeed.

243
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,760
I'm not saying this because you're my son, but I'm saying this as a manager.

244
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,760
I've been thinking about it for quite some time.

245
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,490
I hope my father can help me this time.

246
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,650
What?

247
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,920
Yes, of course.

248
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,630
I'll do what I can to help you.

249
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,280
I have some acquaintances who work at Ssen Entertainment.

250
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,080
There is also a manager there called Yoon. That team manager is very well-known, but we were childhood friends.

251
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,530
I've also helped him many times.

252
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,010
Perhaps my request will not be ignored.

253
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,590
No. I'm not going to Ssen.

254
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,380
What?

255
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,640
Father, please help me debut.

256
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,660
I've been to big companies and good companies. But, there is no one like you, Father.

257
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,130
I thought this was an audition. That's why I came along with you here.

258
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,330
Part-timer, where are you? Are you leaving work?

259
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,160
I finished work early today. I'm at the library.

260
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,060
I've been studying hard trying to catch up with my studies.

261
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,060
Anyway, you love studying so much.

262
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,150
If she had been born during the Joseon Dynasty, she'd have passed the state exam more than ten times—

263
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,010
No, I'm sure she'd have passed it more than 100 times!

264
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,340
Why doesn't she just study for the rest of her life until she grows old and dies?

265
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,680
Why are you in such a long line to eat only gimbap?

266
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,560
Anyway, I guess there are a lot of people who have nothing to do in Korea.

267
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,220
What? What are you looking at?

268
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,160
The line here is always so long that I have never eaten them.

269
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,840
Hey, what was that?

270
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,120
I'm also curious about how delicious their gimbap is.

271
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,040
Ah, seriously! It keeps bothering me.

272
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,760
Ah, forget it. No.

273
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,430
Ah. I'm not doing this. This is not Yoo Hyeon Jae's style at all.

274
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,210
I'm Yoo Hyeon Jae. I can't get in the line on a squalid street like this. No way.

275
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,720
- Student.
- Yes.

276
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,110
- Is it so delicious here?
- It's really delicious.

277
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,990
- I see it's delicious.
- Yes.

278
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,940
Thumbs up!

279
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,550
I'm hungry.

280
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,930
Anyway, I'm doing all kinds of things lately.

281
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,340
What? Is it raining now?

282
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,010
Part-timer must have taken an umbrella with her, right?

283
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,730
It's the rainy season. It's natural for modern people to have umbrellas in this season.

284
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,920
Besides, Part-timer is living in the future.

285
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,140
Hey, Hyeon Jae. Since when have you been so caring?

286
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,060
Whatever.

287
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,680
Hey, Part-timer!

288
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,760
♫ When I still see you ♫

289
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,600
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

290
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,400
♫  I remember when we first met ♫

291
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,940
♫  You’re still so beautiful ♫

292
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,640
Aigoo.

293
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,220
♫ When I still see you ♫

294
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,160
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

295
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,890
♫  You’re still so beautiful ♫

296
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,060
- What brings you here?
- What?

297
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,440
Well... I was taking a walk.

298
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,500
What?

299
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,560
But, it's raining this heavily.

300
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,420
It's my hobby to take a walk. I don't skip even a day.

301
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,950
It's cold. Let's go quickly.

302
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,060
Why did you stay this late at night? You don't have an umbrella with you, right?

303
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,350
You're unlike your appearance.

304
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,610
What about my appearance?

305
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,580
You look so determined and strong as if you'd always prepare for things like this very thoroughly.

306
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,320
Do you want to die?

307
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,770
You always tend to insult even at the end of a conversation.

308
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,870
Hey, come closer. It's still raining.

309
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,170
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

310
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:50,420
Anyway, I thought I was going to get soaked completely.

311
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,600
Thank you very much.

312
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,000
What light words of gratitude I just got?

313
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,560
Aigoo. I don't like it.

314
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,610
Where is Lee Ji Hoon? He's not home yet?

315
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,430
Ji Hoon is not coming home today.

316
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,480
What about Drill? Is he not home yet?

317
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,350
I think Drill is not coming home either.

318
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:24,890
Then... It's only the two of us in the house tonight?

319
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,770
So what if it's only the two of us?

320
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,210
Wait a moment. What's that look on your face?

321
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,350
What about it?

322
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,400
Ah. I'm tired.

323
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:50,590
Ah, if by any chance you have anything to say to me, send me a text message. Don't come up to my room!

324
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,690
Hey! Even if you were the only woman left on earth, you wouldn't be the one for me!

325
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,560
Nothing is working out for me.

326
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,430
Nothing works.

327
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,380
Ah. It looks like something is causing it to be so tightly locked.

328
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,900
We need to call a locksmith tomorrow.

329
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Hey, then... What should I do?

330
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,270
What do you mean? We'll have to sleep under the same blanket together.

331
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:35,120
Hey! You... Even if you say it... What do you mean, sleep with me? I'm not sleeping with you at all!

332
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,020
I'll sleep here and you'll sleep over there. That's how we'll be sleeping.

333
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,110
It's uncomfortable.

334
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,600
What should we do? Do you want to wash up first?

335
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,230
Hey, aren't those lines you said too dirty?

336
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,800
It's dirty not to wash up. Then, I'll go ahead and wash first.

337
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,440
It was raining so much that I got soaked.

338
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,390
What's really wrong with him?

339
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,580
Right. If you're a little hungry, you can eat that gimbap if you want to.

340
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:17,840
Since there weren't many people waiting on the line, I just bought one box on my way back home.

341
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,600
Aigoo. Whatever.

342
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,710
My gosh. Thumbs Up, Drill and Lee Ji Hoon.

343
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,180
They are all the same!

344
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,640
Aigoo. Let's not have weird thoughts.

Hey, what is this?

346
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:09,470

349

- A cockroach?

350
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,870
Hey, where are you going?

351
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,380
Go in there! Go in there and catch it! Please catch it!

352

Yes, I am.

You aren't. You must be studying again, right?

If you know, why do you ask?

379
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,100
You're very hardworking. You're working very hard.
