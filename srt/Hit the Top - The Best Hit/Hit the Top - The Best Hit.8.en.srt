1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,610
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,270
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,420
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,670
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,860
Yoon Shi Yoon
♫ They make my heart flutter
Beautiful day ♫

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,500
Lee Se Young
♫ And I have something to say
something to tell ♫

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,120
Kim Min Jae
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,420
Cha Tae Hyun
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,050
♫ I love you ♫

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,600
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Hong Bo Hee, to be honest, I was a fan of yours growing up.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,780
Well, thank you.

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,790
- You probably didn't know, but you were my first love.
- Really?

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,950
Of course. In school, all the guys would carry around your picture.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,810
Oh, that's embarrassing to hear.

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,870
Now, before we start the challenge, we heard that Bo Hee has an unexpected charm to her.

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,190
Wow, can you really do this? This is is quite hard.

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,390
You're amazing.

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,770
Hey, hey, why am I getting a bad feeling? Isn't she doing yoga?

20
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,710
- No, i-it is yoga.
- No, I don't think so.

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,090
Well, anything's better than yoga. Who even does yoga these days?

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,660
- You brat.
- The Pure Fairy's special talent is

23
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,960
drinking a bottle of cola in one shot!

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,950
Wow, can you really do this? I didn't know you had such a tough side to you.

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,300
I don't know if I'll be able to do it, but I'll try my best!

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,590
Alright, now bring us the soda.

27
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,130
Now, this has a lot of carbonates, so even men find this difficult.

28
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,750
- I see.
- Can you really do this?

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,330
- I will try.
- Hey, hey!

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,800
Do you think she can do that? She's crazy.

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,680
Gwang Jae, I really wish

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,590
I can become a fixed member by winning that contest.

33
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,000
You will win.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,020
I'll become a fixed member, then release an album.

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,600
Then, we could repay our debt quickly too, right?

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,140
Of course. It'll be done in one shot.

37
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,000
Then, I should become a fixed member. No matter what.

38
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,780
- Don't do it!
- I don't know if this is possible.

39
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,110
It's not too late to give up now. Well, then, start!

40
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,790
Wow! If it gets too hard for you, feel free to stop.

41
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,150
It must be hurting your throat. She's at least halfway through.

42
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,020
It's still not too late. You don't have to overexert yourself.

43
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,570
Wow! You're really amazing.

44
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,140
Wow, the last gulp.

45
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,490
You were so amazing! Hong Bo Hee's one-shot challenge is a success!

46
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,790
I thought I would die.

47
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,030
Wow, that is really amazing. Bo Hee, is your throat alright?

48
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,990
I'm fine.

49
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,230
- Will you still be able to sing?
- Yes, I can.

50
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:07,380
I see. The Pure Fairy with unexpected charm, Hong Bo Hee. Keeping up with this atmosphere, please pick a number.

51
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,800
Well, I'll go with 23— No, I want 25.

52
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,460
Twenty five. Let's see what song she chose.

53
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,830
Violet Fragrance

54
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,420
A song that's perfect for the Pure Fairy! She has selected "Violet Fragrance."

55
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,940
- She really picked the best song for herself.
- This is so great!

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,790
- ♫ Your appearance came upon me ♫
- I love it.

57
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,160
♫ like a purple light ♫

58
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,130
Hey! How could this happen!

59
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,810
Oh, Hong Bo Hee. I'm sorry, but you are eliminated!

60
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,390
Hey, I guess my dragon dream was really about a dragon.

61
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,550
We have to go this way to take the subway anyway—

62
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,660
- I know, so you don't have to tell me.
- What?

63
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,790
Just hold onto the belt tightly. Once I learn something, I never forget it.

64
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,360
Ugh, acting high-and-mighty for nothing.

65
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,050
It's not acting high-and-mighty. My brain is the one thing—

66
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,930
Do you remember anything?

67
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,930
I don't, but I'm pretty sure I had a good memory.

68
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,890
You should look for that nearby. I've had to go since before.

69
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,360
Go where? Are you looking for something?

70
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,540
A bathroom. Exactly how good is at that brain of yours?

71
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,240
Oh, let's see. Come this way.

72
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,460
If you go over there, there's going to be a bathroom, so hurry up.

73
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,520
Okay. Hold this for me.

74
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,720
Do I look like someone who will hold someone's bag—

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,370
Don't wander off like last time.

76
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,650
I feel strangely bothered by all of this.

77
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,940
This song...

78
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,920
♫ I'm sorry I can't send you away so easily ♫

79
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:35,130
♫ Remember, please don't go ♫

80
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,650
♫ Don't go ♫

81
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,570
The song's pretty good.

82
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,580
It's just good? It's amazing.

83
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,440
- Double thumbs up!
- Double thumbs up!

84
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,130
Hey, if you keep acting out like that,

85
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,470
I'm going to run away with that notebook of yours.

86
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,000
If you're going to run away, do it alone. Why would you take my notebook?

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,760
I'm going to steal it and change my life. So what?

88
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,810
Let's just eat ramen.

89
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,470
This is definitely my song, and I didn't even release it.

90
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,490
♫ My heart ♫

91
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,510
♫ As I watch you ♫

92
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,340
♫ Tears fall down again ♫

93
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,420
♫ Afraid I'd never see you again ♫

94
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,020
Excuse me, who sang the song that's playing right now?

95
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,700
Who's the singer of this song?

96
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,180
- Do you mean MJ?
- What?

97
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,400
- What's MJ?
- You don't know MJ?

98
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,760
He's MJ.

99
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,480
♫ I can't send you away easily ♫

100
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,860
MJ?

101
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,360
This punk stole my song?

102
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,540
How did he...

103
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,390
Where can I see him?

104
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,290
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

105
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:36,110
Excuse me? Where would we go?

106
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,120
Dda Bong... Aren't you Dda Bong...

107
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,000
Dda Bong? What's wrong with you?

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,060
Dda Bong! Dda Bong!

109
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,560
Did he... again?

110
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,250
- Hello?
- It's me.

111
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,500
Choi Woo Seung? What happened to your phone?

112
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,430
It's a long story.

113
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,570
Is this deja vu or something? Where are you?

114
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,370
- What did you go all the way there for?
- It's a long story.

115
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,270
I'm sorry, but could you please come with taxi fare?

116
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,370
You're always asking me for that.

117
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,410
You're sick of bringing taxi fare too, right?

118
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,970
Then, can you get my glasses from my room, too?

119
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,390
I can't see, and it's frustrating.

120
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,560
What happened to your contacts?

121
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,290
Something happened. Anyway, let's talk later.

122
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,280
I'm hanging up.

123
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,890
Hey. Choi Woo Seung!

124
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,550
What did she even do there?

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,450
♫ Fool, you have no choice but to love me ♫

126
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,270
I told you not to look anywhere else and follow me.

127
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,100
What? You're the one that suddenly left.

128
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,700
I had a reason for that. Go, the light turned green.

129
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,000
♫  I only love you ♫

130
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,240
♫ Yes, fool, I have a lot to say to you too ♫

131
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,900
♫  All day, I wrote down funny things that happened ♫

132
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,700
♫  I’ll tell you all of it as I slowly fall asleep ♫

133
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,740
♫  I’ll tell you stories cozy like the clouds ♫

134
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,250
She should've been here by now.

135
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,570
♫ I love those conditions, You know that I ♫

136
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,660
Saying she couldn't even see. What is she even doing right now?

137
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,590
♫ You have no choice but to love me ♫

138
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:26,600
♫  Only to you, I can give my all ♫

139
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,870
♫ Remember ♫

140
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,960
♫ My love, my eyes, my story ♫

141
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,280
♫  My hope, it’s all you ♫

142
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,900
♫  And what I wanna say is ♫

143
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,040
♫  I only love you ♫

144
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,930
- But, what time is it anyway?
- What?

145
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,220
It should be around 9. Why?

146
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,730
What? Hey, hurry hurry. I'm late for my part-time job at the convenience store!

147
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,900
A part-time job at the convenience store? I thought you worked at the karaoke place.

148
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,640
I work at the convenience store on the weekends as well. Hurry.

149
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,210
Part-time. How many part-time jobs do you even have?

150
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,600
Hurry.

151
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,870
Gwang Jae.

152
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,470
I... want a drink tonight.

153
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,240
Give me the key. I'll head in first so--

154
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,900
Why? You should eat with us and we'll head in together.

155
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,480
Yeah, let's eat together. I want to eat udon too.

156
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,640
That's right. We want a drink too.

157
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,070
Be quiet, you two!

158
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,500
Console her well.

159
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,980
When women are struggling, that's your chance.

160
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,320
What do you mean?

161
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,270
Idiot. I'm leaving, you jerk.

162
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,820
You said you couldn't even sleep. Should you be drinking that much?

163
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,400
I can't live sober, it's too embarrassing.

164
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,160
What about it?

165
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,650
That's enough. Everyone in this world burps.

166
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,260
Do you think they'll broadcast it?

167
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,810
Well that.

168
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,520
I'll try to block it the best I can.

169
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,620
I'm really hopeless.

170
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,450
Why are you beating yourself up?

171
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,230
You should take a shot.

172
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,400
I have to look after you.

173
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,010
As if I didn't know you were my manager.

174
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,360
It's not because I'm your manager.

175
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,410
Then why?

176
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,740
You're right. It's been a while since it's been this empty.

177
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,640
Give me a shot too.

178
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,460
It's been a while since I've had a drink like this with you, right?

179
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,030
You're right.

180
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:28,660
I wanted to win and definitely become part of the fixed cast.

181
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,800
Let's do this slowly.

182
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,460
It won't happen just because we rush it. I promised you.

183
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,640
I'll definitely get you back to where you were.

184
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,910
So trust me and take your time. Do it slowly.

185
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,820
Alright. Since you trust me like that--

186
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,390
Is that woman burping?

187
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,820
That's so embarrassing.

188
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,260
Are they crazy?

189
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,000
Hey.

190
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,840
Drink up. Drink.

191
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,370
Auntie. Give us one bottle of cola.

192
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,820
Hey. What are you doing?

193
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,380
What about burping, huh?

194
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,410
All people eat, and shit, and burp. That's all-natural.

195
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,070
Do they not burp? Do they not fart?

196
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,980
I can't live.

197
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,570
That's right, you should smile. You're pretty when you smile.

198
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,980
Hey, why are you pouring? I will.

199
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,230
You can fill up that empty area in the fridge.

200
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,200
So why do I need to do this?

201
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,660
Didn't you say your charger wasn't working? I have one that I'm not really using.

202
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,400
I'm good. I was penniless before, so I would move at your request.

203
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,600
But you saw me. I've got money now. Who do you see me as?

204
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,030
Got it. Leave it here, I'll do it.

205
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,400
How bad is your eyesight? Ah, I don't know.

206
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,560
Why should I even care?

207
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,200
Leave it. I'll do it.

208
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,940
I need to fill up the fridge after doing this, right?

209
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:15,200
You understand well. While you're at it, make sure to do it right.

210
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,360
She just has to say thank you, but she's always like this.

211
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:30,240
Ah but, are all women here like this? Or is it just her?

212
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,360
I told you I wanted to go home, but why are we headed in this direction?

213
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,560
The CEO told us to bring you to the company building.

214
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,030
Who do you even manage?

215
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,980
I'm your manager.

216
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,410
Then how come you only listen to the CEO's request?

217
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,600
Because the CEO is the one paying me.

218
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,640
But who's the one that brings in the money?

219
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,650
Hold on. Ah, I can't do this any longer.

220
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,610
Let's stop by the restrooms real quick.

221
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,900
Hold it.

222
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,260
I've been holding it in since earlier.

223
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,470
It's impossible to hold it any longer.

224
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,200
Ajussi, we almost lost him! We can't lose him.

225
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,910
What is that? Why are they pulling over?

226
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,460
How is it that a celebrity is waiting on their manager?

227
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,920
I don't even have water.

228
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,510
Welcome.

229
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,200
Welcome.

230
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,480
Why am I saying hello?

231
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,960
You...

232
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,250
You are MJ, right?

233
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,400
No, I'm not.

234
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,300
What do you mean no? I can tell by just looking. Hey, you're not the one that wrote 'Come Back Again'? Right?

235
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,460
- You've got the wrong person.
- Where are you trying to go?

236
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,390
Tell the truth. Where did you steal that? How did you steal it? Huh?

237
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,410
Let me go.

238
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,800
Who do you think I am? You better tell the truth!

239
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,060
- What's going on?
- I said to let me go.

240
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,310
Hey, you!

241
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:58,100
- Hey, you better let our MJ go! Really!
- Do you know who I am? Hey! Do you know?

242
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,370
You must really be crazy? A crazy bastard.

243
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,070
- What is this? Really?
- What? What? What?

244
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,540
Hey, where are you going? Thumbs up!

245
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,550
Hey.

246
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,590
What are you doing?!

247
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,940
What are you doing?

248
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,800
I got fired from my job because of you.

249
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,380
How come all these things happen when I'm with you?

250
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,260
How is that my fault?

251
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,640
Didn't you see me getting chewed out?

252
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,390
And also, the owner is strange too.

253
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,030
Does it make sense for him to say to take these instead of paying me?

254
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,020
But, he said he'd forget about the property damage.

255
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,780
But why did you do that to a customer?

256
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,520
And, what about seeing MJ?

257
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,720
That was definitely MJ.

258
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,130
Did he say he was MJ?

259
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,950
- No.
- Ah really, you should say things that make sense.

260
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,550
How crazy would MJ have to be to go to the convenient store?

261
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,710
What about it? He could go to a convenience store. And you saw his fans.

262
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,160
Ah really, do you think I don't have fans?

263
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,620
Where are your fans?

264
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,890
Ah, after meeting you, nothing's been working out for me.

265
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,620
Hold on. Do you by chance,

266
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,520
have my bag?

267
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,800
Ah. Why would I be holding your bag?

268
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,410
I'm doomed. I must have left it at the convenience store.

269
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,360
Ah really.

270
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,130
Head inside, I'll bring it to you.

271
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,700
Hey. I'm fine.

272
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,120
You said you can't see. Head inside.

273
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,810
Oh my.

274
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,260
Do you know?

275
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,300
I can't get anything done after meeting you too.

276
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,790
There's no one that came in after me. So who was it?

277
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,270
Did you call me?

278
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,140
Yeah, it's nothing big. But we're working on the tracks for your upcoming mini-album.

279
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,030
Cary and I are almost done with it.

280
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,990
I don't think you can continue doing that.

281
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,890
- What are you talking about?
- 'Come Back Again.'

282
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,270
There's a person that knows I didn't write and produce it.

283
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,210
What? Who? Is it a reporter?

284
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,480
- It's not a reporter.
- Then who is it?

285
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,390
I met them at a convenience store.

286
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,810
Convenience store? What are you talking about?

287
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,340
Who did you meet at the convenience store?

288
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,900
I don't know. It was my first time seeing him too.

289
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,900
Was he a part-time employee?

290
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,290
- How could you tell me such important news--?
- Anyways. Don't say I didn't warn you.

291
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,660
Also. That person.

292
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,580
Looked like someone.

293
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,460
Someone?

294
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,640
Hyeon Jae. That guy who was on J2 with you.

295
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,630
Yoo Hyeon Jae.

296
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,880
The password is your birthday.

297
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,120
Oh, when did he?

298
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,830
Then when he said he was working earlier...

299
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,430
Where is Ji Hoon?

300
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,140
What? He left earlier. Did you not see him?

301
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,270
I didn't. Did he leave?

302
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,450
Ah really, where did she go? She said she couldn't even see.

303
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,610
Did you see that accident earlier?

304
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,820
- Ah, that woman really looked like she got hurt.
- Yeah, it was scary. Do you think she's okay?

305
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,960
Yes, what is it?

306
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,700
Where are you?

307
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,780
Where are you?

308
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,830
I'm at home.

309
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,180
Are you waiting for me outside because of the taxi fee?

310
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,160
Are you crazy? Do you think I'm that free?

311
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,980
Then, where are you at this time?

312
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,630
Alright. I'll see you when I'm home.

313
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,480
♫ No, no, no ♫

314

♫ After a long night passes ♫

315
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,890
Gwang Jae.

316
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:09,120
Do you think I can go back to where I was before?

317
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,700
Of course.

318
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,340
♫  Or will I be frozen like my clock? ♫

319
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,400
Gwang Jae.

320
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,050
♫  Or will I be frozen like my clock? ♫

321
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:22,050
Do you think there's anyone that likes me, right now?

322
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,440
Why wouldn't there be? There are definitely people.

323
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,500
If I...

324
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,240
didn't meet Hyeon Jae back then,

325
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,060
what would it have been like?

326
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:41,240
It's all in the past. People have changed and so has the world.

327
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,930
Why is the past important? It's all about the present.

328
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,640
So with that,

329
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,500
when I say the present is important. I'm talking about this moment, right now.

330
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,400
Let's let Hyeon Jae go now.

the emptiness Hyeon Jae left behind.

336
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,310
Oh my, did I drink too much?

337
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,630
That's not it. I can't hold her and use the restroom at the same time.

338
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,370
What should I do?

339
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,590
Ah, over there.

340
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,960
Bo Hee. Bo Hee, wake up. Bo Hee!

341
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,090
You can't get up, right?

342
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,960
Then you should stay here for a bit.

343
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,080
Even if time passes, people like that will always exist. They're so dangerous.

344
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,980
Hey, you. What are you doing here, like this?

345
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,910
Wow. Why did you drink so much?

346
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,290
Ah, what should I do? It's not like I can leave her.

347
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:46,640
Bo Hee? Bo Hee?!

348
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,930
Hey! You jerk!

349
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,090
You better let go of Bo Hee!

I rolled down the stairs because of the storm.

376
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,900
And when he woke up, he said 20 years had passed.

377
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,650
It hurts.

378
